  "text": "So I was talking to the president of one of the clubs I'm in and he literally has three published papers (first author on two), qualified for USAMO, is USACO Platinum, runs a nonprofit, and is basically a genius.\n\nAnd then another girl in his grade broke top 12 for a debate event at NSDA nationals and is the president of four clubs and won this pageant (don't wanna get too specific since it's a regional thing but like she gets to be on national TV)\n\nAnd then one of my classmates is literally the youth poet laureate for my region (with like 3 million people living here) and owns a pretty successful literary magazine\n\nAnd then two of my friends have played at Carnegie Hall -- one is a pianist and she's won a ton of national/international awards and the other is a cellist and she's also won a lot of awards but her orchestra was also on America's Got Talent\n\nAnd the list goes on....and on....and on.....I think I know like 15 people in my grade or in the grade above me (seniors) who do research, own a nonprofit/business, are national award-winning artists, are top 100 in the state/nation for their sport, etc.\n\nAnyways can I just give up I CANNOT COMPETE WITH THESE PEOPLE \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEverybody says A2C is a concentration of all the incredibly smart/talented people but the accomplishments on this sub are starting to feel kinda normal now??? what in the desensitized --\n\nI literally just want to go to Berkeley but I feel so crushed rn\n\nAlso if you think you know me...you probably do -- heyyyyyyyyy this is kinda awkwarddddddd",

Selling a business for 100K isn\u2019t even a huge accomplishment\u2014 still impressive but considering that most transactions/valuations these days are in the millions or billions 100K is chump change.

I'm the only one who took the SAT, and our PSAT average from 10th grade was ~700 I'm pretty sure. Everyone is chill, and a quarter of my class has no intention of ever going to college. The others would be happy at a CSU (which I know are great schools, but I hope you understand what I'm saying here). We have no AP classes, and we're only allowed to take honors classes for credit junior year.\n\nIt's especially ironic considering there's a school like not even half a mile from us that is uber competitive and is similar to how you described. \n\nAND what's most interesting is that we have sister schools that are in the same city but in different locations. From what I've heard (and seen on the official school profile) it's a similar student body to the one I'm in now. It has the same system as well (no APs, honors junior year). Last year, across 300 students (combined from three sister schools), we sent 10 students to Stanford. This happens every year, too, and only for Stanford. Last time we sent a student to Harvard was 7 years ago. It's wack af.",

Literally down the road from my school is a pretty sweaty public high school, and one of the most prestigious prep schools in this country. We only maybe send a kid to an Ivy once a decade and each year there\u2019s usually only one who attends a T50 like Tufts or Northeastern.",

A lot of these kids (including me) don't really have to worry about money or other personal issues because our parents have pretty much made it -- most of my friends' parents are doctors, engineers, architects, lawyers, professors etc.  We basically have a lot of time to pursue our interests and there's a lot of pressure to go to top schools because of the upper class parents thing.\n\nAlso our school was ranked high in the USWNR lol so in a way we're a T500 (there's actually a banner hanging at the front of our school and I tripped on a parking thingie today while looking at it because I thought it was so funny we're ranked on that list)\n\nAlso at this point, if this sounds familiar to you, you DEFINITELY know me/this school...\n\nEdit:  Not Bronx Science either -- anybody who lives in the area can go to my high school, so no admissions/tests to get in.  There are lots of people here who don't take a ton of challenging classes and overload on EC's, it's just that there are also lots of super smart kids at my school",

      "text": "I went to a similarly sweaty school: 3 USACO Golds and a USACO camper, 2 USAMO qualifiers, 3 USABO Semifinalists, 2 USNCO, 20+ others w/ prestigious awards and summer programs), had a way less than perfect GPA, did fuck all for ECs and had to take the SAT three times (dropping on my second attempt by 20 points) to get a competitive score for top schools. The common denominator is that like most other high schools in my area the parents were filthy rich from high-powered white collar jobs and their kids could get whatever they want essentially when it came to academic resources\n\nI got into a T20 and a T5 ECE program w/ Honors ED and EA respectively and have been thriving since. If you're a good applicant you're going to get into a well ranked school, they'll probably go T10 or whatever and good for them but that does not mean you are fucked. Just play your cards right and do your best on apps, see you at whatever T20 you'll get into next year",

      "text": "I am 35, and I just want to tell you - more than half of those people are going to snap, burn out and end up in a fairly mediocre trajectory in life. And I am not saying that a mediocre level of achievement or success if a bad thing. I just want you to get some perspective. \n\nYou are you. And Berkeley may well be interested in your peers, but the assumption that you are lesser based on what *you* see as important is flawed. You are not Berkeley, and your view of their strengths may be a showcase of flaws to them. Yes, objectively achievements matter but every college will tell you they are *not* all that matters and decisions are not based on how long your list is or how publicly lauded.  \n\nIn life, we all watch everyone's trailers and highlight reels. We don't see every scene. Try to see yourself as the unique, eager, motivated and ambitious applicant that you are. Berkeley might see that too, and they might think it's a hell of a lot more important to accept a student that wants them over a student they know have them 15th on their list. \n\nYou matter and your unique application matters and the rest is bullshit.",

You have more value than you can see at the moment. \n\nThe accomplishments of your peers are incredibly impressive and likely to predict future success.  But have you ever seen a promising genius flame out?  It happens. \n\nIn the professional world, a lot of pioneering, cutting edge work is very hard and people at that level are often generous and kind towards those who work alongside them and are happy to collaborate, share knowledge, etc.   They will appreciate what you bring to the table because you\u2019re on the same team with a common goal.  \n\nA strong work ethic and teamwork go a long way in the real world because one genius cannot do it all.  It takes everyone.  \n\nI hope this perspective helps.  I\u2019m sure you are an exceptional student in your own right and are going to do great things.  Best of luck on your journey!",
