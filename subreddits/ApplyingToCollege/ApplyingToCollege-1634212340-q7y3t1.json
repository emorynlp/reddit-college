  "text": "I recently took GRE and now I am starting to apply to different universities. I saw that, in most of them, I have to enter both name and surname, but I don't have a surname, what should I do in this situation. I registered in a few universities, didn't apply yet, cuz I was scared that my application will get rejected, so I thought I should confirm it first, anyone had the same experience before?",

I've seen many people go through the immigration process and the officer just writes down FNU.  So now they're stuck with FNU as part of their name.  Better that you choose your own.",
