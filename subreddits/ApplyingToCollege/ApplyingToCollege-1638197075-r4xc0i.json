  "text": "Hey everyone! I was wondering what a competitive Canadian average looks like for top 20/30 schools in the US. I had a 94.5 in gr 9, 90.2 in gr 10, 95.9 in gr 11and 95.8 for my midterms in gr 12. Also, will a 78% in visual arts in grade 10 impact my chances severely if I'm applying to engineering?",
