  "text": "I have come to the realization that I may have to ED to one school over the one I love more. I'm applying to Wellesley and Smith College. I was planning on doing ED 1 for Wellesley but my sat score is below their 25% percentile range. Also, the ED and RD rates for Wellesley only have a 10% diffeence whereas Smith ED would definitely give me a boost. Should I apply to Wellesley ED as test-optional or apply to Smith ED?",
