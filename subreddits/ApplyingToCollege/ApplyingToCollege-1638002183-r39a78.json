  "title:": "i wish i didn\u2019t live in a rural town and actually had good academic opportunities",
  "text": "i know colleges take into account if a school/town didn\u2019t have much to offer in comparison to more lavish schools and cities, but i still feel insecure about how it looks for me. \ud83e\udd72 i see many students talk about how they got an internship, shadowing, research activities, etc and i wish i had those opportunities because i feel so under-qualified. i live in a rural town which is mostly just a pit stop for people on road trips so there\u2019s practically no academic opportunities here, especially for my preferred area of study. the closest big city is las vegas which is about an 1 1/2 half away, but it still pales in comparison to a lot of other places for tech. either way, my parents think it\u2019s way too far anyway and wouldn\u2019t drive all the way up there for a school thing (i don\u2019t drive atm, getting my license in a couple weeks lol). \n\ni asked my counselor if there was any shadowing or internships *at all* in our area and she said no, which isn\u2019t surprising. my prior high school for three years in the farm area of my town only offered two APs which i took. the rest were honors/dual enrollment which is nice (maybe not for UC oos lol), but i still unprepared and undeserving compared to folks who went to very academically rigorous schools and had a boatload of EC\u2019s to participate in. don\u2019t get me wrong, i have some things that stand out especially for someone in a small town (one national contest winner, a state thing, some leadership positions, and then the \u201cregular\u201d EC\u2019s) but i know there\u2019s some folks out there blessed to have all that and even more. even my prior high school barely had any clubs (the interact club got cancelled bc no kids wanted to do it, along with most other clubs even girls basketball got cancelled). only a few kids in my town are even considering college at all, and practically probably only about 10 at both of the schools in town i\u2019ve attended are aiming for anything outside of the state schools (no shade to the states, got some cool scholarships from two of them atm \ud83d\ude0b) so i feel like when i voice my concerns over the lack of activities here, barely one really cares to think abt making a change. this isn\u2019t my fault or anyone else\u2019s fault for living/being born where we live ofc, but even just for my own academic growth personally disregarding college admissions i would\u2019ve liked to have more enrichment in hs bc i genuinely love gaining knowledge. i guess this is just a rant bc i had no one else to talk to about it lol\n\ntldr i feel saddened bc i lived in a rural town my whole life and feel weaker compared to most other students in big cities applying, especially in this sub",

      "text": "Definitely don't worry too much about this.  They will take into account your geographical area, as you've already noted, and you won't be compared to the kids in the big cities.  The grass is always greener - those big city kids that are shut out of the top 10% of their class because of the abundance of super genius kids (yes, Bay Area) are really envious of your position right now.  Emphasize your connection to your rural roots in your essays - geographic diversity is a real plus.",
