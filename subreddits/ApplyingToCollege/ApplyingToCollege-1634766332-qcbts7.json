  "text": "It's not a thesis, I'm not trying to defend any side here, I'm just genuinely curious about it because I'm considering going test optional for my Northwestern ED and I'm not sure if that's good considering the intl application pool.\n\nEdit: the question actually refers to those who could take the test, because those who couldn't obviously have explanations to write in the COVID section or other parts. Now those who decide to go test optional even with the score in hands can't simply say \"my score is below the expected\", it's better not to say anything.",
