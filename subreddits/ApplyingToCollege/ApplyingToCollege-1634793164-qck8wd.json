      "text": "I think there\u2019s probably an element of survivorship bias in your question. The better question would be \u201c how does the rate of acceptances change with people with a 4.0 compare to 3.9\u201d. I don\u2019t have an interval for that figure, but I reckon. the numbers would be far less dramatic or drastic. One B, or even a few, isn\u2019t going to crush your chances at any school. I\u2019m the same way, a 4.0 UW is extremely impressive and will add to your application, but won\u2019t make it break it, won\u2019t guarantee success or raise it to a significantly higher level.",

              "text": "Not by a meaningful amount. Especially so if your courses were hard. I had two Bs before applying, two more final semester after getting into colleges. Didn\u2019t apply to Stanford but I got into some good schools. I\u2019m not an exception, just the typical student in that regard. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of those kinda comparisons anyway. You\u2019re a unique individual in so many ways, i struggle to see the value in comparing with large groups of people. Averages and percentages themselves aren\u2019t people, and they certainly aren\u2019t you. Do your best in HS and other shit in your life and it\u2019ll work out. Not sure if what I said made sense but it\u2019s late, apologies.",
