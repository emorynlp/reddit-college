  "text": "I can't bear to pay expenses for school, so I really want a full grant in addition to part times to work. I'm an understudy from Bangladesh. I'm a most completed class 11 understudy, I got 800 on math and 760 on English on sat. My normal is 97 in general in addition to the test normal is 94.5. I took 10 APs on 11 grade and got 5 all. I took Ap science, science, physical science B, Cal 2, ap physical science c mechanics, English. I got 36 on the ACT. I depleted my family ledger by testing expenses and wifi. I likewise took other AP in 10 grades, for example, AP cal 1 and statics, got 5 both, however, got 4 on ap English writing and creation and ap English language and organization both. I did a ton of exploration on neighborhood colleges and schools, author clubs, and join rivalries, volunteer long stretches of 500 hours. DO I have t gotten a full grant to any school for a very long time and do I need to concentrate on CS? I can be coding in dialects like simples applications. I began papers and completed them. My AP class normal is 101 and did many courses.\n\nI want any college to accept an offer to give full financial rides for 4 years or not even coming even I get in MIT but no financial aids. I want to get out of Bangladesh.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know much about international students, but it may be a trade off between getting a full scholarship and going to a top school. I think you\u2019d have a better chance of getting full ride at a lower tier school or maybe some public universities (excluding the public ivies). \n\nResearch what schools offer the most aid to international students or what schools have full-ride scholarships for international students. Additionally, the best scholarships usually only go to a couple of students, so apply to plenty of schools and see what your best offer is. \n\nGood luck!",
