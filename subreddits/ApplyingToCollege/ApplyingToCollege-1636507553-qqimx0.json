  "title:": "question about major - was accepted as undeclared even though i selected a major",
  "text": "hey so i\u2019m a senior in hs who is planning on majoring in mechanical engineering. i applied to a few schools and have only heard back from ASU, U of Arizona, and UCF. i got into all three, but both of the Arizona schools displayed my major as \u201cundeclared engineering.\u201d i explicitly made sure to put mechanical engineering on my applications. there was no explanation to why i was placed in undeclared engineering.\n\ni have amazing grades, have taken pretty good classes. i\u2019ve been doing dual enrollment at a local community college all four year of hs, and i\u2019m earning an associates of arts degree this spring. the only problem i could think of is my math classes. i\u2019ve only taken algebra I, geometry, algebra II, and am currently in college algebra. i have gotten straight As in all my years of high school math. i\u2019ve learned trigonometry throughout these classes. the problem is that i have no experience with pre-calc or calculus. \n\nafter all that, i was wondering if my lack of advanced math classes is what caused this to happen to my majors? will i have to worry about this happening with other colleges i\u2019m applying to / have applied to? i have also requested a major change at ASU but have yet to hear back from them. if anyone has any advice, i would greatly appreciate it. :)\n\nEDIT: just wanted to come back to thank everyone for the advice. ASU got back to me and confirmed to switch my major to mechanical engineering. thanks to all for the help",
