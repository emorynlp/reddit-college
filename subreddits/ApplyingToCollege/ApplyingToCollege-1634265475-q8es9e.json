  "text": "after so many sleepless nights spent deciding on what topic would be the best fit for my personal essay, and then spending countless days trying to write, i finally finished my essay. i still wasn\u2019t sure that it was good enough though- i thought it didn\u2019t sound academic enough, or wasn\u2019t ivy league worthy. but my english teacher loved it, even saying that i should minor in creative writing. my essay is me- it has my charisma and flow without the unnecessary features i had always thought were required for a successful essay. ig what i\u2019m trying to say is just be yourself- it will work out in the end!",
