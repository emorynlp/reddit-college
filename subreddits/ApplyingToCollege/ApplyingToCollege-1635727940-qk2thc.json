  "text": "On the Coalition app for UT Austin, we are allowed 2 teachers and one outside recommender. However, on the UT Austin website, it says only 2 recommenders are allowed. I had assigned 3 recommenders (2 teachers, one outside rec), of which one of the teacher recs is likely not as strong as the outside rec - I don't want them to ignore that one in favor of the teacher rec. Should I just remove the teacher rec?",
