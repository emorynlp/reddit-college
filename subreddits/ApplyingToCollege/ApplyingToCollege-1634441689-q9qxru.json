  "text": "Food.\n\nI don't know about you guys, but food is an important part of my life. I'm looking at all these universities I'd love to go to, but then discovering that the nearby towns don't have grocery stores with products from home. \n\nWhere's my milo? My muesli? Heck, I'll take the non-chocolate digestives at this rate. I live next to a food market where the aunties and uncles sell cheap home-cooked meals to the passing students walking to school, and I have no doubt there's no Big Uncle in New England ushering me to get a bigger serving of rice. \n\nDon't mind me, I'm just really sad now.",

This is because of Japanese colonialism and cultural influence. Sometimes the Japanese supermarket is more expensive, so I can just go to a Korean supermarket instead to buy the same thing for a cheaper price. Basic ingredients like soy sauce, mirin, sake, dashi stock, canned sardines, nori, and vegetables like burdock, beansprouts, daikon radish, napa, etc can be found at both. Other times, I can find products like natto, tsukemono, chuka soba, inari, beni shoga, baked wagashi, kirimochi, etc for my family to cook or eat. I honestly prefer Korean supermarkets, because Japanese supermarkets in America are starting to cater to foreigners causing less authentic items to appear while prices are soaring. But at the same time, maybe the Korean supermarkets near me are starting to cater to Japanese consumers. lol",
