  "title:": "How to determine how rural a college is?",
  "text": "Pretty much the titile. I'm looking into schools like Vassar, Amherst, Carleton, Cornell, Bates, Tufts, F&M, Skidmore and while these are smaller, more isolated schools, I find it hard to determine the difference between \"not urban\" and \"extremely extremely rural\" for these colleges. Virtual tours don't really give me the perspective I watch, and I don't think the youtube videos I've been watching have been descriptive as I want either.\n\nI want a small college that has a balance of meaningful interaction with off-campus stuff and being a tight-knit community.(whether thats because of transportation to big cities or if I can regularly go to cities outside campus for other activities, etc etc)",

      "text": "Another way to think about things: what amenities the town has and how much that is centered around the school. That usually tells you if the town is strictly a college town or hamlet or a small city. Let's look at a couple examples.\n\nFirst example, Williamstown, MA. There are a few pubs, some restaurants, some coffee places, and one grocery store in a roughly 2000'x3000' area (excluding campus) -- so not even a square mile. It's nice (love the Purple Pub), but with a population of less than 8,000 people...  Williamstown is definitely a small college town.\n\nSecond example: Northfield, MN. You have some pubs, restaurants, coffee places, yoga studios, come chain hotels and drugstores, and about 4-5 grocery stores in about one square mile (built-up/commercial area, excluding Carleton and St. Olaf campuses). There is transit: three bus routes. It is nice but almost suburban -- not surprising since it's a half-hour away from suburbs of the Twin Cities which has about 3.5 million people -- and itself has a population of just over 20,000 people. Northfield is either a big town, a far suburb/exurb, or a small city.\n\nFinal example: Ithaca, NY. You have pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, yoga studios, chain hotels and drugstores and a home-improvement store, 2 gigantic grocery stores and 7-8 other large grocery stores. in a built-up area maybe 1-2 square miles. There is transit: maybe 12 routes within Ithaca and another 12 that service commuters from nearby towns. With all that and a population of 30,500, Ithaca would be a small city.\n\nBTW, of all the schools you listed... Tufts is definitely not isolated and neither Tufts nor Cornell are small.",

And ty for letting me know about tufts and cornell, looking at their populations I don't think these schools will fit me then (if you have any suggestions for colleges that would be cool; otherwise I have some in mind that I'm going to research).\n\nI don't think I would mind a campus like Carleton College then, as long as the city doesn't blend into the campus / the campus is distinct.",

              "text": "Campus is definitely distinct at Carleton.  It's a short walk to downtown Northfield where there are cafes and shops - definitely college town feel there because of the two schools.  Once you get farther from that part of town it's more suburbia/bigger rural town.  I would guess they have a shuttle bus of some kind to get to Target, grocery stores, etc.    or into Minneapolis.\n\nI have a family member who went to St. Olaf so am pretty familiar with the town - Northfield is really nice IMO.",

      "text": "I visited Bates, Tufts, Skidmore, and Vassar. Like ^^ said. Just figure out how many stores are nearby (I did this by just asking what do students like to do outside of the college, you\u2019ll get a sense of how much there is actually offered). \nBates-it\u2019s Maine so yes it is pretty rural, there\u2019s a town though. However, Portland is an hour away which is a super nice city.\nVassar-not that rural since it\u2019s not super upstate in NY and there\u2019s a town. Stuff to do isn\u2019t that faraway either. Not a huge fan of the town though\nTufts-definitely not rural at all. This is a suburban town like 20 min away from Boston and the school is not small.\nSkidmore-there is a lot to do here I was pleasantly surprised. The town is Uber rich so there are soo many restaurants on Main Street. A lot of retired folk so there are horse racing tracks. Definitely more of a suburban area.",

          "text": "thanks, will def make sure I ask more questions about off-campus life in my next virtual visits/meetings. Can you specifiy more about you not liking the town Vassar is based in?\n\nAnd yea looking at Tufts and Cornell student populations, I'll probably take them off my list since it doesn't seem to be a good match for me. Not sure what to add instead though but I'll probably look at colleges that have been suggested to me before here.\n\nOtherwise, I'm going to look into Skidmore, Vassar (probably amherst and carleton) more - I hope Vassar isn't super super rural and more like an in-between ish but I'll keep researching the school and I'll try to get a virtual session with another student to see how it is. tysm for this comment, provides a lot of detail for me",

      "text": "Amherst College is a 1 minute walk to Amherst MA and right next to UMAss Amherst. Northhampton is a short drive away. You will have plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, boba shops etc. nearby, with plenty of shopping (mall, whole foods etc.). While quaint, it isn't quite Boston or New York. For that you need to take a 1-2 hour bus ride. Definitely rural, but has a very strong suburban flavor. Plenty of things to do, but you can't do everything a big city will provide.\n\nCornell is in Ithaca, a small city. Quaint yet larger than Amherst MA. However, Ithaca is quite isolated and going to a large population center is quite a hassle.\n\nVassar is more similar to Amherst, without the 24,000 UMass students nearby. Remember entertainment generally correlates with population size. Poughkeepsie is nice but small. Closest to campus is CIA and West Point, but they're still quite a drive away. You can get to New York by bus.\n\nSchools that are similar to this would Wesleyan, Wellesley, Swarthmore.\n\nThe benefit of the three schools above is that they offer a balance between nature and urban entertainment. More nature, less entertainment. However, none of them are anything close to rural.\n\nTufts is interesting since it is in Medford, right next to Boston. So definitely not rural. Access to Boston is much easier but a lot of students spend most of their time in and around campus during the weekdays and the city on the weekend. Less nature, and the campus is definitely more urban.\n\nFor me rural schools are places like Williams, Middlebury and Bowdoin. Very small towns nearby and not close to any major population centers or other schools.",
