  "text": "When I show my parents' bank balance, does it have to show all the money they can provide me for all four years? For example if my parents have $20,000 in their bank, can I say that they can provide $10,000 a year (as they earn more money along the way) or do I have to divide that money into 4 and say they can provide $5,000 per year? \n\nP.S my parents' income isn't much and the bank statement would be of a fixed deposit.\n\nSomeone please help!!",
