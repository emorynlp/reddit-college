  "text": "trying to decide if i should shoot for a 35. i\u2019m at a 34 right now and i think a 35 is attainable but i\u2019m not sure if colleges would view it any different. my uw gpa is not quite shaping out to where i wanted it to be (3.8 ish) but it\u2019s not horrible, just not doing me any favors at very selective schools and i was thinking a 35 might give me an additional edge but i\u2019m now wondering if it\u2019s kinda useless. any thoughts?",

      "text": "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t take it again. 34-36 is pretty much the same. I think the ACT is just to prove you\u2019d be academically capable enough to succeed at that college, and a 34 more than proves that. If you want to do it, go for it, but your time might be better spent on writing an amazing essay or something similar to that\n\nEdit: I guess it also depends on where you\u2019re applying. I think MIT\u2019s average is a 35 so if you\u2019re applying there you might want to give it another try",
