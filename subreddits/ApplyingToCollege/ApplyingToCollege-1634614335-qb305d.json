  "text": "So I have been out of school for about a year now helping with family but that\u2019s not important. I\u2019ve moved to a new state and am ready to start college now. I\u2019m a first generation student so all of this is new to me. I applied to the college William Paterson University but during the application it did not ask for my transcripts it just asked for permission to access my files via the school I attended for my transcripts and my ACT scores. So should I be good or should I submit another application entirely and find a way to include my transcripts or just email my transcripts separately to the admissions office?",

              "text": "yes\n\nThere are multiple parts in the application process and it is never possible for all of them to be sent at the same instant. Some may arrive before the app, some after, it does not matter.\n\nYou should be receiving an admission portal login from the college soon. The portal will indicate what documents you are missing. It may also be where you receive your decision.",
