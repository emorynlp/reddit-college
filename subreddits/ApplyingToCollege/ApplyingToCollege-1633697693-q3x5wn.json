This is outside of your control.  \n\nWhat you should care about is what you got out of your experiences, whatever they are--not how they look on paper.  What did he get out of these experiences?  Not much.  They'll only help him so far.  Maybe they'll help him get into his desired college--but he still will have less going for him in terms of personal developmental and preparation than a peer who actually *did* the activities he is listing.\n\nImagine him sweating before an interview wondering if he'll be asked about those things and knowing he'll have to be vague or lie.\n\nFWIW, Not all internships are high-quality experiences--whether a connected parent arranges them or not.",
