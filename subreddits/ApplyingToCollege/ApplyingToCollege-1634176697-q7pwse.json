      "text": "It's self selection\n\nThe people who care enough to go and post on places like this subreddit or College Confidential care _a lot_ about getting into college. *A LOT*\n\nI'm talking \"I ran a red light on my way to school since I got rejected from my Top 20 school ED\" or \"should I retake a 1530 SAT\" or \"Should I take another AP on top of my 5 or 6 existing ones\" or \"What extracurriculars should I do to get into a top school\" level of care\n\nUsually it's the AP kids who were at the top of their class and were already micro-optimizing their high school career to try and get into Stanford or MIT or Harvard so they frequent subreddits like this as an extension of their efforts. Other times it's kids who stumble on this subreddit with lofty expectations and upon scrolling through some posts come to the conclusion that they're woefully inadequate for the schools they dream about and start hardcore gunning\n\nPeople who aren't so ridiculously boosted see this subreddit and become demoralized as fuck so they don't bother posting. This means the only activity you see originates from the T20 gunners\n\nBut also worth noting a lot of people on this subreddit are similar to you w/o such lofty expectations and joined this subreddit just to try and get college app info b/c their schools didn't have many resources pointing students in the right direction. They usually just lurk and maybe you see a couple of them comment on major drama posts blasting the super determined kids for \"caring too much about college\" w/ hundreds of upvotes",

When in reality college rankings are not accurate and also don\u2019t represent individual majors/programs, only prestige. \n\nAs a psychology major looking into going to grad school for social work, I used to want to go to a UC for honestly prestige, but learned that the CSU\u2019s have more opportunities for \u201chands on\u201d learning and social work internships, as UC\u2019s are more research based. And as I did my research I learned that most of the CSU\u2019s have strong psychology programs especially for the type of work I want to do, so ig just noting that prestige only means so much.",

              "text": "I agree that looking at major / specific program rankings is more important than overall college ranking. If I were an engineering major I'd definitely go to UCLA, UCSD or UC Berkeley over Harvard unless I got financial aid and were BioE where the program rankings are comparable\n\nOr for bigger contrast, UIUC vs Yale. UIUC has a CalTech-tier ECE program and a huge department, Yale's program is barely on the board. Yet UIUC has an overall ranking of T60 and Yale is a top Ivy.\n\nOr UCSB over Brown for Physics since UCSB has a T10 physics program w/ much higher impact research going on\n\nAnd this calculus would change depending on what I wanted to do obviously. It's all down to specifics",
