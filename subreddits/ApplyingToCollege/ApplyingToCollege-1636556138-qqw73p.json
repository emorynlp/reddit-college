I though only  transcripts from 9th to 12th grade in English were necessary but I read that maybe some colleges want it too? I'm so confused because in my country, the only transcripts that are issued are from 11th to 12th Grade (as the prior grades are not important). \n\nIs sending the normal transcripts enough?",
