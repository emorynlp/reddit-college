  "text": "Tomorrow will be my first interview with a MIT alumnus, and I plan to ask for feedback at the end of the interview. Mostly because I have three interview scheduled so far and want to improve. I wonder if it sounds offensive to ask how I perform. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: So the conclusion is not okay.",
