  "text": "Hey!\n\nI was recently named my school's \"DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) Good Citizen,\" and if I want to qualify for the scholarship, I am required to sit for a timed essay. \n\nIs anyone familiar with this scholarship or even sit for this essay too? If yes, what was the essay like?\n\nThanks!",
