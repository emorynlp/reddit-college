  "text": "I'm not sure if it's just an international student thing but I'm an international who needs aid and I've worked quite hard for Harvard and it's been my dream forever (I know it's a clich\u00e9. So initially, I was pretty convinced about Harvard REA and I'd been working on my supplemental for over a month. Then, around the 28th of October, I started talking to people - former AOs on reddit, as well as some other people who have experience in the field of counselling, etc.\n\nI was told that I'd be wasting my early chip with Harvard because it's quite unpredictable and even though I have some good achievements, I'll need to prove that I'm overwhelmingly the smartest kid in my school, and despite being first in my class for year 11, I was told that Harvard wouldn't touch a local curriculum school kid unless it was really smth crazy. I was told to apply to less selective schools and ED to a less selective school, unless I wanted to stay in my country. \n\nWith a heavy heart, I scrapped my Harvard supps and decided to ED elsewhere. I thought I had a good profile but I struggled with the line between self confidence and unrealistic optimism. Idk if I'll regret this ever but I wanted to know if there's others who are in my shoes. \nHighlights of my profile (I think) - national debater, 150 member nonprofit with 4000+ kid impact, MUN awards, research paper, Econ fellowship winner, intern at NY company, etc. SAT - 1540, All As and A*s so far (1st in my class since 6th grade)",
