  "title:": "had my first ever college interview today :DD",
  "text": "I think it went super well!! I wasn't too nervous because I'm a people person/extrovert and I like having conversations with people. It was super casual, but I got really excited when he asked about some of my experiences and hobbies that I kind of rambled. I still hope I charmed my interviewer's pants off LOL It's for my dream school too but overall, I think it was pretty positive!! He was smiling and reactive to my responses so I take it as a good sign. I'M JUST REALLY HIGH IDK IT WAS KIND OF FUN AND EXHILARATING",

Also think of a few things you want to emphasize that might not be highlighted as much as you'd want it to in your app itself. You'll end up getting excited and go down a rabbit hole (I did with the different instruments I play and the differences in the mouthpieces LOL) so to reel yourself back in, just have that sticky note with the list. Good luck!! You'll do great!!",
