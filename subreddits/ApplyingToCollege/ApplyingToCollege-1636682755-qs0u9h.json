  "text": "I just out of my EA Stanford interview, and I was literally at the verge of tears the whole time. For some reason, I was so emotional and everytime he complimented me I felt like bursting out in tears. There were also awkward silent moments because I was trying to prevent myself from crying, and it was mostly him directing the conversation. WTF should I do? Do you think I will be put as mediocre? I also regret some things I've said. At least he kinda sympathized with me near the end about some of our experiences. His voice started to crack, and he started turning red, so I might've mad him cry....is this gonna ruin my chance at Stanford?",
