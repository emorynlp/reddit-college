And I put a message on the reddit asking if anyone had a similar issue or if I should contact Admissions....\nWell, some asshole moderator(Sn: Mumbleton) who is an alumni, supposedly, of Duke deleted my post. But not before being condescending and saying \"This isn't technical support. Contact Admissions.\" Then me asking him who hurt him and if he needs a hug... and well we got into it a bit. And because of that I went and sent them an email that day! \nGuess what happened when they responded?! \nThey said.... They are very busy, and to please calm down and not bother them during their busiest time. The processing time is normal and every students application goes through it....\n\nNow they think I'm an annoying pest because some douche-bag Duke alumni(Sn: Mumbleton) doesn't like \"freshman questions \" on, apparently, \"his\" reddit..... \ud83d\ude11",
