Two big ones are deferment of applicants till a later semester and  wait listing, which are sorta the same thing, but different.  Deferred students are accepted but for a later date. While wait listed students are put on a maybe list(ill be it, a high probability list). \nThats how they get such a huge student body and make tremendous amounts of bank off tuition, but also get super exclusive and prestigious looking statistics. Truly  exclusive schools make a large portion of their money from research grants and different work contracts. Because they truly don't make enough to survive on student tuition alone.",

I'm not really familiar with Indian educational system but they're always trying to appear as the only ones who have a hard time or something (look at the comments on almost every YouTube video about the SAT)... And it gets annoying at some point.",

I study at an international school in India so life\u2019s like a piece of cake for me, but had it been the typical CBSE school I would\u2019ve been rubbing my ass off reading and rote learning the textbooks 24/7 \nPlus, the competition around every Indian student is mad crazy so the bar set for everyone is pretty high. Almost every other kid in India prepares for the IIT which promotes a really unhealthy competition unlike the US system",

You have physics chemistry and math. That is actually insane. Its like AP exams on crack and the time limit is insane. \n\nMy final verdict: Both the SAT and JEE are hard and there is no point in comparing. We are all in the same boat and need to bring each other up and support the family in r/a2c",
