  "title:": "Applying to Ohio State University after Graduating with CCP",
  "text": "So, I am in my junior year of High School and my freshman year of Community College. I would love to go to Ohio State University because they have a good credit transfer program with my community college. My HS councilor says I have a GPA of 3.95 and on ACT practice tests I consistently score between a 27 and 29 (I am taking it in December, and my dream goal is a 30 or above once I graduate and take it a few more times). Do you guys think that I would be accepted?",
