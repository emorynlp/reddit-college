  "title:": "I have a scholarship interview coming up next Friday and I'm pretty scared",
  "text": "The interviewer is a sophomore at the school. There are pre-interview questions about my favourite extracurricular activity and a fun fact about me. I know that interviews are supposed to be like a conversation, and a way to gauge interest, but I'm still terrified. I have what I'd consider pretty poor extracurriculars and basically none related to my intended major (math), so I really don't know what to say or how to convince the interviewer I'm a passionate, well-rounded person while answering the questions or during the interview. I'm also pretty nervous about my conversational skills and whether I'll be able to keep the interviewer interested, since I sometimes sound mechanical when I'm not speaking extempore. Any tips for how to avoid the awkward questions and keep him engaged? I have exams coming up in early December too so I'm even more stressed urrggghhhh",

      "text": "\u201cWell-rounded\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean loads of ECs. It can mean open-minded, worldly, logical, experienced or inexperienced but tried\u2026 It\u2019s also something that is subjective. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about how you come across. Instead, flip your thinking: make sure the interviewer knows the real you. Don\u2019t change who you are for the interview or the school. You\u2019ll end up on a slippery slope of creating a persona you can\u2019t fulfill. \n\nWhy did you decide to go into math? Just say it. Don\u2019t worry about convincing, just say it. You being convinced is enough \u2014 it\u2019s *your* life, right? Because think about it: are you going to change your pathway because the interviewer knows you better? Remember, he/she doesn\u2019t know you at all. You\u2019re in control of the narrative in the interview. \n\nFinally, be happy you\u2019ve got a student interviewing you! **You now have a direct source of inside info**. Think of all the questions you can ask! \n\nTip: before answering any questions, take a deep breath and repeat the question in your head. If the question doesn\u2019t make sense, ask the person to clarify. If it does, take your time in answering (listen to your pace). You\u2019ll stay more steady. \n\nFinally, on a piece of paper in front of you write, \u201cThey\u2019d be lucky to have me.\u201d",

Worrying abt it and trying to convince the interviewer you're someone you're not will only throw you off and make you seem superficial, don't overthink it. Good luck, wishing you all the best! :D",
