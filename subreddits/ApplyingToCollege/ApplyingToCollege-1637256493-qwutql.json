  "text": "This is kind of inspired by that marriage post but genuine question. My parents are making x amount of money which isn't enough for college but is too much for aid. My grandad gets 10k a year from a pension. Could my parents \"give me up\" and I become my grandad's dependent so I qualify for aid? I feel like this is a better plan than getting married to someone lol",

      "text": "The getting married poster's plan was straight up fraud. You can google articles on parents relinquishing rights - apparently people do this. Whether you can get away with it or not, it's still fraud. (If you aren't aware, that means it's not only unethical, but could open you up to both civil and criminal liability and potential loss of degree.) Just, no.\n\nYou are not alone in the proverbial donut hole. A copy and paste:\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",

This would likely be required to be adopted by someone else, and it\u2019s better to have no other source of funds than to have one.\n\nNeither is an idea that is likely to turn out well.",

      "text": "You\u2019re not the first one who has thought of this, but colleges are cracking down. You may not get caught, but is it worth it? Looking at schools with in-state tuition or a school that might offer nice merit aid seems like a much wiser approach to the financial squeeze for middle class families.\n\nProPublica did a piece on this a couple of years ago, so it\u2019s on the radar now of financial aid admin. \n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/college-student-financial-aid-guardianship-loophole-us-department-of-education\n\nHere\u2019s a clip from a 2nd article from the Nov 4 WSJ (since it\u2019s behind a paywall I copied the relevant part):\n\nSocial-media chatter has increased the awareness of potential maneuvers like marrying to get more need-based aid, or transferring legal guardianship of a college-bound child to relatives or friends who are less well off so the teen can seek more financial aid, according to Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors Network Inc., a provider of financial-aid information and advice. \n\nMarried students can qualify for more financial aid, Ms. Rubin says, because their parents\u2019 income isn\u2019t considered in the calculation.\n\nBut she advises students and their families against either marrying or transferring guardianship solely to qualify for additional aid, pointing out that both tactics have at least one big problem: They\u2019re financial fraud. \n\nAnd the penalties for getting caught can go way beyond missing out on financial aid. Aid officers who suspect fraud must report their suspicions to the Office of Inspector General at the Education Department, which can pursue criminal charges.\n\n\u201cStealing student aid is a crime\u2014be it through identity theft, or applying for student aid without any intention of attending classes, or providing false information on a Fafsa to get more aid than you are entitled to receive,\u201d says Aaron Jordan, assistant inspector general for investigation services at the Education Department. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime with real repercussions, like prison and financial penalties.\u201d\n\nDepending on the amount of aid fraudulently received, a person could be sentenced to up to five years in jail, fined up to $20,000 or both.",
