  "title:": "Could this be interpreted as a red flag in my application? EC Activities List Question",
  "text": "I put on my activity list that I helped expand one of my school clubs from 40 to 150 members over the 3 years I've been on board. I wasn't paying attention when I wrote it and just went by mailing list/Slack membership, so the information is 100% true in that regard. The club used to be tiny and now it's one of the biggest at my school.\n\nBut truly active member-wise, it's more like expanded from 20 to 60ish. I didn't realize this could be a red flag in my applications until today and I've applied to early schools. Should I email my AO or am I freaking out over nothing?\n\nThanks in advance!",
