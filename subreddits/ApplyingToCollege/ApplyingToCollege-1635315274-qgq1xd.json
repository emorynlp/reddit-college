      "text": "MUN usually takes me 3 hours a week. HS + MS training, as well as leadership meetings. The number of hours goes up to 4 or 5 when I'm part of a secretariat as well.\n\nI would note that this only applies to me though. The number of hours it'll take you really depend on what your MUN program is like, and how committed you are to pushing things through.\n\nIn past years I've had MUN presidents who devote 1-2 hours every week. Depends on the year and how much work you have.",
