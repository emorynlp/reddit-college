What startled me the most was Hopkins going from 28% to 19%. One of the main advantages of applying ED is the increased acceptance rate, but even that seems to be slowly going away \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Remember, last year was test optional almost everywhere due to COVID test date cancelations. There is no question that is the reason for the increase in app numbers and corresponding decrease in acceptance rates at highly selective schools.\n\nI would expect similar this year, simply because most schools are still test optional.\n\nOn the bright side, it seems likely there will be fewer deferred acceptances for schools to account for in their enrollment numbers, a little more room in the class than last year's seniors were given.",
