  "text": "so I just found out that I was a Coca-Cola semifinialist (yayy) and I wanted to let the colleges I applied early to know of this. Do I shoot them an email? Or for one of my colleges (upenn) it allows you to upload additional materials but it's a file upload? Should I use that and what document would I upload? Or maybe I shouldn't inform my school's at all if it's not important/ they don't look at it?",
