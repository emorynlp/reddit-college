  "title:": "How do I deal with jealousy?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m currently a junior at a somewhat competitive school so I\u2019m not exactly not used to feeling inferior, but there\u2019s this girl in one of my classes who\u2019s just really good at everything she does- and it\u2019s 100% because she puts so much effort in everything (yet somehow makes everything seem effortless). She studies a lot and basically gets all As in almost everything, AND she\u2019s a student athlete and looking to be recruited (idk how recruiting works tho but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s pretty good)\n\n\nShe\u2019s obviously super disciplined, and she\u2019s said things that basically implies that her mom is really strict and a tiger parent. All of the teachers also really like her, probably because shes really social and always talks to them- she does kind of suck up to them, but tbh as bad as it sounds, that\u2019s just another thing about her that I\u2019m jealous of \n\n\nEspecially in terms of colleges, I know that she\u2019s probably going to get into an amazing school, and I\u2019m just so unreasonably jealous of that even tho I know that she\u2019d deserve it\n\n\nI know that she gets a lot of pressure from her mom, especially about colleges and everything, but I can\u2019t help but feel so jealous about how disciplined she is and about her work ethic and about how good she is at everything. I know that it\u2019s not because she was born talented and that it\u2019s because she actually puts in the work\u2014 that just makes me feel worse though, because I feel so lazy compared to her\u2014 like the only reason Im not as good as her is because I don\u2019t have the work ethic\n\n\nAnyway I\u2019ve been hitting a slump where i feel like I\u2019m just not good enough and this constant jealousy isn\u2019t helping- any advice?",

      "text": "If her success is due to effort, then she may not actually be more gifted in those areas where she's enjoying success.  She's just working harder.  Trading time for achievement.\n\nGiven how you've described her mother, it's quite possible this person is stressed all the time, not sleeping, miserable, etc., and just hides it very well.  Consider the multitude of posts that show up on A2C from high-stats Asian kids with tiger parents who are miserable, not sleeping, and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  As someone observing her from the outside you just don't know what's going on in her head.\n\nYou feel like you're being \"lazy\" because there are things you believe you \"should\" be doing that you're not doing.  Presumably because there are other things you'd *rather* be doing.  What if there were no \"should\"?  I'm not kidding.  You're very close to being an adult, at which point you can do (or not do) whatever the hell you want.  Want to go to T20?  Then do what it takes to get into T20.  If you end up *not* doing those things, then, given the \"cost\" in terms of time and effort, maybe you don't *really* want to go to a T20?  That's fine.  There is no \"should\"!\n\nWe must all decide how to spend our time.  I might like to run a sub-3 hour marathon.  If I started training and dieting today and I were super-diligent about it for the next couple of years, I might be able to accomplish that goal.  But I'm not going to do that, because I'm not willing to spend the time and effort (and pain) it would require.  Now, I could beat myself up about being \"lazy\", or I could realize that running a sub-3h marathon is just not something I care to do given what it \"costs\".\n\nMaybe T-whatever is your version of the marathon.",

Ignore the people who make self help youtube videos, your friends who sleep negative hours a day, etc. Second, make small changes at a time. If you make too many drastic changes you'll like burn out and just not do it at all. For example, this could be doing your homework when you come home. Even if you fuck around the rest of the day, then at least you did one thing. Then after a while of that, do something else. Set some goals like \"I will work on my passion project today for 30 minutes\"",

I believe the reason is that people tend to downplay their own achievements and always look at what we don\u2019t have, rather than what we do.\n\nThe solution is to create your own \u201cgame\u201d where you are one of the only players, the reason being that it is niche enough where you are one of the firsts. If you play your game to its absolute best, then logically, no one will ever be able to \u201cbeat\u201d you at it (as long as you don\u2019t get too sloppy) because you\u2019re the one who started it.\n\nOnce you do this, you stop caring about what other people are doing because competition vanishes and you see cool things and go \u201coh! That\u2019s cool! I hope they succeed at what they\u2019re doing,\u201d and then get back on your grind.\n\nCompetition is unhealthy because it blinds you from the bigger picture. Focus on creating a niche where you\u2019re only competing against yourself, because then you will push yourself to your absolute potential, rather than trying to beat someone else\u2019s.",

But rn I'm at JHU which is super competitive and It's the first time I've been around people who are all super talented and smart, besides a few in high school. But instead of just saying \"oh I tried really hard and I didn't get #1 for my exams, so I'm just gonna be jealous of those people\" I just see everyone I meet as a way to learn something - their work ethic or whatever. Instead of being jealous, you can see others hard work as a way to push yourself and be the best you can be because at the end of the day how much you push yourself is all that matters",
