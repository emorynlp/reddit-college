  "text": "So i built a website for my dad's business and published it. I currently have 2 ECs this can go under.\n\n1. Web development. Here I just talk about how I learned html, css, js from scratch via tutorials and classes. I also talk about a website I built for my school (ik 1 website isnt that impressive, but im really proud of it lmao)\n2. My paid job there. I just talk about working as a cashier and stocker. Its pretty boring ngl, but I spent a chunk of my summers working there.\n\nWhere does this ec go? im actually so confused lol",
