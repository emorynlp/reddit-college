  "text": "I\u2019ve heard from UD, IU, & Clark (accepted at all so far, waiting on 6) Clark requires an admissions decision by November 30. Umass Amherst for example releases decisions \u201cby mid-December\u201d. There\u2019s no real timeline for spring decision release dates either.",

      "text": "I would suggest following up with the remaining schools and maybe even telling them that you need to get back to another school by the 30th - request them to see if they can render a decision earlier than that... If they don't, you can request Clark to grant you an extension, if it's your best option to now... If that doesn't work, your best bet would be to deposit the amount to secure the seat there while you wait for the other decisions.",

A November decision date sounds very odd.",
