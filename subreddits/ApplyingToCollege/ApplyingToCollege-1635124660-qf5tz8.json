This is due to classes being extremely hard (lots of work, maybe busy work, idk), a culture that emphasizes academic success over having a personal balance which leads to those struggling academically to put themselves under even more pressure, and a funky male to female ratio prolly messing up the psyches of the guys even moreso than being engineering students does. Also the fact that almost everyone is studying engineering which is known to be hard on the conscience regardless of your school.\n\nI\u2019m also told there\u2019s not many mental health resources, although the school insists that will no longer be true in the near future. \n\nAlso apparently altitude is correlated with how suicidal you are, and the school is at 6,000 feet (which isn\u2019t extremely high, but most people live near sea level so it can be a bit of a difference)",

From what I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m sure the school is more intense than mine, but intense is the environment I thrive in, and time management + prioritization + efficient Studying all all skills I\u2019m pretty decent at, so by my judgement I\u2019d do better at a school like mines where you don\u2019t have to be perfect to get in but have to suffer to get out than a school like Harvard where you have to suffer to get in but can relax through.\n\nRegular intensity courses/schools seem good for me on the surface cuz school-life balance and whatnot, but ime being given any significant leeway leads me into the procrastination loop. \n\nAll this to say, you\u2019re not wrong but I\u2019ve done my research.",
