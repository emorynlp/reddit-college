  "title:": "Stanford REA makes Northeastern EA incompatible. True?",
  "text": "Even though Northeastern has a non-binding EA, if one chooses to apply REA to Stanford, then according to their REA policy, applying to any private early action (even though it\u2019s non-binding) isn\u2019t allowed. \n\u201cIt is Stanford policy that, if you apply to Stanford with a decision plan of Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private college/university under their Early Action, Restrictive Early Action, Early Decision, or Early Notification plan.\u201d\n\nI do understand the rationale of not allowing  applying to ED elsewhere, but saying you can\u2019t apply to a non-binding EA program for a private university seems odd. But maybe it isn\u2019t. After all that\u2019s their definition of \u201crestrictive\u201d. \n\nI want to make sure I\u2019m not misinterpreting this.",

You can't apply EA to privates *and* they clearly state that it doesn't give any boost... And still thousands do REA every year... I guess they just try to make sure that only extremely qualified and confident applicants apply in REA...",
