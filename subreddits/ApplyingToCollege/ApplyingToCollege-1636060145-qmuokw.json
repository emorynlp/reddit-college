  "title:": "Pennstate self-reported academic record unable to put courses 9th and 10th grade",
  "text": "So I attend a senior high school that only has 11th and 12th grade so I'm guessing that it's interfering with my SRAR. Basically, it's only giving me sections for middle school high school courses, 11th grade courses, and 12th grade courses. It's not giving me anything for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 so I put that in the middle school section.\n\nDumbest thing about it? I'm trying to submit it and it's telling me that I only have 3 years of high school reported even though I can't find a way to add two more years for 9th and 10th grade. It's stupid and frustrating and I'm awaiting a response from the counselor but I'm crunched for time and I want to know if anyone here is having the same problem.",
