  "text": "I will integrate to school in 2 days (I wasn't enrolled cuz I was out of the country waiting for my Visa), and I have weeks struggling with this on my mind, I just have a lot of things to do. I have to prepare the whole application from scratch.\n\n- Fill the FAFSA, CSS profile, universities Financial Aid, look for scholarships \n- Write my essays as well as the supplementals (I'm applying to 8 colleges)\n- Make 12 pieces for my art portfolio + the Parsons challenge)\n- Catch up with my school classes and AP classes\n- Prepare my extracurriculars\n- Take the TOEFL\n- Get my teacher's and counselor recommendations (so I need to build a good relationship with my teachers and counselor)\n\nI have the time to do all of the above, and I can sacrifice some sleep hours in order to study for the SAT, but I want to know if it's really worthy.\n\nTests are optional in all my selected universities, and they say they are not going to take in count the SAT as much as they did it before, so I wanted to know if the SAT is just going to add a bit to my college application or if it's really going to help me to get accepted\n\nThese are my selected colleges (in preference order) if it's relevant.\n\nCornell University\nLehigh University \nNortheastern University \nSchool of Art Institute of Chicago\nUniversity of Michigan Ann Arbor\nSyracuse University \nParsons School of Design\nSUNY University at Buffalo\n\nI also have a 3.95 GPA or of 9.4 in 10 scale",
