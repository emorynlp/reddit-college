But, can't think of a reason the college should agree to delete the old app; presumably they would want both old and new apps available for their review.

And based on an earlier thread, you stated you lied on your application and faked your counselor rec, you will not be accepted to any school you applied to last year.\n\nYour best bet is to apply to colleges you never applied to before.",
