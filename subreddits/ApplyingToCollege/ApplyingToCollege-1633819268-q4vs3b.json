  "text": "Like do jobs pretty much only care where you went to grad school? And if so then why do people freak out so much about what college they go to out of high school? Should I just go to whichever college seems the most fun for my undergrad and then go to the best academic college for grad school?",

      "text": "If you go to grad school, the grad school matters more than your undergrad. But many people don\u2019t plan on going to grad school at all, and some people just care about prestige regardless of practicality. And the opportunities provided at your undergrad college (internships, research, advising, etc) could make a difference for what grad school you get into later, which would still make your undergrad important in that sense.",

Don\u2019t go to PartyStateSchool and get a 2.5, because it doesn\u2019t matter, and expect to get into a top Grad school.\n\nSimilarly, no one will care where you went to grad school after 3-4 years of working. Each step matters to the next step.",
