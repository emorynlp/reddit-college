  "text": "Sorry if this isn\u2019t allowed but I\u2019m really curious about the application process as an American as someone who is in grade 12 and applying in Ontario \n\n1. Do you have to pay for each application? \n2. Do you apply to specific schools or just in general and schools can pick up they want you?\n3. Do you have to do an interview at every single school or is it just harder schools to get in?\n4. Do you have to pick a major in first year? What if there\u2019s way too many people in one major, do they cut people?\n5. When do you find out if you got in? Do all the results get released on a specific day or does it vary school by school? Does the school send all the results out the same day if so? Or do they randomly send an application out once in a while?\n6. How does early acceptance work? If you get accepted early at school, do you have to go there?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions for the application process as a Canadian!!",

      "text": "1. Yes. Unless you are granted a fee waiver.\n\n2. You apply to a group of colleges of your choosing, with advice from parents, counsellors, etc.\n\n3. Varies by university.\n\n4. Varies by university. For **most** universities, you are accepted to the college within the university, and you declare your major in the 1st or 2nd year. For a very small number of universities, you are accepted into a major and/or your ability to declare a popular major is based on your academic performance at the university.\n\n5. Varies by university\n\n6. If applying early decision, you are agreeing to enroll if accepted with the possibility of decking the offer If the financial aid differs dramatically from the aid calculated by the Net Price Calculator.\n\nEarly Action does not require you to enroll if accepted.\n\nBut not all universities offer an early option.",

          "text": "We technically don\u2019t have Ivy League schools here. There are some schools that are for sure a lot harder to get into and are a lot more academically challenging but how it works here is that each school is known for a couple specific programs because we apply straight out of high school for a specific program. For example, I applied to The University of Guelph for their agriculture business program. McMaster is super famous for their health science program or queens is super famous for their business program. Those programs are really hard to get into but there\u2019s no specific school that\u2019s considered an Ivy League. Like the University of Toronto or McGill are definitely more challenging and harder to get into. I am also not super knowledgable about any programs outside of Ontario because majority of people stay within their province when going to university. I hope that makes sense!",

I\u2019m not 100% sure though. But I feel like as long as you\u2019re ECs are good and you have good enough marks, you\u2019ll have a good shot",
