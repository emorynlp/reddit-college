Not really writing them as much as gaging whether they\u2019re on par with my common app essay (especially the dear roommate one) or not. That being said they\u2019re mostly written, I just need like my English teacher or someone to review them, and I have one SAQ left. So altogether, I would say it\u2019s going decently, could definitely be worse lol.",
