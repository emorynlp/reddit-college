  "text": "International applicant here and I decided to apply to my top choice REA.  Currently my stats are that I\u2019m seeking aid and my \nSAT is in the 25th percentile.\n\nMy ECs were good, a lot of leadership in different areas as well as winning a district level physics Olympiad. However I unfortunately do not have anything unique or very impressive like research or karate.\n My grades were generally good except for one subject that showed a great upward trend and was addressed in my essays.\nThis  is my second time applying as I didn\u2019t get in anywhere last year. It is also my last before I decide to go to a local university.\n\nI applied ED because I wanted to give it my all and I\u2019m certain that\u2019s where I want to be. However, the more I think about it, maybe it was reckless and being way too wishful. However, I was told luck is also a possibility but I keep myself both pessimistic and optimistic.\n\nMy ED school is a t5 by the way.\n\nWhat advice or insight could y\u2019all share?",

      "text": "Lmao I\u2019m kinda in the same boat here. Applied REA Stanford with roughly 25th-percentile scores as an international seeking (a lot of) aid, ECs were decent but no international awards or Olympics medal or anything in that league. This is also my second time applying (the previous time wasn\u2019t to Stanford, but to other colleges, and it was in my senior year) after taking a gap year. This whole decision to apply to Stanford has been largely wishful thinking, but just like you, I know this is where I want to be and so I want to give it my all. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m hopeful and scared and optimistic and pessimistic every damn minute too, but I know I\u2019ll rather die knowing I made my shot than wonder what could have happened hadn\u2019t I tried at all. \nAt this point there\u2019s not much we can do except for hoping for the best and continue living life as our best selves. Our legacy doesn\u2019t stop at where we end up for college :) I applied to Stanford because I thought I\u2019d fit in with a community of bright, motivated and ethics-driven individuals who have big plans for the world, and even if I don\u2019t get in, I\u2019ll continue to be that person! You are already incredible being so dedicated and daring to apply a second time, OP, so no matter where you end up, I hope you\u2019ll continue be the admirable person you already are :) \n\nThough, best of lucks with your REA! I\u2019m rooting for you too ehehe",
