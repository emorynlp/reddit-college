  "text": "I am a US citizen studying abroad. We received our A-level grades yesterday... or more like some of them. One of my grades is completely missing and will take until October 25th to be released. I am also querying one of my grades to see if I can receive a higher mark, this process will take three weeks starting Monday. This is really frustrating but I have to deal with it in the best way possible.\n\nMy grades right now are pretty average, or maybe above (and would've been better if I received them all at once) but I have a time limit since my top school's ED deadline is the first of November. This is important because I am applying for financial aid, and I was told that the acceptance rate is much higher when applying ED.\n\nShould I request a transcript now so I can apply to the school with average grades but ED? Or should I wait until all of my grades are sorted out and apply Regular Decision?",
