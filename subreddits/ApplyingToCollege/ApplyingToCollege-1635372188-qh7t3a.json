  "text": "On the section that says \"My Score recipients\" there are no colleges and on the link to click that says \"See where you've already sent scores\" I see nothing. Does this mean that it didn't go through and there was an error? I'm not talking about the college receiving it. Shouldn't I get some sort of confirmation that I sent it out on my side?",

Don't worry, check tomorrow.\n\nIt then takes a few days (to a week, depending) for College Board to put the score report in the college's account.\n\nIt then takes some additional days until the college downloads the batch of score reports that are waiting in its account, which it will do on some regular schedule such as weekly.",
