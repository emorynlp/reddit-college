  "text": "Hey guys, I just recently finished my PIQ's and I'm currently going through the review section. \n\nThere's one issue though:\n\n**Under Subject (A-G) Requirements, I have 1 missing requirement for English.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI for the life of me CANNOT figure out what's causing this. **I have met minimum requirements for all 4 years** of my English courses. I did not take ACT or SAT however due to Covid-19 Exceptions. (and I'm sure that shouldn't affect the requirements?)\n\nWhat is causing this?",
