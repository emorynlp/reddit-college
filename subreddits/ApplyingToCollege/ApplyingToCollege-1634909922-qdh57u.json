Like I have had a IV drip attached to my arm for at least once every year for the past decade. Should I ask my counselor to put it in the counselor's report? How would it look on the application?",

I don't see how it's relevant to an app unless you missed a lot of high school classes for infusions and thus your grades were affected.)",
