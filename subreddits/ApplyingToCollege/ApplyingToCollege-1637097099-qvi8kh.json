  "text": "I don\u2019t even know anymore bro. I just spent three years grinding for no fucking reason. I\u2019m probably going to go to a safety the way it\u2019s looking right now. I\u2019d be more than happy but it\u2019s like what the hell was the point of it. And I feel like I still have to keep the same grades I had while in a harder course load this year and I\u2019m just fucking exhausted. It\u2019s all bullshit. I feel like Sisyphus. \n\n\nIGNORE\n\n[Little things from the past or present irritate me and my gut response is to want to scream or think that I want to hurt people. I don\u2019t actually which is why it\u2019s even more annoying that that\u2019s what my brain tells me to do. I made no more friends since freshman year because of covid. In fact I mostly just have my few close friends who hang out with their own people and smoke weed and a bad trip is still fucking with me so everything I look at is never the same anymore and I can\u2019t smoke so if they\u2019re seshing with people I don\u2019t go so I feel like we\u2019re falling apart. Sometimes I\u2019m the only one sitting alone at lunch and it bugs me. I can\u2019t even socialize without drinking but I\u2019m worried drinking is fucking with my head too. My cousin is going to rehab for alcoholism and that shit is bugging me too cause I feel for her and it sucks to think about. None of my friends understand the amount of death I\u2019ve dealt with all my life and everyone keeps dying and I don\u2019t even care anymore because it happens so often as of the past year or two. I shouldn\u2019t be complaining plenty of people have it far worse off than I do. I don\u2019t know what I should do In Replacement of drinking if anything but i do kind of need ot cut back. I just want to sleep.]\n\n\nI finished all my apps and I\u2019m happy with my list but I don\u2019t know if I should keep trying because I just don\u2019t have the same motivation I used to have. Something is telling me it\u2019s not worth it because it\u2019s not like second quarter senior year is going to make a big difference on my outcomes for college. Or third and fourth quarter for that matter. How much can we let our grades drop to still look adequate. Only significant ECs I have are working. I don\u2019t have any internships or any of that bullshit so I\u2019m probably not getting into my reaches. My reaches are all small schools anyway so I probably won\u2019t go to them anyway since I\u2019m sort of a changing my Mind about small colleges.\n\nIdek. How are you guys continuing with the bullshit? How are you keeping your grades up consistently? How are you keeping motivation? Etc etc. anyone else just burnt up?",

      "text": "friendly reminder that it's a bit silly and short-sighted to assume all of your academic work and extracurriculars have no value outside of college admissions. you grinded for 3 years for what? for an education. for a much better education than people who coasted with Bs and Cs got. for a headstart going into whatever field you want to go into. for a better idea of what you want to do with your life. for all sorts of good life experiences from extracurriculars, whatever they may have been, maybe fun memories with people at your school or meaningful contributions to the community or the pursuit of something you love. learning is just as valuable whether it gets you in at harvard or not.\n\ni think I reached the peak of this \"I'm wasting my high school years\" feeling when i was prioritizing schoolwork and activities specifically for college admissions over activities i really enjoyed. take a break. reread your favorite novel from when you were a kid. take a nice long nap, and you'll feel a little more in control. at least, that's my experience. <3",
