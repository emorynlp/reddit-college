  "text": "In the Common App, some of Princeton\u2019s supplemental essays have a higher maximum word count than the recommended word count in the prompt. For instance, in the \u201cWhy Princeton\u201d essay, the prompt says \u201cplease respond in about 250 words\u201d but in the Common App, the maximum is 350 words. Will I be at a disadvantage if I submit a 350 word essay even though the prompt specifies a 250 word limit?",
