I would much rather build myself up taking the hard route rather than building off of the backs of others hard work without contributing my own work. You become who you hang out with, and most popular people have old money, not working on themselves, and it doesn\u2019t matter if they fail anything because that trust money or inheritance will set them for life, I wasn\u2019t born with such privilege. I have a good mindset, and even if I was born with such privilege I\u2019d like to accomplish a lot through good habits and good associates. Think long term as I like to think!",
