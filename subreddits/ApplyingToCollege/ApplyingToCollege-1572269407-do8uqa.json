Each quarter we have a 1700-word essay on an approved history/art/lit topic pertaining to the time period we\u2019re studying. There\u2019s a graded checkpoint each week to see if we\u2019re actually doing the work (research which requires 40 notes from 8+ primary and secondary sources, outline, rough draft, final draft, etc). My Humanities teachers don\u2019t do anything to the outline or rough draft, they just check to see if they\u2019re completed and if we have any questions. The essay\u2019s final grade is out of 200 points and worth 25% of the quarter\u2019s grade in both History and English Honors.",
