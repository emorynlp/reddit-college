  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m an international student from the UK who\u2019s been offered a Columbia interview. I\u2019m obviously excited but also nervous as I have no idea what to expect. I\u2019m from the north and my school has never sent anyone to a US College before, so my teachers are unable to offer me much guidance, which is why I\u2019m turning to Reddit! What kind of questions can I expect to be asked and what prep should I do beforehand ( I\u2019ve already searched my interviewer)?\nThanks!",
