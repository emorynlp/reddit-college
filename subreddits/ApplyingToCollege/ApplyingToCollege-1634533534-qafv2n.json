  "text": "I slacked off during Covid and my gpa from freshman and sophomore year combined is an 87(my school is on 100 point scale for weighted, 2nd semester freshman year didn\u2019t count). \nAssuming I can get a 103.6+(what I got 1st quarter junior year, 4 1.2 multipliers) and a 108 first semester senior year(7 1.2 multipliers) I can get my overall weighted to 96. \nWhat if I took a gap year so my second semester of senior year counted so I could get my overall up to a 97.7(assuming 108)?\n\nIs a gap year worth it to go from 96 to 97.7? I know colleges don\u2019t like them unless you make use of it so I assume I could work at a non profit or something (might look good)\n\nP.s. i know I\u2019m obsessing over this WAY too much but I can\u2019t help myself from worrying about it. If you read through Ty for taking the time.",
