  "text": "hi there, i\u2019m 18 and currently in my 2nd year of college studying math/economics in france, aspiring to get a master in finance. A few days ago a received the results of the TOEFL ibt test i did (scored 100/120). as a result, i received a mail from a recruiter at hult saying they were interested in my profile. \n\nI\u2019m considering applying for a few reasons : i\u2019d like to get international experience, i\u2019m not really a fan of math so i have a hard time getting invested in my studies, and frankly even though i love paris i\u2019d like to get out a bit. \n\nhowever, i\u2019m reluctant for a few reasons :\n- never heard of hult before this mail\n- i graduate by the end of year 3, so if i accept i\u2019ll basically go naked (no diploma, and what if hult is bad), and idk if it\u2019ll make me start a year 1 at hult (if i accept i join their undergrad program) so yeah not a fan \n- their brochure mentioned at some point giving students the \u00ab\u00a0mindset of a entrepreneur\u00a0\u00bb which is in my eyes a red flag (due to the absurd amount of \u00ab\u00a0entrepreneurs\u00a0\u00bb online selling bullshit $500 courses and the grindset/alpha male/motivational circlejerk)\n\nbut again if it\u2019s affiliated with the TOEFL it should be something serious right ? \n\nso yeah title, is this offer worth considering ? or should i stay and graduate here in france?",
