  "text": "should I send my dual enrollment transcript to colleges? I heard that a lot of them don't use them for admission since they were taken at my high school, not at the actual college. but also I want to show that I took these classes and did well. if there wasn't a transcript request fee Id send them but I dont want to waste money if the colleges arent gonna look at the transcript anyway",

      "text": "If it isn't mandatory, I wouldn't. Cause I know it's mandatory for UT, UT Dallas, and University of Maryland, so I sent it to them. But my other colleges didn't really mention it. I'm assuming it's similar to AP scores ie you send them after you enroll so you can get credit. But again idk cause some schools want dual enrollment transcripts. And yea it's a lot of money to send it too all the schools you're applying. That might be why some schools don't mention it but again some schools want SAT scores to be sent via college board and that costs more than transcripts sooo... Yea.",

      "text": "Unless the school specifically requests it, this seems odd. The school would be able to see your dual enrollment classes on your high school transcript/self-reported info (if provided). They will want the college transcript for credit evaluation once you've decided on a college and actually need to transfer the credit there to be counted towards your degree.",
