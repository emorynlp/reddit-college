  "text": "I\u2019m an international student at a school that does not offer AP or any advanced classes. So I was wondering whether I should self study for some AP tests or do Dual Enrollment. If I do dual enrollment, it will be online as it is also not offered here. I\u2019m currently leaning towards Dual Enrollment because most top colleges don\u2019t really offer AP credits but I was wondering which one would look better on my application?",
