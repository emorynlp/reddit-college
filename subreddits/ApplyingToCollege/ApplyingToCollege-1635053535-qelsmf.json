  "text": "hey guys! I'm applying to Cornell as ED for fall 2022. I'm interested in Economics and Computer Science. Would you guys advise me to apply to Dyson school of economics ( 5.4% Acceptance ), College of Engineering for Computer Science ( 8% ), or College of Arts and Sciences that has both (7%)? I don't wanna submit my sat because it's only 1360, in Dyson, it is not even considered, but for COE and CAS, it is just optional.\n\nGPA: 3.97 uw",

If you choose COE, you\u2019ll have to major in computer science. That is, unless you internally transfer. A&S will allow you to choose between them more easily.",
