  "text": "If my parents have a set amount of money that I can put towards college and they make enough money to disqualify me from financial aid, how do I go about paying to attend a college that I do not have the money for?\n\nLike, if I have $25k per year covered by my parents, how would I go about covering the other $40-50k it would cost to attend a great private university? I know there's a max on federal loans that is pretty minimal in the beginning. \n\nI am not considering asking for more money because I'd feel like I'm then disrespecting the extremely generous amount of money they've saved for me, plus my family lives very frugally, so I don't think my parents would budge. My Grandma might be willing to help because she and my deceased Grandpa saved really well, but I don't want to plan on it (plus, even if she did help out, it wouldn't be anywhere close to enough to cover the presumed $40-50k I need to account for).",

UT Austin\u2019s mostly go to honors, but I think I would be able to pay for in-state w/o scholarships and not have to take out any loans. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into their CS program though. Where I\u2019ll probably end up is UT Dallas, but they don\u2019t have good merit scholarship programs because they handle their finances terribly. \n\nAnyways, I said top ones because that\u2019s the only type of private college I would consider. I don\u2019t see a point in going to SMU or Baylor when UT Dallas has a much better program for my intended major. Plus I don\u2019t like big schools (unless it\u2019s UT Austin).",

I would like to get my PhD, and if you graduate from a top university, it\u2019s much easier to get offered research by top, fully-funded programs. \n\nI also prefer the academic culture and social life of more intense (but smaller) universities.",
