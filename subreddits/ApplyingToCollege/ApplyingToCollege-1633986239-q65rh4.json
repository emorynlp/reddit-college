  "text": "If my parents have a set amount of money that I can put towards college and they make enough money to disqualify me from financial aid, how do I go about paying to attend a college that I do not have the money for?\n\nLike, if I have $25k per year covered by my parents, how would I go about covering the other $40-50k it would cost to attend a great private university? I know there's a max on federal loans that is pretty minimal in the beginning. \n\nI am not considering asking for more money because I'd feel like I'm then disrespecting the extremely generous amount of money they've saved for me, plus my family lives very frugally, so I don't think my parents would budge. My Grandma might be willing to help because she and my deceased Grandpa saved really well, but I don't want to plan on it (plus, even if she did help out, it wouldn't be anywhere close to enough to cover the presumed $40-50k I need to account for).",
