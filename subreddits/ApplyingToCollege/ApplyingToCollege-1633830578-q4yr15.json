  "title:": "Does my essay have to be personal?",
  "text": "There is a current events topic that I\u2019ve been following closely and am very passionate about it, and I think that writing a paper about the situation would be very compelling, since it\u2019s something I\u2019m involved in and care about? I can\u2019t think of any incredible moments in my life that would be worth writing a whole essay about, but is that what I have to do? Or if I do choose to make my essay on current events, will I have to eventually make it have to do with me in the paper? Thank you to anyone who can help.",

      "text": "It's not really an essay, it's an applicant statement or personal statement. It needs to be about you and should not end up sounding like a term paper for a class. Also, be careful with current events. In general, it's best to tread lightly  with \"Bible, Bucks, and Biden,\" which is a cheeky way to say be careful with topics involving religion, money, or politics.",
