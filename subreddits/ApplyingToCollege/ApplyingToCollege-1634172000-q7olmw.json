UCs are research universities with a larger budget and longer history. These were the original academic institutions in California designed to be a place for both education and professional research. CSUs were set up as a separate system designed more as a traditional college experience, focusing on job training and undergraduate education. There is no research credit given to these schools and they are more similar to what someone thinks when they are talking about \"college\" as an undergrad student. \n\nOne pushes the boundaries of the fields being taught and the other gives more training for when someone is going into the job market. (both school systems are good about this tho don't let that fool you). \n\nTypically, UCs are more expensive and more competitive with higher job placement because of the competitive nature. It's kind of seen as the more \"dominant\" of the two systems and is often the more desirable option. \n\nOn the other hand, CSU has some standout education through places like Cal Poly SLO and San Jose State for things like architecture and computer science and these examples specifically outrank some UCs in the fields above. Also, like I said, they are typically easier to get in to and will cost students less.  \n\nYou're welcome, \n\n\\-A student wondering why the hell I wrote this long ass thing but I'm too deep to quit.

That part didn't really matter since my school has prep courses you can do for HS credit and they offer free sessions with a tutoring company.

I paid for exam prep. I paid for the SAT/ACT a couple of times. We talked a lot, especially about how I see kids come to college and fall flat on their faces because they have no clue how to function independently. We talk about time management tools, strategies to manage ADHD and anxiety, when to ask for help, why going to class is super important, how to develop relationships with professors, everything in moderation, safety, keeping an eye on your money, managing self-care and daily routines, being internally motivated and self-driven, etc. \n\nThen, they decided their major and which colleges were a good fit. I did read over some of the essays to give a few editing marks, but I didn't offer advice on content. \n\nOpe, and I also filed the fafsa for them. But I'm a former accountant, plus I work at a university, so they asked me if I would just handle it.\n\nI just asked my kid how they would rate me, and they said \"solid 8, but that's not bad. You're not a jerk.\" So yay I guess :)",

My mom thought I was taking too long with my Common App essay in late September so she wrote an essay FOR ME in 3 hours and complained to me about how I am being lazy. My dad yelled at me about it every day for 3 months while dropping off and picking me up from school. They kept saying that my grades right now don't matter if I don't apply on time, which I obviously understand but this message isn't helpful when it's parrotted to you every waking minute of the day. The one day I took off of school because I was genuinely sick was spent by my parents constantly bothering me about applications.\n\nTo top it all off, they have been complaining to friends and family about how I have been so slow with this process and I keep getting unsolicited advice from relatives and acquaintances about it too. Them putting so much pressure on me to do college apps is mentally debilitating and exhausting. My grades have tanked this semester because I am guilted by them saying shit like how my grades don't matter unless I apply to college and how I have been lazy about this whole process. They do not understand that if you keep beating a person down to make them get up, they won't get up. \n\nFYI, I have applied to 3 colleges as of now and reviewing 2 more. And I wrote my own essays, I didn't use my mom's.",
