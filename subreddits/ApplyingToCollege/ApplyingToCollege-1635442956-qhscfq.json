  "text": "I got a puppy in junior year and since then I\u2019ve become really interested in dog training.\n\nI love researching about it, and find it super interesting. Since I got my dog Ive spent a significant amount of time doing research about training/training methods and training him.\n\nI only have 6 activities and I thought about putting this as an activity because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve put a lot of time into. But I haven\u2019t really trained other dogs, or worked anywhere as a dog trainer, etc. I just like to train my dog lol\n\nMy ECs are okay but not great. I am also writing a short essay about this for UF. Should I put training my dog as an activity?",

      "text": "That\u2019s pretty cool! I was touring WashU last week, and they said that your activities include anything that isn\u2019t just sleeping, watching Netflix, and going to school like everyone else. This definitely counts, especially if you\u2019ve invested a lot of time into it. I also think it\u2019s cute and unique. \ud83d\udc36",
