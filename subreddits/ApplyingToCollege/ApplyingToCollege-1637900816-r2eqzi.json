  "text": "I'm in arizona, but none of the schools we have here are of my interest unless i end up having to go. i keep coming across several schools that barely offer or dont offer any need-based aid to out of state students. are there any recommendations for schools that \\*do\\* offer decent need-based aid? i read that syracuse university (and unc chapel hill - i know the acceptance rate is in the low 20's but ill still give it a go) are a couple of good ones. i'm looking for schools that arent the utmost hardest to get into but dont have a very high acceptance rate at the same time, so around a 30%-60% rate of acceptance.",

      "text": "A lot would depend on what you want to study, because both ASU and UArizona offer most of the disciplines possible... But if you're looking at OOS schools, start with the rankings for that major and go through the list to see which schools are a good match for you, both academically and financially.",

      "text": "Private universities and liberal arts colleges -- schools like Lawrence University and College of Wooster are good examples that can provide a lot of need based aid with acceptance rates in that range (many of the [ctcl.org](https://ctcl.org) schools actually fit this, but they aren't the only ones).",

      "text": "Look up acceptance rates at privates ranked from, say, 30-100. Some private universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state.\n\nSome general thoughts on paying for college:\n\n*Public* universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nSome public universities offer large merit scholarships to out-of-state students.\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
