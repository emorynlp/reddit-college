(Other than some schools will ask \u201cdo you intended to seek need-based aid\u201d or allow you to check that you want to apply for scholarships.)\n\nYou\u2019ll need to look at the info about financial aid for international students for each specific school you\u2019re applying to; this will tell you whether they offer aid to international students and, if so, how to apply.",
