  "text": "\nHello, I am currently a sophomore and am planning on majoring in either math or computer science. If I plan on being accepted to a top college like an Ivy League, what are some things I should do to maximize my chances of being accepted? I\u2019ve done the AMC10 contests and am planning on competing in USACO. I took AP CS principles last year (4 on ap test), and am taking ap euro, ap chem, and ap bio this year. During the summer i took a advanced cs course from columbia university. Ive also been playing violin for a while and have competed in a few competitions. As of now i\u2019m not sure what to do to build on my portfolio, and am looking for helpful suggestions.",

      "text": "Hello, I\u2019m also a sophomore that wants to major in cs or math. In my opinion, on portfolios it\u2019s more important to highlight your passion and experience on these 2 subjects than to try and seem like you do everything(sports, music, arts, asb or leadership, etc.)  Try exploring these subjects more since there a lot of other math competitions besides AMC and think about what you want to do with your cs skills (maybe a big project). Hope this helps!",
