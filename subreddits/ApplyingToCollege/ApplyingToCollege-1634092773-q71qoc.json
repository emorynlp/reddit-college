  "text": "I am applying for computer science and was filling out my common app with my activities. I only have 8 that I can think of. However, I did spend some time over the summer (maybe close to 20 hours) learning the basics of development (mainly HTML and CSS but a little bit of Java Script aswell). Should I add this as an activity? I figured it would help me look more interested in Computer Science but I don't know if it constitutes as an activity.",
