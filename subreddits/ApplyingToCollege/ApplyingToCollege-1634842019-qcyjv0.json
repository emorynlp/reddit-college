  "text": "I\u2019m applying to University of Maryland - College Park.\n\nI'm going to be applying Early Action and to be transparent, I am unsure of my chances after researching average academic achievements. Seeing as this is my dream school, I\u2019m looking for the way I should apply that gives me the best chance of being accepted\u2014 either Fall or Spring semester. There is no Early Decision option, but there is an option to apply for either Fall 2022 or Spring 2023.\n\nI also know that Fall applicants who are instead offered Spring admission are also offered Freshman Connection so they can take classes and live on campus in the Fall.\n\nI want to know if there is data/statistical facts that compares the admissions rates between Fall applicants who were offered Spring admission versus Spring semester applicants who were accepted for Spring semester.\n\nI also want to know if Fall applicants had a higher chance of being offered Spring admission than the applicants who applied for Spring, if this entire post makes sense.\n\nAny help is appreciated and good luck to everyone <3",
