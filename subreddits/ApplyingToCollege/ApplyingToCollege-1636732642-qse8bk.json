  "text": "For example, the buildings at Yale, Princeton, Fordham, Harvard, Wash U, Rice (?), Oxford, etc, all have a similar antique feel to them. Maybe it's just me and my fascination with history, but when colleges have this appearance, it's a HUGE plus. Especially for the older universities and just knowing that you're on a campus where hundreds of years of history have taken place, it's really cool. Okay, I'm done now \ud83d\ude05\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. I'm a prospective computer science major, but I love history.",
