  "text": "For the common app testing, I put 2 for the \"Number of past ACT scores you wish to report.\" I have already submitted my application and then was going to submit my ACT score. Half of my highest composite was on one ACT, and the other half was the other.  I submitted 1 of the ACT to the college already.  I totally forgot that my school district had seniors take another ACT (October). The problem is, I am not sure if I can send the other ACT scores I sent that ACT scores to the colleges since it was free after I took it. Scores have not been released for that test yet and I submitted these scores before doing my application.\n\nSo the question is, should I email the admission office about the number of past ACT scores I wish to report? Or, would it be fine to send the ACT score which is my other highest composites are?",

I have submitted the ACT which the school district required for us to do (submitted before my application) and submitted one of my ACT test score which had some of my highest scores I entered on the common app.\n\nThe question I had was whether if I can submit the ACT scores which contained the other half I reported on the Common App",
