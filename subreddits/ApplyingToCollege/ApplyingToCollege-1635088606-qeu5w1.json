  "text": "Our counselor says that they have to upload a mid-year and a final year transcript for grades 9 to 11. The problem is I didn't attend assessment tests (due to personal and valid reasons) in 9th grade which affected my 9th grade final year report. My counselor is not going to explain it (can't do much about it). I suggested not attaching the final year report and only the mid-year one (which wasn't affected) but they can't do that either. I'll have to explain this myself in the additional info section, but won't it look very weird? I have amazing grades in every transcript and then in 9th grade finals I have almost all Bs. My counselor is not mentioning it either.\n\nWhat can I do? Should I just let it go, let our counselor attach the transcript and explain in the additional info section? I hear colleges also recalculate GPAs (our school doesn't have a GPA system). Will they take into account my Bs? I didn't even attend some components of the exams, so how is that going to work...",
