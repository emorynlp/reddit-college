  "text": "Putting that aside, I just wanted to say y\u2019all got this. With the extenuating circumstances given the pandemic, Class of 2021 I am sure you will push through. This goes out to all HS students, College Students and anyone who wants to read this, we will make it through.  \n\nFor HS students, I understand that college applications are especially tough to balance for some of you who are affected by the pandemic, but never give up hope. Having been through the app process myself last year, I am sure this year with everything going on, it\u2019s going to be a fabulous year for you (Positive Hopes). A bright future lays ahead of you and I am confident that you will prevail and bounce back from adversity. \n\n2020 is coming to an end and I am sure it has been a wild year for y\u2019all, however, let\u2019s finish strong \ud83d\udcaa. \n\nI just wanted to spread some light and say that to y\u2019all.  Good luck and let\u2019s get em.",
