([http://www.ijsred.com/volume4/issue5/IJSRED-V4I5P8.pdf](http://www.ijsred.com/volume4/issue5/IJSRED-V4I5P8.pdf)) The impact factor of the journal is 4.99. How much will my work impact my admission process? Should the journal have been even better or IJSRED is acceptable?",

      "text": "Hey OP, did you have to pay money to publish this paper? What kind of peer review did it go through? How long was publication proccess?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe jounral on its site claims 24 hr publication which is highly suspect. It also claims a 4.99 IF on their website but I cannot find any info on the journal on any reputed source that claims journal impact factors.\n\nThis seems like a predatory journal from what I can gather. These journals try and scam people and promoting publications in them can harm your research reputation. [https://www.quora.com/Is-the-International-Journal-for-Scientific-Research-and-Development-fake-or-not](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-International-Journal-for-Scientific-Research-and-Development-fake-or-not)\n\n[https://www.openacessjournal.com/journal/134/International-journal-of-scientific-research-and-engineering-development](https://www.openacessjournal.com/journal/134/International-journal-of-scientific-research-and-engineering-development)\n\nI'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you likely got scammed. Please reach out if you want to discuss more",

IJSRD is of course a fake one. I doubt is IJSRED is fake. Despite they mention 24 hrs publication, they took almost a week to get it published. I paid $40. For peer review, they have a team.",

A true journal with an IF of 5 (I have published in a journal with IF \\~5 prior as well as higher IFs) should be listed on the common sources regarding impact factor which this journal is not. My bad on citing the link for IJSRED I just misred.\n\neven a week is exceptionally suspect. Most publications take months to be accepted and a week is too short. For peer review most journals outsource to experts in their field. I am not claiming your work or paper is bad but rather this journal is predatory at worst or highly suspect at best. I would not include this publication in your applications or resumes to avoid harming your research career.\n\n  \nI'm not trying to be agressive or discount your work here, I just want to help your career in research",
