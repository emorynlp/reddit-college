  "text": "I attended a community college before I transferred to UC Berkeley, where I will be getting a degree of science in EECS. I am applying to some Computer Science master's programs this fall, and I need three letters of recommendation. On one hand, I can ask for letters from my teachers in community college, with whom I have forged very good relationships. I have TA'ed for them for a few semesters, and they know me really well. In other words, their letters would be personal and strong. On the other hand, I have also found some professors at UC Berkeley who are willing to write me a letter. However, they barely know me. The only connection between us is that I did well in their classes. The letters they write will be simple and short.\n\nI am graduating soon, so doing things to bond with professors for the sake of good letters is too late now. I'm inclined to just have my CC teachers write my letters(only 1 of them have a Ph.D.), but I'm also worried that in this case, none of the three letters would be coming from the institution I graduated from.\n\nWhich should I go with, CC letters or university letters?",
