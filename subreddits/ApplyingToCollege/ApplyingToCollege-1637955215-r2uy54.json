  "title:": "CSS Parent Waiver thingy please help me",
  "text": "Soo\n\nI guess I submitted the CSS profile (before the due date for Cornell) with only \\*1 PARENT\\* listed. But I guess 2 is required? I guess I was a little confused because they let me submit the application with only a single parent, but now I'm seeing that a waiver is absolutely required to get away with not listing a second parent.\n\nI'm super worried about the waiver being accepted because I was only aware until now that it was something I had to do! It is well past the due date for financial aid for all of my schools that have the CSS profile (which I already submitted), so does that mean the waiver is past due? When I look at my copy of the profile it does only have a single parent on there.\n\nAlso, a little more importantly, third party documentation is required from either:\n\n1. Social worker\n2. Counselor\n3. Teacher\n\nBut absolutely NO family members. It needs to be a letter verifying my personal statement about not having a dad lol. I have never spoken to any of those people about my family situation and don't really feel like explaining it. And what should even go in a letter like that....like what would I even tell my school counselor to say on it lol..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo idea what to do. Is anyone or has anyone been in the same boat here who can give me some guidance? Because I feel like my school counselor would not be very helpful in this field (rich kid schools amirite?)",

      "text": "For the 3rd party letter, I got a teacher to do mines in which I just told them what to say and it was a really short letter. For counselor verification, your counselor should have on file your primary parent and who to call if there's emergency and if your non-custodial parent isn't on there, your counselor can say that as a supporting doc.",
