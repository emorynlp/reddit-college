  "text": "So I tried to use the converter on college vine and I can't quite figure it out. I have a 4.41 weighted GPA and I need to convert it to an unweighted. When I select a 5.0 gpa scale for what my school uses and try to convert it to a 4.0 scale it says I have a 3.53, which seems a little too low. If I make them both 4.0 nothing happens of course. I don't have anything lower than an A- on my transcript. Does anyone know what I should do?",

Even if a teacher had some grudge against a kid and decided to deduct 10 marks, that kid can do absolutely nothing about it. Plus, every  schoolhas its own approach and level of difficulty. I know about schools that will literally leak their papers before the exams, and many of them are even respected in their areas. The point is, it's just impossible to set up a definite criteria.\n\nP.S. You probably got 90+% in your 11th grade and are hence making this point?? Just a guess.",
