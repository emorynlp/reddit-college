  "text": "I'm sorry if posts like these aren't allowed here.\n\n\nI have a GPA of 3.4/4.0 which I think is pretty low for scholarships and have mediocre ECA's. I haven't given SAT as it's test optional these days but considering my low GPA I think SAT is the only way I'll land a scholarship. I'm planning to major in CS and I've looked at so many colleges but I can't seem to come to conclusion on which colleges to apply to that is affordable and good.",

Pricing would also be on the lower side, though asking for a scholarship with a 3.4 unweighted while being international is just begging for rejection.",
