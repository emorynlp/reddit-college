When I entered grade 11 (different school)  I started going by my full name.\n\nThe nickname isn't really a \"former name\" because I was still registered in these schools with my full name; it's just what the people there referred to me as.\n\nThe shortened version is on an award that I'm putting in the honours section.\n\nShould I indicate this on my common app, if so where?",
