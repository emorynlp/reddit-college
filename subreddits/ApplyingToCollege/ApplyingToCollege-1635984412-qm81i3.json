  "text": "not like uw instead of w, i just put the wrong number.  naviance gave 3 decimal points and i only read the last 2.  i just found out today because after i read that post about the 64 students applying to brown ed, i wanted to see how many from my school applied as well.  my gpa showed up and i was like\u2026that\u2019s not right.  so i checked again and realized that no, i\u2019m just stupid.  the one thing i didn\u2019t double check on my application because i was sure i didn\u2019t need to\u2026 and it\u2019s wrong.\n\nanyway is there a way to fix it",
