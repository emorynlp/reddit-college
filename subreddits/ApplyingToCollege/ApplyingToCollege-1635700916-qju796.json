  "text": "I already submitted my ED application to one school. Now I am thinking about EA. I have 2 schools in mind: St. Johns and Northeastern since neither of those require supplements and all my other stuff is good. \n\nBut I forgot to send in SAT scores to those schools and if I do it now, they'll be sent late after November 1st. So should I just wait until RD? I'm fine with either but was just wondering what I should do. I'm really indecisive. My mom said to wait until RD so maybe I will just do that. But what are yalls thoughts?",
