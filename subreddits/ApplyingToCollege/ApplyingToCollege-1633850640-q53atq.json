  "text": "As for me, i began my junior year in 2019-2020 and by the beginning of second semester our school got shut down. The following year i spent at home due to covid STILL being a major issue in my country, i haven't gone out with my friends too much and i lost NEARLY ALL my ECs during that year. I stopped going to guitar, my robotics club and etc. This is my final year in HS and i felt like i never got what i needed from the past 2 years. I still feel like I'm stuck in the beginning of 2020 trying to figure out what is happening around me.   \nHowever now is the college apps season, and i don't feel like I'm old enough and mature enough for this, I'm only 16 and it feels like my teenage life is going to end once I'm in college, that's when i am 17. So i practically lost 3 years of teenage life due to this fucking virus, furthermore i lost shit-ton of activities and chances that could've been helpful to college applications. Hopefully this will be improved next year. What about you?",
