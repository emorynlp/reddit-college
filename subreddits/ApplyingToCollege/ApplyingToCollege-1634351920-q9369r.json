  "text": "I'm a 17f student planning on applying to colleges in the US this year. And honestly very confused about how my grades and ECs are in par with the colleges.\n\nI have had 90+ grades in all 4 years of high school. I'm in top 5 of my class. I scored a 1540 on my SAT this year.\n\nI have very mediocre extra-curricular participation.\n\n* I am a dancer and have a degree in classical dancing.\n* I was an assistant yoga teacher in my school in my freshman and sophomore year.\n* I have written articles for magazines.\n* I have participation in science olympiads in my school and am in top 5 of all of them.\n* I'm professionally trained and can play two instruments.\n\nI'd be grateful to know what colleges I should apply to with such a profile. I'm sure my LORs and essays will be good. I'm planning on majoring in Computer Science or Math.",
