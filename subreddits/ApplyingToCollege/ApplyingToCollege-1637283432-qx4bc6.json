              "text": "If you\u2019re international it may be tougher coming from a non-feeder than if you were domestic. It seems to me that of the small pool of intls that are admitted, a greater proportion seem to be from at least semi-feeder schools compared to the domestic accepted pool which is big enough that feeder school students don\u2019t compose such a significant proportion. There\u2019s also the confounding factor that most colleges are need-aware for intls, so accepted ones are almost always full-pay, and thus they tended to go to an expensive private high school as well, often with an international curriculum. And those high schools tend to be the feeders/semi-feeders. But it\u2019s out of your control now, so don\u2019t worry about it too much.",
