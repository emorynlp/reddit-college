  "text": " I was waitlisted by NYU last year and I am applying again after my gap year. My final grades jumped from a 78 to a 90.2 and I have gained a lot of work experience in the field I'll be pursuing in college. Since I applied to NYU last year, will they be able to use my previous year's financial information? I come from a low-income family. So will that play to my disadvantage",
