  "title:": "Is College Worth It? A Comprehensive Return on Investment Analysis",
  "text": "Came across this interesting analysis and thought some here might find it useful. Full article: https://freopp.org/is-college-worth-it-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-1b2ad17f84c8\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n- This report estimates return on investment (ROI) \u2014 the increase in lifetime earnings minus the costs of college \u2014 for nearly 30,000 bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\n- For students who graduate on time, the median bachelor\u2019s degree has a net ROI of $306,000. But some degrees are worth millions of dollars, while others have no net financial value at all.\n\n- After accounting for the risk of dropping out, ROI for the median bachelor\u2019s degree drops to $129,000. Over a quarter of programs have negative ROI.\n\n- Four in five engineering programs have ROI above $500,000, but the same is true for just 1% of psychology programs.\n\n- Elite schools such as Caltech and Penn dominate the list of highest ROI programs. But attending an elite school is not a golden ticket; some Ivy League degrees have negative ROI.\n\n\nAs someone who's been out of college for about a decade, and having had the benefit of hindsight, I'd say the findings align with my experience and those around me/my college peers. A lot of college applicants/those trying to the applicants/their parents obssess over the wrong things. It's not the brand/college you go to that matters; it's the degree. Pick a degree that occupies that sweet intersection: find something that teaches you real skills that add value to society and bring you fulfillment in some way, and you will never starve.",

      "text": "I saw this yesterday and have been discussing it with a friend of mine from high school.  I find it a little flawed.  Some thoughts:\n\n1. Many people who read the paper will make generalizations that aren't true for all students.  Namely, don't use his average or expected ROI numbers as a guide to pick what *you* should study.  They may not be indicative of the expected earnings numbers for *you* as an individual.\n2. The earnings numbers across different schools (for the same major) seem off.  Compare UT-CS vs. Rice CS.  If accurate, that (very large) delta is almost certainly down to the set of individuals admitted to one vs. the other and not pure value add from the Rice degree.  Ergo, don't use the earnings numbers (for a given major) across schools to predict what *your* earnings will be if you get into both schools and are choosing which one to attend.\n3. His analysis completely discounts the non-financial benefits of attending college.  For instance, it's more fun than working for four years.  But, also, the social capital.  He briefly mentions this but, as there's no way to quantify it, it is ignored in the final figures.\n4. While this isn't in the paper, many readers will be tempted, based on his analysis, to choose what to study based purely on predicted earnings while completely discounting the sort of career they might actually find meaningful and rewarding.  Seems like a poor approach, and a great way to wind up highly compensated while also bored, dissatisfied, and burnt out.\n5. Related to the above, it may be the case that, for certain students/majors/schools, while getting the degree has net-zero ROI it nevertheless unlocks careers they would find more *enjoyable and rewarding*, even if the money is no better than what they might have earned without the degree.\n\nRe: the first point, consider music vs. CS.  Slam dunk for CS, right?  Well, not if you're Joshua Bell.  If you're Bell, then you should almost certainly study violin performance over CS.\n\nOr, let's suppose a high stats student is considering becoming a physician and is highly likely to successfully matriculate to and graduate from med school.  The earnings \"floor\" for that guy, regardless of degree, is whatever a physician earns.  He can major in English or religious studies and still make physician money.\n\nThings I agree with based on his findings:\n\n1. The career you choose is much more impactful w.r.t. earnings than the undergraduate school you attended.\n2. There is a larger-than-most-people-would-care-to-admit set of students who will either derive no financial benefit from their college degree or actually end up in the red.",

          "text": "To be fair, point 1 is true of any study, not just this one - it's not meant to tell an individual what exactly they should do. The role of such studies is to analyse what tends to be true for a sample/population. Then you draw your own conclusions as needed for your own case.\n\nPoint 3 is not quantifiable as you say so falls outside the scope of a study that is specifically trying to assess the quantifiable/monetary aspect of college decisions. \n\nPoint 4 is really up to the reader. It's not the responsibility of any study to provide philosophical guidance on what people should do with the findings because, hey, it's different for everyone. What the study can do is offer the data as factually as possible, or analyse it as logically as possible, and so that a reader has good information to then make a decision that is suited for themselves. I know people who can't work in a job unless they find some gratification in it. I also know people who literally do not care whether their job offers any intangible enjoyment factor and are willing (and have) worked with their nose to the ground because money is the sole consideration for them. It's just up to the individual; I don't expect an analytical paper to impose any philosophical conclusions on its readers.\n\nUltimately, I found it interesting because it's hard to come across papers that analyse the financial payoff of college decisions to such a level so I appreciate it for that.",

              "text": "I agree it's not the fault of the study or its author if it's ultimately misinterpreted.  But, at the same time, I think it's highly likely this one will be grossly misinterpreted.\n\nThat, and I have some problems with his methodology.  For instance, he has the median Harvard chemistry major earning $70k at age 45.  Does that seem credible to you?  It turns out he tries to separate the portion of the Harvard chemistry guy's earnings that are attributable to his subsequent graduate degree(s).  So, while Harvard chemistry majors may actually be very highly compensated relative to Harvard C.S. majors, his analysis paints the opposite picture.  I'd prefer to see numbers that take into account the opportunities for further study that various undergrad degrees \"unlock\".  This would tend to also make humanities degrees (esp. at top schools) look \\*much\\* better relative to CS and engineering.\n\nAnother thing that might be significant: men vs. women and family-related career choices.  Many women intentionally tank their earnings when they choose to start a family and/or spend more time with children.  For women, then, as a group, I would expect the ROI to a college degree to be somewhat lower if we're basing that ROI calculation purely on future earnings, and I'd expect women's earning hit to \\*especially\\* impact fields that are disproportionately popular among women.\n\nI'd also be interested to see what the ROI numbers look like \\*specifically\\* for high-stats students.  This set of students is not only more likely to receive large discounts on the \\*cost\\* of college, they're also more likely to supplement their undergraduate degree with a professional degree.  History + JD, Biology + MD, etc.  Limited to this set of students, I might expect the earnings gap between \"low-earning\" majors and, say, CS or engineering, to be somewhat smaller (when subsequent degrees are taken into account).",

I would have never matured and become myself without getting the hell away from my parents\u2019 house and my tiny town and having the chance to learn in a new environment. College is not there to teach you specific skills; it\u2019s there to teach you how to think, how to ask the right questions, and how to frame things properly.",
