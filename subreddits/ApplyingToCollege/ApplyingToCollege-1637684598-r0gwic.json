  "text": "Got accepted into my dream school... spring semester??? Do you think I should still go? There's options to study abroad which i've always wanted to do but I wanted to wait until my junior year. Do you think i'll regret missing out on first semester freshman activities like move in day and all of those things? Idrk what to think abt this situation. On one hand i'm really grateful I got accepted into a school I had a very low chance at with my gpa, but on the other hand i'm a little sad that I wouldn't be able to attend first semester. Any thoughts and advice are appreciated :)",

      "text": "i think you should go for it! i go to a college where a portion of the freshman class spends their first semester abroad before coming to main campus in the spring, and nobody i've spoken to has regretted it. it's actually a really cool experience! you may miss out on some of the classic move in activities but you'll get a whole slew of different experiences to make up for it. there will be a lot of people in the same boat as you come spring semester, and i'm sure your college has a system set up to make the transition easy",
