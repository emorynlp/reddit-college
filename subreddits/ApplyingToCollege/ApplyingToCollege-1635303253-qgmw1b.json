  "text": "Demographics: Asian female in Texas\nClass Ranking: 6 out of 382 \nGPA: Weighted 4.67 on a 4 point scale,\nBase GPA is 98.17 \nACT: Composite 32 \nR35, E33, S32, M26 (retaking for superscore) \n\nAPs: \nAP Human Geo (4) \nAP World History (3) \nAP Lit (3) \n\nCurrently in the IB Program my senior classes: English HL, History HL, Music HL, Biology SL, Applications and Interpretations SL, Spanish SL, AP Journalism, Theory of Knowledge\n\nExtracurriculars: \nCo-Captain of Social Studies UIL (3 years, 2 years co-captain) \n\nFounder and President of Asian American Pacific Alliance (1 year)\n\nPresident of Senior Council \n\nChoir (4 years)\n\nPart time at a fast food restaurant (1.5 years)\n\nSecretary of Diversify Our Narrative (student led school district initiative) \n\nAwards: \nSocial Studies UIL:\n1st place for team in district\n4th place for solo \n\nChoir: \n3rd chair Area, 17th chair for State auditions\n\nHobbies: \nEmbroidery, roller skating, cooking, fashion, biking \n\nEssays: Haven\u2019t started, but English is a strong suit and I\u2019m not worried about this portion \n\nLORs: \nEnglish and History teachers and counselor, only good things to be said \n\nLocation: I prefer a suburban town close to a big city but I\u2019m open to a lot of schools \n\nSchool Size: preferably 2k-10k, also interested in honors colleges in big state schools. I like talking to professors and would enjoy smaller classes \n\nColleges I\u2019m Considering: \nPomona College, UT Austin (state school, safety), Cornell, Dartmouth, Oglethorpe University, Rice\n\nFinancial Needs: 150K to 200K range looking for merit aid scholarships TT\nMoney is a big deciding factor \n\nSchool Type: Interested in Liberal Arts Colleges mainly for the curriculum, if there are similar universities that still emphasize liberal arts education I\u2019m also interested (ex. Brown) \n\nGeography: \nCalifornia, Texas, East coast, Colorado \n(Hoping to either be close to mountains, lakes, or the 1 hour away max to the ocean) \n\nWeather: \nNot picky\n\nSchool vibe: collaborative, chill, fun. I don\u2019t care for school spirit or crazy partying\n\nPolitical: Left leaning \n\nArchitecture: Pretty asf, I don\u2019t have a preference for anything specific but I would really enjoy a pretty campus \n\nIntended Major: Biology with a minor in History \u2014> planning to become a Bio researcher \nMost likely going to get a masters or pHD depending \nFrankly, my passion is in social science but unless a school can give me the safety knowing I can pursue a job in that field, I can study biology instead. I actually prefer LACs so that I can basically take as much classes I want while still being able to graduate w a bachelors in bio\n\nExtras: Preferably has study abroad programs, big Asian American percentage (10-25%)\n\nWould love to have suggestions for all 3, safeties, targets, and reaches. Thank you all so much :)",

Also I\u2019m in-state so that\u2019s a leg up I have.\n\nFeel free to throw questions my way.",

A conversion online says a 32 ACT is ~1440 on the SAT if that means anything. \nI understand the Ivies don\u2019t have merit based scholarships but I have basically little to none saved up if I were to go to an OOS, does Cornell offer anything financially since I\u2019m in the range that can\u2019t pay out of pocket but also not enough for need based aid?",

      "text": "I'd say for sure check out Colorado College- I think it would be a good fit for what you're looking for. Their Block Plan allows you to take one class over a block(think it's a 3.5 week period) and for some classes, their blocks are abroad. Their study abroad programs are quite nice and it's a great LAC. \n\nAlso, Grinnell, Carleton(one of the best LAC's out there), Macalester, and Mount Holyoke",
