  "text": "So my previous drafts of the personal statement didn't seem good enough to me so I wrote one without looking at the prompts and I'm pretty happy with the one I wrote. But I was wondering whether I needed to write a Title or write Prompt at the start. I'm sort of at the edge of the word limit so I don't really wanna do one but I think I can do like a three word title?",
