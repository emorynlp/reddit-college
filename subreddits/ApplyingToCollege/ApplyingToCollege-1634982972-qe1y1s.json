  "text": "I'm an international student with huge financial need and help me pick a school for ED 1 and the other might be my ED 2. My intended majors are psychology and CS.\n\nDenison pros :\n\n1) located near a big city\n2) Great student body\n3) Good CS program with great internship opportunities and help from career development center\n4) Liberal arts education (kind of on fence with this one)\n\nDenison cons :\n\n1) Financial aid is not applicable to study abroad programs\n2) They do not guarantee loan free aid package\n3) I'm not really into the party culture here\n\n\nGrinnell pros :\n\n1) Open curriculum \n2) Better financial aid, loan free aid packages\n3) Better study abroad programs\n4) Amazing Collab culture!\n\nGrinnell cons :\n\n1) In the middle of no where\n2) location might affect intership opportunities (not sure about this)\n\n\nI'd appreciate any help and feel free to add anything. Thanks!",

      "text": "Even though I go to Denison, I would recommend Grinnell for Psychology, the top departments here are in either STEM or arts/humanities fields. The strength of CS programs at Denison and Grinnell are pretty much the same, but if you are interested in big data, Denison might be a better choice.\n\nIf money(financial aid) is the main concern, I would suggest you go with Grinnell.",
