      "text": "Thank you! It\u2019s honestly such an honor for me to be able to give y\u2019all any kind of guidance at all, but especially \u201cmom\u201d advice. I love learning from you and with you \u2014 my kids from all over the world and every little nook and cranny of the US. Thanks for sharing your lives, words of advice, fears, anxieties, crazy ass memes, and excitement every day. \n\nI\u2019m gonna take a moment now to share a bit about why I\u2019m here. My amazing mom died in 2015. A college dropout and a single mom to me for a while after her divorce, she still lived her life in pursuit of making the world just a little bit better. Totally and absolutely devoted to me and all things parenting, she extended her love and heart to those around her in her life and community. She was a tireless volunteer at the homeless shelter and worked with troubled youth for years.  She pushed others to go back and finish their college degrees even when she hadn\u2019t. In her mid forties, she returned to college and graduated at the age of 48 (you can see her graduation pic in my Instagram post today). She then went on to get her masters degree and founded and became the chair of the Early Childhood Department at her college, where she taught and led the program for the next 20 years or so. My mom truly was a life-changer, for both the young children of Texas and for her students, whom she prodded and pushed and sometimes even forced to succeed.  \n\nWe were very close, and when she died I was lost for a while. I took some time off from teaching to mourn and when I began to get restless, a friend suggested I live my life in a way to honor my mom. This amazing advice caused me to remember some words I\u2019d heard from mom my whole life: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t figure out what to do with yourself, do something for someone else.\u201d  Remembering those words led me to college admissions help and ultimately here with you. Thus my user name is in large part in honor of her. \n\nMore great life advice from my mom:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the perfect get in the way of the good.\u201d (Originally from Voltaire I think)\n\nAnd\n\n\u201cThe squeaky wheel gets the grease. Don\u2019t ever be afraid to speak up for yourself or be your own best advocate.\u201d\n\nNow, go hug your real life mamas and tell them you love them.  And for those of you who have experienced the loss of your mom, I know today might be hard for you. Just know that your memories of them will always be with you.  May their memories be your blessing. \n\nMuch love to my a2c fam. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99",

Two years ago, I was homeless and on my own, overwhelmingly depressed, and in absolute terror of just perpetuating the cycle of poverty and addiction that each member of my family had fallen into before. I went to a high school with no resources for college application help and a 49% graduation rate, and I can honestly say that you were my only advisor for a couple of years. Thanks to advice from you and a few other fantastic people on this subreddit, I\u2019m about to finish my first year at Cornell University on a full scholarship with a 4.15 GPA. There are still bumps in the road ahead, and they\u2019re likely to become very apparent when I\u2019m moving as fast as I am, but you\u2019ve been one of the few people who have helped me to navigate the world when I felt blind. Thank you for embodying everything that your mother was... you\u2019ve had a greater impact on me, some random homeless kid from Texas who you\u2019ve never met, than my own mother ever has. I know I\u2019m not alone when I say that I\u2019m forever in debt to you for your compassion, knowledge, and willingness to help those who are lost. You truly are one of the people who makes this world worth living in. Happy Mother\u2019s Day from New York.",

I apologize if my comments have been a bit long and sappy, but I just really wanted to take this opportunity to thank you, on the behalf of every kid who came from nothing, for believing in us and pushing us to do great things. My calculus teacher in high school told me that I was better off buying lottery tickets than applying to an Ivy League university. You helped me to prove her and everyone else wrong, without the expectation of anything in return. Society grows when people like you plant trees under whose shade they know they shall never sit. I know it might be hard for you to feel the effect that your work has had, due to the fact that you help us remotely and anonymously, but I assure you that your efforts are not lost on this community.",

Here\u2019s the text: \n\nMaybe admissions didn't go your way this year? Or maybe you're a junior freaking out when you see how admissions has gone for seniors?\u2063\u2800\n\u2063\u2800\nOne of my favorite redditors, a very wise former admissions counselor says to think about college acceptances like trying to put scoops of ice cream on your ice cream cone. Every college has an ice cream cone to fill with students, and they have many favorite flavors. Sometimes you just can\u2019t fit all your favorite flavors on your cone, so you have to make a decision. That decision is not a reflection on the mint chocolate chip or rocky road or cookies and cream you didn\u2019t choose. You\u2019d probably choose them next time. It is what it is. There simply wasn\u2019t enough space. \u2063\u2800\nThere are just too many yummy flavors to fit on one cone. (this is why SureFire Safety Schools are an essential part of your list!!! What\u2019s a SureFire Safety School, you ask? Ahhhhh. Stay tuned!! \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udd25)\u2800",
