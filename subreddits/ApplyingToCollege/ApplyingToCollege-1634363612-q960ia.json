      "text": "Assuming you\u2019re just a legacy and not a mega-donor child, you have to still be a competitive applicant - AOs typically claim legacy is just used as a \u201ctiebreaker.\u201d About a quarter of legacies get admitted, which is about 5x the 5% normal acceptance rate, but when you consider that legacies have smart genes/home environments and likely more wealth (and thus access to things like private school, test prep, college counselors, extracurriculars, etc.) it doesn\u2019t seem crazy to think their average stats might really be higher. That data isn\u2019t published, however, so we can only speculate.",

It doesn't need to be as strong as a non-legacy applicant's.\n\n>How much of a boost is it?\n\nDecent.",

Look at old press releases - if the legacy admit rate has declined at the school remember that decline has occurred most amongst those with run-of-the-mill parents. Children of major donors or volunteers still get a major boost; children of others not so much.",
