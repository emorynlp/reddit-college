  "text": "Many of my EA schools need an english language supplement from students from non english speaking countries. I haven't taken these tests yet and cannot until November 5, and the results for those are 10-15 days later. So i cannot submit my english language test results by the EA deadline. \n\nI have a studied in the English medium since 2008. I have a 760 EBRW sat score and scored 95% in my 2020 english board exams. Is there any way I can ask for a waiver on the english language requirements? It's not just about the time constraints, this shit's expensive too!",
