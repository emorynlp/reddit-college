      "text": "Don\u2019t miss class. It shows your recruiter you can prioritize. If you can\u2019t find somewhere on campus or near your school where you can land in a quiet spot, your car with a good pair of earphones/pods works.\n\nJust be honest. Address it directly by saying something like, \u2018I apologize for having to do this from my vehicle but I have class today and had to adjust as much as I could.\u2019\n\nWill show a desire to not miss the opportunity, while conveying your commitment to your education. If you don\u2019t get the job you miss on the class.\n\nPlus, do you really want to work for a place that\u2019s going to make you put your development on hold because of formalities?\n\nCOVID changed the remote perspective, so an interview in this setting should not surprise or even put off a professional recruiter or hiring manager. Just look sharp and put your best virtual foot forward!\n\nGood luck!",
