I feel as if my application wasn\u2019t that great, so I\u2019m currently looking to apply to more colleges as a fallback. Preferably schools that have high acceptance rates to ease my anxiety.\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate any advice. :)",

      "text": "San Diego State comes to mind, but I just checked and they're only accepting 37% so maybe not that safe after all.  If your SAT is 1300+ then your odds are much, much better.\n\nAlternately, there are some large public campus near-ish to California you could likely be admitted to, but that would be more expensive (unless you get significant merit aid).  Washington State, Oregon, Oregon State, Utah, Arizona, Arizona State.",
