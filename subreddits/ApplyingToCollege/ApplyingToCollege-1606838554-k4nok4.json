I\u2019ve got good letters of rec, Meh grades and no test scores, and basically no options to get out of here besides college. Yeah, 1st quarter grades for senior year were As and Bs, but early deadline/early action probably aren\u2019t gonna be making their decision in the next month and a half with grades I\u2019ll have in may. \nI managed to keep most of the cynicism out of my essays, so I\u2019m confident that the good essay and good letters of rec might be enough to get a foot in the door",

For me I\u2019ve always had good grades but they took a lot of effort to get but now with online, I have even better grades with way less effort. I know my course load is easier than previous years (i killed myself junior year and took 5 APs- I would not have survived that if not for the changes they made to AP tests) but even accounting for that this year has been easy. So I\u2019m just wondering, why do you think it is that you find online school difficult? Is it bad teachers, lack of drive, course load, stress related? Like I said i\u2019m not trying to be rude but I\u2019m curious to know what the reason behind this largely common view of online school is. Who knows, maybe I lucked tf out and just have amazing teachers. Idk, maybe i\u2019m lucky and the fact that I just can\u2019t let myself slack off has helped but I truly don\u2019t know and I want to know",
