  "text": "college freshman here! i remembered this existed and i came back to see a bunch of stressed out probably sleep deprived high school seniors comparing themselves to others too much and worrying about where they're at in the process when this journey is their own and no one elses.\n\napply ED if you want to! or don't if you're not super sure! write a dozen shit drafts of your common app, put it off to the last minute, ask all your friends and family for help, or keep every word of it to yourself! if you can and would feel better taking the ACT/SAT again, do it (and get a good nights sleep, studying can only take a tired mind so far), if you want to go test optional, do it and don't worry about the people who don't. do what you need to do to feel the best about your college application process\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou'll find many people whose experiences you can relate to and many that you can't. at the end of the day, this process is your own and you'll only make yourself feel worse comparing your progress or qualifications or scores to others over and over and over again\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand be yourself! colleges want to see you, not someone else you're trying to be, or someone who's just trying to check off boxes of what you think that college wants to see. be proud of your interests and hobbies, even if they have nothing to do with your major! show personality in your essays, be honest in your interviews, and don't try to fit yourself into some mold of what you think someone would want\n\nyou're in the thick of it now, but I promise it'll all be fine. once apps are done you'll be another little ball of stress waiting for decisions, and when those come out, the arguably even more stressful decision making process will be upon you and before you know it, it's summer and you're done with senior year. so try to enjoy yourselves as much as you can. have fun with your friends and stop comparing yourselves to them, revel in the fact that your school events are only happening for you one last time, do the things you want to do in your hometown before home becomes a place you only see a few times a year.\n\nI know how you feel, and I want you to know it gets better, but don't just wait until it does, try to enjoy your last year of high school too < 3\n\nas for me, the college i go to now is one i hardly considered before admissions, and I applied to almost on a whim. I didn't seriously consider it until after I was accepted and I learned more about it (and the Cost), but out of all my options, I do believe it was the best for me. admissions saw my app and thought I would be a good fit, and here I am, at a campus i genuinely love and an academic environment that i can keep up with while still being challenged\n\nso i promise it will work out, and maybe not in the way you expected it to. all of your hard work will be worth it, but please remember that this is your journey and no one elses, and to enjoy your time in highschool while you still have it ! < 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck out there guys!! i promise none of this will matter in a year and you'll be somewhere, whether your dream school or something you never could have planned",
