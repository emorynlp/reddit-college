I have League of Legends and Hell\u2019s Kitchen and even Reddit on my interests block. It makes you more human and you\u2019ll really never know who identifies with you! I\u2019ve had my interests brought up in interviews before.\n\nBut yeah specifically regarding A2C, I\u2019ve mentioned that I\u2019m active(and you can see so in my post history) on subs that help foster growth on Reddit. I always tie it into my work spiel because I was a manager at 17 and I\u2019m an undergrad student but I worked full time in Silicon Valley for a year training my own interns, so I talk about my leadership and mentoring experience and I tie it together with how I also do it on Reddit in my free time and how I used to coach LoL as well.\n\nWorks well enough for me. I\u2019m heading into an internship that pays an ass-ton of money, but the military also helped me land that one.",
