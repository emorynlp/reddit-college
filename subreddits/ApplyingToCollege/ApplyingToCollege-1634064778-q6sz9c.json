  "title:": "Kinda worried about the \" My bully got into a t20 and now I should tell my counselor or inform the admissions office of what they did\" posts.",
  "text": "I've been reading A2C for a while and am even on the discord, and during the last admissions cycle I saw a lot of posts about their bully or hater getting into their dream school. Most of those posts were made under the rant or emotional support flair, but people in the comments were encouraging OPs to tell admissions offices of what the Bully did. \n\nI see no problem with actually telling the admissions office what happened, so they could prevent that person from bullying more people in the university, as long as you are telling the truth.\n\nBecause if you're not telling the truth, and the person you are accusing didn't do anything bad to you, and you are just doing this to get off the waitlist...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen you are an evil person, and I hope you rot in hell.",

If it\u2019s important enough, that seems like the correct thing to do. Especially if additional laws are being broken. It seems insincere/weak to report this to the AO.",

              "text": "I agree that high schools don\u2019t take this seriously enough, but if the high school does nothing and both parties attend, they could presumably investigate. What is an AO (who doesn\u2019t know either party beyond a paper application) supposed to do?  It\u2019s a horrible idea.\n\nPeople either need have the guts to go toe to toe where they are with the accusations or they need to gather enough corroborating stories/evidence on the record to force the school to do something. \n\nBut you don\u2019t cry to strangers in an admissions office with one party\u2019s anecdotal allegation. If it\u2019s important enough to protect the safety of future potential targets, then it\u2019s important enough to deal with it in the way I described above.",

And then there was the whole Nicholas Zhao case\n\nHell there was a guy in the same year of HS I was who pulled a knife on another classmate and he was still cleared to attend a T50 engineering school he was accepted to. He somehow got himself expelled a year later by bringing a gun to campus but you basically have to go to that extent to have any action taken against you, even then it was the police who had to force the school to expel him and allow him to get booked\n\n20-30% of women report getting sexually harassed or assaulted at the T20 I attend.\n\nThese reports go nowhere at any school, the only way for anyone to protect themselves is to stay secretive and avoid the offending parties because all allegations, no matter how factual, are seen as pettiness and will only ding the accuser harshly",
