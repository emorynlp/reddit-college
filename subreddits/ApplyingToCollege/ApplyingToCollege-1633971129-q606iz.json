      "text": "You should be fine to change it this early. If you leave all the other schools on and resubmit with the school you've added as well they'll get a copy of the new FAFSA as well as your original, but it shouldn't negatively affect anything. Most states and colleges go off of original submission date for deadlines anyway.",
