  "text": "The last 4 years have been horrible on my mental health because of how competitive college admissions are. It's been a constant rat race to the top, and I'm glad that once I submit the rest of my regular decision apps, it will be finally over. People who attend competitive highschools understand what Im talking about when I say that the passive aggressiveness and snobbiness over grades/stats can become extremely stressfull and draining. I honestly don't care if I get into my ED school, Im just happy to get the process over with. I cant wait to cut loose.\n\n Anyone else feel the same?",

I've been on both sides of this coin- went to a competitive HS (2 of my CLASSMATES got HYPSMC), saw the subtle gaslighting that goes on there, and now in my job it's the opposite (to the point where I'm losing motivation to apply at all).\n\nI too want to be done with this and (soon to be) congrats from moving on from this dumb process!",
