  "text": "A little back story, i just finished my 12th grade so i basically have graduated and am waiting for my exam results in January.\nMy exam board is CAIE GCE A levels\nand in my 11th grade( AS/A1) I took Business, English, Economics and Math and got ABBC respectively in my Oct/Nov 2020 examinations.\n\nI finished my A2 exams in November and i took Business, Economics and Math.  I've begun my university applications for Canada and Australia.\nI need to give my Predicted scores because my results only come out by January 10th.\n\nSo today i got my Predicted scores and my teachers have inflated my grades and given me ALL As.\nNow i for sure hell know im not getting all A.\nI think i might get ABB or ABC.\n\nI don't know what to do because if i submit my really inflated grades and end up getting something shitty i definitely will get rejected.\n\nShould i wait for my actual results or should i go ahead with my Predicted scores and pray that I don't get rejected when my actual results don't match my predicted scores?",
