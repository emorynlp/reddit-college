  "text": "Ok so everything I need help with is in [here](https://imgur.com/a/hAQx3H2). That is a screenshot of the admission form, cropped because I don't want to be bullied for my 16 pornhub tabs. Anyway, I have no idea how to write a ''testimonial'' for my admission form, as in what am I even supposed to write in there?   \n\n\nAlso I've done no volunteer service or internship anywhere, do I just lie? They can't possibly confirm it. Or do I just come clean? That sounds like a bad idea tbh.  \n\n\nAlso also how do I tell them what I bring to the table that others don't? My drive? Strong motivation?Or do I boast about my academic skills and all that? \n\nNOT IMPORTANT:\n\n((Thank you. And whatever your religion may be, pray for me or just wish me luck, in my family there is no ''me'', I'm just a report card. And this year I wasn't that well as you can see from the MDCAT result. So things have been very hard at home for me, I haven't talked to any of my friends in more than a year, almost 2 now so we've kind of strayed away too. I can't enjoy my hobbies, gaming and driving either because they're a waste of time according to my parents, life is painful, I'd persevere but I see this same situation as far as I can see in my future. I can't just leave cause my parents spent so much time, effort and money on me, also my sisters would be left alone. idk man I wish I was born in another country to another family.))   \n\n\nTL;DR: Hi, what is a good testimonial for a medical college? Is it okay to lie about volunteerism and internship in an admission form? How do I get a college to accept me? [look at this](https://imgur.com/a/hAQx3H2)",

      "text": "Hi honey! <3 Basically a testimonial (i\u2019m pretty sure-) is when someone endorses you and speaks about why you should be accepted. I\u2019m 90% sure it\u2019s similar to a letter of recommendation (which is something I got for my own admissions process.) It is someone who can comment on your academic abilities and verify that your qualifications / show why you\u2019re impressive. \n\nAlso volunteerism can come in many forms, however if you haven\u2019t done anything don\u2019t lie since it can possibly come back to bite you later. (That\u2019s in my own opinion. I haven\u2019t done much volunteering either other then back when I did church food drives so I\u2019m in the same boat.) \n\nYour personal statement is basically what we consider a college essay, where you talk more about yourself as an individual and how you\u2019d be a great addition to the university. Talk about why this is important to you, why you\u2019re going here, why this is an essential step for your future. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re sending in your transcript so you wouldn\u2019t need to talk about academics since it\u2019s reflected in your grade. This is more about the type of person you are and why you\u2019d make a great fit at their school. \n\nIm working on all of this stuff for my own applications, so let me know if you need any help! You\u2019ve got this love, I\u2019m praying for you!! <33 I\u2019m wishing you so much luck, your hard work will pay off. Remember i\u2019m so damn proud of you! \ud83d\udc9c",

          "text": "Well shit I'm one week late, also I haven't been this happy reading a message in a while lol, thank you for that. I probably should've stuck around to read the responses now that I think about it, anyway I did manage to come up with something, I'll send it to you on discord.   \nOn another note, things have been pretty stressful at my place, when a little under 200,000 candidates are applying for like 5000 seats that's what happens I suppose. Just hoping my name is included in the merit lists come November. Been applying to colleges left and right, hope all this pays off in the end, been missing you a lot too.",
