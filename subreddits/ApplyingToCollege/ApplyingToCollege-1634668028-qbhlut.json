  "text": "Ok so everything I need help with is in [here](https://imgur.com/a/hAQx3H2). That is a screenshot of the admission form, cropped because I don't want to be bullied for my 16 pornhub tabs. Anyway, I have no idea how to write a ''testimonial'' for my admission form, as in what am I even supposed to write in there?   \n\n\nAlso I've done no volunteer service or internship anywhere, do I just lie? They can't possibly confirm it. Or do I just come clean? That sounds like a bad idea tbh.  \n\n\nAlso also how do I tell them what I bring to the table that others don't? My drive? Strong motivation?Or do I boast about my academic skills and all that? \n\nNOT IMPORTANT:\n\n((Thank you. And whatever your religion may be, pray for me or just wish me luck, in my family there is no ''me'', I'm just a report card. And this year I wasn't that well as you can see from the MDCAT result. So things have been very hard at home for me, I haven't talked to any of my friends in more than a year, almost 2 now so we've kind of strayed away too. I can't enjoy my hobbies, gaming and driving either because they're a waste of time according to my parents, life is painful, I'd persevere but I see this same situation as far as I can see in my future. I can't just leave cause my parents spent so much time, effort and money on me, also my sisters would be left alone. idk man I wish I was born in another country to another family.))   \n\n\nTL;DR: Hi, what is a good testimonial for a medical college? Is it okay to lie about volunteerism and internship in an admission form? How do I get a college to accept me? [look at this](https://imgur.com/a/hAQx3H2)",
