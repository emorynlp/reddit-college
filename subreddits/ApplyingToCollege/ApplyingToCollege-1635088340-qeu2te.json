      "text": "before anything, you gotta get something down on the paper - no matter how shitty it is, you cant edit a blank page. go with whatever works for you, whether it is sporadically bullet pointing your ideas, or leaping in with full sentences, etc. \n\nwhat you might find it that you dont even need your intro after all. i started a lot of my supplementals with mini intros, but found that they were unecessary, and that getting straight to the point gave me more room to talk about the important things.\n\ngood luck!",
