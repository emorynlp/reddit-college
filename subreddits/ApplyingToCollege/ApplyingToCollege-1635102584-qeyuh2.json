  "text": "so my dad recently found out what my classmates \"moral\" of his personal essay is and thinks its really good. now he's on my ass about having an \"impact\" in my personal essay and that mine doesn't have one. he keeps comparing me to my friend and saying that ill never get into my dream school scea. should i just rewrite the ending of my personal essay so it has a moral about who i am?? or should i just leave it, cause i personally liked my essay?",
