  "text": "Heyo! I know that I''m starting on my personal essay wayy too late but I haven't been able to settle on a solid topic to write about for months now.\n\nI want to talk about how racism in my small southern town was so normalized that I didn't even realize that I was experiencing it until about sophomore year, and how that has affected my past perception of myself along with what I've done (and will continue to do) to overcome the internalized racism I have against myself.\n\nOr,, I want to talk about how both racism in my town and the rise of the fetishization of koreans due to  Kpop (and more recently Squid Games) have impacted how I perceieve myself as an Asian American in negative ways and how I've fought to break out of the negative mindset I've always had towards my identity.\n\nI feel like these would be my strongest essay topics because I have so much to talk about in reguards to them and I've personally put a lot of time into myself and correcting my internalized racism, but I've been told that talking about trauma can be a super iffy topic and I'm scared that talking about racism is too cliche or that I might come off as if I'm victimizing myself/asking for pity.\n\nIdk I might be overthinging this but I want some outside opinions. Critiques of the topics are encouraged!\n\nEdit: don't mind the typo in the title lmao",

I kinda like the topic fetishization of Korean culture - I haven\u2019t heard that perspective before and the squid games thing on top of Kpop makes it current. It\u2019s really where you take it.",
