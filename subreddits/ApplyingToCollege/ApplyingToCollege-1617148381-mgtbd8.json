  "text": "before the results came out: \u201cUSC is a great school! It\u2019s definitely on the rise since the time I applied. They\u2019ve got a lot of money invested into their programs, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re on the same level as Stanford in 10 years.\u201d\n\nafter i told him about my rejection: \u201cUSC? More like University of Spoiled Children. Lots of rich kids at that school. They didn\u2019t deserve you. I like [insert school i got into] more anyway!\u201d\n\nmeanwhile, i didn\u2019t even have a reaction while reading those first words of rejection on my portal (just kind of like Oh? Ok). It\u2019s funny how our parents will completely switch their opinion on a school depending on if we get in or not. Grateful towards my dad for trying his best to comfort me :\u2019)\n\nanyways, congrats to the people who got in!!! and to those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019re in this together \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14",

There are several people who call out the ideology of going to this or that \u201cgreat\u201d school. All too often, we get wrapped up in \u201cthis school is the best, this school is better than this or that school\u201d but what/who makes up these rankings? It\u2019s a rather subjective list (USC is actually ranked 24 according US News). Don\u2019t get me wrong USC is a good school, but there are many like it. What was your reasoning for wanting to go to USC vs.\u2014 the other school you compared to\u2014Stanford (other than the obvious that it\u2019s more competitive)? If you want to go to a California school? There are hundreds (281 according to google). If you want to go to a west coast school? There are many more. There are 5300 (according to google) in the US. Why worry about one school?\n\nMoral of the story, it sucks not getting into the school you really wanted to get into, but it opens up other opportunities.",
