  "text": "I\u2019ve been grinding out essays so much this weekend, around 18 hours, but, nothing that I write is good. I\u2019ve got great stats, decent ECs, and going to have outstanding LORs but my writing is holding me back. I think I wrote around 5-6 full essays and scrapped them all. My writing is just so formulaic and I don\u2019t know what to do. Anyone run into the same roadblocks and have any ideas on how to overcome them?",

      "text": "What sounds bad to you might sound good to others. Recover all your drafts, and ask for a session with a friend or you English teacher. Show them all your essays, ask them for tips or maybe which essay is the strongest, both in terms of idea and writing. Progress from there. Keep a list of all ideas, anecdotes, etc. Keep the essays too, don't delete them. Stuff that you have already put down on paper is valuable, and could be used for other supplemental essay or other things.",
