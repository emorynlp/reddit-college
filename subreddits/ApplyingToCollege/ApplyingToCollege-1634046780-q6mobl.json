      "text": "You seem to be doing great on your EC already.  I'd probably just lean into what you're already doing and shoot for BETTER rather than MORE.  That is, instead of finding more EC, I'd suggest you look for more responsibility or success in what you're already doing.   If you really feel the need to add a new area, I'd look for some writing-based EC for breadth, but only if you think you can be successful at it.  Adding more purely for the sake of having a longer list is for fools.",
