Eg Wisconsin\u2019s specific Econ with Mathematical Emphasis degree, Penn\u2019s specific Mathematical Economics degree, etc. There are others.",

          "text": "This is correct and probably the best answer. Many (but not all) econ and finance programs have worked hard to get official STEM designation -- because it gives graduates an [additional 24 months of OPT](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt) (optional practical training = working under an F-1 visa) [in addition to the 12 months everyone else gets](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students). (Just make sure your internships get done under CPT.) \n\nAlso... the NSF does award grants for econometric+game theoretic research (MPS directorate, DMS division) as well as some economic research (SBE directorate, SES division). So I'd say some of economics is legitimately STEM.",
