  "title:": "Discussing the effectiveness of the death penalty in a supplemental (TW)",
  "text": "So for the Reed college supplemental (basically what topic would you teach your peers if you have the opportunity to) I wanted to discuss the death penalty (specifically in the context of sexual assault) as this is an issue I've studied extensively for debates and it's something very relevant in my country right now due to recent wide-spread anti-rape protests. It's important to me for other personal reasons as well. I know quite a bit about this but I was wondering if it would be a good topic to explore or if it would be risky.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a polarizing issue. Unless you\u2019re discussing that there is a debate without choosing a side (like, analyzing how people interact with each other), or providing your anecdote without absolutism about the issue, it\u2019s a bad idea. Imagine if your AO is of the opposite opinion.",
