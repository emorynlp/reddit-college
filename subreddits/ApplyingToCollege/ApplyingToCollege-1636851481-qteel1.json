      "text": "Yes you are absolutely underestimating yourself. I\u2019m sure you would have some decent odds at getting into at least 1 T10. I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet, but definitely apply to some more \u201creaches.\u201d I would ponder applying test-optional but that isn\u2019t my department of expertise.",
