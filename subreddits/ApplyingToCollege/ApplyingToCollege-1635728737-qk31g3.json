  "text": "Background: intend on studying Electrical engineering\n\n(Assuming a proficient essay for hypothetical purposes)\n\nI have many EC's mostly STEM. Band too. Leadership roles in all Ecs. Also i heard work experience looks good.. i was a supervisor at a food service place with a key to the store at 16. Also i heard publication looks amazing -- i was interviewed and featured in a magazine for inspiring others with my tech designs in which i reached millions of people---. Context: designed many electronics projects and posted them. Magazine acknowleged it and reached out to me. Etc.\n\nSo... im just curious if this 'looks good' is this totally unnecessary. Should i be set to apply to u of m (ik its impossible to say for sure) can i be satisfied with my 4.0, AP + Honors, 1400 SAT? I have 1 solid year left and want to strive for somewhere prestigious: gatech, umich, etc.",
