  "text": "How do people even get crazy letters of recommendation? I'm class president, love to talk to my teachers after class, excel in there courses and demonstrate my knowledge outside of school as well, yet my teacher called me \"noteworthy\" in the context of my school, like wtf?  \n\n\nAnd my language teacher literally said to my face he'd use a pre-written letter of recommendation. Like come on? 3 years and that's all you could do for me?   \n\n\nSorry for my rant but I'm so frickin mad rn",

If admissions officers see something like that, they will become skeptical because it's not uncommon for students to write their own letters of rec.

That\u2019s not at all true. How the hell would institutions like Harvard even function without the noteworthy students from average schools? The students from average schools are the ones that make up most of the school. Do you think everyone attending the Ivy League went to schools like Philips Exeter? Also, I want to contest that there\u2019s really nothing implied by Ivy League material. All it takes is luck and being placed in the right situations in your life to be an ivy student. You could\u2019ve been an Ivy League student if you had attended a different school in your area, maybe a below average one? You could\u2019ve been an average student compared to the entire country, but since you were so noteworthy in your below average school, you have both good grades and maybe a few teachers who like you enough for not causing any trouble and being a good student to write you a good letter. It doesn\u2019t matter the smarts you have, these ivy institutions carry all levels and types of smart.",

All I consider is their academic success in my course and what it says about their potential future success in subsequent programs. \n\nThe teachers who agree to write you a letter of recommendation are agreeing to do you a favor, almost always on their time off. You're not entitled to a recommendations period let alone whatever you deem to be an amazing recommendation. You are making a request and the appropriate response to those who grant your request is gratitude for their time and consideration.",
