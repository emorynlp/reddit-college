  "text": "How do people even get crazy letters of recommendation? I'm class president, love to talk to my teachers after class, excel in there courses and demonstrate my knowledge outside of school as well, yet my teacher called me \"noteworthy\" in the context of my school, like wtf?  \n\n\nAnd my language teacher literally said to my face he'd use a pre-written letter of recommendation.
