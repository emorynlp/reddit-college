  "text": "So the supplemental essays of Colorado College include one essay about extra curricular, one \"Why Us?\", and 6 optional supplemental essays, out of which 3 need to be done right? Or is it 3 out of 4? And the other 2 are required? Because the first 4 have a mentioned word limit of 75 words but the last two have no such word limit. I am applying through the Coalition App.",
