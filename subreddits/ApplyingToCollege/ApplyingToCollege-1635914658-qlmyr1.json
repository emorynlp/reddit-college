  "text": "I already submitted my apps but I found out I may have lowballed my self on the hours per week. How much do you think that matters? or do you think college will care more about the actual participation. For example I was VP of model un and I said 2.5 hrs a week but In reality it could have been like 4.\n\nI might just be overthinking it but I feel like a really undersold myself on all the activities.",

      "text": "I honestly have this same question. All my apps are submitted, but mine totaled out to around 30 hours a week including my job. But in reality, that\u2019s actually LESS than the amount of time I\u2019m spending. My parents made me lower some hour counts Bc they thought it seemed unrealistic but I have the schedules and hour counts to prove it.",
