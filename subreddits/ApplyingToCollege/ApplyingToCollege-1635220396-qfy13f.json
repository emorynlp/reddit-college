  "text": "NOT ASKING FOR ADVICE JUST RANTING\n\nI've been researching the college process for around 3-4 years now and so when I finally get all of my ducks in a row, college applications, there comes the big hurdle: financial aid. My family is fairly wealthy but of course middle class so we all know how that goes. Anyways, my dad is the main financial caretaker and I try so hard to just speak with him about financing my education etc and he just doesn't even seem to care in the slightest lol. Try asking during dinner, when he isn't busy, when he's just chilling. Either get yelled at or ignored. It's like he actively CHOOSES to not give a shit about my future of well-being. i asked if he'd be willing to cosign on a loan if that's what it came to and he just tells me to \"stop worrying about the stupid shit\" ...so my genuine concern for my future is stupid? and what irks me the most is that my mom says one thing and my dad says another. It so frustrating and makes this process 2000x harder than it needs to be. i wish they were just on the same page, and i wish they would talk about it together like mature adults. this process is already isolating enough as it is so it just sucks feeling even more alone by your own parents--the people who are supposed to be your main support system.",
