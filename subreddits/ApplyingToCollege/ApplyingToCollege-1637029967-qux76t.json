  "text": "Even if you have the best stats, perfect grades, perfect scores, it means jack shit if you don't have ec's, connections, and money, especially money. \n\nWhen I was young, my parents would always hammer me to get good grades. So I did. Top of my classes, regularly aced tests, took a bit too many AP classes, etc. But come junior year, I realize that none of that mattered. Because I focused so much on school, I didn't make any connections with teachers, had no friends, never socialized. So now I have mediocre letter of recs, no leadership because I wasn't popular, and have mediocre ec's that definitely aren't hooks. And I can't do somethings especially because my family isn't wealthy enough, but we also aren't poor enough for financial aid. I'm stuck and I don't know how to get out. \n\nAnd what's going to come of all of this? A wasted highschool career filled with stress and anxiety, dissapointed parents, and a sense of inferiority. \n\nTLDR: Stats don't matter. They're a prerequisite. Go cure cancer and marry Bill Gates.",

      "text": "\\-Your stats matter a lot, actually! It's only at a tiny minority of the most prestigious schools in the United States where stellar grades/scores are considered \"prerequisite\" rather than \"a strong plus that sets you apart from most of your fellow applicants.\"\n\n\\-A profile with great ECs but average grades is generally considered \"worse\" than one with great numbers but mediocre ECs (though both are enough to go to college somewhere.)\n\n\\-Trying to find happiness in ECs that look good can sometimes just result in increased stress. So in terms of enjoying school more, I recommend chilling out a bit academically, doing nothing basically, chatting with people, figuring out what you like.\n\n\\-Letters of rec can be improved by getting to know teachers, but you can also just write thoughtful notes on what you would like them to cover in their recs. Teachers also won't ignore the fact that you're a good student who tries hard, especially if you participate in class and ask questions that express genuine interest in the subject they're teaching.\n\n\\-Leadership is honestly less big a deal than it looks. All the student council at my high school in my year went to mid-level state schools. For leadership to stand out it generally includes some degree of accomplishing something impressive with others, not just existing as a popular human.\n\n\\-Most ECs are some degree of mediocre because of how self-directed most are. Do you know what fraction of students have ECs strong enough that that's their main hook, as opposed to being part of a sought-after group, a legacy, a wealthy donor etc.? I don't either, but I think there have been estimates that it's like less than 5% who are the \"cancer-curing olympian\" types. Most students who get into prestigious schools are run-of-the-mill impressive and really lucky (or legacies/faculty kids/donors), not superstars.\n\n\\-Your scores will probably be enough for you to be offered a chunk of merit aid at true safeties, which I'm sure your parents would appreciate! Reaches are tough for anyone and targets tend to offer less aid, which is definitely a challenging position to be in financially, but not unusual. Finances play such a large part in the application process that viewing it as a meritocracy where anyone middle class to wealthy is in the same boat is pretty misleading.",

          "text": "I think your idea of average ec's and grades might be slightly different than mine, no offense. For examples, I think a 3.98 GPA with 13 ap classes is mediocre while 17 ap's with 4.0 is good. Or that 1530 sat is mediocre and a 1570 is good. \n\nThe thing is is that I'm aiming for top schools so not only me, but also my parents have these types of expectations for me. So the ec's I have are mediocre because of the expectations put on me while they might be amazing for someone with less expectations on their shoulders.\n\nSo an \"average stats\" with excellent ec's profile would indeed be better than my \"idea\" of average ec's with good stats. \n\nBut I do agree with a lot of your points, especially that financial aid at targets is going to actually going to **** me lol.",
