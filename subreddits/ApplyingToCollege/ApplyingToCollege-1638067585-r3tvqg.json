      "text": "From an upper middle class person who scored a 1600 on the SAT... I always get asked, \"How?\" \"What prep materials?\" \"Any tips?\"\n\nYeah, I have a tip. Have highly educated parents and be privileged to go to a daycare to start learning basic things from an extremely young age, so that you're already ahead by the time you get to elementary school. Be provided with all the materials you need to succeed (healthy family life, computers, books, stable internet, food, shelter, clothing, luxuries to help destress.) I also went to school in one of the best public school systems in my state (maybe even the country) and had supportive, knowledgeable teachers. It helps you start higher. I'm not saying that nobody who is lower income or didn't have these privileges can't do well, but I started at a 1450. A fucking 1450. All I did was add 150 points to my score, much like a person who goes from an 1100 to a 1250. No, I never had tutoring, I never took prep courses, but I also didn't need to. I've been set up to succeed (just by the luck of being born to my amazing parents). \n\nSo given all these factors it should be no surprise that people from higher income families do better on standardized tests. That being said, I'd still say that the SAT and ACT provide a more even playing field than extracurriculars and GPA since it's a (relatively) more even playing field and there are so many great free resources online. Definitely space to improve, but strictly removing them from admissions probably isn't the answer (although I'm biased since my SAT is the high point of my application!)",

The topic of discussion is test scores not extracurriculars, for example. Stop making assumptions because no one explicitly (or even implied for that matter) that the other factors of admisssons actually favor economically well off students.",
