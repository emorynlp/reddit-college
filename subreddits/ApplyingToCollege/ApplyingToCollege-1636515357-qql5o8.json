  "title:": "Wasn't aware of the whole \"mentioning other schools\" taboo in my Why [university] essay.",
  "text": "For my Why UChicago essay, my conclusion contained a brief mention of why UChicago was my top choice compared to the other options. I don't mention any specific schools, and the rest of my essay was devoid of any mention of other institutions. The context for my mention of other schools was how UChicago's fundamentally intellectual and curious student culture was a definitive factor in deciding between them and my other top schools. I obviously now know this to be a mistake, but is it gravely detrimental to my application as a whole?",

It is just a thing of kindness since top schools like to overlap on a lot and you don\u2019t want to be dunking on Yale because of the risk that the reader is a Yale alumni. If you compare it to other \u201ctop universities\u201d as a general grouping like R-1s then it doesn\u2019t really matter.",
