  "text": "I\u2019m applying to college and I just realized that four schools have received my free ACT Score report. I planned on going with my SAT Scores and never put much thought into my ACT and only attempted once. Needless to say, the ACT score was horrible but now it is sent to the colleges that i\u2019m applying to. My ACT is listed as official scores and my SAT score is only self reported. Will the college take into account my ACT Scores or just ignore them? Is it far too late to cancel the ACT Scores?",

I don\u2019t think that you can ask them to ignore the ACT score that is sent officially unless you change the application to test optional.",
