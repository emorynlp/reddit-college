Is it hard to transfer?\n\nDo my SAT still matter if I transfer from community College?\n\nDoes it mess with your social life if you are a 20 year old freshman among 18 year old freshman?\n\nI live in Maryland if it helps answer your questions.",

      "text": "I live in Maryland as well. It's not uncommon to transfer to 4 yr schools anywhere, just don't take highly specialized classes. Get your gen eds done. What you're doing is very smart, college is expensive, just stay focused and determined. Keep your mind not on the school you will transfer to but the classes you have now. Those classes are what allow you to transfer. Also, look up the SREB Academic Common Market. Maryland is a pretty small state and we are lacking in the opportunities of other states. The Academic Common Market can help by allowing you to pay in state tuition at some out of state schools throughout the SOUTH but only for majors not available in Maryland. It is only an agreement between south east schools. I'm majoring in forestry through it.\n\nEdit: The SAT can be sent in if you want but usually it doesn't matter in transfers if you have more than a year of credits. Your age doesn't matter, you'll have older students to be friends with anyway because you'll transfer in with gen eds done. You won't have to live in freshman dorms if you have about a years worth of credits, depending on where you're going.",

              "text": "Frankly, transferring credits is going to depend on a variety of factors. The biggest is where you want to transfer to. Simple things will likely always transfer, ENGL Comp 1 and 2, Statistics, American History etc. These are called 100 or 1000 level classes, versus 200/2000, 300/3000 etc. Just get your general education classes done and most, if not all, should transfer to most, if not all, schools.\n\n Your community college won't really matter, however, it will be a bit harder than if you were at a cc near the school you want to go to for you bachelors. What I mean is, for example, the University of Tennessee gives automatic scholarship money to people who have earned an associates in Tennessee community colleges. They will still accept your cc classes but it will be a bit harder because they won't be as familiar with them. You can communicate with the transfer department at whatever school you are interested in and they will help with this process. \n\nSomewhere on the universities site they will also probably provide a transfer equivalency table to look up how your credits will transfer yourself. If your cc isn't on there, then no one from your cc has transferred there yet so there is no frame of reference. You can communicate with the admissions or transfer department to get those classes evaluated. Save your syllabus from your classes just in case, download them in a pdf or something. \n\n**All of this is in the future and doesn't currently matter.** All that matters now is going to community college and earning credits. Don't brush off the experience of community college either. Your professors still have doctorates and still know what they're doing. A lot actually prefer teaching at community college because they have a passion for teaching rather than research. Your classmates are there to better themselves as well. I know, community college isn't as glorious as a huge out of state university but it's still valuable time and experience.",

              "text": "Which community college you go to doesn't matter that much, but if you were considering in-state public schools you can get some advantage by going to a CC that has a formal transfer program with where you might consider transferring. For example UMD [has this agreement](https://admissions.umd.edu/apply/admission-requirements/transfer-applicant-requirements/maryland-transfer-advantage-program) with 11 Maryland CC systems.\n\nHowever you can definitely transfer without going through a program like that. Also, if doing an out of state transfer, the admissions officers are 99% not going to care which CC (to be honest they probably don't know which CCs in some other random state are considered better or worse).\n\nBesides gen eds the only other thing I'd recommend is 1 or 2 intro courses with good grades on your transcript for your intended major (this is more important if applying to transfer into a more competitive major). For example comp sci transfer into a good program is a lot easier if your transcript shows an A in CS-101.",

You'll have best chance at your in state public college. Private colleges generally do not care where you are from, it only depends on how many transfers they take. \n\n2. No and many colleges won't accept it anyway for transfers. \n\n3. You're not a freshman if you transfer. You will transfer as a junior and you will not interact w/ freshman in general.  For this reason, you want to go to a school with a large transfer population (mostly public schools) where you have your own community.",

      "text": "I am working on my application right now as a transfer from a community college. I was in a similar situation, and I hope I can provide some useful insight! I\u2019m a student at a California Community College and I\u2019ll be transferring to the UCs, but I don\u2019t imagine it will be too different in another system.\n\n> Is it common for people to transfer from community College to an out of state uni? Is it hard to transfer?\n\nIt is pretty common to to go the CC route and then transfer. As for difficulty, private universities vary quite a bit. I\u2019ve noticed that in-state private schools are often easier to get into (such as John Hopkins if you end up at a CC) and they often have transfer agreements (I know Cornell does for NY community college students), but out of state private schools are much more difficult. \n\nOn the flip side, it will usually be much easier to transfer from CC to a 4 year if you are going to a public university in your state. The process is generally pretty streamlined (no standardized tests, lower standard for admission, etc.).\n\nI\u2019ve found [this](https://transferweb.com/stats/transfer-acceptance-rates/#.YYVjMRo8Lmo) table to be pretty useful. Keep in mind that the numbers are often inflated by in-state transfer agreements.\n\n> Do my SAT still matter if I transfer from community College?\n\nYou can include them if you want, but most people don\u2019t. Unless you did exceptionally well or you feel that it would fit your application better to include your tests, I wouldn\u2019t bother.\n\n> Does it mess with your social life if you are a 20 year old freshman among 18 year old freshman?\n\nMost transfers come in as Juniors (having spent their Freshman and Sophomore years at another school). I\u2019m a little less qualified to answer this, but public universities will usually try to group transfer students with other transfer students. There is a good chance you will have a dorm of purely transfer students.\n\nI hope this helped! Let me know if you have any other questions!",
