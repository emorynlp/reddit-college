  "text": "I have such a bad high school transcript that I am starting to doubt I'll get accepted to a any of the decent schools I plan to apply to. I literally have a 43/100 on math in the second semester in 10th grade, that is the lowest but I have many other scores close to that. I got a 1340 on the SAT and plan on taking it again next week, do you think I would stand a chance of acceptance if could manage to get a bit better on the SAT this time or am I doomed and should be considering community college instead ? \n\nnote: I've already graduated from HS , so there is nothing I can do about my transcript.",

      "text": "Yes, there will always be colleges that are likely to accept you whatever your status, and plenty will with 1340 (it's in something like the 90th percentile of test-takers). If you have your heart set on any you think you can't get into , a community college nearby/with an expedited transfer process to one of these schools is an option well worth looking into. Your college experience will be considered more important than HS for admissions purposes if you do. Whether or not you'll get into the schools on your list depends entirely on which ones they are. Good luck and I wish you success!",

Maybe you should get off of this sub for your own sake, because it seems to have given you a distorted view of how admissions actually operate given your scores. Yes you can get into college, and if you end up at community College it will be because of you choosing to be there given your circumstances.",
