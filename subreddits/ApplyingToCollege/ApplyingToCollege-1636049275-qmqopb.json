  "text": "I would love to study journalism in college if I were to get into a prestigious program and hope to some day work at the NYT or another big name publication. In general, what universities have the best undergraduate journalism programs? I know Northwestern and Mizzou are some of the best, but I\u2019m looking for some more options. \n\nAlso what about schools that don\u2019t offer journalism degrees but have really good English programs?",

Link to the most recent ones below, but I would look at multiple years - not focusing on specific ranking, but to get ideas of schools to look into.\n\nhttp://www.hearstawards.org/2021-hearst-intercollegiate-winners-announced/\n\nLots of good English programs - Iowa is a really good one if you want a big state school environment, but LACs like Kenyon and private universities like Emory can be excellent too.",
