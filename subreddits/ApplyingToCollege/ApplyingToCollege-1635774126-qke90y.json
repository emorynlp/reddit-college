  "text": "So I applied to MIT EA and they strongly recommend that you pick two LORs- one from STEM and one from Humanities/Language Arts. Now the issue is that my language arts teachers have been super inconsistent over the past two years with Covid-19 pushing us virtual and the fact that two of my teachers unfortunately passed away. I was able to submit a recommendation letter from my Computer Science (counts as a language credit at our school) teacher instead. So my two LORs ended up being from Computer Science and Physics. Is this okay?",
