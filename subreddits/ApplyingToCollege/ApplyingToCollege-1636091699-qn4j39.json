  "text": "im so done simping for uchicago and northwestern only to show my peers down. Only to show that I have evolved from that 7th grader who wore a hood over his head all day to someone who can get into a t10 university. I am done. I have a vision for the future, and I will achive it. The world is moving virtual and big frontiers are coming in social media and VR world. I am done with the ego bullshit. fuck EVERYONE. fuck bragging about my achievements to fuel my insecurity to my peers.\n\nI can still be extremely succesful by entering emerging industries through Berkeley. Probably more than old 1990s based places like Uchicago and NU (sorry, finance is stupid).\n\nIma just get my straight A's and hopefully the L&S CS thing is not out yet. I have strong enough ECs rn.\n\nill save the saved money from in state tuition and go to MBA or start a start up. or law but blech so 1990s. or not idk ",

              "text": "I'm from California & have an older brother who went to Cal.\n\nUC Berkeley is considered up there w/ Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and MIT esp in the Silicon Valley, save for some highly snobby pockets of rich ppl in Palo Alto and Cupertino who prestige-whore way too hard. It falls out of the T20 because a lot of the metrics USNews uses heavily favor private schools but it's readily considered a T10 school to a lay person who knows even the slightest thing about colleges in the US.\n\nIn addition it does command respect for being a public school whose mission is to serve the residents of California and consequently has estalished pipelines from CA HSs and community colleges in place to support such an objective, a stark contrast to top privates which seem more obsessed with maintaining their elite image through their stupidly low acceptance rates & heavy recruiting from rich prep schools (in contrast Cal recruits from all over California and is esp. attuned to SES disparities between regions). UCLA is commendable for the same reason\n\nT10 STEM programs across the board along with many T10 liberal arts programs as well, association with a top medical school (UCSF) and a location that gets more shit w.r.t safety than it deserves.\n\nClasses esp. in Engineering are also pedagogically sound and from what I've seen teach you far more than the equivalent courses at many lesser Engineering schools, so you receive a highly rigorous education. One of the UCs will literally waive 2 semesters of an intro CS course if you take CS 61A at UC Berkeley, and CS 70 is a combination of a Discrete Math class and a Probability course (comparing against CSE 240 and ESE 326 @ WashU, CS 70 not only covers the material in a shorter time frame but arguably does it better).\n\nAll top recruiters for basically any field have stations at Cal, including traditionally prestige-gatekeeping fields like quant, business, etc. If you're used to being highly independent and are willing to work your ass off / don't need your hand held like would happen at T20s & their higher resources/student allocation, Cal will open literally any door you can imagine, all for less than half the price of elite private schools if you're in-state. You and I go to WashU (a so-called T15) and having seen the types of recruiters who show up to Cal our recruitment / career fair gets BTFO'd and it is not even a contest.\n\nThe only good reasons someone would pick another top school over Cal as a California resident are 1) if they're pre-med and have money since med school admissions engage in a surprising amount of prestige-whoring + grade inflation and getting opportunities thrown at you is nice to have (this is is my situation, otherwise Cal no contest) 2) highly value a smaller environment and don't want to sweat nearly as hard as they did in HS or 3) didn't get into Cal",
