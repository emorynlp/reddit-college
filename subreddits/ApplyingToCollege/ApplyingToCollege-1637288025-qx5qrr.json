  "text": "So for context, my school is a public high school in NY.\n\nAbout 1/3 of all applicants to Cornell make it in (56/170 in the last 3 years)\n\nAbout 1/4 of all applicants to uPenn make it in (11/44 in the last 3 years)\n\nAbout 1/3 of all applicants to NYU make it in.\n\nIm just not sure because we have relatively few people who get into HYPSM (maybe 3 or 4 who get into any of them at all).\n\nthanks",

      "text": "\"Feeder\" isn't really a thing. We don't have lists of high schools that we are obligated or even encouraged to admit students from. Some schools have more resources, more \"hooked\" students, more awareness of our institutions, etc, so they have higher than average acceptance rates to particular schools, but those colleges could just as easily admit 0 students one year and admit everyone the next.",
