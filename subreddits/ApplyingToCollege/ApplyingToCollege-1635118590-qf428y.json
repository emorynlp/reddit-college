  "title:": "Should I self report a 4 on Physics C E&M",
  "text": "I'm filling out my self reported AP scores right now and was doing a bit of poking around and saw this: \" I only recommend that students self-report these scores if it can help them. If you are applying to highly selective colleges, they like to see 5s on AP exams. Getting a 4 is okay in their eyes, but I have been part of admissions committees where the student gets a 4, especially in a subject matter they plan to pursue, and that's enough of a reason for that student to be denied\" on a blog. I've taken 7 other exams and gotten 5s on all 7 of them including Physics C Mechanics, but what makes me skeptical is my intended major is Computer Engineering which sort of relates to Physics C E&M, which I got a 4 on, so should I still report that test or should I omit it?",
