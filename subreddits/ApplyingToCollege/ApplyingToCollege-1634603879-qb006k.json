  "text": "I\u2019ve built my application with a STRONG emphasis around business/Econ sustainability for the environment and how I hope to do something in that area. It\u2019s a real goal and interest of mine for the future, but none of my ECs really \u201cback it up\u201d since they\u2019re all just general business ECs. Would AOs think I\u2019m fabricating this interest to seem like a better person in my application? All of my recommenders are going to talk about that interest because that\u2019s what they know me for, if that helps at all. \nI hope I\u2019m just overthinking!",
