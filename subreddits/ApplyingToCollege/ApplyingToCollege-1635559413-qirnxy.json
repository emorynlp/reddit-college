  "text": "I haven't even started the supplements (especially the why UMich essay), so they'll probably be weak if I end up cramming them over the next two days. This is probably not a good situation for me to be in as a Virginia resident, because with a weak why UMich essay, it's more likely than not that they'd assume I'd go to UVA over UMich if I got into both. Also, I heard that they don't even read all of the EA applications and end up deferring a lot of people for that reason, so should I just go with RD instead? Does EA provide a significant advantage?",
