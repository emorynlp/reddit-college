  "text": "Using a burner email for obvious reasons. I applied for REA to a certain school and EA to a couple of schools. Turns out I am an idiot that does not do proper school research because one of these EA schools is a private university. I found out 4 days after submitting my application and immediately withdrew my application from this EA school's portal.\n\nThe EA school is not T30. I did not do anything else. The question is, could they find out and if they do, how fucked am I?",
