  "text": "So the deadline says October 15, does that mean we have until October 15 at 11:59 pm to work on the application or does that mean it needs to be done by 12 am the morning on the 15th. In simpler terms, do we have October 15th to work on the app? That was super confusing lol but if anyone understands me I\u2019d appreciate a response.",
