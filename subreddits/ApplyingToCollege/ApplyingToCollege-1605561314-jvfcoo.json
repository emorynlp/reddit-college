I\u2019ve got so much going on in my head about my career field, what\u2019s best for me, what I\u2019d enjoy, etc., that I haven\u2019t even applied anywhere yet (paralysis by analysis is slowly killing me). Just know that a negative attitude has never really helped anyone. You\u2019re allowed to reserve some time to have a nice cry or rant and release some bottled up stress, but you can\u2019t let it halt you. If you know what needs to be done, you\u2019re doing well, just get it done. If you have no idea, that\u2019s a little more difficult. Just try your best to figure it out... then get it done.",

I\u2019ll probably make a post more specifically about my situation soon. I really like your idea of finding what initially sparked my motivation, I think that could definitely prove helpful in my situation and many others. In short, I\u2019ve always loved animals and I decided in middle school that vet would be a good career path. Therefore, I may try to spend more time with animals for motivation. Thank you too.",

Knowing this your will never rush, and you submit with sparkling supplements and well-written applications much before the deadline, that will land you in your dream school, where you get to crush all learning goals for the next four years. Then, postponing such goals for the next 1.5 months will seem worth it!\n\nHave an awesome day.",
