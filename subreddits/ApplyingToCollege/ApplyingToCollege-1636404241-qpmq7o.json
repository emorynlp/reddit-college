      "text": "Just be yourself! The college picked you for your application, so clearly they like who you are. Now is your chance to literally put a face to that app. So be comfortable with who you are, act as you would in any other formal interaction, and have fun! Know your application well and be ready to speak to your activities and your personality, look up common interview questions so you have a sense of how your interviewer might ask about those things. And practice your answers with a friend or family member!",
