  "text": "I\u2019ve been so bombarded with college applications, homework, SAT/ACT prep recently that I have had absolutely no time to look for and apply for scholarships. It\u2019s also so hard when you don\u2019t know where you are going to get accepted into, so the idea of taking the time to apply for scholarships, get them, and not even be able to use them because they apply to a different state, school, etc. is disheartening. I tried to look to scholarships nearing the end of the summer but ultimately came up empty handed due to the aforementioned reasons. So to simply put it, will I still be able to apply for a large number of scholarships come roughly January 5th? Or should I try to cram as much in while I still can? Of course, the deadlines vary for each scholarship, but I am just looking for a broad idea on the average deadlines of them all, thanks so much!",

      "text": "The scholarships you're most likely to win are going to come from the schools you're actually applying to.  Two things to bear in mind:\n\n1. Most of them want you to apply during their EA period, or by a priority deadline, in order to be considered for all scholarships.\n2. A few of them have a \\*separate application\\* you must fill out in order to be considered for certain scholarships.",
