  "text": "Hi- I'm currently trying to fill out my honors for my CA/MIT Application. \n\nMy question is, what counts as an 'honor'? I know placing at a competition or receiving an award of some sort counts, but how about being selected for a really prestigious program? Being chosen to receive a grant (business related)? Nominated for an internship program at a really big company? \n\nIf they count, how would they be worded? I would love some tips and examples!",
