  "title:": "Is it worth applying to relatively low chance reach schools?",
  "text": "Hi, I'm a relatively average student, I do a lot of music like marching band, academic-related activities, and some leadership positions at my school but my ACT super scored is 27/28 and my GPA is 3.58 (Thanks Covid for bombing my sophomore year, that 3.4 stings), and I'm applying early to a couple of universities, but one of them I'm working on the hardest for whatever reason is the University of Michigan. I guess it's because they were the first university to send me a letter, and they've had sent letters fairly frequently and also have specific schools (LSA) send me letters. Yeah, I know that does sound like a long shot. I just want to ask is it really worth it for all the work for a university that is such a reach (Both economically and chances)? I have a couple of meetings with the school I plan on attending if I make it in and other things, mostly to help with the essay and to show I'm really interested in attending (Because I am) but the more I look at it the more it feels that I'm running into a brick wall, even if I choose not to submit my ACT. I'm also from Ohio, I don't think anyone the past couple of years has attended UMich, mostly because they fucking hate it (college rivalries, eh?)  The other 3 colleges I'm applying to are under UMich (OSU, Penn, UK) but are most likely easier to get into, so I don't really have too much to worry about if I don't make it in.\n\nIf you see this and respond, thank you so much!\n\nP.S: I don't know if they look at stats from your current year, but I'm currently taking Dual Enrollment courses at a local university because AP Lit gave me a very sexy 78 (weighted 88), plus I'm planning on majoring in History and my school doesn't offer much history.",

      "text": "The point of reach schools is that there\u2019s a small chance you get into them, but you like them enough to put in the effort to shoot your shot. If you like UMich, that can be your reach school. It\u2019s all good as long as you have some safeties you would be happy to attend as well.",
