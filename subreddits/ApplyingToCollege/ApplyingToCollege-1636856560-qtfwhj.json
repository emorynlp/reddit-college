  "text": "The prompt if for the UC application: \u201cBeyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California\u201d\n\nMy opening sentence was doing to be:\n\nThere\u2019s something you should know about me. I\u2019m a former child star.\n\nThe essay is about how I was on a kids travel show in middle school, and how it developed my curiosity, and my passion for culture and travel (I\u2019m a foreign affairs major). I will also mention something about how grateful I was for this opportunity, since I know this essay could come off as pretentious/snooty",
