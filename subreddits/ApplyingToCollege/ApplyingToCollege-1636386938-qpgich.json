  "text": "I've always had a huge passion for art so I thought I want something related to art/design. I told my mom when she asked me about the major I want to major on and that is what I told her and she looked down at me disappointed and said that I have no future. My mom wants me to major in something like Biology since I have higher grades on it than other subjects in school but I feel like I would hate it there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers told me that I should go for that since that is really what I truly like and I was always the artist but I am in constant fear that I would end up dysfunctional with no job. I wish I had passions that were actually useful for me.",

      "text": "There are all kinds of design majors out there. And biology on its own doesn\u2019t really lead to jobs unless you want to be in a lab or you want to go to med school. \n\nI suggest you consider applying to colleges that don\u2019t require you to set your major until sophomore year. That will give you some time to explore and find classes that interest you and maybe have some summer opportunities and jobs to explore what you might want to do.",
