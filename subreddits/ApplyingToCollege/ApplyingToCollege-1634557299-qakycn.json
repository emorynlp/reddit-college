  "text": "Hey, can someone please look through my essay  regarding the prompt of sexual orientation and gender identity given by Duke? I want to make sure I am adequately representing my feelings on the topic, but I am unsure whether that's being achieved by what I have written. If someone is willing to read it and give me tips or pointers on this, I would be really grateful.",
