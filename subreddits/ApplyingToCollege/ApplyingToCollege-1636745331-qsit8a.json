  "text": "At the time of application, AP students already have some AP scores on their transcripts, but IB students will only get their scores at the end of senior year. So they don\u2019t have any standardized tests (like AP students have) on their transcripts when applying for college. How do colleges gauge IB students since all they can see are their local school grades and all schools/teachers are not the same?",
