          "text": "I know; it doesn't help anyone's learning when our cameras are on. Like, at school, I can look at the teacher or look at my paper, and the teacher will know that I'm paying attention. But for online school, I feel like I always have to keep my eyes centered at the blinding webcam light, or else it will look like I'm looking at something else...I got so self-conscious about my every move; I even hesitate every time I need to sneeze, adjust my hair, drink a glass of water, or reach down to grab a notebook. It's such a distraction to constantly be thinking about how I'm seen on the camera; at the beginning of the year, my teacher told the class \"so if I see you looking toward the side like this, then I'll probably know that you're on your phone\".....smh, NO, I could even be looking at the teacher on the screen, but if I'm not directly looking at the webcam, it will look like I'm not paying attention...I was traumatized and so scared by this during first semester, and this is why by the end of the day, I would get so tired and not feel like doing my homework. At this point, eighty percent of my classmates have given up on turning on their cameras, probably because of similar reasons, and some of the teachers have realized that they can't do much about it. But there are still some teachers who accuse us of \"hiding behind the cameras\" and assume that we're not actively participating just because of that...\n\nBesides our own faces, it is also distracting to have everyone else's face constantly in your face. Sure, in real life, there are people, but classmates in real life at least don't seem to be looking directly at you. And even if we sometimes get to turn off our cameras, there are also other factors contributing to Zoom fatigue...like the fact that we have to stay unmuted in Breakout rooms, which can be stressful because my family often makes noises and uses the microwave during the school day, so I have to constantly be on alert to mute my microphone for a bit when someone is being loud, and then unmute it again, and then have to mute and unmute every minute or so. In real life, we can just talk about what we need to talk about to answer the question in as little or as much time as we need, and the teacher can obviously see that everyone is participating, and the teacher can gauge when everyone's done talking. However, in online Breakout rooms, you have to be talking and unmuted ALL THE TIME at the EXACT moment where the teacher happens to come into your Breakout room, and it can get awkward to have to keep unmuting and muting myself when my teacher is in the room if my family is making noise in the background.\n\n I have microwave phobia every time I hear someone use the microwave now because I associate it with getting kicked out of the Zoom class due to poor internet connection, sometimes when the teacher is saying something really interesting.\n\nThere are also the distractions of having to download everything-you have to go on the website and copy the pdf to Notability, and if you're Zooming on the computer while working/writing on the iPad, you may need to take an extra step to copy the link from the teacher's Zoom chat and email the link to yourself......not to mention that writing and drawing with an electronic pen  on Notability is slower than writing by hand (even if you type, there's the inconvenience of making boxes, waiting for them to pop up, and adjusting the size), but it's often the only way to get to work with an exact worksheet pdf that the teacher made. You can't print because the teacher usually posts the document on Canvas during class time, and you have no time to mess around and print because the lecture will then start right away. Plus, I would waste a lot of ink and paper. It would be a distraction either way.  \n\nOkay there's a lot about online school that is okay as well, but I'm ranting a lot here because the truth is that a lot about online school makes me tired, and I want you guys to all know that if you feel unmotivated right now, not all of it is necessarily your fault :) \n\nAs always, try your best to see any positive side to it and adapt!  :)",
