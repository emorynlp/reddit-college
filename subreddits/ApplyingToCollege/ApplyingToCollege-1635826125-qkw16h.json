Nearly every deadline in college admissions has a built-in grace period to accommodate all the weird random stuff that happens in life - natural disasters, system outages, power failures, credit card fumbles, etc.\n\nThat \"built-in\" part is important - it means that the system accepts applications automatically without any manual intervention, and often without even annotating that it was received late.  As can be said in other areas of life, do not presume upon grace.  But you also don't need to freak out over being a few minutes after the deadline.",
