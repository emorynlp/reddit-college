When you apply to UC, they ask you to submit the a-g course history and grades and they will automatically figure it out in their internal system. If you prefer to know your gpa separately, you can use the Roger Hub UC gpa calculator. All based on a-g courses. UCs will look at unweighted, UC weighted cap, and IC fully weighted gpa.",
