  "text": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m wondering if it is worth taking december SAT. I know a lot of schools are test optional or test blind but I will explain my situation.\n\nI took the SAT once before without studying at all and got 1290, so I believe I could do a lot better if I actually tried and studied. But is it too late?\n\nI heard some schools have a policy where the earlier you apply, the higher likelihood of scholarships/financial aid being awarded. And also some of my schools have RD deadlines prior to the score release of the next SAT, so I would like to hear your opinion on whether it\u2019s worth studying this time and retaking?",
