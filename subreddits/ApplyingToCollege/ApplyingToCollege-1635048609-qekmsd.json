  "text": "Well I think the title says it all. I think I want to major in International relations in college, and I have some ECs that are good in that field but I want more that are specific/good for it\n\nThese are not all my ECs, just the ones that are sorta related\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Door to Door campaigner for a campaign for town supervisor\n* Member of Model UN (Well see if we can get a leadership role senior)\n* Writer for school newspaper, focusing on International/history stuff\n* Writer for my own website focusing on Current events/history\n* Writer for another blog I down own but which is much larger focusing on, well guess\n* Head/Officer of a volunteering club in our school, that will probably do some world donation drives or something at some point this year\n* (I'll probably find a way to combine the writing ones when I actually apply.)\n\nSo anyway do you think this is enough (Like I said before, I have a lot I'm not listing, cause they are irrelevant to the post)? Also what recommendations do you have for other ones I could try?",
