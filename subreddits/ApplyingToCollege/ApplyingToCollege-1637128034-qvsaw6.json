You'll still be doing all the CS courses - the difference usually exists in which other core courses you'll need to take... From an employer point of view, it doesn't matter what the degree is called, as long as you possess the required skills.",

The main difference is that a BS allows you to specialize in a certain area for your prospective career, whereas a BA allows you to take electives in other subjects which could lead to a minor or a double major.\n\nSource: https://www.mydegreeguide.com/computer-science-ba-vs-bs/",

          "text": "Yes this! Also, as someone who had to make the choice: It depends on what your goals are. I'd certainly say try going for a B.A if your into design or arts or writing. However, if you are more technical, go for a B.S. Try looking for safety colleges (they exist I promise) with more specialized majors if you are looking for something specific! Like, a CS + Design or Software Engineering if that suites your fancy. Or something with a concetration pathway built into the degree.",
