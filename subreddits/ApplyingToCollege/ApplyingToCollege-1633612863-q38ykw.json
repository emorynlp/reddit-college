  "text": "Its that time of year again where seniors are narrowing down their application lists so I wanted to throw out a tip because no one seems to talk about it much. Consider the quality of the dining halls. \n\nA disclaimer: obviously this is just one factor and things like price and programs should all come first. \n\nBut, coming from a current student, the dining halls/meal swipe restaurants have a bigger effect on my day to day life than college prestige or building architecture or location or any of the other things I thought were important when choosing a college. \n\nA good meal after a hard class can boost your mood and a bad meal can ruin it. Its something that doesnt really get considered a lot but if your a foodie, look at a schools subreddit or instagram page and see what students say about the food. Its something worth considering when it comes down to decisions.",

I knew someone who went to Cornell and hated the food so much their parents had to send freeze-dried care packages regularly. \n\nI'd say access is something else to consider. Like maybe the dining halls are meh and there's no great restaurants directly on campus, but maybe there's a wide selection within walking distance.",

Do you have to eat in the cafeteria, or can you get a carry out meal if that fits your schedule better? Also for people with food restrictions, eating off the salad bar all the time gets old really fast. Some schools offer a food station that doesn't include the 9 most common food allergens. An international food station is a great option if you avoid meat or dairy.  Most freshmen will be required to live in a dorm, and pay for a meal plan. If you don't use it, and end up eating out a lot, you are wasting a lot of money. Eating in the dining hall is also part of the social life on a campus.",

When I did my college search last year, I didn't care about the campus food at all, as I was more focused on the campus vibe, student life and student opportunities. After picking which school to attend, I had no expectations on what to expect with campus dining. Thankfully, the college I attend rn (Purdue) sort of blew me away with campus dining, starting with the variety of food, from the generic burgers and pizza, to rotating international fares. There's also the option of dining in or take-out from the dining courts, which is nice if you don't want to eat in the dining court. Also, you can use your meal plan on various fast-food restaurants around campus, so for example, I can grab something from Chick-Fil-A instead of dining court food for a meal. Now if they can fix staffing issues at the dining courts...",
