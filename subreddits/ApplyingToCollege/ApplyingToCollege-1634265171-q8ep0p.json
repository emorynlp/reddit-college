I just have normal-good ECs: captain of a sport, officer in a club, Mock Trial, working a part-time job, that sort of thing. I\u2019m the golden student at my Midwestern public high school, but when I look at A2Cers I feel like I have no chance at all compared to my national competition.",

I put insane pressure on myself, treating ever test, every lab report, and every essay like it it would make or break me. In my mind, it was a worthy sacrifice for my ultimate goal of being valedictorian. And it worked, mostly. I ended up with a class rank of 2, and a GPA over 100. But now I\u2019ve realized that all the effort wasn\u2019t worth it. The reality is that I spent 4 years of my life sidelining family, friendships, and mental health just so I could have high stats to brag about. Plus, even with my near perfect stats, I\u2019m still a long shot at any of the \u201celite\u201d schools. \n\nI wish I dropped a few honors classes. I wish I spent more time gaming with my friends, instead of on SAT prep. I wish I went to prom instead of studying for AP exams (yes that really happened). If I had done all that, I still would\u2019ve ended up with a GPA good enough to get me into any one of my state schools.",

Even if you are from a fierce, competitive demographic like me, you do NOT have to appear with national news articles with your name on it to get into T15 schools. Case in point - numerous asian males in a school close to me get into places like harvard/stanford/JHU/Yale, when I look their name up, I don't see --isef++-- or --usaco camper++--. I don't see anything, but ordinary dudes who wrote fantastic essays.\n\nOn the contrary, I see kids with national nonprofits in my demographic that get into MAX berkeley EECS.
