      "text": "As an AO who reads maybe \\~500 essays a year and not thousands, I read a lot of good ones. For me to say WOW though is a little less frequent. My advice to all students is to 1) ANSWER THE PROMPT. Every year I get some essays that are really great but... don't actually answer what we're looking for. Or are about someone who is not the student. And 2) go deep, not wide. Pick one specific topic to talk about (in my school's case, our essay asks about service/leadership/adversity) and go into more detail about that one thing, rather than just listing your activities. Is there a project you were a part of? Is there some kind of problem you helped solve? You don't have to have solved world hunger or anything - but showing me that, for example, you helped organize and promote a car wash fundraiser for your French club so you could take the club to a fancy French restaurant (with the details!!) will go far.  \n\n\nI also work for a state school and not a T20, but I'm guessing this basic advice will apply to any essay for any student reading through here.",
