I was under the impression that he/she was the one who was supposed to submit my gpa and class rank. \n\nFurthermore, what should I do if I do not know my class rank? Btw is class rank the entire year group (100ppl) or just my class of about 35 students? \n\nApologize if this has been asked a lot before.",
