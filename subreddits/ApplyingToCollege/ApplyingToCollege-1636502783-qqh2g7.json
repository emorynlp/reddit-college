  "title:": "If colleges like Georgia Tech directly take an applicant's GPA without altering it in any way at all, how do they factor in grading/scaling differences? For example, some HS's give honors and AP/IB/DE classes .5+ and 1+ boosts respectively while others do 1+ and 2+ (rather much) - how is it fair?",
  "text": "([https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/academic-preparation](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/academic-preparation))\n\nFor example, applicant 1 and 2 could've taken the same amount of college classes / honors but get totally different gpa's; for example the .5+, 1+ guy could get a 4.5 GPA and the other 1+, 2+ could get a 5.5 GPA, but shouldn't #2's be recalculated to match all others?",
