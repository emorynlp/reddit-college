  "text": "Hi,I\u2019m currently struggling with the Yale 250 word essay on an intellectual idea or topic that excites you. I was wondering how others answered this prompt. Would someone mind PMing me their supplement on this topic/comment ideas I could talk about as an economics/environmental studies major? I would really appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know stanford has a similar prompt on intellectual vitality so any stanford examples would be super helpful too!",

      "text": "Not to be vague, but just think of ANYTHING that you\u2019ve found intellectually exciting during high school, whether it\u2019s an academic topic, social issue, etc. Just make sure it\u2019s specific enough and the AOs can see why you\u2019re excited about it (pls be legit with the topic tho, bc they can sometimes tell when you\u2019re not as excited as you claim to be). I struggled answering this one too, but just know that if you\u2019re not excited about the topic while you\u2019re writing about it, you likely didn\u2019t choose the right topic (I had to circle through a few ideas myself before I landed on something). Also, there are plenty of examples online if you want to read them (just search Yale supplemental essays examples) since I know people on this sub are hesitant to send their responses to strangers. Hope that helps and good luck!!",
