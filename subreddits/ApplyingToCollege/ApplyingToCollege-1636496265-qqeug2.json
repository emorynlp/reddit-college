  "title:": "Changing my Second Semester but already applied to Columbia",
  "text": "I am a senior who EDed to Columbia University.  This year I scheduled myself to take 7 APs, and I have 4 APs next semester.  I want to change it to swap out of one of my class for a band class since I play Saxophone. This school is already a reach for me and I wonder how bad it will look if I drop an AP for a band class (which is kind of just a class for fun).  Should I just stick to my schedule and have a stressful asf second semester senior year? Or should I just bite the bullet before I apply to anymore colleges so I don\u2019t have to notify them?",
