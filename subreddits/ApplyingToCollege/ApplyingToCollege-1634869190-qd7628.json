I\u2019ve tried to study it, solve it, ask my teacher but it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. On top of that, Im a horrible test taker and I just got assigned a research paper and have to revise two essays. \n\nMakes me want to just give up after I submit my college apps",

      "text": "My daughter started AP Physics like that as well.  With tutoring, she was able to pull her grade up to a B (her only non-A on her transcript) and she got a 4 on the AP test.  It's the first time she's struggled with a class and I'm glad she went through it in high school instead of college.  She spent as much time on Physics as the rest of her classes combined.\n\nYou can do this!",
