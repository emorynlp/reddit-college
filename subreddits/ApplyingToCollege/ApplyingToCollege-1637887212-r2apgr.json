  "title:": "For Princeton\u2019s graded paper, is it a terrible idea to submit a paper I got a C on?",
  "text": "I genuinely believe this paper was one of the best I\u2019ve ever written. My teacher didn\u2019t really agree on that lol and gave me a C (it turns out my paper didn\u2019t address the prompt closely enough \ud83d\ude22). However, I spent hours on it and I believe it represents some of my best writing so far. Is it too risky to submit it if it has unfavorable comments on it? Or should I pick a paper I got an A on even if I don\u2019t like it as much?",
