  "text": "I'm new to Reddit and don't know how flairs work and I can't find the one that labels this as a rant. I'm about to write about an experience I had while looking for a college counselor. Full disclosure: yes, I was willing to pay thousands of dollars for someone to work one-on-one with me to make my college app more competitive. In retrospect, is it a smart use of money or really necessary? Maybe not for me. It was definitely a huge help, and for a lot of people it is the right decision, but I'm not so sure if it's worth the price tag in my personal case.\n\nOnto the main point of this post: IvyCoach. I'm sure at least some of you have heard of it, namely for the price tag on its \"Unlimited Package\" ($100k+, and the organization's website is unashamed of clarifying that it can be far higher). I'm sure IvyCoach has done much to earn both its reputation and its profit margin, and I have no doubt that if you do choose to pay six figures for college counseling, you will be receiving the best of the best in terms of guidance.\n\nMy family scheduled a meeting with IvyCoach - the free 20 minute introduction. To clarify, we had no intention of paying 6 figures for college counseling. My parents do very well in life, with advanced degrees and stable, well-paying jobs. But there was no chance we would pay that much. We would consider one of their less encompassing packages, but mostly, we were curious to see what the best of the best had to offer.\n\nWe met with Jayson Weingarten. He's pretty high-ranking at IvyCoach, having a place on the leadership page of the website as well as participating in a few high-profile interviews. From the very start, it was clear he had no interest in us as clients. Not surprising, given the fact it was fairly obvious to both sides that we would not be paying the big bucks. I, a junior at the time, asked what could be done to strengthen an applicant in the eyes of admissions. The response? \"You should have started earlier.\" \"Is there any benefit to taking the ACT and the SAT?\"  \"No why would you do that.\" 20 minutes of conversation with a person who clearly did not want to be there and was unafraid to show it. Arrogant and stonewalling.\n\nIt's not lost on me that college admissions is ultimately a test of wealth. I can afford to pay hundreds of dollars for the SAT and AP tests. Someone two or three income brackets up can afford to pay six figures to get into college and six figures more to finish it. Not really fair, but that's how the world works. And I realize how whiny and entitled this rant seems: \"Wahh wahh my parents have money and this random guy didn't give me the respect I deserved.\" My point in writing all this? I was mildly annoyed and decided today would be a good day to discuss it at length. But beyond that, I think this is a pretty hilarious example of just how stratified college admissions have become and the attitudes of people at the very top.",

(in the event I'm classifying at all heh)  \n\n\nCause no businessman worth their salt discriminates a client based on their appearance and his initial willingness to buy a product. A dollar is still a dollar despite where it's from ;)",
