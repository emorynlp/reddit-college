  "text": "I plan on transferring to a top university after 2 years but I was wondering if it matters to these universities where you transfer from. Do they prefer transfers from a 4-year school or a community college and if they do prefer people from a 4 year does the school matter? I know it may not matter at all but I was wondering if they have a preference or not.",
