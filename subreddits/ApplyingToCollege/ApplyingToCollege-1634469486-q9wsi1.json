          "text": "Hello, thanks for replying.  I did what you said before, but as I wrote;  not very descriptive answers.  What I mean is this;  For example, I will apply to Harvard University, when does the application start and end?\nWhen I googled this question, I got many different answers.  Some say I should apply early, others say it doesn't mean anything.  I'm so confused.  I thought maybe someone who applied before could answer this question. \ud83d\ude0a",

Here is the link for the Harvard one: https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants\n\nThe early deadlines for most colleges are almost here, so you would be better off looking at the regular deadlines, which usually fall on or around January 1st for most colleges.",
