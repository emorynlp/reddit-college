  "text": "I know interviews are all optional, and \"have no impact on application determination\" but, is there some sort of interest shown in your application if you have received an interview? There are limited slots and availability for interviews, and I can only imagine that the alumni who volunteer to be interviewers aren't talking to 40,000 students. I just feel that there are showcasing some sort of interest in your application if you received an interview, and they are using resources to get more information on your application. Any thoughts on the whole interview process?",
