  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m applying to Florida State University and they require to upload a resume/activity list on their Application Status Check. However, I already wrote everything on my Common App activity list, and I honestly don\u2019t have anything else to add to the resume. \n\nDo you guys think I could just copy-paste my activity list into a resume? Wouldn\u2019t it look bad? Thank you in advance!",
