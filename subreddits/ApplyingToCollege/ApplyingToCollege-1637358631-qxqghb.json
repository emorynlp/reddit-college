  "text": "I've been spending the last 3 months dreading this thing. I've written and deleted almost a dozen essays on the same 3 or so topics.\n\nBut today I was just in a wierd mood and I decided \"fuck it, I'll write about my matress\" and I did. In 30 minutes. And it might be better than the one I ended up with in the last 3 months.\n\nMaybe I'll wake up tomorrow (on my matress) and decide it's trash. My old one was about teaching kids how to cook at a camp I worked at and it was really generic... should I go for the matress essay??",

      "text": "The matress one would most likely be better if it tells  the same story (personal growth personal experience life goal bla bla bla) because yeah, volunteer at a camp is so fucking overused that it's actually very hard to come up with a good essay. Just make sure you aren't just describing the matress. You want to paint a picture or yourself through the matress.",
