  "text": "So I just received my Caltech applicant portal after submitting my common app yesterday. I was thinking about if I had anything supplemental to submit.\n\nI did a research course with Caltech during my junior year but the research I did was not new (as in the data my group gathered and the conclusions we drew had been done before). I also didn\u2019t publish a research paper, but my group and I did culminate our project into a final presentation. I wouldn\u2019t say it was a formal presentation, but it was similar to what an actual formal research presentation would be like. Should I submit it as supplemental material?",
