  "text": "I'm a senior in high school. I've only been in two clubs throughout my high school career.\n\n1) I am the President of my Girl Scout troop, and I was the Historian and 1st Vice President in the years before. I've also been in Girl Scouts for 9 years. \n\n2) I am an active member of Key Club.\n\n\nBut that's it. That's all I've done. I feel like this isn't enough for any sort of scholarships or to be accepted into any UCs.\n\nIs there any hope for me to be accepted nonetheless? What are my chances?",

There's no need to be disheartened or feel insecure at all. You're going to do great regardless. Good luck!",

If you have done AP & UC transferable courses, that too is strongly considered. PIQs are next most important. ECs are actually optional and can even be zilch. Having one or two long term ECs will help of course.",
