  "text": "I\u2019m a 18 year old who is currently in the US Air Force and does something with computers. My tuition, books and housing will all be paid for with the post 9/11 GI Bill so no worries about that. What are some good universities for Americans and have good acceptance rates as well as respectable cyber programs and good nightlife. I\u2019m starting my research now.",
