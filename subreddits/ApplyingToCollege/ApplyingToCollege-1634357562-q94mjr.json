  "text": "I decided to apply to UNC EA on a whim today. I got a really good idea on one of the supplementals and it turned out really well, and the other was ok, but I barely finished in time, and because of a credit card issue I submitted my application a few minutes late (Common App said \"deadline has passed\" before I submitted). Would this seriously hurt my chances of getting in?",

      "text": "If the \u201cdeadline passed\u201d message shows on the Common App then that's kind of a bad sign. Sometimes the common app doesn't immediately show that message, but if it does, it means you've not met the time limit, and it PROBABLY won't be considered as EA. I think you should immediately email the school with an explanation.",
