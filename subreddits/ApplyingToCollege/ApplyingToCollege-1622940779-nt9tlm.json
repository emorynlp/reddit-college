I don't blame them from finding a way to profit from their idea. I actually think it's a good idea to get income from ones passion, especially when the passion is something as important as theirs. The income enables them to do their important work.   \n  \n I would like to see more differentiation between the name of the social movement and the name of the organization. If the organization can stylize its name to indicate the distinction, and include that on their website, that would really be all they need to do.   \n  \nBut until the organizers make that distinction, I'm backing off slightly on my use of a hashtag because I don't want my support of the movement to be co-opted by an organization with additional goals.",

Growing up in bad family situations or with a bully can put on some crazy goggles that make you blind to your own actions. I can\u2019t remember exactly, but I saw a clip a few years ago about someone calling their old bully decades later, and the bully truly thought they were friends back then while the caller was extremely negatively affected by their relationship. Anecdotal, but either way it\u2019s hard for the brain to truly introspect at a young age. That\u2019s not to say bullying is bad, it obviously is. I\u2019m just saying that there are many layers to trauma.",

But the fear of not being forgiven is enormous in situations like these and it\u2019s not very obvious to a person in that situation.
