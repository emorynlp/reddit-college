  "text": "This is really dumb but \n\nI used to run an anime blog around freshman and sophomore year. It started out as something very random and I literally didn't have any sort of goals. Theres this little Map that shows where your visitors are from and I basically wanted to get at least one visitor from every country (realized that wasn't possible haha). \n\nThen I got into SEO and I tried to get posts to rank on google. only did this on a couple of posts but they did surprisingly well. \n\nAnyways, the blog still gets like 10k views a month (which isn't very much ) and I still get requests for sponsored posts, guest Posts etc. Its also ranks pretty well. \n\nI would definitely include it in my ECs if it had made any sort of positive impact but it was a dumb hobby (Its nice to watch the views go up lmao) and I'm honestly embarrassed to include it anywhere. \n\nI definitely don't plan on including it but could this help or work out under any circumstances ?Suggestions?",
