Assuming this is a casual activity for you, I would not put that at the top of your list, which should be ordered based on significance to you. As an aside, for the description, I'd focus on puzzle and try to leave out the word game.\n\nKeep in mind that you do not need to fill every slot in the activity section. Think quality over quantity.\n\nIf you are in need of meaningful activities, the most obvious non-school option, yet often overlooked in this subreddit, is a typical teen job, in a business. Typical as in grocery, fast food, retail, etc. Hard work, responsibility, real world experience, context for future learning, and a place to start your resume when you apply to real internships during college.",
