Like I know my Duke interviewer did his undergrad there and did three majors/minors, then did a Ph.D., and is now at Scripps Institute of Research. That's literally it. Nothing more particular than that but I just wanted to know whether he did research or not so I could ask him about it.",

It\u2019s not stalking if it\u2019s all information that\u2019s out there in the open. I gain valuable information and can steer the conversation towards their interests. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.",

      "text": "Huh interesting! I had quite the opposite experience.\n\nI Googled my interviewer and spent about 5 mins seeing which labs they used at the university. During the actual interview, I slowly turned the conversation towards the labs and associated skills/tools...and suffice it to say that I (and I guess the interviewer too) lost track of how long we discussed that. Of course, it is true that they were a recent grad in the same major as my anticipated choice, so that had a huge role to play too.",
