  "title:": "Writing about mentor and childhood dream in additional info section",
  "text": "I'm considering adding two things in my additional info sections, both being major contributors to my personal development that I can't talk about anywhere else in the application. \n\nThe first is how my mentor impacted me. The way he challenged my beliefs and asked questions that required in-depth self-reflection has helped me understand myself and my approach to life in ways I never could have. I think including this would help explain my lack of ECs/leadership roles as well, as I was going through a major identity crisis at the time and stopped doing ECs because I didn't gain any inspiration from them.\n\nThe second is my childhood aspiration. In 7th grade out of spontaneity, I set out to get into Oxford because 1/ Going abroad was my dream and 2/ I wanted to challenge and develop myself to the greatest extent. I didn't succeed (apparently), but I changed and grew drastically thanks to it, accomplishing things like going from the bottom to the top at school in terms of English skills, gaining a bunch of skills, and developing my mindset and identity. \n\nDo you think these would benefit my application? If possible, could you suggest a better way to frame them?",
