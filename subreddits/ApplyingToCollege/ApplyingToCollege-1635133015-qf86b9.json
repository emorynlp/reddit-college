      "text": "As someone attending a prestigious university and someone that got into all that I applied to, but one I can say I didn\u2019t spend much time researching the professor because much like you I didn't know what I was looking for so I mostly researched classes. Anyways now as a college student, I do know what to look for in professors. How long have they been at the university? Most of my professors have been at my school for 20 years plus. You know that the work environment is good and the students are enjoyable if professors are sticking around that long. The next thing you should look for is how caring professors are. You can do this by reading reviews on rate my professor. Even in my large lecture halls, my professors know my name. Having your professors care about you makes a world of difference. My teachers want me to be successful they meet with me to fill in mg gaps of education and are proud of me when I do well. Where you professors studied is another thing to look for. By that I mean my Spanish teacher got her degrees in Spain. She\u2019s very qualified to teach Spanish unlike many of the Spanish teachers I had in high school who went on a mission trip and were somehow deemed fluent. These are just my suggestions, but I would try to think of what qualities you like in a teacher. Do you like strict teachers who have very strict deadlines or do you like a teacher that\u2019s much more flexible and gives extensions. Do you want an interactive professor that calls on students or one the lectures the whole time and students never say a word.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re very interested in a particular (small) field, it\u2019s good if the university has several faculty members who do research in that area and are well-regarded in the field; this is very important if you plan to do research in college on a pretty narrow topic.\n\nI will say though, as a student at a \u201cprestigious university,\u201d I really didn\u2019t research the professors before, and I\u2019m not aware of my friends doing so either. It\u2019s not going to get you accepted or tell you if a school is a good fit in most circumstances - most people don\u2019t need very specific professors, so it\u2019s weird to weight that heavily when you might not even study with them if you get admitted. As I said earlier though, if you want to do specific research as an undergrad, it might be helpful.",

          "text": "Thanks for that insight, that\u2019s good to know. I should have clarified that the reason I\u2019m researching is so that they will notice my deep interest in the school. One of the big tips I see to getting into your dream school is being an expert on it and showing that you have a specific reason for wanting to attend. So that\u2019s why I was asking, I\u2019m not really sure what I should be looking for",
