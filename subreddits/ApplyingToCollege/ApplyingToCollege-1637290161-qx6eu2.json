Within 3\nMonths of graduations got into google within 2 years he earned double of what his dad made and he got cleared his 170k debt under 3 years. U go to some normal uni in the sale of being cheap it might not yield that ROI. So yes again it varies from person to person but I don\u2019t want you to think it\u2019s impossible",
