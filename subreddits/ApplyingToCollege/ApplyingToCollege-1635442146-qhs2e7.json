  "text": "My college professors keep denying my recommendation letter request because \u201cthey don\u2019t have enough information\u201d and I\u2019m taking remote courses. I have a 4.0 gpa and I work extremely hard but they have never met me. I feel like Im put at a disadvantage because of this. are colleges considering that many students only have an online relationship with their professors when reading letters of rec? do you have any tips on getting a strong letter? Im at a loss here.",
