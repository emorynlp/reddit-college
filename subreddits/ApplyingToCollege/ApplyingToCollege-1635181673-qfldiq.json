      "text": "The global space science ranking is really going to be focused on research output in that area - how much that impacts undergrad education varies.  I wouldn't choose it over MIT if you had the option and the costs for MIT were manageable, but I would also have it a lot higher than 100 or wherever they are on the national university ranking.\n\nThey definitely have some of the top research faculty in specific areas - the principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx is there for example.",
