  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking an online Linear Algebra class. It\u2019s through a university; however, it\u2019s a non-credit class that I\u2019m not using towards graduation and the credits can\u2019t be transferable to any university. \n\nWhen the Common App asks me to report the number of universities I took courses at, the only options to put it under is \u201cDual Enrollment with high school,\u201d \u201csummer program,\u201d and \u201ccredit awarded directly by college.\u201d\n\nDo I not state the university Im taking Linear Algebra at in this section if it\u2019s non-credit? How should I go about reporting it?",
