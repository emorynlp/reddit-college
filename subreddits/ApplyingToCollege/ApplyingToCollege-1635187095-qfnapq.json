          "text": "Pro football.  Fun story actually.  His dream was to play football in the NFL.  He went undrafted in 1995 and was cut from the Canadian Football League in his first year.  His dad had connections to pro wrestling, so he gave it a shot and quickly became a star, leading to his illustrious acting career.  He's now one of the highest grossing and highest paid actors in history.\n\nSo what is the lesson, what is the takeaway?  Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway!\n\nSeriously kids, if you don't get into an Ivy or T20, it doesn't mean anything. There's more than one or two (or 20!) paths to success.  Just work hard, focus on your goals, and ~~have a dad who's a pro wrestler~~ make the most of your opportunities.",
