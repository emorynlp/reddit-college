      "text": "Depending on where you go, you may feel a smidge old in some of your freshman classes. But most juniors on campus will be 20, so you're still in the normal age ballpark at any university.\n\nA good way to ensure you won't stand out for your age at all is to look at T30s that [admit a lot of transfer students.](https://transferweb.com/stats/transfer-acceptance-rates/#.YZSMUWDMJPY) You'll see more people taking nonstandard paths through college, like gap year students and transfer juniors filling in freshman reqs, so it won't be just you in a sea of 18 year olds in your intro classes. \n\nThese schools also have better resources for 'older' students, which you probably won't need now, but may be helpful once you're an upperclassman.",

There\u2019s a guy in one of my classes this year who\u2019s literally 10 years older than me but he\u2019s chill and has been constructive and punctual with all the work I\u2019ve done with him, so if anything I appreciate that more regardless of age than someone my age who never does things on time.",
