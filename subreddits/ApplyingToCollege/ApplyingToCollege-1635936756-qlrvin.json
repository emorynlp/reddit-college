  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m currently researching colleges and can\u2019t seem to understand the difference between Core Curriculum and Distribution Requirements.\n\nFor example at WashU, the Distribution Requirements are 9 credits each of Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities. Isn\u2019t t that the same thing as a Core Curriculum?",

          "text": "To add a bit, think of comparing non-major requirements between schools as an x-y scatter plot where you\u2019re measuring two types of burden. \n\nThe more course requirements, the greater the y. That\u2019s burden #1. \n\nThe fewer options you have to fulfill those requirements, the greater the x. That\u2019s burden #2. \n\nIn some schools a history major may be able to fill a science requirement by taking a history of science class or a class on Darwin. Or a social sciences or philosophy major may find a class on medical ethics, policies around IT and innovation, etc. At other schools, your science distribution may only get filled by \u201cdumbed down\u201d versions of Gen Chem or bio courses that pre-meds, engineers and STEM students take. \n\nPay attention to choice and how much of your course load must be set aside to fulfill those requirements rather than what they are called (core, distribution, etc).\n\nMost of the schools people describe as \u201ccore\u201d have more defined literature or history sequences and things like that.",
