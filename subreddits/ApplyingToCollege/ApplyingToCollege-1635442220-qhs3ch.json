  "text": "I was able to follow the process for kid #1 who is in college now. Trying to create another CSS profile for kid #2. This for parent's account but I understand College board doesn't have that option. Here are my questions:\n\n1. Do I need to create two separate accounts for two kids as a parent? I browsed the internet and that's what I understand. Also that I need to use two separate email addresses.\n2. When I try to create my second account, except for email address all other info like my name, DOB, etc. is all the same so it's kicking me out with \"you already have an account.\" Duh!\n\nIf, as a parent, you have two kids and have done this successfully can you please chime in? Thanks.",

How do people do this?",
