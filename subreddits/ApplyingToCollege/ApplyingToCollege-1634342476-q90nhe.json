  "text": "I just got a 1470 on the October SAT and I\u2019m not sure if I should retake it. My essays are really good and my LOR should be very nice. My EC\u2019s are pretty good and show leadership and my personality. Should I take it again or focus on college apps now? I\u2019m planning to apply to ivies and other top schools",
