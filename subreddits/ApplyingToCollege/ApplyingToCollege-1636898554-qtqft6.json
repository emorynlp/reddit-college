  "text": "Hey Everyone. I'm an international student from India applying to UCSD as a 26' graduate. Now I want to pursue a pre-medical track(Major- Neurobiology/Alt Major Undeclared Physical Sciences for bow) but in the UC application, they require me to choose out of the 8 campuses and give a preference list. So here are my questions\n\n1. How do I approach this question? I read in a few places that add the list in the descending order cause the first 3 you never get(Was skeptical regarding this)\n2. What were your campus preference lists when you applied?\n\n3. What should my campus preference list look like, or\nat least what would be the better campuses for me as a\npre-med major?\n\n4. How does research look like at UCSD? What are the benefits of each college, and would fees vary from college to college?\n\n5. If I get into one college, can I transfer to another one in the next term, or before the term ends? 6. Would you give any general advice regarding the UC application/essays, things you wish you did, you learned from, etc?.\n\nThanks, everyone and does feel free to PM me too",

      "text": "I'll address some of the questions, but I'm not great at premed stuff so I won't provide a specific ranking. \n\nThere are 7 UCSD residential colleges, not 8. Whoever told you you don't get your first three is so incredibly wrong. It's relatively rare to not get one of your top 3. \n\nAll the residential colleges determine are where you live on campus (only relevant for one or two years) and what GE requirements you have. These colleges aren't like far away separate campuses. They directly border each other. So location isn't a big deal. Fees are effectively identical between colleges. The benefits of one college over another are housing (but it's not guaranteed you'll live in your college and it's not even that important) and GE requirements. That's it. You cannot switch colleges. There is technically a way to, but you need to prove a bunch of stuff (like you'll graduate two quarters earlier in a different college) but I've never heard of any succeeding and again it doesn't really matter. Assume the college you are admitted to is the one you are stuck with. \n\nAnything you read about sixth that is from pre2020 is wrong. In 2020 they got a brand new location on campus with great new buildings. Seventh was also brand new in 2020, so take any info on it from 2019 or 2020 with a grain of salt. Overall seventh seems pretty good. \n\nBest way to rank the colleges is to figure out which one has the best GEs for you. This means the ones you are most interested in and the colleges where you'll have the least GEs (whether due to AP credit or something else). compare.ucsd.edu, the major requirements for the major you're interested in listed on the department site, and the AP credit chart (just Google UCSD AP credit chart) are all very good resource if you want to go overkill. \n\nDon't think of them like different universities or anything. It's basically just you choosing your housing and what general ed requirements you want. Back when I was a new student, I got a pretty bad college for my major (ERC as an electrical engineer) and it's not been that bad. So no matter what don't go crazy over this. Just try and figure out which college has the most overlap with your major classes and the most interesting GEs for you, while also reducing the number of GEs you need.",
