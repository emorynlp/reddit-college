It's comparable to other good State schools, and is a little more expensive due to Vermont not exactly being able to dump a bunch of funding into it. However, it's right next to Burlington, which is a gorgeous town. It has Lake Champlain, which is great for water activities and hiking around it. It's in close proximity to the Green Mountains, so you'll have a very great time if you enjoy hiking, skiing, etc. It's a day's trip away from Montreal and Boston. New England atmosphere, etc. \n\nI'm applying for History and Secondary Education, but I have heard they have a pretty good Pre-Med (or nursing?) Program.",
