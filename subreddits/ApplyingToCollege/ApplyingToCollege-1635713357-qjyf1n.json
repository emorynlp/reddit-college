  "text": "Yea, i got 5 Fs in one quarter. I've been dealing with depression and parents divorcing which wasn't so great for my grades. I'm putting in the effort to get my grades back up for the rest of senior year cause i don't want to mess up my life but i don't know if i'll be able to get into a decent 4 year uni with 5 Fs on my transcript. At the moment, i have a 3.43uw gpa and a 3.94w gpa. Please give thoughtful responses, thank you!!",
