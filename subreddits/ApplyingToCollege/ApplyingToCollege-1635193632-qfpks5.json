  "text": "I am an international student not applying for aid, and Barnard is one of my top choices. But, I know I will be limited in my budget during my entire college life since my parents will be paying. Barnard is very expensive; How do broke students manage life in Barnard, if there are any? And also please leave some advice for applying as well. \n\nI appreciate you taking out your time to answer. Thank you so much. \n\nAny information helps!",
