      "text": "WashU grad who studied politics and went into IB before I came to my senses. I studied politics, economics and layered in some business classes (non-Olin core + finance classes) btw. \n\nI don\u2019t think it really matters. Stern definitely has a higher IB placement rate. But a big part of the rate differential is student self selection. I\u2019m not sure that the placement for either school, controlled for number of students who wish to pursue IB, is appreciably different. That said, more banks do recruit at Stern, but the number of students interested in IB is higher. \n\nMy advice:  if you have a strong WashU preference outside of IB aspirations, pick WashU. If you\u2019re neutral or have a strong preference for NYU, pick NYU.",
