  "text": "hello,\n\nclass of 22 here\n\nI was looking into getting an International Relations major. I have always been interested in politics, public policy, government, conflict, geopolitics, as well as domestic and international affairs. Didn't know about an International Relations major until recently, when I was searching for majors that would be best.\n\nBut I'm thinking would it be worth it? Would I be able to make a successful career out of an International Relations degree? From basic research it seems that a graduate degree is needed at minimum for a chance to find a career as it is a competitive field.\n\nAlso, what would you suggest I do for an undergraduate degree if I wanted a masters in International Relations?\n\nThanks for any help it is much appreciated, and good luck to anyone applying this year!",

      "text": "Absolutely laughing my ass off at the commenter who said you won't get a job with an IR degree if you don't go to a T20. That is so unbelievably not true. \n\nAn IR degree is going to give you essentially the same opportunities a polisci degree will. What careers are you interested in? As long as you seek out opportunities and experience, you 100% can get a solid job with an IR degree. And law school or getting a graduate degree in a different field is always an option. \n\nIf you wanted a master's in IR, political science, or something closely related would be best (history, econ, etc). But I'd imagine pretty much any social science or humanity could probably get you there. \n\nI would just caution you to not limit yourself to schools that offer an IR major. You'll be taking essentially the same classes and have the same opportunities as if you were a polisci major, so make sure you don't settle for a college just because they have an IR major. \n\nBest of luck with everything! I'm taking an IR class now and I'm involved in the IR club at my school and it's really a fascinating subject with a lot of cool career opportunities imo. Make sure you take advantage of the opportunities your school offers and you'll be set for a career.",
