  "text": "Has anyone here used one of those online editing services that cost like $15-$40 per essay? I want to have someone read over my commonapp essay, but I want to know if these are worth it. I'm looking for something that can help me make it flowier and less awkward. Is there a place I can see like an example of an essay before it was edited and then what the suggestions were. I just don't want to waste my money on something that only corrects my grammar. I will literally pay a college student too lmao.\n\nIf you know of any reputable companies or people, please let me know!",

          "text": "Thanks so much for your response! I was actually looking into using Gohars guide and have a few questions about it. I know you said you didn't like it, but did they offer suggestions or just tell you what they didn't like.\n\nAlso, I don't really know how these editing services work at all, so would they actually help me make the writing \"prettier\" or would they just tell me to do it? (basically, I'm asking if they actually reworded what you wrote to make it sound better)",

              "text": "they did offer some suggestions, however, it was pretty basic such as saying that the essay was merely expository or saying that it seemed a bit basic but that it was a good start when i was pretty much finished with it. this advice really didn\u2019t do that much for me, tbh it only made me feel bad abt this essay when everyone else who read it, even strangers, said that it was fantastic. to an extent they were correct, however it was more criticism and they didn\u2019t give me any advice on how to make it better. they didn\u2019t really reword anything but cut down my essay from 650 words to 250 which made it unrecognizable as they were basically asking me to start it from scratch since there was nothing original left. ultimately, i was disappointed w what they said and thus wouldn\u2019t recommend it but it\u2019s up to u to decide if it\u2019s something u wanna invest in",
