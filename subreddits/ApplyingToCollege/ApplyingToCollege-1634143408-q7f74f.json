  "text": "I've heard this a lot, but I still somehow doubt this because I feel like they r just tryna fool us. Idk it just seems like there has to be some kind of stuff that makes one topic better than another. If I, as an Intl, talk about my struggle with accent when I moved here, rather than what I learned from the diversified community (both equally profound and written in the same style), does it make a difference which topic I choose?",

This is why people say college admission is kind of random. By chance, your story resonate with AO and they view favorably. So yes, I focus more on what you want to say than what AO want to hear because you have no idea what AO want to hear.",

But what AOs are saying is to not write what *you think* AOs want to hear, because oftentimes that is not what AOs actually want to hear. So your goal *is* to write what AOs want to hear, you just have to be accurate about assessing it.",
