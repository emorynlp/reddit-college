  "text": "Question that I don't quite understand - at least I think I do, but I want to make sure.    \nOn Princeton's application, they say that \" If you have indicated that you would like test scores to be considered with your application, only test scores sent directly from a testing agency will appear in your checklist.  \" In the portal. I self-reported my SAT scores on commonapp, but does this mean I have to send an official report from CB? (y'know the one that's $12 per uni) And if that's the case, should I write an email saying that those scores have been sent?  \n\n\nThank you so much  \n\\-an anxious high school senior",

I'm sure their office is overwhelmed with mail right now\n\nJust try confirming on their site whether or not they have a grace period for supplemental mats and scores (I believe they do but I'm not 100% on Pton)",
