  "text": "Hi\n\nI was mostly homeschooled but I have 32 credits from 2 community colleges that I earned in highschool. \n\nI'm not currently enrolled anywhere. Can I transfer into a university as a 2nd year student or does it just depend on the school?\n\nSorry if this comes across as super ignorant. I haven't been able to find a clear answer.",

      "text": "If you earned them while in high school, you will likely apply as a first year student. Your credits may allow you to place out of some courses, earn advanced standing, and possible graduate early if you camplete the required plan of study more quickly.\n\nYou would have to contact an Admissions Office with your specifics for an accurate answer.",
