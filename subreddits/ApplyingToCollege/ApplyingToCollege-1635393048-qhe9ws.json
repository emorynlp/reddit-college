  "text": "I applied to a cal state school last year and was accepted after spending 1 year at a private institution and 1 year doing community. I got really depressed last year and was not looking through my emails or in general keeping up on what i needed to submit past just getting accepted. Long story short they rescinded my acceptance because I never submitted a \"final transcript\" from a college I technically never attended. I did dual enrollment in high school and for anyone familiar with dual enrollment it's a two part agreement. If you complete the 2 parts you get college credit but I only did one part so I only got high school credit. No big deal I only wanted high school credit but now it's really biting me in the ass because I have absolutely no information for that community college. I'm not in their records because I was never technically a student, I have no idea what my school email is etc. etc. Do I even have to indicate I \"went there\" if I don't want any credit from them? The CS Apply website says to say that you were a student there because they give u honors credit but I wouldn't get it either way. Any advice ....",
