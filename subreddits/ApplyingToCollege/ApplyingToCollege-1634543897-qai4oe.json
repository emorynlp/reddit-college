  "text": "So basically I'm an international student and last year I applied for some medicine courses in the UK and unfortunately was rejected by all 4 unis. I was wondering if talking about the hardships I went through and how I have reflected on my failure is a good topic to talk about or will it just sound like a sob story?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
