  "text": "Can I submit late SAT score during February? Should I take the ACT now? Please help \ud83d\ude22 I have a 3.7uw/4W but 1080 SAT. I was almost late, didn\u2019t sleep, and had no breakfast on test day so that happened. Scheduled for December 4 SAT but got canceled. I honestly really don\u2019t want to submit my score because I know it\u2019s going to drag down my app. I only have 20hr of volunteering services and currently doing school clubs. Has anyone applied to colleges that required SAT/ACT but didn\u2019t submit it and got in?",

The ACT is a little different from the ACT, the biggest thing being it\u2019s a much faster paced test. Just get used to that and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do good and you can send that score.",
