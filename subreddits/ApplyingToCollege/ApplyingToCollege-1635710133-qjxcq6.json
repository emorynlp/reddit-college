  "text": "Hi,\n\nI was looking through my submitted application for my ED school, and I noticed that for one of my clubs, (Key Club) I accidentally put down \"all year\" instead of \"school\". Will this have a big impact on my admission? I did do activities for the club during the summer and other breaks, but I participated in it primarily during the school year.\n\nSorry if this is kind of a dumb question lol, I'm just super stressed and overthinking everything since it's my ED school.",
