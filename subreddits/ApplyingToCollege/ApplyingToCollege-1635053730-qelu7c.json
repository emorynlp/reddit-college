But many schools are need blind, and need aware schools often accept and meet the need of many students - they generally just limit that number to how many students their aid budget will cover.\n\nI wouldn't let that concern limit where you apply. I would pay attention to net price calculators though - if a school is telling you they won't meet your need, believe them.",
