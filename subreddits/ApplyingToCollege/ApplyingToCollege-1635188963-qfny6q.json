Youngstown (got offered full ride if I went into premed. I don't want to go premed though)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need some more safeties/ targets. for The RD round I'm also applying to Rochester and NYU as hard targets/ reach. Preferably a city type school. I doubt OSU will not accept me and I really love that school so if its my only option I'd be happy., but just in case yk. If yall know some safeties and schools that are decent for me to apply to lmk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit. I want to be Biomed engineer.",
