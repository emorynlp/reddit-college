  "text": "So once upon a time (early October), I applied to the University of South Florida. Rolling admissions. A few days ago I had gotten bored and was still waiting for an admissions decision from them, so I thought \"Wouldn't it be funny if I tried to log into their email service?\" So I did. It worked. I then logged into their Canvas. It also worked. Still waiting for a letter from them but I think this is a good sign.\n\nTl;dr: got bored. tried to log into stuff for a school I had applied to and not gotten a decision for. It worked.",
