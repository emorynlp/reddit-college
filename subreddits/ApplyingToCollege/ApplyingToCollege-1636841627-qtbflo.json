  "text": "I'm currently a junior in highschool and want to enter the engineering field when I go to college but besides robotics I don't have much to show. However, I have a ton of musical achievements and I have no idea if any of it actually matters to schools like Cornell or Georgia Tech. Does anyone have any insight into this?",

If you're also applying to the music school and your audition blows them away, then they might put a finger on the scale w.r.t. admissions.  Some schools also have talent scholarships that don't even require the applicant to study music.  (Though, they typically require him/her to participate in an ensemble group.)",
