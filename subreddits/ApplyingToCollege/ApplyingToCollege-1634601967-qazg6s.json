  "text": "So there are two essay questions that Princeton want us to answer in around 250 words but the Commonapp limit is 350 words. Should I listen to the specific directions and aim for 250 words or should I go as long as I want until I hit the 350 word cap? I don't want to piss off the AO, so I wanna be safe hahahaha.",
