  "text": "I have been playing the Mridangam (Indian percussion instrument) from the age of 7. I do not have any passing exams taken in them (no access to Mridangam grade exams where I live), so regardless of my proficiency, i am very much an amateur on paper. However, I do have a 3 hour video of my debut solo concert. Can  submit that as my art portfolio for BrownU applications and other unis that have an optional question about portfolios? I  am on the edge about that question, because I have played for 10+ years, but if I leave the portfolio empty they could question my integrity about my ECs.",

I\u2019ve played the violin for 10 years, regional awards etc but I\u2019m not submitting a portfolio because I don\u2019t really want to haha. They\u2019re not there to check if you\u2019re lying, they\u2019re there to assess you and if you get admitted, then maybe ask for some proof (standardized test scores, etc).",
