  "title:": "Just had my Harvard Interview and....",
  "text": "She was incredibly nice and her story was so effing inspirational. She went from a low income home in Mumbai to Harvard College and now being a candidate at a prestigious law school(I think top 10). As someone who is a somewhat similar background, I felt a surge of positivity and for a minute felt like I could actually do it. So it happens! She did not have a 2200+SAT or cure cancer. She was amazing but not someone you would expect to get into harvard but she still did.\n\nSometime in between the zoom call, my brothers interrupted me as they wanted breakfast and I had to go. When I came back, I thought she would comment on my 'absence' but she was very interested to know more abt me  taking care of my brothers without my mom instead of how I had disappeared in the middle of our meeting  . The empathy was so empowering.\n\nTo those yet to be interviewed- Chill. Its not as scary as you think it is. At the beginning of the interview I was stuttering from the anxiety but at the end, my interviewer was giving me some breakfast recipes for me to make for my bros.\n\nHope y'all have a great time.",

              "text": "If you are taking care of your brothers due to the loss of a parent, or even because a parent is working far too much, this is something you SHOULD mention. Not mentioning this is, in my opinion a big omission. If you have big family obligations and you are trying to get into a good school, you are fighting with one hand tied behind your back compared to richer students with excellent support systems and some even waited on hand and foot by their parents to help them compete. Anyone in this kind of situation, or with any tough circumstances or obligations should should try to communicate this in the application process.",

Interviews help in the college knowing that you did your research. Talk about your interest. My interviewer asked me about my interest and really wanted to know more about it.

Your interviewer doesnt want to know the perfect scorer or the soccer player, he/she wants to know your inner geek or the art connoisseur inside you. And remember that your interviewer is human too. Try talking to them like a friend and it will go so much better. And also do some research about the college and prepare a few questions to show hat you do your homework.\n\nAll the best and hope you have a gr8 time<3",
