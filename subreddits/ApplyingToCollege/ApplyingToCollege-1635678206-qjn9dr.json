      "text": "You're coming at this from the wrong direction.  Don't think of it as \"what's the best major to earn the most money\"; think of it as \"what's the best career to earn the most money\".  Or, better yet, \"what career will I find most rewarding when all aspects are taken into account, not just compensation\".\n\nThere is no single best answer, but certainly some popular choices.  Two things you'll want to consider:\n\n1. How capable are you \\*really\\*?  It takes a certain kind of person to obtain and flourish in the positions that pay drastically higher than industry average.  Are you that kind of person?  Best to be honest with yourself.\n2. What do you actually \\*like\\* doing, as opposed to what you're \"good at\"?  Some people are capable of sustaining a high level of effort with something they don't enjoy doing.  I'm not one of those people.  Are you?   If not, and if you wind up doing something you find utter drudgery, then you may find it difficult (or impossible) to sustain the level of effort and engagement it takes to advance.\n\nSome typical \\*career\\* (as opposed to \"major\") suggestions are:\n\n* Software.  If your main priority is compensation, then either with a  Google/Facebook type employer or, better yet, one in the finance space.  Note that these represent a fraction of all software jobs and they're highly sought-after.  Even if you don't get one, though, the \"floor\" isn't that low, assuming you do a few things correctly as an undergraduate.  If $ is your goal you'll probably want to get on the management track as soon as possible.  In this case your end goal is something like CTO or VP of  Engineering.\n* Medicine.  Major in whatever you want.  English, Philosophy, doesn't matter.  If compensation is your main goal then choose your specialty with that in mind.\n* Law.  Same as above; major in whatever you want.  Here the goal is getting into a top firm, which is (sadly) somewhat dependent on attending a top law school.\n* Engineering.  This is somewhat similar to software; to max out compensation you likely need to move into management.  On the technical side, petroleum, computer engineering, and chemical seem to be the most lucrative, but I'd be leery of entering the oil and gas industry.\n* Finance/IB.  My knowledge is thin here.  I gather many students major in economics, but there are also highly technical roles in quantitative finance where you'd want to study something like applied mathematics or physics.",

They want people to use fossil fuels instead of alternative energy sources since that's what they produce.  They want to be able to drill wherever they want.  They want to be able to frack.  This results in the set of folks in that industry being somewhat more conservative/Republican than in other industries.  You may not care; some people do.",

Statistics, applied math, and careers out of that area often pay well too (actuary, data science, etc.), as do a number of engineering fields -- I like electrical engineering for the balance of good pay and job security.\n\nMost of those aren't going to be a path to incredible wealth -- the average software developer isn't working for Google or Facebook, and you are far more likely to find a starting salary around $75k then $150k.  They are jobs where average salaries are high and you can have a reasonably good chance at an upper middle class life.  I agree with a lot of the other posts that you shouldn't solely focus on making the most money, but it's perfectly fine to weigh career prospects as an important factor in your choices.\n\nI'll agree with some of the negatives about petroleum engineering that have been mentioned, but the biggest problem is the uncertainty -- it's a job market that is closely tied to the price of a single commodity, so there's a lot of inherent risk in that.",
