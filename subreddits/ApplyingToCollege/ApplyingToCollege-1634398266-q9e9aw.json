  "title:": "This piece on cutting down essays to fit the word count is exactly 650 words long",
  "text": "YoLet'sGo\n\n**1) Cognizantly write the essay you want to write, then deal with making it fit**\n\nYou have about a 25-30% buffer. So a 250-word piece can be around 325 words. And a 650 can be around 800. But mostly write then cut. Don't be checkingcheckingchecking while writing it sucks don't.\n\nAlso edit the essay independent of size. What you want is your very best, polished essay ready to go, only it's too long. That being said, part of editing naturally should involve cutting down stuff that sucks.\n\n**2) Permanently ignore anyone who recommends you start by creating contractions or removing words like \"that\" because that person has no fucking idea what they are talking about**\n\nThose strats butcher prose in the womb and also only save you like 15 words. Yours will probably be 100+ over. This guide assumes you are in that 25-30% over range, but up to 40% should be OK. The following strategies are in order of how much word cuttage you will see from it.\n\n**3) Begin by looking for entire paragraphs/sentences you can cut**\n\nYa, the entire thing. Often this will be a paragraph that either surmises info written elsewhere in the essay or isn't integral to the plot/your experience. It is often glaring the paragraph/sentence that simply isn't it. Slash it.\n\nThen take a look at your intro. Often students will double introduce an essay by having a tell paragraph followed by a show, \"I've long been fascinated by the study of Organic matter\u2026\" You just get to the fascination in paragraph two, bro.\n\nThat tell+show combo is usually what you want to keep looking for as you go through the work again. You only need one. The hack babies first writer's advice is to tell you to always cut the \"tell\" section. But no, telling kicks ass. I'm telling you that right now. It's up to you to make judgment calls on what version of the info best fits the work.\n\n**4) Cut or modify entire sentences that, while interesting, aren't integral to the narrative nor about you.**\n\nThese sentences tend to be perfectly fine writing. They're just long and could instead be short. Often they involve cutting out details or making actions more direct\n\n\"I glanced over the Email that announced the topic of that Tuesday's virtual assembly; it held nothing more than a name. Pip Harrington. I had heard the name before but didn't remember when, so I immediately turned to Google for answers.\"\n\n\\>>>>\n\n\"The day before Pip Harrington came to speak at my school, I turned to Google to learn more about him.\"\n\nYou won't enjoy doing this. The term is \"killing your children.\" But, if the primary reason a sentence exists is that you think it's clever or pretty, it has to go at this point. Maybe if you wanted to keep it you shouldn't have written so much to begin with, JENNIFER\n\nYou should be within 5-7% of the goal now. If not go back to 3 and run through the list again, only this time being more of a dick about it until you are.\n\n**6) Combine multiple clauses into a shorter one**\n\n\"I was in my dad's car, a used Toyota. The AC was broken.\"\n\n\"The AC was broken in my dad's Toyota\"\n\n**7) Finish by cutting lazy adverbs (essentially, obviously) and tightening up simple phrases**\n\n\"will gain a chance to\" >>> \"may\"\n\nRead [this](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/concise-writing/) and/or get Grammarly premium because it crushes here.\n\n...I like lazy adverbs :(\n\n**8) If you do it right, your piece should be 93%-102% as good as it was**\n\nI wish I could tell you that editing fifty bajillion of these things down would have shown me the power in tight editing. But no. Cutting word counts almost never makes an essay better or tighter. It just makes it shorter.\n\n...645! Just enough space for\n\n\\- Mattie",

By u/ScholarGrade, I think?\n\nLook at each sentence/word/paragraph/{other chunk of characters that count towards to word-limit}, and ask yourself, \"what does this tell the reader about me?\" If you cannot come up with an answer, consider deleting that segment.\n\nI reduced my Common App essay from about 1300 words to about 800 words easily because I am generally a verbose writer and had a lot of useless content.
