  "text": "Hey friends! \nI need some help. I am currently a junior. Right now my stats are good for most T20s or ivies and that\u2019s my dream. I really want to go to law school or med school and I believe I can do it, I love school. The problem is my parents don\u2019t take me seriously. My mom went to a small state school, my dad did not go to college, and my sister is going to a small non-competitive state school as well. \n\nWhenever I say I have to go home to study or finish an assignment, they laugh me off saying that I can just turn it in late or not get a good grade on the upcoming test. I know they want me to succeed but they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s gonna take to get there. As much as I\u2019ve tried to get them to understand they don\u2019t. \n\nAnother thing is that when my sister was a freshman in high school, she wanted to go ivy and be in that world (I blame her love of gossip girl) but she didn\u2019t do it cause she hated school and didn\u2019t work hard in her studies. I think my parents think my dreams are like the same as hers were, a non-serious pipe dream. \n\nIt\u2019s so difficult to be working so hard for my dreams and then to get laughed off. Any advice?",

      "text": "Stop talking to them about it (no support sucks but it\u2019s better than getting negativity)\n\nIf you have work to do and it\u2019s possible your parents might hold you hostage (when going out together), don\u2019t go. Make up an excuse they\u2019ll accept if that\u2019s what they need to hear to leave you.\n\nWhen I was going through junior/first half of senior year I went to bed around 6-7pm and got up around 2am. This solved a lot of social demands for me. And, bonus, in the quiet of the night, fully refreshed, I worked more efficiently.\n\nI got into my first choice college with no support. I just took full responsibility/control and aggressively protected/nourished my opportunity regardless of the circumstances I found myself in.\n\nYou\u2019re obviously smart & determined \u2014 you\u2019re going to find a way around this that works for you, just keeping trying ways around this and think outside the box if need be.",
