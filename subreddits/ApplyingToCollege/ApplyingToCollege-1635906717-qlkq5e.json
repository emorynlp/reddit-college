  "title:": "How significant are letters from colleges and waived application fees?",
  "text": "I took the ACT a couple weeks ago and got a pretty good score (in the 30\u2019s) and ever since, I\u2019ve received a ton of letters from a lot of different colleges (mostly random ones, but there have been some pretty decent ones in the mix), but today, I got one I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting. \n\nI got a letter from Harvard. My mom was so excited that she forced me to take a picture with the pamphlet. Basically, in the letter they said I would be a good fit at Harvard and other top schools, that they will waive my application fee, and provided me a booklet to prepare me for college.\n\nNow, I was just wondering, how significant is this, really? Like, does this mean they\u2019re taking special interest in me, or do they do this for a ton of students? My transcript isn\u2019t anything crazy except for a few AP classes, a solid (weighted) GPA, and a nice class rank, but I\u2019m not the super exceptional student you would think Harvard would have their eye on. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a black girl who wants to go into STEM that makes me stand out? I\u2019m not sure.\n\nBut yeah, if anyone could help me out with this and let me know if it\u2019s the equivalent to a mass email I\u2019d appreciate it!",
