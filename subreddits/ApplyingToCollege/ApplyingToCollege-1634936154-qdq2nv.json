There are a lot of T20s I would never go to because they would not help me advance my career the way I would like for it to be, I didn't apply to them for that reason and could never write a truly compelling why this school essay if I wanted to. I see what you're saying here and that's funny lol but if I was an AO, I'd make you (me from the past too) write this essay so that you knew what you signed up for and what you were getting into. All the best on your essays and apps, and I hope that the why school essay actually helps you realize why that school would/ would not be a good choice for you- it might help if you look at the essay, not as a chore but a part of your decision making!",
