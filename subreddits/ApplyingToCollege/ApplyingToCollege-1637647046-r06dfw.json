  "text": "Umm, I just realized I only put the ap tests I\u2019ve gotten scores for on the common app and forgot to input the ones that I will take. I\u2019m going to take 4 ap tests this year and have those corresponding ap classes in the senior class load page, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a big deal. Should i contact the colleges I\u2019ve sent my common app to and let them know I will be taking those 4 APs or just leave it be?",
