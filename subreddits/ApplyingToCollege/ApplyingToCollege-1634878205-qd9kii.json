  "text": "So I was previewing my application before submitting to a college, and in the \"Testing\" section it literally says \"There are no scores to report\" in the preview, but I've literally entered SAT, AP and TOEFL scores in there + \"Leaving Exams\" (they're a thing in India). Idk why it isn't showing up??????",
