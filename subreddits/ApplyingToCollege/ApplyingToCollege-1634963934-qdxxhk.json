  "text": "I'm seeking to apply to Macaulay Honors College but I'm having a really difficult time deciding on which campus to choose. How much does the home campus choice matter anyway? Like is the campus in terms of education going to matter a lot if I'm doing Macaulay? I'm looking for social sciences, perhaps going into something like environmental law and I really can't tell which of the campus options best fits that desires. Thanks for any help.",
