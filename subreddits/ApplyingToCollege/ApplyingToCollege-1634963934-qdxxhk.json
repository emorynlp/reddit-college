  "text": "I'm seeking to apply to Macaulay Honors College but I'm having a really difficult time deciding on which campus to choose. How much does the home campus choice matter anyway? Like is the campus in terms of education going to matter a lot if I'm doing Macaulay? I'm looking for social sciences, perhaps going into something like environmental law and I really can't tell which of the campus options best fits that desires. Thanks for any help.",

      "text": "The only reason the campus would matter is depending on what you want to do in the future or for grad school. For example, Baruch is known for business, Brooklyn for STEM/pre-health+medical route, John Jay for criminology and forensic science. \n\nThat being said, just cause one campus is known to specialize in something, doesn't mean you can't pursue the same on another campus. For example, I said Brooklyn was for STEM/pre-health+medical but I went to Queens College Macaulay and pursue the same track (pre-health) and now going on to graduate school. \n\nDo more research on the CUNY campuses and see what goes with your interest. Let me know if you have any more questions, I'm glad to help",
