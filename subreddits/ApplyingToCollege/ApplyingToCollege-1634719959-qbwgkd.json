  "text": "Hey all. I am not sure whether this is relevant to the subreddit. If it is not, I can take it down. Basically, my parents are unsure if my applying to (and potentially getting in) universities in the U.S. right after school will be the correct choice since according to them, I don't know much about how the world works.\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd74 Also, no one in their social circle or in our family has gone abroad for their undergraduate studies. Almost everyone they know has gone either for their masters or for a ph.d. They are also worried about any potential racism or homophobia I might face in an unknown country and they say they can't readily come to my help as opposed to my staying home. While I understand their concern, I also don't understand how to appease them. Any problems I might run into there can equally occur in India or even if I go for my masters. Also, I kinda think it's pointless to worry about things that hasn't happened yet or might never happen. However, I would like to hear any experiences from fellow Indians who are currently in universities in the U.S. just to show that they have got nothing to worry about.\n\nTl;dr: my parents are worried about me going away from home so quickly and I want some anecdotes or reassurances from fellow Indians to calm them down.",
