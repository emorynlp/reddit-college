  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to transfer colleges and was wondering if having various transcripts from different colleges is bad. I graduated with a 3.3 took summer classes at another college before graduating. (that's 2 different transcripts)\n\nI am now taking prerequisite at a different Community college (moved for some reason) in order to get a second bachelor but do not like the Community college and place I am currently at and would like to go back home. I was wondering if changing college \\*again\\* would penalize the admission office by seeing various transcripts from different institutions.\n\nAlso I don't know if it matters but my new gpa at the community college is 3.8 after I graduated.  All science and math classes as I would like to get into computer science.\n\nThank you for the advices. Much appreciated.",
