      "text": "Congrats! I did my undergrad at Georgia Tech (majored in Computational Media) and loved it! The classes were engaging (mostly), the people were nerdy and friendly, and the campus was beautiful. There\u2019s so much to do, both on campus and off. It was a great experience for me, all of which led me to the great career I have today. Here\u2019s my advice:\n\n1.\tJoin clubs and get involved. It helps your social life, and looks great on a resume. One of my favorites was VGDev, the video game development club. \n2.\tGet help before you need it. Georgia Tech is a tough school. Don\u2019t wait to ask for help when you\u2019re in trouble- go to office hours, lean on teachers/TAs/study-groups, and tutoring if needed. Myself and many of my classmates also developed depression and anxiety while there due to the pressure. Use the school therapists. They aren\u2019t great, but they\u2019re better than nothing. Avoid the group therapy if you can- it\u2019s awful.\n3.\tGo see the DragonCon parade at least once. It\u2019s amazing :)\n4.\tWhen you make your schedule, look at the locations. You cannot get from west campus to east campus in 10 minutes unless you run.\n5.\tTry to sign up for Health as a freshman. It\u2019s a requirement, but it fills up fast. Freshmen get priority, but after that you won\u2019t have high enough priority until you\u2019re a senior. And nobody wants to take a stupid health class as a senior\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more, but that\u2019s a start. Congrats again!!",
