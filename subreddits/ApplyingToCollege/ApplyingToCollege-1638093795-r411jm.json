  "text": "I have A and As level scores however, my concern  is that if Ox bridge or Lox-bridge looks at my HS grades and or GPA I'm screwed as they aren't the best to  put it lightly. (2.2-2.8 range) \n\nso my question is do your high school grades affect your chances at receiving an offer to Oxford, Cambridge, LSE and if so to what extent?",

      "text": "You said you have A levels so I assume you also have IGCSEs? If not then they will look at your transcript and regardless of any other factors they could reject you without an interview.\nIf your grades(IGCSE/AS/A levels) are within range according to the website and you do well in the entrance exam(if your subject has one) then you should expect an interview. Interview is the make or break. You can get in with a bad interview but even if the rest of your app is below average or not outstanding a good interview can get you in.",
