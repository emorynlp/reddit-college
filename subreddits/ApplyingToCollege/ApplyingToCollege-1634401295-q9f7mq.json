  "text": "I'll give you guys a rundown of who I have rn:\n\nMy junior year AP Bio teacher, who I know will be able to write a great rec cuz we were close.\n\nMy junior year APUSH teacher, who I wasn't that close with, but asked anyway for schools that require a history rec letter.\n\nAnd my freshman year Intro to Programming Teacher, who is the teacher I am probably closest with because we founded a club together.\n\nMy main concern is that if I submit the two that i really want, bio and into to programming, it might not look too good considering that they're both STEM subjects. And for schools that don't take more than two, I wouldn't be able to submit my APUSH one. Should I be worried or nah?",

      "text": "For schools that require two, see if they have additional specifications, as is sometimes the case. I would submit bio for schools that ask for one,  and bio and APUSH for schools that require two. Reasons: programming is outside of the core subjects and colleges are looking for junior year teachers.",
