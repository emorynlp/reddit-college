  "title:": "Question regarding UC English Language Requirements",
  "text": "Hola amigos,\n\nSo I\u2019m currently finishing up the last of my UC application. The UC course requirements state 4 years of high school level English are necessary. I\u2019ve taken 4 years of high school level English, but only 3 in high school, as one was taken in middle school. UC states that this class will not be accepted, as it was not completed in high school. That being said, for my sophomore and Junior year, I did take both AP English courses and exams, and got a 4 on each. I also took an English elective in the form of debate. Will these suffice, or am I SOL?\n\nThanks,\nBruh Momento",

So English I was taken in 8th, but written as 9th, II in 9th but listed as 10th, Lang in 10th but listed as 11th and so on. I have the emails saved, but I still dont feel totally confident in this solution.",
