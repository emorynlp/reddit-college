  "title:": "Question about dropping classes senior year",
  "text": "So this past semester was the first time in over 2 years that I had in-person school. \n\nTaking AP Calc AB and physics. Im decent at math but right now it's killing me in those two classes.  I have a D and a F with a month and a half left. \n\nI have genuinely tried to work harder and ask more questions, but it's still not reflecting on my grade. I have done early admissions for all my schools and was thinking of either drop or accept fate with the score. \n\n\nShould I keep the semester going and justify my grades or something else entirely?",

              "text": "First, I assume you are saying Early Action admissions for all schools, not Early Decision?\n\nColleges like to see kids challenge themselves especially because in college it will get more challenging depending on the pathway you take. If you drop and take easier courses, they may call you out. If you stick and can pull them up somehow (meet with teachers after class for extra help), that would be a talking point in your favor. \n\nWhat does your college counselor say?",
