  "text": "So this past semester was the first time in over 2 years that I had in-person school. \n\nTaking AP Calc AB and physics. Im decent at math but right now it's killing me in those two classes.  I have a D and a F with a month and a half left. \n\nI have genuinely tried to work harder and ask more questions, but it's still not reflecting on my grade. I have done early admissions for all my schools and was thinking of either drop or accept fate with the score. \n\n\nShould I keep the semester going and justify my grades or something else entirely?",
