  "text": "What background should indigenous people of other countries put down in the Common App race section? I'm not Native American or Alaskan Native, and I'm not sure if I should put down Australian under Pacific Islander because most people think of the British when they see Australian. Should I put down Austronesian instead, even though that's not technically a country, or how should I specify that I'm indigenous?\n\nEdit: Just adding the comment below because it might make things a bit more clear!\n\n\"- op please clarify if I'm wrong but the whole point of this post is that you don't identify as white, your family doesn't identify as white, you've never identified as white.\n\n\\- Yes, that's what I mean. However, the problem is when I put Australian, people think that means I'm White, and I don't know how I can specify otherwise. I wrote in my original post that I didn't know much about my family's history, but I think people thought I meant I'm putting down Australian just because I could be, but what I meant was that I couldn't point out a specific tribe or anything.\"",

A very few extend to Canada's First Nations.",

Personally, I would not try to stretch Indiginous Australian into the mix solely based on apocryphal stories or DNA testing if you've never identified yourself that way before.\n\nIf you have always identified as Indigenous Australian, then check other and fill in the blank",
