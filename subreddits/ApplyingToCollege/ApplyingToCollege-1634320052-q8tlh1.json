  "text": "Afternoon, because good and thriving is my anxiety. Sorry, I tend to resort to bad black humor when in distress. Mmm I feel as if I\u2019m walking on air? The college process is getting more serious than ever. I made my list very meticulously but then, I never calculated anything via net price since it isn\u2019t/ wasn\u2019t available for internationals. Always said the same. I have my college list, have been kind of pressured from a college to apply (check the post before this one) and I feel as if I won\u2019t get in anywhere and if I do, the financial aid won\u2019t be enough since I need a full ride. I kind of think I\u2019m stretching my chances and wondering if I\u2019m self-sabotaging. I definitely want to go to the states and get a good scholarship and study what I\u2019ve in mind, but then, am I on the right path? I\u2019ve 2/3 LORs, my essay is almost done and I\u2019ll start on supplementals once that\u2019s done. I was confident, but now I\u2019m not? Senioritis, school, covid, ECs, contests and else seem like too much, and whenever I take a break it isn\u2019t a break bc I\u2019m still thinking about how I\u2019ve things to do and can\u2019t rest properly. I take weekends off but even then, I don\u2019t rest. I used to have a system for this, I\u2019d journal and read and do good things, but now I can\u2019t seem to find the motivation for any of it.",
