I spoke about my aspirations in life, the people that caused that aspiration, and how it led to my choice for NYU (mostly cuz it\u2019s a good school that grants me fantastic ability to make connections). Worked out great! \n\nKeep in mind that I had a low GPA for NYU (3.2/4 unweighted) with a high SAT (1520). My situation is somewhat unique, and my take on the \u2018Why ____\u2019 essay may not work for you. I encourage you to spend a little time thinking over what\u2019s important to you personally.",

In this case, if you were my student and I was reviewing your response, I would ask you to talk more about why the liberal arts are important to you - specifically at Columbia. Are there any specific professors that you would love to take a class from? They already know they are in New York and a great majority of the planet wants to live there, so personally, I would recommend you don't really talk about that as much.",

Colleges want their students to learn from each other and teach each other both inside and outside of the classroom.  Part of what they are looking for in this prompt is what those things look like for you.  You can help your chances and make your response stronger by trying to show some of this.  Note that this should be specific and detailed, not \u201cI will make an impact\u201d or \u201cI will engage the community\u201d or \u201cI am a great fit for this school.\u201d  Show how those things are true and let the reviewer come to those broader conclusions on their own.",
