That shift came later and is mainly one of retrofitting. \n\nSome that come to mind as best managed in their environments are easily Michigan Tech, which has a STARS silver rating for the entire campus and is located on Portage Lake, and a stone\u2019s throw from Lake Superior. It is also a great place (arguably one of the best) to learn about sustainability due to the extensive mining that occurred in the region up until the 1960s, so field trips to former industrial sites (and superfund sites) is easy. \n\nFor a smaller campus that lives more with the land, I would say to check out either Northland College or Lake Superior State as well. \n\nBut by strict definition, I believe the only one truly \u201cinspired you nature\u201d would have been The School of Architecture prior to 2020 when it was housed at Taliesen and Taliesen West. Though it was only a graduate school and only taught architecture.",
