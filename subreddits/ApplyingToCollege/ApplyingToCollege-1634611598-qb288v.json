  "text": "Hey there,\n\nLast year, during my junior year of high school(online), I made a huge mistake that I deeply regret. I was caught cheating on a test by my physics teacher. That class was quite difficult no matter what I did. With all the problems that came from being isolated all day, I chose the cowardly, easy way out. However, my physics teacher was kind enough to settle the matter privately with me, not involving the administration or my counselor, and I received an F on the test. I definitely learned my lesson.\n\nThe incident has not been recorded on my disciplinary record and as far as I know, my counselor is unaware that this happened. However, when I started filling out the common app, this question appeared:\n\n\"Have you ever been found responsible for a disciplinary violation at any educational institution you have attended from the 9th grade (or the international equivalent) forward, whether related to academic misconduct or behavioral misconduct, that resulted in a disciplinary action?\"\n\nI'm not sure how to answer this since while I did technically get caught cheating, the incident never went on my disciplinary record; admin and counseling were never contacted. How should I answer this question? I want to be as honest as I should be, but I also don't want to shoot my application in the foot. I also don't want to say yes unless I can do so with absolute certainty that this incident won't come back to haunt me. This has been weighing on me heavily for a while. Safe to say, I've definitely learned my lesson and cheating is not something I will ever do again. No more shortcuts for this guy. Let me know what yall think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I am on great terms with my physics teacher now and he is helping me with a personal project involving a drone! I am eternally grateful to him for showing me the error of my ways.\n\nEdit: thank you all for your responses. I appreciate you taking the time to answer.",

Since it\u2019s not on your record, I would just leave it be and not bring it up. Good luck and I\u2019m glad you had a compassionate response from your teacher.",
