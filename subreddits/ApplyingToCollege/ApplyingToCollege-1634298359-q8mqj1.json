  "text": "Hi guys, I\u2019m risking my chances and putting my app in the line by doing this, but curiosity killed the cat. I\u2019m applying to Hult Intl Business School for the Nov 01 deadline. Thing is, they\u2019re the only college that has reached out to me, given me info, followed up a bit much (with different admissions officers) and then pressured me a bit into applying. It\u2019s confusing because what they say isn\u2019t always aligned with the common app info. Regardless, what I wanna ask about is: what do you think of it? Is it worth it? Have any of you have bad experiences with them? I found a YouTube video I\u2019ll link below where a girl posts all the good and bad things, but there are more bad than good. In the comments, tons of people go on about how it\u2019s a scam, not worth it, only care for your money and more things. As an international, it\u2019s imperative for me to go to a nice place, not only in terms of education but college culture. Help me out pls",

Then as they kept on contacting me and my family I was like \u201cwtf, this is too intense, back off\u201d. People told me I was being ungrateful and that people would kill for those opportunities and whatnot. Yesterday , they contacted me again with a newer deadline (before Nov01) about some documents. I felt rushed but excited? I seriously don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to go to a college where they don\u2019t care about me, but at the same time, I don\u2019t wanna miss out",
