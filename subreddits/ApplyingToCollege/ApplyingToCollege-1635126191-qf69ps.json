  "text": "I\u2019ve recently been very confused about what I would like to major in. I\u2019ve used google but couldn\u2019t find straightforward answers so I decided to ask on Reddit. \n\nI\u2019m interested in social and environmental problems/issues. Also sustainable development. I don\u2019t want to stick to one side ex: environmental science or sociology.\nI also would like to have a BS. It\u2019s sooo difficult to find the right one.\n\nIs there anyone who happens to study anything that would fit my preferences?\n(If this is worded out poorly please excuse me)",

      "text": "The University of Vermont is an outdoor lover's paradise, in regards to academics, as well as the campus/town/vibe/surrounding area. \n\nIt's quite easy & common to double major at the University of Vermont, so what you could do is a major in Environmental Studies (B.S.) and a major in Sociology (B.S.), or something like that.\n\n**Here's a list of their environmental-related majors:**\n\nParks, Recreation, and Tourism (B.S.), Environmental Engineering (B.S.), Environmental Sciences (B.S.), Environmental Studies (B.S.)\n\n**And their Sociology/Development-related majors:**\n\nSustainable Business (B.S.), Community & International Development (B.S.)\n\n\\-----\n\nMany schools allow students to take double majors, so you could take both environmental science *and* sociology if you'd like. I just gave UVM as an example because it's a nature-lover's paradise and because the Rubenstein School *(linked below)* is one of the most well-known Environmental-Related Undergrad Schools in the country.\n\n[https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr](https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr)\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck! :)",

              "text": "Nope, if you double major it's the same cost of attendance as long as you don't drag out graduation for an extra year LOL (don't be like my oldest brother. he took 5.5 years to graduate, and he took ONE major lmao.)\n\nIt generally just entails taking different classes to fulfill the major requirements. Some majors have overlap in classes (environmental science and environmental studies probably) so it's often a lot easier than you might think to double major.\n\nBest of luck. :)\n\nAnd if you're an environment/nature lover: **CU Boulder** *(beware- costs $52,000 to attend as a non-Colorado resident)*, **Cornell, UVM** *(beware- costs between $41,000 to $61,000 to attend as a non-Vermont resident),* **Connecticut College, U of Oregon, UC Santa Cruz** *(beware- costs $68,000 to attend as a non-California resident)*, **Champlain College, Colorado College, Montana State, Appalachian State, Penn State, Most rural liberal arts colleges in the Northeast,** and **U of Washington** would all be schools to perhaps consider. *(They're all sustainable-minded, and have an abundance of outdoor activities nearby.)*",
