  "text": "I'm applying to a specialized college majors they start taking applications in November and stop in March. I plan on applying as soon as the application submission opens. I'm already struggling from the anxiety of not knowing whether or not I got in. I would also like to know before March because it affects where I'll move and the classes I'll take spring semester. I know every college is different but I was wondering if anyone else applied for a certain major and if they got accepted before the submission deadline. I reached out to the program director to ask and was ignored.",
