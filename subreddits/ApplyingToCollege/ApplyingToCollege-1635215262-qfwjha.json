  "text": "I will be applying to all my schools before any of my grades for senior year are put on my transcript. I currently have a 3.91 unweighted and a 4.3 weighted. I don\u2019t think this matters but I am expecting on getting a 4.6 weighted this semester and 4.0 unweighted. Should I put weighted or unweighted on my apps? I\u2019d imagine this wouldn\u2019t matter much, if at all since they can see my courses and transcript anyways. Thanks in advance\ud83d\udc4d",
