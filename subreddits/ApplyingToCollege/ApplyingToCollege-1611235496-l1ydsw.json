Some awards are easily searched, and depending on what your teachers and counselor say in their rec letters, the game can be given up easily.\n\nThis is especially true if you overstate involvement in an activity you are known for, as teachers are likely to mention your actual level of involvement in rec letters (at least the good ones will).",

There was the Grinell student athlete who told the dean of admissions that he was being recruited by other colleges without realizing the dean knew the coaches the student mentioned and quickly uncovered the lies. There are also plenty of stories about colleges doing random checks when things don't add up and/or to prevent people from lying on their applications. They can't catch everything but if you get caught then you're admissions can be rescinded and depending on the lie you may have some legal issues on your hands. Just don't lie.

If it's not something that significant and you fake it chances are its not showing up on in your essays or letters of recommendation ( you could lie about it on your essays but unless you're particularly good at that sort of writing people can tell when someone doesn't sound super sincere about a particular experience , or it doesn't come out as good as those writing from genuine experience).\n\n\nIf it's not significant enough to be verified like that and not showing up anywhere else on your app then it's likely not going to make a major difference to your application. I don't know in what cases do admissions officers follow up with one's school to confirm if a person has lied about activities , but even if they don't these factors would likely result in an application that's inferior to one's with genuine activities, hence you wind up with a rejection or a waitlist.",

It\u2019s definitely ridiculous that my school expected all of us to get 100 hours, but they actively tried to help us reach that goal. Teachers even offered to let students grade papers in class for volunteer hours. But I knew people who faked 200+ hours just to look better than everyone else.",

If fake , then unless you've conspired with your teachers and college counselor, they won't be speaking to your involvement in those activities in your letters of recommendation.  chances are you won't elaborate upon a fake activity in your essays and would choose to focus on stuff that's important to you. Even if you did do so , unless you're really good at sort of writing , it's unlikely to be as good as those writing from experience.\n\n\n\nSo if you fake an insignificant activity that doesn't get elaborated upon anywhere in your application then it won't boost your chances of getting in. \n\nWorst , You run the risk of getting caught and in some cases possibly disadvantage yourself . For example if you want to lie about having worked in an old age home , and they get applicants with a similiar activity except it's featured better in their essays and backed up by references ,you're going to look less competitive in comparison. At the more selective schools chances any community service you can fake they probably have atleast one other applicant doing that activity on steroids ( e.g. you faking an old age home volunteer experience vs some kid that made headlines by  creating  a program in their city that takes care of old people and helps them find employment )",
