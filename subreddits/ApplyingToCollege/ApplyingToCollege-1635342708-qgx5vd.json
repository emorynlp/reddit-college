My teachers wrote a decent letter with school english teacher but I am worried if colleges call them to verify, it may be troublesome. I hold all of the required certificates personally. Its just those teachers are not very likely to be able to respond appropriately, especially maths teacher who is basically old enough to barely manage using common app. I am worried about that?",

          "text": "The words are true and so are the recommenders, I suspect that contacting the teacher on spot may raise issues. Since one of the teachers is very old and I dont want to say it, boderline senile. Them being contacted worries me.\n\n\nDo they even contact international schools?\n\nI meant certificates as proof of activities and internships.\n\nAlso i personally know their process, my school basically has a LOR writer who takes bragsheets, verifies it and fills it up for said teachers. Which means the recommenders arent directly involved. That worries me",
