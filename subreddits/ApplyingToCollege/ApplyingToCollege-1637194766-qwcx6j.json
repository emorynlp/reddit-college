  "text": "Like every day I feel more and more certain I have absolutely no chance. Looking back, I now realize how lame my essays and activities sound and all the ways I could have reworded them to sound much stronger. My interview is this weekend and I'm just thinking why even bother trying if I know I'm not getting accepted.",

      "text": "i do feel pretty discouraged about it, but every time i mention it to anyone they say that \u201cyou get what you put out into the world\u201d meaning if i act like im not gonna get in/think i have no chance, im gonna receive that and i guess that has def helped me be a little less negative about it and try to be hopeful yk? Like either way im gonna get into a college, and itll be a college I like and chose. And if the college doesn\u2019t accept me, maybe the college wasn\u2019t perfect for me yk? Idk if that helped but i hope it did a little lol",
