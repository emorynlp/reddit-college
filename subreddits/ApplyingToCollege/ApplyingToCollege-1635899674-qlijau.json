  "text": "To provide more detail, I already meet the requirements for these awards (one is school-level and the other is regional), but will not receive them until later this year. On my Common App, I wrote that I was a \"Prospective Recipient of XXX Award\". Since submitting my Nov 1 applications, I've started to worry about this. Should I have done that? Would it be considered \"lying\" on my application? What should I do if it was a bad choice?\n\nEdit: Upon checking my application, one of the awards does not have the \"Prospective Recipient\" and just has the name of the award.",
