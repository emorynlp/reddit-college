      "text": "I don\u2019t think you have to worry at all. I think it depends on what school ur applying to, what you actually get in the class and on the exam, and whether or not you are directly competing with the seniors who are taking more and more classes\n\nChances are you aren\u2019t competing directly with them - so you\u2019re most definitely not gonna look like you\u2019re slacking. Even if you were, doubt anyone would look at 3 ap classes as slacking. If anything, if you have more time to focus on those classes, theoretically you could do better in them then 6 or 7 AP classes where you stress yourself out and are falling behind. \n\nUr fine tho, I wouldn\u2019t worry at all lol",
