  "text": "I got a survey from my ED school that said to take their survey because they request feedback, and when I clicked on it it was titled \u201cSurvey of Admitted Students Spring 2021\u201d. Their decisions don\u2019t come out till Dec 15 though, so I think it might be a glitch. Any admitted students got emails like this before?",
