Can you help me here with an answer to a few questions?\n\nDo you use some services like google docs or notion for study? And if so, for what purpose?\n\nI'll provide all survey participants with free access to use the service.\n\nThank you so much for your attention and participation. :)",

Gdrive is also centralized, which is great because I am always way too lazy to transfer files when I move from an old laptop to a new one lol\n\nI don't use Notion too much, but I do use it to track tasks (I use a template) and, very rarely, take notes.",

      "text": "I've never heard of notion, so I use Google docs most of the time for homework. I've also grown to be a big fan of Google jam board for studying + homework because our school's new Chromebooks are touchscreen, and it allows me to keep my notes and practice quizzes in one place. It's also easier for math than Google docs, in my opinion. When I have checklists of what I need to do for homework, I use Google keep because I can color-code notes easily, and the checklist function works much better.",
