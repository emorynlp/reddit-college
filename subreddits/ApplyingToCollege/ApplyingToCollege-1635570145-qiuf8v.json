  "text": "have everything ready for uchicago. because it seemed like a reach that i really liked.  not unreasonable reach.  (thought it was a big reach for the longest time)\n\nbut now i'll forever think: could i have gotten into stanford.  \n\napplying to college is hard for non domestic.  having no context of where you stand, where you can go, what schools you can try for.  so you can only kind of guess.  no alumi from your high school to reference.  not knowing how good your ecs compare to the american ones.  even, not knowing how your grades compare.  seeing other profiles only helps to a certain extent, because its presented from such a 'good' perspective.  sometimes i wish i could have a scale that i can put myself on to really know: where do i stand?\n\nmaybe its the self deprication, not really understanding where i stand, my guidance also unfamiliar with the profiles for those schools.  but ive always felt, just the slightest incompetent for everything.  maybe i sometimes subconsiously know that im doing alright, but will deny it because self deprication be like that and not wanting to be a pretentious person.  its scarier to be overconfident than underconfident.\n\nbut i guess i might never know.  \n\ni'll still do uchicagos ed because i want to.  i also have no excuse to back out at this point. i dont want to give it up and maybe end up with nothing in return.  \n\nis this all kind of petty? maybe.  but i guess im just an overthinker and anxious.\n\nif you just think im being annoying or stupid then just dont comment lol",
