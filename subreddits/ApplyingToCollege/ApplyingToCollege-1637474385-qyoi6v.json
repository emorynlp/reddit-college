  "text": "apparently ucs dont provide financial aid to internationals, and without aid its \\~70k USD per year. i cant really pay that much, and even if somehow manage to do it i'll end up feeling guilty about spending that much. should i even bother applying? if it helps, i have a 1490 sat score (first attempt, idk if that makes a difference), fine grades in all classes throughout hs, but super weak ec's (im in india studying for jee lol). if i dont apply, i can save on the application fees and apply to a couple other colleges.",
