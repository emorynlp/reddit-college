  "title:": "Is anyone else's parents getting way too involved in choosing a college?",
  "text": "My parents are super adamant that I go to the same college that they went to, but I've lived in this college's town for like 6ish years at this point. It's a good college, but definitely not as rigorous as I would like. So, I'm applying to other places out of state. My parents somewhat entertain that idea, but for some reason don't want me going anywhere else unless I can get a full ride. I could potentially be okay with that if they were paying for my college, but they're not. I am going to be paying for EVERYTHING myself. Which is why it makes me so angry that they're trying to control my future so much. I'm not sure why they're so attached to the idea of me going to this college and at this point it's genuinely draining. Is anyone else's parents doing this? Please tell me I'm not the only one lol",

      "text": "If you are paying for college entirely by yourself, you may not be able to afford the local college anyway, unless you have a very low expected contribution and the college meets full financial aid, or you'd get big merit *(and also live at home? Is this what's on their mind?)*. Your ability to borrow on your own is limited to federal student loans, about 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years. Larger loans require a parent signature (go against parent credit) and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIt sounds like you'll need to plan the financial angle very carefully. With the caveat that you need parent cooperation to apply for need-based financial aid, first see whether you are eligible. Run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.* Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for you. Note automatic scholarship deadlines, as some might be earlier than the RD deadline.",

              "text": "That depends on the college and on the scholarship in question. Check the scholarship webpage and, if it's not clear, ask the scholarship office. Most merit scholarships do not require financial aid forms, though there are a few out there that do require the forms even though the scholarship is not need-based, usually to rule out Pell eligibility. (Scholarships that also have a need component obviously also require financial aid forms.)",
