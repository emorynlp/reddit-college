  "text": "I had my Harvard interview last week and my interviewer started by asking me how many students of the entire pool of Harvard applicants I think are qualified to attend. I said 50%, thinking it was generous. He told me it's 85%. \n\nI checked it out, it's written in the interviewer handbook that was released in the affirmative action lawsuit. Just think about that for a second. 17/20 of you are qualified *in the eyes of the Harvard admissions team* but they can only accept less than 1/20. \n\nNow, I could talk about how rigged the system is or how some people have an advantage over others, but what's the point. The point is that 80% of applicants will find success somewhere else and so will the other 15%. Don't let a school name define who you want to be and who you are. Of course, going to an Ivy League school might help you, but if being accepted to that school is what it takes for you to try hard, maybe you're looking in the wrong direction. \n\nThe admission process is super ambiguous and there's not a single thing that can do that will 100% guarantee an admission, especially in the T-20s. But you can be happy with yourself and satisfied in knowing that you tried your best. So keep your head up because you've got this. Even Harvard knows it :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Here](https://www.advancingjustice-la.org/sites/default/files/%28419-55%29%20SEALED%20HARV00001392-1438%20Interviewer%20Handbook%202014-2015%20%28002%29.pdf) is the handbook if you guys want to learn about the Harvard admission process and interview process.",

In the past few weeks, I came to a realisation that no matter where I get accepted or the line I end up choosing, I have equal opportunities. I can make an equally good career in my home country as well. The worst is when people decide to stop learning, there is no one way to having a successful/happy life.",
