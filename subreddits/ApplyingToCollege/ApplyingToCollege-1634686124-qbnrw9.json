  "text": "Hi guys! I am planning on applying to neu ED with a combined major in CS and Journalism. I wanted to know which college I should apply to to increase my chances of admission? I know there was a small data leak on here that stated that the CS acceptance is actually higher than CAMD but I am sure that applicants applying to Khoury will be more competitive... Thanks!!",
