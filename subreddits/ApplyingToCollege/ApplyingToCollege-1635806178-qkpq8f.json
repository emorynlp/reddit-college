  "title:": "Should I Worry about an AP Score if it was an exam relating to my planned major?",
  "text": "I want to major in economics and I self-studied for the AP Micro exam. I kind of studied super last minute (lol) and got a 3. I don\u2019t want to self report that score since that\u2019s my planned major but AP scores are included on my transcript. My counselor already submitted my transcript through the Common App, though. \n\nShould I worry about this score? Will it negatively impact my application if it\u2019s a 3 when I want to major in that subject, even if I self studied for the exam?\n\nI know lots of people say that AP scores don\u2019t really matter much for admissions but I\u2019m just worried if it does matter if it\u2019s a subject relating to your planned major.",
