It will take a while for the essay to have a high search index in google (no one will search the 40th page for an essay). The timeframe of its publication is also too short assuming you're applying ED. Worst case scenario the admissions committee will let you know ahead of time about the mishap. \n\nYou shouldn't be worried about sending essays online. We've received hundreds from reddit alone and a lot of other people use online services to improve their essays.",
