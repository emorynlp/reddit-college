  "text": "Hi,  I am an international student. Universities that say they won't look at test scores in terms of admission, are they just saying it for the media, or do they actually mean it?  I have 2 4s 1 5 on the AP tests plus a strong C.V, the only problem is my SAT score I just scored 1440 which I know is not enough for the IVY leagues and I'm confused about what to do. Please help me out!",

      "text": "If you are applying to a test-optional school, the rule of thumb would be to not report a score below a certain threshold. Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My general opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th. Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/.\r  \n\r  \nKeep in mind that acceptance rates for internationals at top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\n\"Won't look at test scores\" refers only to those apps that were submitted without scores. They do look at scores of those who choose to admit. (That is, test optional is not test blind.)",
