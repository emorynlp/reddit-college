      "text": "my classes are still all virtual so I emailed + asked if they needed anything from me. both teachers agreed to write me a LOR. I structured it like \"would you be at all interested in writing me a LOR\"\n\nif you're in person it's always better to have that face to face connection. ask in office hours. \n\none of my teachers was pretty transformative in my work and mindset so I also asked her if I could come to her office hours in the email. she sent me link and office hours so I'm going today to explain some things that I hope she writes about in the LOR.\n\nother teacher just asked for a 'brag sheet' which at our school is just a list of things we've done. I don't expect much from him-he was a teacher I asked bc I have no otuers and I'm just hoping and praying- so this was OK for me and I didn't ask for office hours.",
