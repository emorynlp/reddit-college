  "title:": "is my application still considered early or regular?",
  "text": "so basically i finished my common app on the 29th without my counselor and teacher recs because 2 of the colleges i was applying to had a priority action deadline on the 31st and early action deadline on Nov 1st. I told my counselor and teachers that they had until the 15th of november to submit recs (because a program i want to get into at the 3rd college i applied to\u2019s deadline is Nov. 15th.) Is my application still considered early (for the first 2 colleges mentioned that i applied to) because i submitted beforehand or regular since it\u2019s incomplete? is it an issue to submit applications early but get teacher recs later on?",

I can say that *usually* there are a few weeks grace period for those letters but definitely not guaranteed since it\u2019s school-dependent.",
