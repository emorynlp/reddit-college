      "text": "Oxford is between \u00a327,840 and \u00a339,010 for international students, tuition only. Tbf that still makes it cheaper than many ivy leagues for international students, but it's not cheap. Course is only three years though, so you'd save money there. \n\nTo answer the OP, it depends on if you know what singular course you want to study, or if you want lib arts/sciences. That's the main difference, though university life is very different in the two countries as well.",
