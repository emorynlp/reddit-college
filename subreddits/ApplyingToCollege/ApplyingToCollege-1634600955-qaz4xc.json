  "text": "Hi everyone, first post here. \n\nI, like most people here, have been furiously writing supplementals for the last month or so and I'm almost through with my list of colleges. (MIT, UPENN, UCLA, UC Berkely, UTexas, Perdue, Georgia Tech, Texas A&M)  \n\nI am thoroughly burnt out, not just from the application process, but from doing all of the BS to put on the resume and whatnot. \n\nI've got a 1560 SAT, 35 ACT, 3.93/4 GPA, 14 APs which are 4s or 5s (technically 8 so far but im taking 6 more), and a solid resume.\n\nI noticed cornell doesnt have any suplemental essays, and for 75$, I can get another top college on the list with no additional effort. There is a chance I dont get into any of my top schools as its a lottery basically so I want to have some insurance in case I get unlucky. If money isnt a concern, Is there any merit in just shotgunning at good schools without suplementals.",

      "text": "Cornell has 1 or 2 essays, depending on which school you select.\n\nIt also is ED, as is Penn, so your application strategy is unclear. You can\u2019t ED to two school.\n\nDoes Cornell (or the others) offer what you are looking for, or are you just throwing applications at famous names?\n\nPerdue is a chicken, not a University.
