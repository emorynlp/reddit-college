  "text": "Y\u2019all I\u2019ve always had my heart set on going out of state, but I visited UVA today and I\u2019m in love?? Charlottesville is so cute and there\u2019s so many stores around (which I appreciate as a NoVa gal). I walked around and I could really picture myself there. It was kinda crazy. I\u2019ve been to other colleges, but it didn\u2019t really feel the same idk. POINT IS you should tour before ruling anything out because you might be surprised \ud83d\ude0c",
