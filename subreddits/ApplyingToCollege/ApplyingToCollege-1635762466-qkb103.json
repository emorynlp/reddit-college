  "title:": "Do Americans See Stanford In League of HYP?",
  "text": "HI, I'm an international from Singapore but have lived in the UK for the better part of my life. I've been somewhat surprised to see all the praise Stanford gets in this subreddit. Outside of the US, Stanford doesn't have nearly the same cachet as Yale/Princeton, and certainly has much less of a cachet than Harvard. I was wondering whether people in the US actually see Stanford in this level, and it is only outside of the US that doesn't know that Stanford is that good? Even for technology, we usually saw MIT as the undisputed best. Stanford seemed to be more like UChicago, UPenn (non-Wharton), etc. Below HYP, MIT, and Columbia. \n\nOr is it just because many people in this subreddit are in California? I know that Stanford is populated mostly by Californians, like Berkeley, is that why this subreddit talks about Stanford so much?",

Among HYPSMC:\n\n* Harvard, MIT, Stanford are clearly the most \"prestigious\". \n* Harvard for anything humanities related, MIT for \"hard\" science, and Stanford for \"softer\" science. \n* I think we see those 3 as equally prestigious, but MIT as the most difficult to get into.\n* People mistake Columbia for a country, until you tell them what it is/or that you go there and then they'd be quite impressed.\n* Princeton and Yale are great, but less name recognition than HSM.\n\nSo in terms of prestige perhaps M> H = S (but you'd be entirely right to see them as completely equal) > P > Y = Wharton (?) >>>C >>>>>>>> the others",

Below that, if we exclude MIT because of its STEM focus, then most people view Stanford as being in roughly the same category as Yale, Princeton and Columbia.  Of the few I metrics I looked at, Columbia didn't outperform Stanford on any of them.",
