What they are looking for IMO is someone who has explored or looked through the campus offerings, colleges, interdisciplinary programs, infrastructure and surrounding city who then explains how they envision themselves at Penn. For example, Penn is unique; it is essentially a huge rectangle; on the perimeter it has 2 major hospitals a major law school, a great vet and dental schools and the 4 pre-professional colleges within.  It is a liberal arts college and professional oriented colleges surrounded by a lot of professional and grad schools schools in the middle of a major City..  I think it is looking for you to be creative as to how you might apply your interests and passions there and if you are excited about it and why.",
