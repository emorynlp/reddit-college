It also kind of depends on what your major is and what schools you are applying too. For example, I had a 1520 with a 760 in both sections. I want to be a CS major and am applying to Harvey Mudd and MIT which want students to have at least a 780 on math. So I retook the SAT one more time but only did like 5 hours of prep. The math section was much easier in the October SAT while the reading and writing  section had less of a curve. This led me to get a 800 in math but a 730 in reading and writing. I then superscored and got a 1560! Because of this, I believe people should retake the SAT one more time after getting a 1500 since variations in the difficulty and curve may lead you to be able to get a good boost in your SAT score.",

If you would have asked 5 months ago, I\u2019d say take it again - mainly for merit scholarship consideration. (You say the T20 is his goal, but I\u2019d argue that a T50 with a huge scholarship is better than a T20 with tons of loans.)\n\nAll that doesn\u2019t matter as his only focus now should be on applications.",
