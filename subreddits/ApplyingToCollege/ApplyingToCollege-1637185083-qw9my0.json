  "text": "There are protests on campus to demand better safety for students, as ***three students have been shot and killed*** this year so far.\n\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-university-of-chicago-student-rally-shooting-response-20211117-szbvysl6vvdahbv6qnez4xrfle-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-university-of-chicago-student-rally-shooting-response-20211117-szbvysl6vvdahbv6qnez4xrfle-story.html)\n\n[https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2021/11/16/university-of-chicago-protest-violence/](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2021/11/16/university-of-chicago-protest-violence/)\n\nFaculty of the university also wrote [this letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QIsZRyQaMLvJH3Qgi7NFIv4M_QrW9-HECupujVF9AzI/edit) to the university president and administration.\n\nThere are a lot of conversations happening around gentrification, crime, social justice, and more. I am *not* trying to paint a negative light on the city of Chicago, as I've heard great things about the city and know that the crime that often hits the news is concentrated in a select few neighborhoods. But there's a lot of talk about how the university and the administration purposefully obscures just how dangerous the community around campus can sometimes be (apparently some armed burglaries or muggings won't even warrant a campus crime alert), and many have called out students/admins who downplay the safety issues by turning it into a race/privilege issue (even when they themselves are speaking from places of immense privilege and are often just trying to be performative).\n\nIt is hard to get an accurate feel for just how safe/unsafe UChicago can be because the promoters of the school are so vocal in their stance, and I've heard both opinions (some saying that they don't feel safe at the school, others saying that they feel extremely safe and anyone who disagrees is problematic).",

      "text": "I've posted much of this before, but...\n\nThe truth is bad. In addition to three students/recent grads being shot, a university employee was [recently robbed at gunpoint](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-university-chicago-staffer-robbed-20211111-qmqh4ff7pzbs7eklw53a43s5r4-story.html). The response from the university has been the standard response issued for years -- except they have yet to remind students to be vigilant/aware of their surroundings and say they are increasing patrols \\[in cars, not on foot\\].\n\nOften, these events are accompanied by the university noting that crime in Hyde Park is lower than in much of the city and especially the north Side neighborhoods often compared to Hyde Park. That is true... but misleading. Most people don't care about pickpocketing, street scams, or the like; they care about violent crime. If you look at violent crime per capita ([https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/police/data\\_information/crime\\_trends/](https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/police/data_information/crime_trends/), police precinct map here: [https://home.chicagopolice.org/community-policing-group/community-map/](https://home.chicagopolice.org/community-policing-group/community-map/) ), the areas safer than Hyde Park are... O'Hare Airport, all of the North and Northwest Side neighborhoods (apart from the downtown areas) -- and the far SW side (like suburbs) and the area near Midway Airport. It is not true to claim Hyde Park is safer if we define safe as avoiding violent crime.\n\nWorse still: the numbers for the downtown areas are skewed because they have large numbers of pedestrians (workers, shoppers) who are far larger than their resident populations. If we normalize crimes in those areas for typical populations of people present, we see that Hyde Park is not safer than *any* of the North Side or downtown neighborhoods. For neighborhoods which are not poor, Hyde Park is probably the most dangerous.\n\nThe university may finally address this: some of the faculty names on that petition are people who never protest and rarely get upset. If you have a Nobel Laureate signing a protest petition... you've got a big problem.",

              "text": "They have one of the largest private police forces in the US covering 65,000 residents and multiple adjacent neighborhoods over two miles north of campus. The university has previously considered moving to the suburbs (due to crime, in the 1950s IIRC).\n\nThe faculty don't have to propose anything. They hire administrators to run the university for them -- so it is the administration's job to fix things. If the administration does not fix the problem, the faculty will leave, take their research grants with them (yes, you can do that), and most schools would be all-too-willing to help them leave. Northwestern does a tidy business picking up faculty from UChicago and the professors do not even need to move, they just change their commute.\n\nSo there is a lot the university can do and they had better hurry up. As to what they could do... more foot patrols, more cameras with shotspotters, they could even control access to campus and discourage people living off-campus (with shuttle buses between campus sites outside the main campus).",

Not to say Hyde Park is safe/unsafe but earlier this year I felt comfortable walking around off campus (I was usually going to 53rd) by myself, and didn\u2019t feel unsafe. I\u2019m definitely not now though. I really hate the university\u2019s lack of communication. They give us CTA passes, and earlier this year I tried to use it but the system was so confusing so I got off. I didn\u2019t know which lines are good, which routes are safe/unsafe, and I ended up just taking a Lyft (in my state public transportation isn\u2019t super sophisticated, although I have used it before easily because I know my area). I signed up for safety alerts on my phone and email, haven\u2019t gotten one all year (including the one in which the student was shot). So I understand the frustration, because I\u2019m pretty angry too.",

      "text": "I'm a current student at UChicago and can weigh in on this. To be clear, I love going to UChicago, and I don't regret my decision to come, but it's apparent that it's not safe here. For more context on the deaths, last year, a grad student named Yiran Fan was shot and killed while sitting in his car in a parking garage. Over the summer, my friend Max Lewis was hit by a stray bullet while on the train coming home from his investment banking internship and died in the hospital a few days later. Last week, a recent graduate, Dennis Zheng, was shot and killed during a mugging just off campus on a block full of student apartments. None of these were on campus, but they all occurred in areas frequented by students. There are a lot more incidences of crime that don't make the news - for example, earlier this quarter, two of my sorority sisters were robbed at gunpoint while walking home from a mixer on a Thursday night, and I believe other posts mentioned the mugging that happened last week right outside one of the dorms.\n\nUChicago is telling current students and parents that they're taking these tragedies seriously and expanding precautions, but I don't know how much I believe them. They expanded a program that gives a $15 discount on Lyft rides (which doesn't include tips for drivers, lol) within the campus area from just weekends to every night, but it only runs from 9pm to 4am, and it gets dark around 5pm here. There's also been no acknowledgement from the school or any of my professors that this could be taking a toll on students' mental health or class performance, despite widespread outcry from the student body such as the protest mentioned in this post. While all the murders occurred after I began school here, so I haven't heard the recent admissions spiel, I would be very surprised if they were entirely candid about the extent of safety risks on campus. There's a campus summit on safety and security coming soon, so I can update if they make any major announcements, but I'm not terribly satisfied with their response so far.\n\nOf course, this is a Chicago problem as much as a UChicago problem, and going to school in any major city means accepting some extra risk, but no student should have to worry about getting shot at school. There's a lot of controversy on campus right now, especially with regard to possible solutions (e.g. whether policing should be expanded), and opinions on safety run the gamut from \"Chiraq is a dangerous war zone where you can't leave your dorm without getting shot\" and \"\\*insert other blatantly racist/classist comment here\\*\" (yikes) to \"there's no problem with safety and anyone who gets harassed on the street should just take off their Canada Goose and stop listening to music while walking\" (also yikes). Most students I've talked to agree that there's a problem with safety here, though.\n\nI wouldn't actively discourage new students from coming here - generally, I love it here, and I'm incredibly happy - but you should do some serious thinking about what level of risk you're willing to accept. It's unclear as of yet whether this is a long-term pattern or part of the recent spike in crime/homicide happening across the country, but 3 students being murdered in a year (or even 1 student) is too much to just disregard. Sorry for writing an entire essay, but I hope this could give a little bit of perspective on the campus climate at the moment. Please ask/PM if you have any other questions about safety on campus I can address; I remember how difficult college decisions were even without this element.",

It definitely requires both caution and risk tolerance, but the majority of students here will not be victims of a crime, especially a violent one. I would definitely encourage prospective students to reflect on what their personal tolerance for risk is, because the likelihood of crime here is objectively much higher than a lot of other colleges, but coming here has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made.

There are appreciable differences between the schools you listed and UChicago, as well as among themselves, that make them not interchangeable. There are valid reasons to choose UChicago over Brown, or Penn over Cornell, or JHU over Georgetown, etc. in spite of the extra risk. Safety is important, but people have different risk tolerances relative to the unique opportunities they can get at a given institution, and that\u2019s as valid as people citing safety as a reason to add/drop colleges from their list or when making a decision of where to go.",

          "text": "Well... UChicago has an ugly history with Hyde Park and nearby neighborhoods. In the past, they rammed through \"urban renewal\" projects and worked with corrupt community leaders to displace minorities from the neighborhood. That also yielded cheap real estate for expansion. (Read more here: [https://www.aaihs.org/the-university-of-chicago-urban-renewal-and-the-black-community/](https://www.aaihs.org/the-university-of-chicago-urban-renewal-and-the-black-community/)) More recently, the UCPD has occasionally shot residents [and even students](https://southsideweekly.com/the-fight-over-chicagos-largest-private-police-force-university-of-chicago-ucpd/).\n\nGiven that history, the University is cautious to deploy lots of police, even though [UCPD patrols cover multiple neighborhoods to the north of campus](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/safety-security/uploads/files/Extended_Patrol_Map.pdf) (some faculty live north of campus). Whenever major violence happens, they consult with community leaders first. Committees are, by nature, slow and so the university is slow to act. Furthermore, community members have sometimes had to deal with harassment when policing was increased. This article covers these issues: [https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2020/6/28/university-must-disband-private-police-force/](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2020/6/28/university-must-disband-private-police-force/)\n\nHence some people have a helpless or defeatist attitude. The prospect of increasing policing forces them to make an uncomfortable choice: risk angering some community leaders (and maybe vacating their ideals) or risk their personal safety. It seems that many people instead avoid choosing, go into denial, and just hope nothing happens to them. For the university, it is a political balancing act -- instead of them having any absolutes of what they will not tolerate. It is truly dysfunctional.\n\nAs for more cops on the street... How UCPD typically increases patrols is usually more officers in more cars, not more officers on foot. Surprise: [police on foot are more effective at deterring crime](https://phlr.org/news/2013/12/foot-patrol-can-be-used-curb-violence-and-improve-public-health).",

However, that is not to downplay that UChicago is more dangerous than other universities, and that what happened to these students is a tragedy, and that it should not be a risk you have to take to go to school here.",

My son\u2019s school, and several other nearby schools in our community send a lot of students to U Chicago each year.  \n\nRegardless what the exact reality of the situation is, and how we each interpret what we see and read, the bottom line as a parent is that every single parent of a current student I have spoken to is scared to death.  I doubt I would be any different, and there are plenty of other great universities to choose as an ED option.  \n\nComments from everyone seem unanimous that there is a definite lack of a real time warning system \u2026 something that should have been put in place 10 years ago.  And the perceived lack of an immediate, aggressive and appropriate response by the university to attempt to improve student and faculty safety is disturbing.  This is not a community college with no money to pay the electric bill \u2026..  this is the 12 billion dollar University of Chicago.  \n\nOur family grieves and prays for the 3 students who lost their lives and the families they left behind.",

The campuses are pretty similarly defined: clearly campus areas with some adjacent housing stock used for university purposes but not beyond a block or two.\n\nEvanston is very integrated into the Chicago area and if you didn't see any signs you probably couldn't tell when you left Chicago and entered Evanston (apart from one landmark that gives you a hint). Evanston also does have some sketchy areas (though not nearly as dangerous as sketchy areas in Hyde Park/Woodlawn).

First of all, OF COURSE any death is a tragedy, whether it happens to an out-of-state college student or someone born and raised in Chicago - and lowering the crime rate/making the city safer, as these students want to do, helps literally all of these people, including the young Black men who are too frequently victims of violence. Sure, UChicago students don\u2019t deserve special treatment, but they sure do deserve to not get murdered, just like all the other residents of Chicago. Second of all, 2 out of the 3 students who were murdered have been Chinese international students. The most recent victim, Dennis Zheng, was an international student from China whose single mother spent significant portions of her savings sending him to UChicago. The protest was organized and largely attended by Asian students, especially Asian international students, who are a lot less used to the crime and gun violence that unfortunately does occur in Chicago. Not exactly the \u201crich white trust-fund kids\u201d you\u2019re describing here.\n\nIf students at UChicago are protesting the murders of their beloved classmates and friends and your first reaction is anger towards their \u201centitlement,\u201d I suggest you go to therapy to learn some empathy. No one believes that other murders in Chicago aren\u2019t tragedies or deserve any less attention, but these are our FRIENDS. Of course their murders hit closer to home for us. Jesus Christ.",

The sad truth is that everything is politicized these days and no one is ready for this conversation until there\u2019s a clear personal benefit in having it. Even then, once the conversation is made, there is a false promise that falls through and the cycle repeats. It\u2019s so infuriating now that I think about it.
