  "text": "Does USA have spring intake in March/April 2022?  \nI've experience of 7 years in IT field software development and did my Bachelors in Information Technology.\n\nI'm looking for courses in Computer Science or Management which can be completed within 1 year will be fine.\n\nPreferably without GRE and ok to give TOEFL. \n\nAlso I know I won't be able to get into A, B grade colleges. So any lower grade colleges and courses will be fine.",
