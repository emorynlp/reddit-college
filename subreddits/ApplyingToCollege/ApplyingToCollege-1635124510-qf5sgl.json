  "text": "Nov 1 is a week away and I haven't finished my Common App Essay nor have I even started the two supps for the two colleges I was originally planning on applying EA. There's maybe a 1/3 chance I'll make the deadline, but it's looking more and more like I'll have to go RD.... Anyone else in the same boat? I feel like it might be better to submit a thorough application later than a rushed application early. And the only difference is that you get your decision notification earlier, you know? I wish I could take a time machine and slap my past self for procrastinating, but it kind of is what it is now. I don't think there's any shame in taking the time you need.",
