  "text": "Hello!\n\nI got an email today from my ED school stating my second letter of recommendation hasn\u2019t been submitted yet. I emailed my teacher who just submitted it, apparently there was an issue with Naviance.\n\nDo you think the LOR being ~2 weeks late will jeopardize my decision? Should I email the college and state the issue with Naviance? \n\nPlease help! Thank you",
