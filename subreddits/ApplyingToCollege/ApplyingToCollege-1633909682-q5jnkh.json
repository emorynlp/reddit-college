  "text": "For one of the Purdue supplemental essays we\u2019re supposed to talk about why we chose our first choice major - for engineering students we have to select \u201cFirst Year Engineering\u201d when applying before declaring our actual major later on. Do any of y\u2019all know if we\u2019re supposed to write about \u201cFirst Year Engineering\u201d or about the engineering major we intend to go into later on?  I feel really dumb asking this, haha.",
