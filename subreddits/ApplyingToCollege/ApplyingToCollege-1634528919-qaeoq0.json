  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm writing right now in a really fucked position where I need to have my common app essay and supplementary essays done by next Monday (Nov 1st deadline) and I don't know where to start for any of them. Please help and give any advice you can. I have preliminary ideas for the common app essay, but I need a process or some way to get coherent thoughts down on paper. Thanks again",
