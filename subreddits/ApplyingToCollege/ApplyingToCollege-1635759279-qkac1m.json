  "text": "The mensa bulletin is a magazine for mensa which accepts submissions from non mensa members. I found some of their articles interesting thats why i submitted some of mine and they got approved. Should I include this in my college app or is mensa anything too stigmatized for it to be a benefit to my college app?",
