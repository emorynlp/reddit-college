  "title:": "So lost with engineering schools in CA!",
  "text": "\nI\u2019m looking to apply to engineering schools only in California next year.. I\u2019m doing research but I\u2019m just so lost.. I have a general idea of the top schools, but I don\u2019t know where and how to get more details for which school would best fit me and my standards and my chances of getting in. I\u2019m a decent student with a 3.7 unweighted gpa, taken 8 ap courses and decent extra curriculars like over 3 years of high school basketball, 100+ hours of tutoring,etc. can i get some recommendations for the UCs and CSUs i should apply to and why, and how i can do more research? I would appreciate it..",
