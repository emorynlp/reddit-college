  "text": "Last year I went through the whole application process and I didn't think I was going to get in anywhere. I applied to 23 schools with a lot of safeties because I was absolutely terrified. Fast forward to now, I'm in one of my top schools. I got into Northeastern University (and into the honors program), Boston University, Carnegie Mellon (top 5 for engineering which is what I applied as), etc. And yet I accidentally sent a LOR to one of these schools with the name of a different school and I had multiple Bs on my transcript and even a C from my junior year. I hope this might help relieve some of your stress. Good luck and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",
