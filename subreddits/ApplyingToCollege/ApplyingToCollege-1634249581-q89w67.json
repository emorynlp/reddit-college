  "text": "Last year I went through the whole application process and I didn't think I was going to get in anywhere. I applied to 23 schools with a lot of safeties because I was absolutely terrified. Fast forward to now, I'm in one of my top schools. I got into Northeastern University (and into the honors program), Boston University, Carnegie Mellon (top 5 for engineering which is what I applied as), etc. And yet I accidentally sent a LOR to one of these schools with the name of a different school and I had multiple Bs on my transcript and even a C from my junior year. I hope this might help relieve some of your stress. Good luck and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",

My name is X, I go to X High School in X, CA, and I recently applied to X University with an intended major of biomedical engineering. X is my top choice school and it would be a dream to attend! As someone who grew up in a multicultural family, I love how much the school emphasizes diversity and inclusion and how large the international community is. Additionally, one of the many reasons why X is my #1 school is because the engineering department is project-based, and as someone who is a tactile learner, I think this provides the best method of learning for me. I am also most excited to participate in the traditions at X especially going to the Spring Fling concert before finals! Thank you so much for your time, I hope to be on campus next year!\r  \n\r  \nBest,\r  \nX\n\nThis is the response I got:\n\nHi X,\r  \n\rGreat to hear from you. I\u2019m originally from X, and X is SO beautiful! This was a great first email to read coming back from winter break, and it makes me very excited to read your application!\r  \n\r\r\r  \nTake care, and let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\r\r\n\nThe key to this is to truly research the school and write something SPECIFIC.",
