  "text": "I\u2019ve been looking through r/chanceme and nearly every one that I read has outstanding ECs but like how? I\u2019ve got great grades and a pretty good SAT score but my ECs are mediocre compared to the ones I\u2019ve been seeing. I see these ECs for people looking at schools I\u2019m applying to and I can\u2019t help but feel worried. Idrk it\u2019s getting late and I\u2019m probably just worrying myself too much",

      "text": "a lot of ppl on this subreddit are from super affluent areas and/or are affluent themselves. this applies to anything from academic resources to connections to straight up having the money to participate in certain activities\n\nit's either that and/or they're RIDICULOUSLY aggressive about securing opportunities for themselves.\n\nColleges evaluate applications in context, and even if you go to a competitive affluent HS you can still get into a top college as a non-perfect student. I was definitely not perfect and had no good reason to *not* be perfect given the HS I went to ([https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q72b22/comment/hgfyhv1/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q72b22/comment/hgfyhv1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) and I still did well in admissions. universities can't and usually don't admit a whole class of r/chanceme superhumans\n\neither way the academics are the most important part. you'll do well in college regardless of where you end up and i think that's the key part",

That was certainly the case at my high school. Lots of senior engineers at FAANG companies, physicians, etc. We even had two (unrelated) kids who had one parent as high ranking execs in major companies (probably worth multiple billions? Not sure on that one. Either way, the parents had money). Most people I know also paid for SAT prep classes in some way shape or fashion, stuff like that\n\nWe were also a couple minutes away from places like SJSU or Stanford where people frequently cold emailed for research. NASA Ames as well. You get the idea.",
