      "text": "Incoming block of text from procrastinating\n\nI was researching the top liberal arts colleges cuz they're good for grad school placements. I mainly looked at the QuestBridge partners. From the list, I wanted to find one that isn't a majority rich white school in the middle of nowhere. That pretty left me with the Claremont Colleges, Wesleyan, Davidson, Swarthmore, and Haverford College to name a few. I then realized I want to go to the East because living in California sucks and I like living near the ocean so I'm now in between Swarthmore and Haverford. After researching these two for months, I figured that Haverford is the best fit because of the overall academic and social environment. It was also a 10-minute walk from a train station and a Japanese supermarket (food is important)! Swarthmore was often described as an academically intense school. I then doubted Haverford again so I researched every top LAC to determine which is the best fit for me. I came full circle to Haverford again, which was described as very community-driven, collaborative, and stress-free. I was then concerned with the quality of education but found it ranking high in almost every list I look at. They also have great programs and connections with other colleges (ex: UPENN). I was still unsure so I signed up for their fly-in program. I got accepted and after attending, I thought to myself, \"Yep this is the one.\" Now I'm a simp and this is unhealthy.\n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk I'll be taking a hot 30-minute shower now thinking about life and cringy moments.",

I liked walkable, with good diversity and pretty campus and trees and such. I like when it snows still but it's not unbearable. UPenn checks all of those boxes for me and when looking at vlogs from current students, I just fell in love with the school. It's not even the programs that much, it's more the location and the city. I heard the students are depressed af but whatever. Who isnt.",

So when SATs started rolling around my parents starting asking me where I was interested in going. I had no idea so they just started naming schools that they knew were good for what I wanna do - the first one they listed is straight up now my dream school. It kinda became the only one I can really imagine myself going to. I\u2019ve tried to research into others in a similar manner that I did the first but can\u2019t seem to even really approach that headspace with any of the others.",
