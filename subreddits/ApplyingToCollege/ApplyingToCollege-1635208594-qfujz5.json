      "text": "At my school, co-curriculars are things like choir and band. You have a class period dedicated to it, where you do most of your learning, but you also have required out-of-class elements that take place during other parts of the school day or after/before school. Things like choir/band lessons, early morning sessions, performances, select or honor groups, etc. They're different from regular classes because you have obligations outside of your class period, and they're different from extracurriculars because you have a class period and you're getting a grade.",
