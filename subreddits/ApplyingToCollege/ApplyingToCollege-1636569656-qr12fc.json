  "text": "Hello! As the title says, I have doubts if this will affect the application process.  \n\nI am on an institute that doesn't offer 12th grade, (not USA, btw),  and this concerned me. I don't know if I will get lower chances of  getting accepted because of the diploma. I have asked a teacher about  it, and told me that one student had this issue when applying to  universities outside the country, but that was long ago, and don't know if currently it has no effect on applications. Forgive my English, I am trying to improve it.",
