  "title:": "Juniors - Harvard sending you mail literally means nothing",
  "text": "Last year around this time, Harvard sent me a packet asking me to apply. I was in the shower and my mom saw it. She proceeded to take a picture of it and send it to every family member. We didn\u2019t have plans for spring break (this happened like two weeks before it) and she\u2019s like \u201clol now we need to go to Boston.\u201d Since it was spring break for most schools around the country, they had no tours. She literally made me email the office of admissions and like \u201cummm excuse me but I got a package from you! You need to get me on a tour!\u201d And they said \u201cno peasant.\u201d We ended up taking a trip to the northeast to do visits (not at Harvard lol)\n\nAnyway, getting letters/packages from schools like Harvard mean nothing. If you hadn\u2019t heard of this already, here\u2019s what happens:\n\nHarvard (along with other schools) want to have as low as an acceptance rate as possible. They don\u2019t want to decrease the size of incoming classes so therefore they have to have a large applicant pool. How do they do that? Sending thousands of high schoolers letters encouraging them to apply. Kids think \u201cwow! Harvard wants me!\u201d But no, honey. They just want your application.",

      "text": "This is why admissions reps cringe when students ask about acceptance rates, it's a mostly meaningless data point. You'll find some colleges calling and emailing seniors now to complete their application so they have more applications in the deny column. A better data point to look at is loan default rates. If a school has a low loan default rate it means graduates are able to repay their student loans within 6 months after they graduate, meaning they are employed in some capacity or have gone on to graduate programs(which defers your student debt until you graduate or stop attending school). It could also mean that student are graduating with relatively low student debt. These are numbers that schools cannot manipulate or explain away.",

If a school had one of those numbers really low, I\u2019d generally cross it off, unless there was something I *really* liked about it. If a ton of people were leaving after their first year, or were leaving before graduation, then it probably wasn\u2019t a place I wanted to be.",

          "text": "Most students at public universities and selective privates can pay their student loans initially because they don't add up to much--our government limits the total debt amount to under $30,000 for four years of school-- which can be a quite reasonable monthly payment of $250-$400 per month for 10 years depending on interest rates. (Having no loans for 10 years should be the REAL goal)\n\nUnfortunately, it's a game of smoke and mirrors; for many students, their parents are taking out \"Parent Plus Loans\" for another $100,000-$200,000 so their child can attend their \"dream school.\" \n\nThese loans don't show up anywhere on a college website or government student loan report because the borrower is not a student. Home equity is often used as collateral-- but if they get laid off and can't pay their bill, the loan company forecloses on your home everything is lost....think about it--for what? A Bachelors's degree in biology or business or English? The same degree cost $25,000 less 8 years ago, but the starting salaries are essentially the same when housing has doubled in most decent cities. Do you really want to move in with mom and dad and live in the basement?\n\nMake your college decisions wisely--not with your emotions. You have all heard countless times it does not matter where you go to college--and every single college out there TONIGHT is hoping YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IT--they need your money now, more than ever!",

Some colleges are desperate and want students to apply. Research colleges and keep in mind MLRP. Major (make sure they have your major), Location (check location. Remember out of state is more expensive than instate), realistic (can you afford that school? Are you willing to do loans? Will you be able to be accepted with your scores, grades, and gpa?), and P (options. Do you have a safety? Is this school good rep?)",

      "text": "This is largely anecdotal, but I actually applied to Harvard and got my application fee waived (so I lost nothing by applying). They sent someone to interview me in my state, and we talked a bit.  According to my interviewer, part of what you say is true, but another reason Harvard and other universities spam out applications is that they want \"well rounded\" students. I never went to high school or did traditional \"extracurriculars\" outside off some sports, so I didn't make that cut. Some people are well rounded, and those are the people Harvard tries to  find.\n\nYale was a bit more straight forward and said. \"You're applying with effectively half a BS already completed. We don't accept credits taken from your college and greatly prefer high school students.\"",

          "text": "I will say that if there\u2019s any anecdotal story in here, it would be yours. According to a New York Times [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/harvard-admissions-recruit-letter.amp.html), for the high school Class of 2018, Harvard sent out 114,000 letters and accepted a little over 2,000 kids. \n\nJust think about it this way. I\u2019m a kid with above average but not amazing test scores and a pretty good GPA. I know that I probably can\u2019t get into schools like Harvard, UChicago, or other places. Thousands of kids across the world think the same. They can\u2019t get in so why should they apply? This means less applicants and a higher acceptance rate.\n\nHowever, when you send a letter or an email, it gives kids hope. For many kids, there\u2019s no way in hell they\u2019ll get in, but they still apply. More applicants means a smaller acceptance rate which means a better US News rating and probably more donations from alumni. More applicants also mean more application fees. Congrats for getting a fee waiver, but most people do have to pay that money.\n\nYeah, they claim to be trying to find a diamond in the rough. However, like most things, it always comes down to money.",
