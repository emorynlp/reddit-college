      "text": "I'll go first. Amherst was so bad. The tour guide didn't know how to read the room but was tolerable. However the worst part was the 90 minute info session after. I've never fallen asleep in a class, but I could barely keep my eyes open. \n\nIt got to the point where the info counselor was talking about his paper on a guillotine (I only remember that bc I wanted to use one on him) and my dad sent in my family group-chat \"This is the longest 2 hours of my entire life\" My parents usually make sure I'm paying attention and jotting everything, but I was playing GamePigeon with my brother and they didn't even care.",

He also managed to spend 10 minutes inside the library without mentioning books, journals or research, but did praise the loaner system for GoPro cameras\u2026..",
