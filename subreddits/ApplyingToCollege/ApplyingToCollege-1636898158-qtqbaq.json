  "title:": "Reporting Planned Dual Enrollment Courses on College Apps",
  "text": "I\u2019ve never dual enrolled before but plan on doing so for the next (spring) semester. Since all college apps are due before the spring semester, how do we go about reporting planned dual enrollment courses that we have not yet decided on or signed up for? Should I just mention it in the additional information? And what happens if we don\u2019t end up taking that planned course due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons?\n\nI\u2019ve also already sent in college apps for some schools without any mention of dual enrolling next semester since I was still unsure if I was going to do it at the time. Is there anything I would have to notify these schools about? I don\u2019t want it to seem like I\u2019ve lied about any courses I\u2019ve taken/plan to take. Thank you!",
