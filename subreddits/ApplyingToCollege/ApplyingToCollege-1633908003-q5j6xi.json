  "text": "I took a creative writing class the summer before 9th grade at my highschool and received credit for it. On the UC application, there are only options to add summer courses for the summers after 9th grade, not before. There are options to put classes taken before high school, like in 8th grade, but those only include math and foreign language classes. How should I put this class in or do I not include it?",
