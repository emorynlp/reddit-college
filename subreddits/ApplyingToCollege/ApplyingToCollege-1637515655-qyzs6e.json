  "text": "I'm not sure which middle school courses to include on my SSAR. I don't think I've attempted any courses in middle school for high school credit, although I did have a few honors courses in middle (namely Geometry, Alg 1 and Biology 1). Should I include my middle school courses anyways? Will there be issues if I include non-high school credit middle school courses? Thanks!",
