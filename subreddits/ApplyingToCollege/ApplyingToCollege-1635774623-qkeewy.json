  "text": "Hello ApplyingtoCollege Community,\n\nI need your help. I am currently taking a gap year and have to write an essay about it on the common app. Please reply to a few questions below.\n\n1) What should I definitely mention/write in my letter?\n\n2) What should I avoid mentioning/writing about?\n\n3) Does anyone have experience writing a similar letter? If so, were you at a disadvantage for taking a gap year?",

I don't think it has been a disadvantage, I just put in a short paragraph on what I did and how part of it was relevant. \nIf you have an otherwise good application, a gap year shouldn't be a big deal, but you should deal with it",
