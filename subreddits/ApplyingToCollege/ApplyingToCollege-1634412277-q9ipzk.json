  "text": "Ok so here's the thing. \nI'm going to sound really mean during this, but I swear I'm just asking I promise I have nothing against everyone going test optional ok <3 \n\nSo today I got my SAT score back. it's pretty good! I'm happy with it, it's above the 75th percentile for my ED, and I worked really hard for it. I told my school counselor, expecting her to be all like 'WOW GREAT JOB!' instead, I was greeted with a reaction that was like 'oh nice job, cool, it was all for nothing' \nI asked her why she didn't seem too happy, and she told me that a having good SAT score is great, but everyone is going test optional anyways, so who tf cares.\n\nDoesnt this seem super unfair to all the people who really tried to get a good SAT score? Like wouldn't it be ridiculous if you could just say 'Im applying to Harvard *GRADE OPTIONAL*\" HA ALL YOU IDIOTS STUDYING FOR EXAMS WHAT NOOBS JUST GO GRADE OPTIONAL SUCKERZ. Everyone would freak out then right? How is going SAT optional any different?\n\nI'm sorry if I'm missing something important and I swear I'm not trying to be rude. Do people who actually do submit their scores seem even smarter? I honestly have no clue. it seems really unfair to me right now, but who knows maybe I'm just salty.",

People with low scores withheld them, people with high scores submitted them.\n2. SAT scores are highly correlated with high school GPA; high SAT scorers tend to have higher GPAs than lower SAT scorers\n3. Therefore, the group of people who chose to withhold their lower SAT scores will tend to have lower GPA\u2019s on average than the group who submitted scores.\n\nIn order to draw any conclusion about whether simply submitting a score increases chance of admission you\u2019d need to stratify the data by GPA. (eg \u201c4.0 GPA + score vs 4.0 GPA - score, 3.9 + score vs 3.9 - score, etc, etc)",
