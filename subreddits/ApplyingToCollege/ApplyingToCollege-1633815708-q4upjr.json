  "text": "I decided to take all CP classes this year to adjust to being in a regular school (I was in a Montessori-type school before). I'm doing really well (3.8), but I'm not sure if that means much of anything. I don't know if I'm good enough for honors/AP, either, since I basically missed out of 2 years of high school.",
