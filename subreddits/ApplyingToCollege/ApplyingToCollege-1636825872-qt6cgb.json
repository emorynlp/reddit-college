  "text": "The application is god awful if you don\u2019t live in California. For example, when entering courses and grades, you are required to select \u201csubject area/course category\u201d. If you don\u2019t go to high school in California, there is not necessarily a correct option to put there because your classes from your high school are not the same as California classes. What the fuck are we meant to do I\u2019m so lost",

      "text": "PSA, just to reach those who are not yet aware, to prevent disappointment in the spring:  public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
