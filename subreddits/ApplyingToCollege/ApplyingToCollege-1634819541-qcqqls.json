  "text": "I ordered my SAT scores yesterday and I'm not sure they'll be sent to my colleges by Nov 8. Should I email my admissions officer and let them know beforehand? Also, worst case scenario, if they aren't in by Nov 8, will my application be placed on a hold/reviewed at a later date because I submitted everything except for my official SAT scores (tho I self reported my scores on Common App)? Or will I just be reviewed with the regular pool? \n\nI paid around 70 bucks already but if I'll be reviewed with the regular pool, might as well rush send them and cancel my previous order. \n\nMan do I love schools that do srar.",
