  "text": "Hi,\n\nI took a few MOOCs (with certificates) related to my desired major of CS and wanted to know where to include those in my commonapp. I searched online but some guys are sayin put it in activities (which is what I'm thinkin of), others say awards/recognitions, others say additional info....y'know.\n\nSo, where should I *really* put it? Which section is most advisable to input such online courses?",
