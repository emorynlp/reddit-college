                                  "text": "if i had the chance id never take IB again. id go AP. here's why: it's unnecessarily harder. theres extra stuff you do that in my opinion wouldnt matter, e.g. TOK, EE. CAS is kind of good because it forces you to do extracurriculars, but that's about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an example, I imagine the admissions people view IB HL Econ the same as AP Econ. unfortunately the reality is that it's not the same. i never took AP but i know that IB tests more because i know people who took AP Econ and to my knowledge its not the same. in this case, the only advantage in taking an unnecessarily harder course like IB is that you are more well-prepared so it does help in the long-run. all my IB friends say their first years in uni is a lot easier because a lot of it was something they already took in IB. that's the advantage you get, but in terms of getting the best scores to get into your dream uni, i'd say for most people IB isn't efficient. the only time I see IB winning a lot over AP is if you are someone trying to go into a really exclusive top university, then maybe the difference between an IB 45 student and an all 5s AP student would be that IB is a more rigorous course and from that perspective, they might be viewed as a more competitive applicant. but thats just my guess. just my 2 cents.",
