  "text": "Okay someone help me analyze how my interview went, here are the main points:\n\n1. She was very nice and said that she was very new to the alumni interviews, she seemed to not know what to ask as she was new to it\n2. The interview only lasted for 35 minutes and the last 15 was me just asking her questions about her experiences\n3. I kinda would answer a question and that would be it, like we didn\u2019t delve too much into my interests\n4. She asked me what problem in the world I would solve and I said some dumb answer about how I would love to get more people interested in space and get slave exploration to be a more pressing issue (aerospace major)\n5. At the end she said she thought I was a good candidate\n\nOverall it was good and I\u2019m hoping some of the awkwardness was due to her being new to the whole process",
