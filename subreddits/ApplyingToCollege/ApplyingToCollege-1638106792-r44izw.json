          "text": "I think that is exactly what I am supposed to write about. But the main impact would be that I'll be able to pay for my education and attend that university. If I don't get the scholarship, I won't be able to afford the tuition fees. Or getting this scholarship would save me time that I might have to spend working. But I think these are some obvious reasons. Idk what else to write",
