  "text": "I don't understand how this came from a discussion about a college interview.\n\nDisclaimer: to be fair this conversation started off with us celebrating mutually, he even gave me a fist pound\n\nDad: \"So where were they from?\"\n\nMe: \"They didn't mention if they were from out of state or not.\"\n\nDad: \"What a shame it would have been interesting to know.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah.  Hold on let me check something.\"\n\n*goes to check email to see if they mentioned a hometown* (nope)\n\n*Comes back*\n\nDad: \"I just don't know why you couldn't ask.  Why couldn't you just ask?  I just don't understand why you weren't interested enough to know as much about them as they know about you.\"\n\nMe: \"I am it's just the conversation went in other directions--I was focused on doing a good job (can't he understand maybe I was nervous) .  Why are you getting so upset about this?\"\n\nDad: \"Because it would have been a good piece of information to learn about the school and I just don't get why you couldn't have asked.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok but why are you dragging this out and putting damper on things?\" \n\nDad: \"I'm not it's just that.\" *continues talking about how nice it would have been to know and stuff*\n\nMe: *realizes he is making a big deal out of this and getting upset and am trying to suppress my irritation and thinks about my 2 tests and 1 college app I have to submit in 3 hours*\n\nMe: *starts walking towards room* \"Okay I have to finish my schoolwork and stuff.\" (tbh i did sound annoyed and was pretty much storming off)\n\n*closes door but hears him say something else to me so goes back out and asks what he said*\n\nDad: \"I said yeah you got what you wanted out of me with me cooking your dinner and now you're just going to do whatever you want to do.\"\n\nMe: *wondering why I deserve to be feeling like shit right now and explains I was mostly asking questions about the school during the interview*\n\nDad: *says that knowing why the interviewer came from their hometown to go to the school is a good thing to know*\n\nMe: *asks why he is being so negative tho*\n\nThen we start arguing about who and who wasn't being negative and when i did or did not walk away or how he was or was not getting upset.\n\n*and we go back and forth with me talking back to him more and more disrespectfully and him getting angrier and angrier*\n\nAnd now i still have an overdue test bc i have had a headache from crying so much and don't feel like doing any work.  we have been arguing on and off for the past 30 hours.\n\nik i shouldn't have disrespected him at all no matter what.  im still kind of in shock of the post title.  i cant believe he would say that to me, how he \"put up with me my whole life\".  even worse things were said.  he said he didn't mean them and he was just angry but he has said them before when he was angry during arguments so how many times are you gonna stab me with the same knife???",

      "text": "As a parent myself, I don\u2019t understand why your dad is so stuck on knowing the interviewer. But we (parents) sometime has past experience that affect our judgment. Maybe somehow your dad had an experience in the past that involve him not knowing the interviewer enough and fail an interview. Or your dad just heard of stories like that. Either way, it\u2019s ok. \n\nDuring an argument like this, in order to \u201cwin\u201d the argument, people will tend to say whatever they can to win. They may not mean it at all. I won\u2019t worry too much  about your dad statement even it is hurtful. Just move on and put it at the back. If you have another interview coming up, tell him that you would get your best to know the interviewer (just tell him that. Even you may not act on it) and forget about this. You have much more important thing to spend your energy (like your test and the college app) than meaningless word battle.",

      "text": "Your dad is living through you. All parents do with their children at varying levels. And the application process is as exciting as it is stressful to him too because, hopefully, deep down he wants you to get to the school of your desire. He knows much of it is out of his hands. So in his head he\u2019s trying to be helpful but he probably feels vulnerable and helpless at the same time. Maybe feels like he\u2019s in the dark and wished he could\u2019ve had a hand in guiding you before or during the interview.\n\nI am not saying he was right. I\u2019m only trying to shed light on where he might be coming from. Clearly, in \u201cnormal\u201d times you have a great  relationship with him. \n\nIf he\u2019s the good father he seems, he\u2019ll be running this through his head. Maybe he\u2019ll regret what he said. Maybe he\u2019ll keep at it. Idk. Just know he wants the best for you and maybe the thought that there was a \u201cslip\u201d has him worried.",
