  "text": "hey, i was wondering if it's allowed to reject an ED offer even if i receive a scholarship or other sort of financial aid, but its not 100%? lets say, based on my CSS profile, the college accepts me on ED conditions and decides to give me a 60% scholarship, where i can supposedly pay the rest of the fees. but i also have an offer from another school with a higher scholarship or generally lower fees. do i still have to accept the ED offer from a college with a smaller scholarship?",

      "text": "If the cost they ask you to pay after admitting you is equal to or less than what their NPC returned prior to you applying then they're probably not letting you out of your ED obligation.\n\nOnly caveat to this would be if your financial situation changed significantly between when you ran the NPC and when you got your actual cost.",

      "text": "You need to do your due diligence and run the NPC before you apply ED. If you are happy with the cost the NPC shows, apply. If not, don't apply ED, because your actual offer will almost never be better than the NPC.\n\nIf the actual offer is dramatically different from the NpC, you can turn down the ED offer after having s conversation with the FA office. But you cannot ethically break an ED agreement simply because you do not want to pay. And the college will likely not care about offers from other colleges.",
