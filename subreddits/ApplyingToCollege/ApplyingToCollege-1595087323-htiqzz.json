  "text": "rip to us. no hoco, senior nights, prom, senior parties, toga tuesday, maybe even graduation. we're going into a completely new college admissions process and school year blindfolded with our hands tied behind our backs (standardized testing and pass fail be like \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41). can't even say bye to the friends we made or the teachers that helped shape who we are properly. can't connect with classes under us and give them guidance and air our grievances about being a first semester senior. no senior skip day with friends. no senior field trip ;(\n\nplease show us some love. we are scared.\n\nEDIT: people in different areas in the US have many different experiences so if youre a senior and youre having an ordinary year, great! if you're not, f and stay socially distanced\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffcwear your masks!!!

K12 is the best option right now as difficult as the change might be.",

Our grades were screwed up because we had no exams and they used some some weird algorithm in which they compare us to the previous graduates (which heavily disadvantages schools with few graduating classes and seniors). We have to start our first semester of college online, learning and adapting to a completely new environment through a virtual zoom call and not being able to establish close relationships with other classmates.",

Everything from last semester ended so abruptly and it feels so...unfinished. On the bright side, at least you'll probably get your senior year of college. This is supposed to be my last year of undergrad and I would give up any year from high school just to have this year be normal. Hell, I'd give it up just for the Spring semester. \n\nRegardless, I'm really hoping things get better and y'all get some semblance of normality for the end of your high school career.",

It was also so sudden that we never got a chance you say goodbye to the teachers that helped us through it. In fact I was just discussing with friends and my art teacher about painting her rocks outside her room the very last day thinking that there would be a next week. I had to wait til August to get my diploma I was supposed to Normally receive in May. By time your class comes around they'll have it figured out probably and with how states and the government are pushing schools I'm sure you'll return to campus at least even once during this year. I feel for you guys, but at least it's a foreseen year. I hope your testings go well and you manage to find even a little highlight of this school year.",

Thank God I've had the privilege if failing high school and not going to these garbage events which would have made me fail even more. Prom is disgusting. Period. Paying to actually dress up in something and cosplaying a happy high schooler gives me epilepsy. I don't get how normal high schools consider prom and homecoming to be remotely fun because I've never had the experience of physically going to them besides the one time I was forced into a cattle car to go to the homecoming dance to which I spent the entirety of it hiding in a classroom and reading and playing geometry dash. Enjoy your life and the wonderful future you'll have. I'm dead. I guess now the world is saved",
