  "text": "I can't explain how happy I feel rn. After months of wondering and stressing out about making the right choice, I'm finally confident in my decision regarding the place in which I'd love to study for the next few years. It has everything I was looking for - wonderful majors and minors that I'm genuinely interested in, unmatched flexibility in course choice, wonderful campus (come on!! it has literal Ai Weiwei piece in their museum!!!) and enormous dorms, mild temperature (just right for me!), delicious food, AND meets full demonstrated need!! I don't want to hype myself up too much since my finances (or rather lack thereof) constitute quite a bit of a problem, but at this point, I don't care - it's the place of my dreams and I'm applying there no matter what.",
