  "text": "I'm having a big issue with my college list, and I\"m wondering if anyone can help me with some school suggestions. I currently already have a list, but I want to add more schools!\n\n**Location:** I don't have any actual preference about specifics, but these states would be great AL; CT; DE; DC; FL; GA; KY; LA; ME; MD; MA; MI; MS; NH; NJ; NY; NC; OH; PA; RI; SC; TN; VA; WV**Region:** NYC**Major:** Business, Finance, or Economics**Curriculum:** I don't have any preferences**Size:** I don't have any preference, but any school that's about 1,500 students is best**Costs:** I don't have an exact price, but looking for something most likely below $40,000 (after aid) Not looking for an extremely expensive school, so aiming at finding a school where I could receive scholarships/grants\n\n**Schools I\u2019m applying to:** Penn State, Syracuse, Binghamton, University of Alabama, University of Rhode Island, Auburn\n\n**Stats:**\n\n* GPA 3.6 W (my school doesn't report unweighted gpa)\n* SAT 1390 (retaking in December as some of my schools still accept December score)\n* 4 APs; scores were all fours on the exams (School only offers around 9 APs)\n* 3 College Classes\n* Don't know if this matters but took Algebra and Living Environment in 8th grade so I have credits for those classes\n\n**About Me:** (Just some things that might be important to mentioned)\n\n* White middle-class income girl\n* First Gen. immigrant\n* English isn't my first language, so I fluently speak 2 languages (Parents speak barely any English)\n* Got diagnosed with ADHD in mid-sophomore year so thinking about mentioning this in the additional information section\n* Live in NYC and go to an big average public high school; Most of the people at my school apply to only regional schools, so I would be one of the first to apply to a majority of OOS schools\n\n**ECs:** (Not listed in any specific way, as they're all just average)\n\n* Babysitting multiple kids from tenth grade (often for free); Did this for about 12 hrs a week for about 3/4 of each year\n* Pet Sitter in my neighborhood; Walked dogs and took care of pets when owners were away; Did this ever since ninth grade for about 10 hrs a week for about 1/2 of each year\n* Free tutoring services for underprivileged kids; Tutored kids in kindergarten-fifth grade with science, English, math, and Polish; I have been doing this since mid-ninth grade till now for about 10 hours a week throughout roughly half of each year.\n* Hiking (more of a hobby, but advisor told me to list it) I am have hiked many long NY and nearby trials; Started and arranged groups with friends with weekly hiking trips to nearby NY parks.\n* Volunteered at local Polish small business; Helped at the restaurant during hard COVID-19 times, and also, developed my connection to Polish culture; I did this since sophomore year for about 10 hours a week for roughly 3/4 of the year.\n* Yoga (More of a hobby, but advisor told me to mention this because I would continue this in college) Took yoga and fitness classes every week from the start of COVID-19 till now; Spent roughly 2 hours a week for a majority of each year since 10th grade.\n\nMy extracurriculars aren't necessarily strong, but I may be forgetting to list some.\n\n**Achievements/Honors:**\n\n* Honor Roll for each semester of high school till present times\n* National Honor Society\n\n**LORs:**\n\n* AP World History teacher: Loved him, and I did really well in his class. Predicting that this would be good.\n* Teacher from a Syracuse class I took at my school: Loved her, as well. I did really well in her class. Predicting that this letter would also be good.\n* Counselor/Advisor: We had to fill out a form/survey, so guessing she just went off of that so not too sure.\n\nPlease help me out, and give me any possible schools that would be good for me to apply to. Am I undermining or reaching too far with my possible schools as of right now? Are there any schools where I could possibly get any SAT/merit scholarships?\n\nPlease give me any recommendations! I would really appreciate it.\n\nThank you so much, and Happy Thanksgiving!!! :)",
