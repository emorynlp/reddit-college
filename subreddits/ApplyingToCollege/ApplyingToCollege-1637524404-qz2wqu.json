Maybe if you told me what about those online essays you think is better than yours i can try to steer you in another direction.",

If a college doesn't want you for who you really are, you don't want them either. \n\nThere's millions of people on the internet and thousands of good essays going around. You don't need to match them, you just need to make an essay that you're happy with.",
