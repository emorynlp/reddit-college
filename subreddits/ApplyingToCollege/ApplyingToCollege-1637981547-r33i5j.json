  "title:": "UC Additional Info: Academic History vs Personal Insight",
  "text": "For the UC Additional Comments section for Academic History, we're only given 550 characters, as opposed to the 550 words for the UC Additional Comments section under Personal Insight. I am trying to explain a family situation that resulted in a severe dip in my grades for one semester. Should I include this in the academic history section or personal insight section? I could explain it with full context in the personal insight section, but not in the academic history section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm asking because it may be possible for the AOs to see my grades in the Academic History section and decide to not further pursue valuing my application, thus not giving them the chance to see my Additional Info Personal Insight section and PIQs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks!",
