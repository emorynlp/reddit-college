  "text": "How bad does my transcript look? I have a 4.0 GPA, but took only 1 ap class each year in 10th and 11th, being Ap psych and APUSH. I am currently taking AP Calc BC, AP Bio, and AP Comp Sci. My school offers relatively few AP's but I've  seen everyone else in my class taking at least two AP's a year. In tenth, the available APs were Comp Sci, Psych, Human Geo (can't take both Human geo and psych), and Lang. I took no honors classes. In 11th, AP Lang, Comp Sci, and Chem were offered. I took all honors classes this year, the highest level math class for 11th grade, and APUSH.",
