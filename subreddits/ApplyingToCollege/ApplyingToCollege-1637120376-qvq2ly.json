  "title:": "UC Prompt #7 - Is it recommended to talk about more than one way I helped make my community/school a better place?",
  "text": "Two things I've contributed to this, of practically equal significance, immediately popped up in my mind when I decided to respond to this prompt as one of my PIQ responses. I don't really want to describe them on here just to be safe but if anyone is willing to PM then I could explain personally and in more detail.  \n\n\nAnyway, I really want to talk about both of these examples in this response, so I'm just wondering if that's recommended or is it better to stick to one and explain it in more detail and with greater value? (Which I can, I would just much rather talk about both of them because I feel that they are both really good examples relevant to the prompt.)   \n\n\nThank you!",

          "text": "Yeah, I agree that the 350 word limit is the main thing that's keeping me from already going ahead and writing about both. I'd say they're not *completely* different; one of them was targeted at helping my school and the other at helping the community, but they were both things I helped with in light of the pandemic making things harder for everyone, to help make it better and I guess easier for them.",
