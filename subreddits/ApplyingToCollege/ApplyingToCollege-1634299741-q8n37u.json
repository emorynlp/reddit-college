  "text": "Basically title. I just got my Oct 2 scores back and I\u2019m wondering if I should submit them to competitive schools like Princeton or UPenn. \nFor context, my reading is 780, but my math is 720. Knowing Princeton has a higher math score, I feel like this would be a detriment to my application. \nI know it\u2019s \u201cholistic admissions\u201d, but thoughts?",

If you otherwise look like a \u201c25th percentile\u201d applicant, a 1500 will only help. If you otherwise look like a \u201d50th percentile\u201d applicant, a 1500 is right in range.\n\nPS - I just saw UPenn in your post.  If applying to Wharton, I would not submit a score with a 720M.",
