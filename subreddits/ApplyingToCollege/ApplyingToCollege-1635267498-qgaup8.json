  "text": "I got accepted to UC Merced last month and during the application process they asked me if I have completed the IGETC. I said yes because I thought I did, and they had all my transcripts anyway.\n\nToday, I got a notification from the school asking for a IGETC certificate to verify my completion of IGETC. I just checked the IGETC breadth and it turns out I\u2019m one class short.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do and really worried this will have my application rescinded. Should I contact the school and make them aware of my mistake (even though they specifically asked me if I completed IGETC and I said \u201cyes, it\u2019s completed in full\u201d) and just hope for the best\u2026 or should I play it off and ignore it and hope they just forget about it? It\u2019s on my task list on my student profile.\n\nI\u2019m really worried this will rescind my admission!",

      "text": "Are you supposed to start January? There\u2019s still time to fix this! \n\nFirst off, are you sure they didn\u2019t make a mistake? Could an AP class or course at another college count? Make sure your CC is correct in their assessment. Check with your counselor there to find out what they will accept to fix this (see my suggestions below)\n\nUCM is not going to just forget about this so you are best to address it head on. Call and explain that you thought you had but when you applied for certification found you need one more class. Then offer some ways of fixing it and see what they say. If you turn it in by January (or February? Or August?) would that be good enough? Basically is it critical and when is the latest you could submit it?\n\nThis website lists a lot of online CCC classes you can use for IGETC, including some with late start dates, like November, or taught over winter break. https://cvc.edu/\n\nYou could also look for late start classes at CC campuses near you (lots aren\u2019t fully online but only require a couple of meetings in person) and the Extended Ed programs at CSUs and UCs. UCB extension has some courses that are self paced so if your CC agrees in advance to accept one of those (and you could match them with CC A-G options using Assist) you could start ASAP and get through it before UCM starts 1/11. \n\nMight also be that IGETC isn\u2019t that critical in your case \u2026 but it\u2019s often the easiest way to just be done with GE so I\u2019d work hard to finish up.\n\nJust to set you at ease a bit, at this point they\u2019ve accepted you and are kind of invested in you coming because it might take time and effort to find someone to fill your spot by going down the waitlist. I think if you have a plan to complete IGETC fairly quickly they\u2019ll work with you.\n\nEdit to add maybe someone on r/transferstudents will have hit this exact problem and have advice",

The California public college system is so complicated that to transfer you have to develop a serious knowledge of a bunch of super picky rules and sometimes even the counselors get it wrong or you can\u2019t get into the classes you want. Guess I\u2019ve picked up a few tricks on how to slip in extra classes. \n\nI\u2019m so happy it all worked out for you. So much better than ignoring it and having it hang over your head and blow up later. Now you are on track if you took that hip hop one I saw starting in November it might even be fun. \n\nMerced has really motivated young faculty and a nice architecture and location. Take advantage of that - go to office hours and go hiking in Yosemite. You\u2019ll have a great 2 years.",

I saw that hip hop one lol but I went with two classes that were offered at the same CC to make it easier to send my transcript over to my OTHER cc to get IGETC certification which then they\u2019ll send to UCM. Lol so much for just two classes. But I am very glad I was able to do this. You\u2019re so right I would be so stressed out having this hang over my head otherwise. Also I love UCM\u2019s campus and am really excited for the future of the school! Gavin Newsom was there yesterday promising to build a medical school which would be awesome because I want to go to med school lol. Thank you again!! :D",
