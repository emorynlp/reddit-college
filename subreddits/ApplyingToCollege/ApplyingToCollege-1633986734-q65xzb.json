      "text": "No.  If they use alumni interviewers, they will have their own deadline, usually sometime around the end of November, but that includes interview AND write-up.  I don't know what the deadline would be if they actually have AO reps do it, but I'm guessing Georgetown is like the other top schools and uses alumni.",
