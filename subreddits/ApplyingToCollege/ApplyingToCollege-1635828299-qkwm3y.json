  "text": "So uh, I copy pasted my supplementals and common app from google drive into the text box, and the default bolds them. I didn't know we could unbold and thought it was just how it was supposed to look.\n\nMy friends all unbolded them.\n\nLike, logically, I know that this basically doesn't matter at all but like I'm also extremely paranoid that it'll inconvenience the AO and they'll randomly be unconsciously biased against me because of it.\n\nIs this like, important? Did anyone else do this too?",
