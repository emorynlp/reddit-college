  "text": "i had a 1460 while applying and after i applied ED i received my 1510 on november 3. Out of fear, i reported this on my portal but also sent this score via collegeboard. the college\u2019s website says self reporting is sufficient but they will require official scores after admission. will the fact that i sent both just to be diligent be frowned upon?",
