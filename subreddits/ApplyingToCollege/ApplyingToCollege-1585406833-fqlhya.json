On top of that, Baylor and American aren\u2019t super bme schools, and I haven\u2019t visited Baylor, but I got into American and got really good money but when I visited it just gave off a big commuter vibe and felt dead on campus. That could\u2019ve just been me but idk that\u2019s how I felt abt it. If it\u2019s not great for ur major I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I do happen to have a major that it\u2019s a top school for, however, I\u2019m still prob not gonna go. On the other hand, gtown waitlisted me and my other top picks, USC, Colgate, and Richmond didn\u2019t give me money, so prob won\u2019t be able to go to any of those. As a result, I\u2019m looking at Gonzaga, Elon, and Loyola Chicago, all of which gave me huge scholarships and let me into exclusive programs. None of them are outstanding for my major but they\u2019re great schools nonetheless and money is too big of a factor for me. I would say if you\u2019re getting any financial aid go to UPenn, otherwise Baylor might be a good choice, I\u2019m not too sure. Good luck with your decision man!",

Pretty weird these colleges and their wack admissions process. Elon and Loyola Chicago are p good but I am not sure what your major is.  For Baylor I got in for Bioinformatics. Anyways, I was wondering if you know the acceptance rate to Baylor class of 2023. It says 39% on google but that\u2019s class of 2022. Is it actually 39% cuz I feel like everyone from my school get in when I checked on naviance.",
