  "text": "Duke University has been my dream school since I was a sophomore for multiple reasons, so I have considered applying to the school via early decision for two years already.\n\nA few days ago, a classmate found out about Duke and fell in love with it. Big deal, right? Fall in love with Duke for all I care, it's my favorite place for a fucking reason! The duke-engraved Cupid's arrow on his ass wouldn't have been a problem for me if it wasn't for our school counselor.\n\nOur school counselor prefers students that are involved in a lot of school-wide extracurriculars, but that's something I stayed from. The extracurriculars offered by my school is pitiful--a student government with ONE person running as a candidate for president, a National Honor Society that accepts anyone over a 3.0 GPA--and, to make it worse, the school is broke. Why expect investment to school-wide activities from a school that has half its projectors broken? From a school that simply does not have AP Calculus BC, and from a school that has someone with a bachelors in literature teach biology?\n\nDespite all this, our school counselor has publicly announced that he \"inevitably prefers students that engage in school wide activities,\" quoted verbatim. I stayed away from school-wide activities, starting a small software development company that has two patents and a physical office, interned at a local hospital..... but all that falls to the ground when a classmate participates in the student government. Now he's trying to dissuade be from applying to Duke, telling me \"I need a truly personal reason.\" \"The degree or program you want doesn't matter.\" \"The diverse student body doesn't matter.\" \"The education it offers doesn't matter.\" \"Its alignment with your interests doesn't matter.\" It became clear pretty quick that NOTHING fucking matters, and he explicitly told me to consider applying somewhere else. (The classmate that found Duke a few days ago likes Duke because \"it's prestigious for my major\").\n\nPretty fucking pissed. Our school is very small, so the counselor report holds a lot of weight. If the counselor really wants me to apply somewhere else, I'm afraid my application to Duke would be very subpar, and tilted towards this other classmate. He might not mean do it intentionally, but an obvious preference may be seen through the text.\n\nTL;DR: i loved Duke for two years, classmate just finds about Duke and decides to apply, counselor is now trying to dissuade me from applying to Duke.",

I have a lot of classmates that I think are incredibly qualified for the T10s and even the T5s yet the school shows a concerning level of neglect and distaste for the \"lack of school spirit.\" Might I add, all of these classmates didn't even apply to the National Honor Society. One enormously qualified classmate asked to create a Forensics club and was promptly rejected for a \"lack of school spirit.\" The next day we see a mediocre leadership club requested by a classmate involved in the National Honor Society.",

Combined all of these will easily outweigh the counsellor LOR unless and until the school actively states that you are not a good student/person, which I doubt they would",
