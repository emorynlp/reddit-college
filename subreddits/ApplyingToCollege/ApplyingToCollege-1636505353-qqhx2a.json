  "text": "I don't really know which AP tests I should be taking this year. I'm choosing from Psych, Bio, and US Gov/Comp Politics. I already have 5's and 4's in a good amount of other subjects. And I don't want to be stressed out at the end of senior year for no reason if I don't end up getting credit for these tests. Does anyone know if colleges limit how much credit you can earn from AP Exams? If so, is there a website or doc that I can find this info on? Also any advice on what tests to take would also be helpful. Thank you",
