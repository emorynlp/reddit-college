  "text": "I'm entirely new to the concept of student loans and everything. But I am willing to take student loans to fund nearly half of my education. My dad says he will be able to fund, but ik he just says that to ease the stress on me. I've got a sister who's currently a sophomore and I don't want to be a financial burden to my parents. \n\nThe reason I am asking this is because my parents want me to ED to a T20 for engineering. I too want to but idk I think I'll certainly take loans for 2 of the 4 years..",

Bad school\u2026 no interview.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the news reports, that\u2019s how it works. Brands matter, you know that, that\u2019s why you are asking the question.",

      "text": "&#x200B;\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature (go against parent credit and accrue interest during college) and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
