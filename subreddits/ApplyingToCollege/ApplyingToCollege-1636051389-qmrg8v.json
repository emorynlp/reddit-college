  "title:": "Looking to transfer to Cal State, already obtained AA degrees, but not enough transferrable units? Online bachelor programs that will accept fewer units?",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I recently received my AA degree from a community college in California with 3.9 GPA. I have 87 units, but only 50 of them are transferrable to the Cal State University system, which needs 60 transferrable semester units. I just need to get my bachelors degree through an accredited online program, either for early childhood or business. Do I still have a shot with Cal State (I read they might accept \"lower division transfer students\" - those with fewer than 60 units)? Can anyone offer any advice or suggestions for a decent online bachelors program that won't break the bank for me? Thanks!",

      "text": "Honestly the cheapest thing might still be to take a few more CC classes, especially if they will fulfill requirements at a CSU you are interested in. Did you try checking using assist.org against the business majors you are considering at a few CSUs? With so many CC classes online these days you can take a cool one from a lot of schools that might be helpful. For example, Chabot has a few accounting and HR classes you normally only find at a CSU. This website has a pretty good list of online CCC classes: https://cvc.edu/\n\nI know Cal State Fullerton and CSUDH both have online business degree programs. The one I think is pretty solid all-around for most majors is Arizona State, and the price is not awful. Or you could attend virtually free if you get a job at Starbucks. https://starbucks.asu.edu/  I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d take most of your credits, or at least come close to a CSU. I think a lot of the for-profit online degree programs aren\u2019t respected by employers but all 3 of these schools should be fine because they are well known state schools",
