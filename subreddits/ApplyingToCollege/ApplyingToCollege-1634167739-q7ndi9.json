  "title:": "Is making my personal essay one giant metaphor a good idea?",
  "text": "I say this, because when I wrote my essay it just kind of ended up being one big metaphor for overcoming mental health struggles (kinda cliche I know). This wasn't my intention, but I liked it. However now I'm worried that making my whole essay one big metaphor is a bad idea/overly cliche. I don't know, what do you guys think",

But like if it sorta sounds intriguing and interesting to the reader maybe have someone else read ur essay and give there thoughts. I would also like to add I know that the statement I added above is a simile but I was just giving an example of a cliche comparison.",
