  "text": "I currently hold executive board positions in 2 clubs. I don't mind the clubs, but my heart belongs to wrestling. I am currently a senior. If I were to desert my 2 board positions for my final wrestling season, would that reflect badly on me when I apply to colleges? Also, is it wrong of me to desert these positions? The positions I hold are like treasurer in each, nothing too crazy. I would love to do everything at once, and I thought I could, but my practice is starting one hour earlier this season, 3:15 which would interfere with my participation in clubs, which usually go until 4:00, with a board meeting at the end. Also, my coaches would chew me alive if I was 20-45 minutes late to practice once or twice a week lol, they would never let me pull that crap. So what should I do? ( My shoulder is also messed up cause of wrestling in an off-season practice, so one point for clubs.)",
