  "text": "So, I know this is more decision than application, but I don't really care that much.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the colleges they applied to are either cheesy or overly pretentious in image that they put out? Like there's no college that meets/exceeds your expectations because they're at either end of this spectrum. \n\nIt's disheartening at this point because I have four options, none of which I feel great about. Before I applied, I felt better than after I got accepted into 3/4 (awaiting the 4th). There's no perfect dream school to strive for or get super excited about. Is it me? Is it them? Am I depressed? Anyone else in the same boat?\n\nI could write more, but this is all I got for now. Lemme know your thoughts.",

      "text": "College should be the start of a new chapter in a long book. It should never be the goal.   \n\n\nI loathe the admissions counselors and people that hype college as some sort of goal that will make life great.   \n\n\nI especially hate the admissions consultant that graduated from top-10 schools hyping it up to other students. It's logically absurd, literally reductio ad absurdum. You go to a top school to start a business to get other kids into top schools. What is the point of their life?  \n\n\nCollege is a tool to help you achieve the things you want. Want to learn and gain knowledge in a structured way, sure that's a solid reason. Want to be with like-minded students, that's valid. But that can be found in many colleges if you know how to find that, not just at top expensive and elite schools.   \n\n\nKnow what you want to get out of school. But it's hard because it's such a complicated system and arcane institution. Sadly that's not taught in high school.",

      "text": "IMO it's okay to not be super-jazzed about any school in particular.  Though, if you \"don't feel great\" about any of your four choices, that's a little concerning.  Were there any schools you'd have preferred to attend besides those four, subject to the realities of cost and selectivity?",
