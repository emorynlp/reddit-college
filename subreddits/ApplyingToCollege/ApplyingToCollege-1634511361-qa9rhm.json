  "text": "My parents tell me that employers don\u2019t care where you got your degree, they only care that you have a degree. I feel like this is setting me up to fail. If I want to go to a good law or mba program, work on Wall Street, or work at a big tech company, does it matter which school I chose?",

      "text": "It matters what school you choose in almost every field.\n\nThat's not necessarily the same as the prestige of a school mattering -- schools offer different access to professors, research opportunities, quality of instruction, professional networks, and other things that you wouldn't necessarily think of as prestige. Kettering isn't a prestigious school at all, but if you wanted to be an engineer in the automotive industry it's got a lot going for it.\n\nAlso, graduation rates vary widely not just by the quality of the students but by the level of support schools provide.  When you start with a statement that employers don't care where you get the degree, there's an assumption that you are going to graduate.",

      "text": "Depends on the field and type of job within the field. Tech will mostly rely on what you can do; it's on you once you get to the interview. For Wall St (without grad school), undergrad prestige can matter quite a bit, though it is not necessarily dispositive.\n\nGrad school prestige is a different topic altogether. Undergrad prestige is not relevant for law school admission. For MBA, where undergrad might become relevant is getting the post-college work experience that is important for admission to top MBA programs.",
