  "title:": "Accepted to 3 Colleges & No Support from Parents",
  "text": "Hello! I got accepted to 3 colleges (Penn State, Arizona State, & Temple Uni), and my parents are really mad at me. They are not listening to me at all. My parents are saying that I didn't ask for a scholarship on the common app essay or the supplement that I wrote when I applied to college. So because of that, I didn't get one.\n\nBut, I'm trying to tell my parents that's not how the system works. There are two different departments. The admissions officers just decide whether or not I get accepted. And the other department for the school deals with aid & scholarships.\n\nUpon my acceptance, I got an email explaining the financial aid and scholarships, and deadlines.\n\nAm I wrong? My parents think that my college journey is over. My dad is cussing at me and he's saying that I'll be in debt. (I'm from a low-income family so I cannot afford college at all.)\n\nMy dad is completely losing it. He has no clue about college admissions. And now he's trying to make me specifically say in my future college applications that \"I Need a scholarship\". It's like he's losing brain cells. Writing that in your application is not going to do anything at all. I'm tired of his outdated information. My mother is supporting my dad 100%.\n\nAlso, when I first told my parents of my acceptance they never congratulated me. They just said \"It's easy to get accepted, but did you get a sCholArShIp?\"",

It's never to early to begin the journey of healing.",

Don't be like me, don't carry that baggage. Don't allow yourself to be gaslit. I'm glad you recognize what's happening now. I'm glad that more people are talking about the situations children face when they have shit-for-brains parents. As a kid of the 80s/90s (who is only now returning to school because of a lack of parental encouragement/support), I wholeheartedly feel for where you're coming from.\n\nThere are a lot of resources out there these days. Work with the schools, take advantage of their resources. Don't wait for shit to come to you (I did this, and it set me back so many times) BE PROACTIVE. Email, call, fill out every form under the sun, write a boatload of essays. Do this like your life depends on it because it sounds like it does.\n\nAlso, CONGRATS! If you got into 3 schools, you're probably one smart cookie. Keep it up!",

To a limited degree this stuff is negotiable.  If the packages those schools gave you put them out of reach, then you can tell them that and see if they're willing to make it possible for you to attend. I would first \\*wait\\* to see what other offers come in, and to see if those schools actually sweeten their offers.  (This happens.)  Sometime in March or April of next year you may want to try requesting additional aid.\n4. If money is extremely tight, then you \\*may\\* have wanted to apply to some schools much less selective than those three that would have been likely to give you significant merit aid.  It \\*may\\* still be possible to apply those schools (but maybe not; they often have priority deadlines for merit.)  If so, then you could try applying to some.",

Don\u2019t let their financial stress ruin this momentous achievement in your life. \n\nSecond of all, you\u2019re not wrong I believe. Additionally, your college career isn\u2019t over before it starts. You now have a few options in front of you. I don\u2019t know if any of these schools offer in-state tuition for you, but that makes it significantly cheaper. If you\u2019re low-income, then FAFSA will also be incredibly helpful, and you will probably get some grants to help (as well as some subsidized loans). \n\nThe other option, which many don\u2019t like, is you can go to community college and transfer to a 4 year. By far the cheapest option. But I would be communicative with each University and express your concern with money. Some may offer more scholarships and help lessen the burden. Also look for external scholarships as well.",

ASU and Temple are major metro schools, but Temple is in an unsafe crime infested ghetto.  ASU is a very walkable, safe, environment that to me feels more suburban than urban.  PENN State is a midsized town in a rural/mountainous part of the state.   Depending on your major I'd chose ASU or PENN ST. over Temple.  They will all be about the same price although you will be able to fly to Philly on the cheapest and shortest flights if you go to Temple.",
