  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently going over my application and want to submit an act score to University of Richmond. On their website (linked below) they say \u201cRichmond superscores both the ACT and SAT, but not across tests\u201d I was hoping someone could provide some clarification on what this means. Do I submit my superscore on ACT.com, both scores?\n\nThanks\n\n[Richmond Admissions](https://admissions.richmond.edu/process/materials.html#application)",
