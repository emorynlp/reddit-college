  "title:": "Can't Decide Between Princeton and Yale",
  "text": "I'm a recruited athlete who has been offered spots at both Princeton and Yale for class of 2026. I have full aid covering every imaginable expense for both. I want to go into computer science and understand that I have 2 years before I have to commit to a major. Princeton is a better school for what I want to do (especially considering their new 1 year masters program for engineering). However, on my official visits I enjoyed my time at Yale a lot more. I really liked the coaching staff and the people there, whereas not so much at Princeton. I would love to go to Yale except that I feel like it might be immature to choose a school based on the fact that \"I like the people\". I've heard strong arguments from both sides but was wondering if anyone on the thread could offer any more guidance or insight into whether Yale's com sci is REALLY that much worse. Thanks!",

When I had to pick what secondary school I wanted to attend, I visited several of them, and they were mostly equal in level, reputation, school type and the classes they offered, with some minor differences. But one of them, I immediately crossed off my list after I visited the open day and none of the students who were helping out seemed happy to be there. The atmosphere was just a bit off. Last year, I found out that that school had a lot of issues with drugs and violence at that time. I'm glad to be at the school I ended up choosing (one of the reasons was that the teachers all seemed nice and helpful, which turned out to be mostly true)",

Also ik the master\u2019s program at Princeton is a huge factor for you but could you possibly do your undergrad at Yale then masters at Princeton?

Also, pretty sure that they have the most number of Olympic medals out of all the ivies. Not a criteria but think that this can somewhat accurately demonstrate the athletic faculties. One more thing that I would say is go with your gut feeling and see where you vibe better, you do have to live there for four years and it is always best to know if you will be working more efficiently where.   \nGood luck!",
