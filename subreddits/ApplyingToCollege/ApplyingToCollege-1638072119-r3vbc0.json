For example, CMU, although ranked worse than Harvard holistically, is better than them in computer science. I just want to know general data like this regarding biology so I can start to decipher which schools to apply to next year.",

Salary two years after graduation?  Rate at which graduates enter Ph.D. programs?  Med school acceptance rate?",

      "text": "Rankings sites are where I started when I was making a big list of schools solid at physics. No shame in it. [Niche has a lot of specific majors rankings](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-biology/), though you'll find it often just looks like \"prestigious schools in a seemingly kind of random order.\" No website has accurate data in terms of \"value\" or \"quality\", because those are subjective variables. If you consider something like 4-year graduation rate an approximate measure of quality, however, you can find that on several websites (including Niche).\n\nThat being said, what schools are best for biology depends heavily on what you're looking to study and to do. If you're just looking to learn and not get a scam education, almost any school you've heard of will be suitable for that. If you're looking for something more specific to a type of career or grad school path, that can be narrowed down more easily. Many schools have solid biology programs, but your specific interests will help nail down a good fit.\n\nHonestly, most people (even at the level of academia) get their opinions on quality of programs through communicating with people at those schools.",

Most colleges offer biology and they can all meet the criteria for a solid foundation for med school etc. Even a regional public college can and do have excellent bio capabilities. It\u2019s a good idea to look for schools that fit what you want from the college experience, size, location, and most importantly costs. Then look at the specific bio program website to get an idea of how one program is different from another.",
