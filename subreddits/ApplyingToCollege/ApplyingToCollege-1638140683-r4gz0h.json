  "text": "When talking about application essays, my school counselor showed an example that included a link to a slideshow of photos of the applicant to visually add to his essay. Anyways, now I'm applying to UCs and I mention in one of my answers for personal insight questions that last year I built a website for my mom's students when she was teaching online. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to include the link to the website in either the answer, or the extra information. Other people online said that this would just serve to annoy the admissions officer and make them dislike me as an applicant but that seems a bit excessive--at most they just wouldn't read it right? My counselor showed this as an example and she reads essays for colleges so I was wondering... I don't know if she has time to respond though so if anyone has any ACTUAL insight or experience with this I'd appreciate the help",
