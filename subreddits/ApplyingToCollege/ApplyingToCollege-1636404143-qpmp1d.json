  "title:": "New college admissions resource from the Brown Daily Herald",
  "text": "Hey all! Thought I would share this here since it seems like it might be relevant to you guys. The Brown Daily Herald, Brown University\u2019s student newspaper, has a new admissions series and newsletter that will cover a variety of subjects surrounding applying to Brown, but also to other Ivy-plus institutions. Last week, we covered how students wrote their essays. (See below) This week, we\u2019ll be covering test-optional policies, and we plan to cover video intros, financial aid and more in the coming weeks! The stories all have perspective from both current first-year students and admission officers. Hope it can be of some help! \n\n[The first story/sign up to receive the newsletter](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/11/the-supplement-how-brown-students-crafted-their-college-essays)",
