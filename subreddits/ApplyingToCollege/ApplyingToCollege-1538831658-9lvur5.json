      "text": "Follow the age-old advice that is passed down through the years (if it wasn't clear enough, this is old advice that you can find on reddit, but good luck finding the original!):\n\nFind the nice bathroom on campus. There are quite a few, but they're hidden and rarely talked about, precisely because people want to \"protect\" them. \n\n - Don't look in the nicest, newest buildings; these do have nice bathrooms but everyone knows it. Don't go to the oldest, most rundown buildings because the facilities are about as bad as you're imagining. Look for something in-between, probably 90's era, maybe 80's. Take the ~60th percentile for your own university. \n\n - Avoid areas with high student traffic. These are places like refectories, multiple lecture halls in a single area, near student clubs, the library, or other popular hangout spots. If there are bathrooms in that area then everyone knows about them, which is what you're trying to avoid. \n\n - The best locations will be near more office-like areas. Around purely research areas or administrative sections, there are often single-stall, gender-neutral, and/or handicapped bathrooms that are not used by large numbers of people precisely because they're somewhat out-of-the-way. These places aren't thoroughfares and have no buildings/amenities/services of interest to 99% of the student body so there's no reason for people to walk through. \n\n - If you get the option to pick a dorm room, bear in mind that the rooms which are farthest away from everything/everyone else may have their own smaller bathroom. My own hall did this. There was a large communal bathroom in the centre that most people used, but since my room was in a smaller annex, we had our own private bathroom to share between 3. Again, you're looking for areas with few people that are far away from busy thoroughfares. Everyone needs to pee, so there have to be bathrooms around for *everyone*. \n\n - If you find one of these mythical bathrooms, never tell anyone where it is. Tell one person and everyone will know, and then you'll have to find a new one. It'd probably be further out of your way too. \n\nBasically, look for floors and hallways without many, if any, people. If you feel uncomfortable and as though you're somewhere you're not supposed to be, then you're on the right track. If an area is out-of-bounds to you then there'll be a locked door or a clear sign or someone will politely ask you if you're lost (you can lie and say yes if you like). It's not like you'll accidentally wander in the CSL or anything; you won't get into trouble just for walking around. If you find a single stall but it isn't for your gender, check the next floor up/down as sometimes they'll alternate. ",

My home away from home. Just don't shit in your own department. Go the extra mile to avoid colleagues. Bonus: you may also find a secret quiet comfy chair for studying while you are searching for your special bathroom.\n",

It was at a university where spots for studying were extremely hard to find and most of us couldn\u2019t afford to have internet connections at home so we often had to wait in line for a chair in some random department. The other problem was that friends would often find you and interrupt your studying by proposing a cigarette or coffee break. Then I found the newly established linguistics library, hidden away in a 16th century building that was 90% admin offices and 10% professor offices. It was small but it had windows (natural light!!!) that could be opened for a breeze, WiFi, clean bathrooms with toilet paper (in a country where there is never toilet paper anywhere) and most importantly it was quiet and unkwown. For almost a year I was able to keep it a secret despite my friends begging me to know where I was going to study every day. Then one unfortunate day I bumped into a friend on the street while leaving the building. He figured out what was happening and explored the entire building until he found my secret spot, which was never the same.",

So one day I really had a nature calling on the red phone emergency and I stormed in the building in my moment of need. I went up to a random office and I knocked,  I noticed all the doors were on keypads as well. No response so I moved to the next one and clenched sphincters I didn't know I had. I tried another door, I have a fine layer of sweat and a punch drunk look from the effort... at this point ai am 90% certain that I am either going to shit my pants the next time or I am going to pass out from the effort and then shit my pants. \n\nI knock at the next door, a man that can only be described as a clean cut stoner hippie answers and I explain my plight. He quickly tells me the code to the bathroom. Unsurprisingly I was done in record time. I cleaned myself up and went to head out of the building. The gentleman stoner is there in the hall and explained that was his personal code and that I would be repaying his kindness by not spreading the word... nor ever using it again as security would note the wrong patterns of entrance and egress, hence why he was still in the hall. \n\nI swore to him not to use that code again and that I would take similar emergencies to another building. \n\nwas a super nice bathroom though.

          "text": "To supplement this strategy for locating the best bathrooms, you should implement a triage system for what minimal acceptable quality is, based on urgency. For this to work, you've gotta do your planning in advance. If you build a mental map of acceptable bathrooms and the relative quality thereof, you should be able to manage an adequate to exceptional experience no matter the urgency. You can avoid the shame of shitting yourself and having to walk a mile across campus to change, and remain comfortable at the same time.\n\nA five star rating scale is pretty functional, so let's use that here to illustrate how to rank and prioritize.\n\nOne star quality is the sort of thing you try to avoid even if last night's bender-fueled taco binge is coming for your soul. These are the bathrooms that make the bushes look appealing. The sort of thing that makes you wonder if there's a way to give zero stars on any rating app/website. There are possible health concerns involved in this level of quality. Just shit yourself and get it over with -- if this is all you can find, it might be the lesser of two evils.\n\nTwo star quality is: toilet present and functional (mostly); be grateful for sandpaper TP but you may need to resort to ripping off a piece of t-shirt; rinse your hands with cold, rusty water and dry them on your jeans. You probably won't die, but why the fuck would you subject yourself to this? The upside is not shitting your pants and experiencing eternal shame. Accept this quality only if shitting your pants is a very real possibility. Only real redeeming qualities are the presence of the toilet and the usually minimal traffic flow.\n\nThree star quality is when we're starting to get somewhere. This is the busiest quality level of bathroom as a general rule. Most people (suckers and noobs) find this to be \"good\" quality, but we know better. They are adequate and serve their purpose. Toilet(s) work, there's usually more than four squares of toilet paper left (generally one of those five-roll monsters because of high traffic), the sink produces at least luke-warm to pleasantly warm water, there are paper towels upwards of 86% of the time, and it has the capacity to handle the traffic flow of it's location barring unusual circumstances. There's no shame in this level when you're in the classic \"if you've gotta go, you've gotta go\" situation or as a quick pit stop between classes with tight scheduling. These bathrooms are often still multi-stall, but can approach four star quality during off-peak hours. (Although they must have middle grade or better toilet paper to qualify for this boost.)\n\nFour star quality is fucking paydirt. I will fight anyone on this. These are the ones that a lot of bathroom connoisseurs overlook in their quest for five stars. The diamonds in the rough, if you will. Nearly always single-stall, but the occasional multi-stall can qualify in the right conditions. Ultra low-traffic, forgotten by maintenance types fall here. If you bring a roll of paper towels and some bleach bathroom cleaner on your second trip for your own maintenance, and pack-in high grade toilet paper these can become your own personal \"five star at the three star price\" kinds of bathroom. Good odds on those basement and top floor bathrooms becoming one, especially older buildings. Good candidate for the \"I wonder how this sign labelling this as a bathroom went missing?\" maneuver. Sink is capable of the full range of temperatures on demand, toilet is pretty nice with good flushing power, and is in range of good wifi. All the foundation, with less hype, or a fixer upper. This is the kind of bathroom you can nurture into five star status if you're careful, and can become one of the legendary \"in every generation there is a chosen one\" bathrooms if you guard it well and pass on it's secrets.\n\nFive star is next level. The \"wow this brand new bathroom in this new wing that isn't in use yet\" types. The ones that people pass the location on in each generation to the chosen few (or lucky single heir to the kingdom), and guard the secret closely. Perfectly adjustable water temperature, excellent flush power, paper towels are never empty, no disturbances, great wifi, and in lucky cases you might find a beautiful view or some excellent tile work.\n\n\nIf you have time to select at a more leisurely pace, treat yourself to a five star experience, but you can also cultivate a four star bathroom into something extraordinary and have it at your disposal at nearly any moment. Never accept less than three stars, you deserve better than that. If you are diligent in your bathroom questing, you can build a mental map that will serve you well for years. \n\nRemember: leave each bathroom better than you found it if possible, and *never* worse. Respect the four and five stars that you are blessed to encounter.\n\nEdit: These are the skills that you gain by having IBS. Carried them from college into the rest of the world, and they have not failed me.",

      "text": "I had a handful of favorite bathrooms in college. \n\n\nOne was the top floor of the lab wing of the science building. It was about 4 stories up and mostly deserted. That hallway was just labs which last almost 3 hours. The classes usually topped at 16 students. So there\u2019s a 15 min window before each *3 hour class* where there are 13 people in the hall? That\u2019s nothing. You can\u2019t really *leave* during lab. You have whole consecutive hour blocks of time with a near guarantee the hall will be pin drop silent. I\u2019d go poop while the lab kids were in the middle of class. Whole thing to yourself. \n\nOne was in the basement of the English building because there was zero cell service. Underground in a stone building? We could barely get on the WiFi. No one else is gonna poop there if they wanna look at their phone. We all do it right? So I\u2019d go there to poop. \n\nOther one was the staff offices at the top of the library. You won\u2019t look out of place, I promise. The offices exist for one kind of university or student related service or another. There will be students on that floor all the time. Maybe just a few of them, but they will there everyday. But since it is just offices that see maybe 30 total students all day you have a pretty significant chance of getting the pooper all to yourself. \n\n",
