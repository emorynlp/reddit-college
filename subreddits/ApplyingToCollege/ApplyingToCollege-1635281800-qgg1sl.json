  "text": "So I submitted my common app to a college yesterday and I got an email back today from them saying I needed to fix something. They didn't like that I superscored my SAT in the Common App. \n\nIn the Common App, are we allowed to superscore? Because it has two slots for EVBRW and Math as well as two separate dates if I say that I tested twice. \n\nMy other question is: should I submit an AP score where I got a 3? \n\nI'm kind of conflicted because I don't want the college to assume that I didn't submit it because I got a 1 or something, but they might also not like score either and it could disqualify me from some reach schools?",
