Being a legacy statistically makes you twice as more likely to be accepted, but no college will accept you if you are underachieving and a legacy. \nBeing URM also gives you an edge as most colleges want a student body of many racial profiles rather than just white and asian. \nAnd lastly being an athlete is so easy feat in it of itself. I am guessing you are referring to being a top tier athlete? If so, many schools like Johns Hopkins want good athletes, so as long as you keep your grades up to a certain point, it can give an edge but is equally as hard as being a top tier researcher who wins prizes.\nAlso, early decisions can make you more likely to be admitted as you are usually competing with less qualified people and there is less competition.",

At the firm I'm at, a good portion of the software/hardware engineers tend to be from strong state schools but the researchers/traders that don't have Phds are mostly from those few schools. \n\nIn general, the school you go to can definitely influence the connections and opportunities you'll have access too and it's definitely something that needs to be considered. In the tech industry, if you go to a top 10 CS program (or ivy that has a lot of CS majors), it's easier to get a referral to companies like FB/Google/Uber/Pinterest/Stripe from friends who will have probably interned/fulltimed at those types of companies, and that makes it easier to get an interview. That being said, a lot of companies (especially Amazon/Microsoft) will interview anyone with a pulse for their new graduate positions, and most large schools nowadays will have a lot of CS majors to connect with, so you really can't go too wrong here.",

Like I said other schools have these same connections to be made, they are just more readily available at an ivy. Once again I'm no expert just sharing what I've been told.",

These schools oftentimes have vast alumni networks and whatnot that make establishing connections easier, and as a result the outcomes for ivy league students who took their academics seriously oftentimes are better than those who didn't attend an ivy league. I don't have any statistical data on this, but you haven't presented any either (so I don't know why you called me out on it), and like I said I'm no expert I'm just repeating what I've heard from various ppl, whether on this sub, or in my personal life, and as I said in my original comment, going to an Ivy League doesn't mean you're destined to get your dream job or make connections which will put you above the rest of the competition, the same way not going to an Ivy doesn't mean you're destined to make no connections. There is a middleground, but in general terms it is easier for ppl who go to schools like ivies to make connections. I'm not here to try to offend anyone and I would be happy to be proved wrong by actual statistics bc imo this whole system is stupid and the quality of education is the same no matter what school you go to, so why do we build these preconceived notions about certain schools?",

You\u2019ve kept mentioning what you\u2019ve heard or seen on this sub, and I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong for doing that, but why is it that the focus seems to be on the same eight colleges? Yes they have vast alumni networks, but so do hundreds of other colleges. It seems that we agree more than disagree, so I\u2019m not going to go much further, but I want you to keep thinking about this. If you\u2019re attending an ivy, I give you major props because that is certainly an accomplishment. But if you\u2019re still deciding where to go, just think about why do we place such emphasis on these colleges, and will an ivy really REALLY drastically change your work outcomes?

Maybe for elitist positions like finance, school is incredibly important. But lots of other schools have connections as well. Idk where you're at, but I chose money & friendly environment close to home over some name. It's all fun to make jokes about state schools here, I laugh at them too. In all seriousness though, your effort is the main part of how you'll do finding a job, not the school. I know well-off & smart people, not a single one of then has a degree from a t20. \n\nIn summary, t20's will be better for some areas like finance, but there are equal or better state schools for other areas, which encompasses most jobs.",

She says \u201cyeah I got a 1500 but it was very bad. Missed on question on math. If I want to get into Harvard then I want to be able to get 1530 or higher as a goal......so what about you what\u2019s your score?\u201d\n\nI zoned her out and walked away to the front of the line.
