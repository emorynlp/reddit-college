          "text": "That list is okay but it's very heavily balanced for engineering. also, any info pre-2020 will be a bit out of date as sixth moved to a new location and seventh was created. \n\nI would recommend doing your own research using compare.ucsd.edu. If you want to get really into the weeds, I would recommend using plans.ucsd.edu and the UCSD AP credit chart to see what credit you have and find out which college has the least and most flexible requirements for you. Every major is the same in each college though so it's definitely overkill for most people, since all that changes is your GE requirements and housing",

It depends a lot on your major, but for engineering something like:\n\nMuir/Sixth/Warren\n\nSeventh/Marshall\n\nERC/Revelle\n\nIs pretty typical. I would check out compare.ucsd.edu as well.\n\nKeep in mind it is effectively impossible to change the college you get into. They're really not a major deal though. Any of the things that say they have \"personalities\" and stuff are mostly BS.",

              "text": "Of course! I would definitely try and do your own research into it, but even if you get into a \"bad\" college for your major it's not the end of the world. For most people the college you get shouldn't make or break things, but it'll be easier if you're in a college that has more overlap with your major. I'm an electrical engineer and I got into ERC, which is basically the worst combo you can get at UCSD, but it's been fine. I had some AP credit coming in which helped a lot so I actually could've graduated a quarter early this winter, but since I'm starting a master's at UCSD next year I'm just doing some grad classes early to finish the master's earlier.",
