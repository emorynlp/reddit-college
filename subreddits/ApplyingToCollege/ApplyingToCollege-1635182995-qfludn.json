  "text": "Hello everyone. I would like some suggestions from fellow computer science students applying for Fall 2022. I initially wanted to take a gap year but because of a special program, I was told to apply early. I am still in the process of preparing papers but have made some progress. However, I wasn't able to research much unis to apply to due to my initial gap year plan. Therefore, I would like some suggestions for what universities would be good to apply to for computer science. However, I don't want very expensive and high ranking ones like Harvard or MIT. I'm looking for smth a bit lower that is good and has scholarships like DigiPen, Carleton. So can u nice folks give me some uni suggestions pls for computer science mainly in USA that provides scholarship and aid but isn't as costly as MIT, Harvard or other ivies.",

It's biased towards PhD programs with up-and-coming younger faculty, but it'll give you a good idea of stronger and weaker schools.\n\nThe best deals in CS are usually large state universities, but they might not be a good deal if you're out of state or international.  Ref UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UW, UIUC, UMich, UWisc, UTAustin, UMD, and GATech.  UWisc and UMD are probably the easiest to get into.",

There are many very good CS programs that are not housed in an engineering college and therefore wouldn\u2019t be subject to ABET accreditation.\n\nhttps://www.abet.org",
