  "text": "Hello everyone. I would like some suggestions from fellow computer science students applying for Fall 2022. I initially wanted to take a gap year but because of a special program, I was told to apply early. I am still in the process of preparing papers but have made some progress. However, I wasn't able to research much unis to apply to due to my initial gap year plan. Therefore, I would like some suggestions for what universities would be good to apply to for computer science. However, I don't want very expensive and high ranking ones like Harvard or MIT. I'm looking for smth a bit lower that is good and has scholarships like DigiPen, Carleton. So can u nice folks give me some uni suggestions pls for computer science mainly in USA that provides scholarship and aid but isn't as costly as MIT, Harvard or other ivies.",
