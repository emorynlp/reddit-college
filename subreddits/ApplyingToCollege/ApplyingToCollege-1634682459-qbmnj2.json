  "text": "Short question - is the deadline for applying EA actually November 1st (for most schools)?\n\nWhat I mean is that some universities have their own application portals, links to which are sent after about a week since submitting an application through the common app. Should I therefore apply a week earlier, or can I submit additional materials after November 1st? Sorry if it's a stupid question!",
