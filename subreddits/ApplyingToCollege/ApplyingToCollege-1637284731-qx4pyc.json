  "text": "Gap year student here. I graduated this May and was not too sure about committing to an expensive university yet and went to my local community college just to try out some classes I was interested in only for a semester. Turns out, this makes me a transfer student for some colleges. It seemed like most private institutions only considers a student to be transfer if they finish an entire year's worth of classes before enrollment (which I won't be), but public schools, such as UMichigan and the UC schools, have told me that I will be considered as a transfer student instead of a first year. Even worse is that the UC schools have credit requirements that I need to complete before applying. Classes I've been taking at my local community college were just art-based ones, an astronomy class, and a language I've wanted to learn, and none of them amount to the UC requirement. So I just can't apply at all to the UC schools it seems like... I guess it was dumb for me to think about going to my local community college while planning to apply as a first year. Anyone have heard of/experienced a similar case? My application will obviously be weaker than actual transfer students' apps, and I honestly just feel like I've screwed myself.",

      "text": "That's unfortunate you found yourself in this mess. I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nFirst off, look at what schools you would want to attend and what they would consider a transfer applicant. As you have seen each school can set their own policy. Furthermore, there may be some that will consider you a freshman applicant if you weren't enrolled as a degree-seeking student in community college.\n\nUnfortunately some schools like the UCs have a whole list of requirements for transfers which you now need to work on if you want to apply there. But fortunately, there are also schools where applying as a transfer isn't much different from high school applications, at least from your side.\n\nYou'll find many universities in the U.S. are transfer-friendly but some high-profile ones (the UCs) are very tight on who they let in and others (Princeton) have a record of NOT admitting transfers. So if this is your situation now, your options may have changed, but with some planning you should still have many open doors.\n\nYou can also see if anyone in /r/TransferStudents is in a similar position.",

      "text": "Not that it would be what you originally wanted, but if you are in CA (since you were looking at UCs), they have a program, TAG, where you can get *guaranteed* transfer admission into certain UCs. The TAG requirements consist of about 2 yrs of coursework (but APs can help), so obviously that doesn\u2019t help you now with just mostly fun classes under your belt, but TAG is pretty amazing if you are struggling as a 1st year transfer to meet requirements. \n\nIf you meet all the TAG requirements, you pick one school to TAG into. Then, you can still apply to others (like UCLA/Cal), and you have safety that\u2019s still got a great rep.",
