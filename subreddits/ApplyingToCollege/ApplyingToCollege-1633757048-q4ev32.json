  "title:": "Not sure what am I doing",
  "text": "I don't really know what am I doing by applying to ivies against all odds. I don't really feel like I am fit for them and people saying it, again and again, makes it no easier. My partner, sister, and few people have only been hopeful. Just making a small rant here. \n\nI don't really have any fancy ECs if not none. I usually spent my free time programming and building things. Little insignificant things but meant something to me. From blinking LEDs to chatbots and websites. That's about nice as it gets being honest.\n\nSchool never had any ECs, when it once did, it stopped after a year, it was robotics. That's when I started embedded electronics. Soon stopping after a year or two? Because it became expensive, things would burn and I couldn't ask parents to get me new stuff or get my designs fabricated. Then I started making chatbots, then websites cause it was free. I had what I need a decade-old computer. I would make silly bots for my friends applying what I learnt over time. When the build process of code started taking awfully long, because the tools were so stressful on my computer, I ended up making my own build process. Eventually starting freelancing to finance me to buy a computer. When I did get my computer, at the beginning I was making lots of new things. Helping people revive their old projects, which I wanted to work but could never considering they were so massive for me and my computer. But then school started, I had shifted to a new school, the coaching school ended up being torture. Often using programming to make myself feel better till the point they started talking about getting me failed if I didn't attend to my parents. PS, over the years, the dire need for mental/emotional help hasn't been helpful either, I have struggled with anxiety attacks and existential crisis, it's always been the addiction of making things that kept me busy and happy.  (PSPS, being on a self-help platform I met so many people, many of whom I lost but there are still a few countable of us friends\n\nApart from building things, it's been about learning things. Often through the internet cause, I couldn't afford books, as my parents didn't see the value in non-academic material. It often was spending all day, the whole day, spending it learning and applying. From tutorial to tutorial, medium articles, StackOverflow, Github and Reddit. There are other things I still am enthusiastic about, but don't get time or don't have resources. Like biking (broke it), photography (I haven't been going outside apart from school) or gardening (takes lots of time, throughout the day). That is all to my ECs. \n\nTalking about competitions, I don't really remember going anywhere. Our school rarely conducted inter-school competitions and neither could my almost single mom take me to places and afford. So yeah, I have almost 0 prizes. I did win an online hackathon once, but I have no proof about it or certification. Also, I did volunteer once, as a class initiative, but nothing else, considering we (family and I) had our own hardships to keep us busy. \n\nAcademically I had always been great. I did manage to be always the first ranker till the 9th. I had family issues in 10th (came 2nd in the whole school) and then I changed schools. The new school has been hard and depressing, it has been draining, I have been an average or maybe less now. I was also the valedictorian of my previous school and opened up my school library for borrowing and also managed to increase the time students were allowed to be there. (Mostly because I would spend my time there in solitary and read books and the teachers kept disturbing me. I also spent time in the computer lab often, using the admin's internet and do programming, show her things I knew)\n\nSo yeah I don't really know why should I be at MIT, it's just I love programming, I don't see myself doing anything else and I feel MIT would give me things I always needed, little recognition (nobody cares of what I code for hours cause they see nothing coming out of it) and lots of resources.\n\nApplying to MIT, Harvard, Cornell, Brown, Princeton, Columbia, Yale, UChicago (probably ED2) and Amherst. Why not ED? I have my SAT in December, the process of registration and fee waiver was new being an International.\n\nThanks for reading, appreciate it. I don't have anywhere else to vent, so :P",
