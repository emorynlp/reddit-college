They made me take the SAT again, and I was thinking it was useless. Freak things like covid can ruin your uni offer internationally, so just take the test. Obviously, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll go to uni abroad, but I was in the same situation with the same feelings and then mine got crushed. Anyways, congrats on getting accepted that\u2019s awesome!!!!",
