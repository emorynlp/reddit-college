  "text": "Lets start here... I am a high school Junior this year and have been running myself in circles trying to prep myself for tje next huge step in my life. Can you guess what it is?\n\nAnyway... I am the type of person to over analyze things, a trait many may relate to. I have a strong passion for engineering, specifically electrical. I am a straight 4.0 student + AP classes in science and honors math classes. I participate in a select few extracirriculars that I really 'go all out' in. I have leadership roles in them all and I have been promoted to a supervisor at my place of work (i heard colleges like work experience). While this may be a vague description, i am confident in my course rigor and activities as they pertain to my application. Although, i have some pretty high hopes in mind... my heart is set on Gatech and UMich for Electrical Engineering and if i get into either I will be so grateful. My skills in essay writing are profound and not to be confused with my ineffectiveness to write a paragraph on r/applyingtocollege. My only shortcoming is my SAT. I am confident I can get a min 1400. Maybe not much higher. Ive easily gotten 750-790 on practice math btw. I guess I just need reassurance? Advice?\n\nOh also I was published in a magazine for inspiration by my electronics i designed. I ended up reaching millions of people.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think you need to stress about the college application process - certainly not in the fall of your junior year. Enjoy time with friends and family and maintain your academic excellence. You\u2019ll be a strong candidate for admission and merit scholarships depending on where you choose to apply next year. \n\nThere are many colleges with accredited electrical engineering programs. You can do a search on the ABET website to expand your list.\n\nhttps://www.abet.org",

      "text": "It sounds like you'll be a competitive applicant. Take advantage of Khan academy, r/SAT, and other free or low cost resources to do as well as you can -- you should have time to take a couple of shots at the test, and it's something where more familiarity with the test can really help.\n\nIt's great to aim for schools like Michigan and Georgia Tech, but keep in mind that they are very selective for out of state engineering students and certainly aren't the only options where you could excel.  Have a wide variety of options ranging from schools you could have guaranteed acceptance and big merit scholarships at (Iowa State, ASU, Texas Tech, etc.) to those really selective schools.  There are a lot of good electrical engineering options out there, and the difference in outcomes between the best schools and the good schools isn't that large.\n\nIf finances matter for you keep that in mind too - if you aren't in-state you could be in a situation where a private school like Cornell would provide a lot more aid than a public out-of-state options.",

      "text": "You will make a college list with a wide variety of reaches, matches, and safeties. Ga Tech and U Mich will be reaches.\n\nYou have time for testing. If you're not happy with your score this spring, plan to retake early fall senior year to bump up one or both sections. Lots of seniors end up doing this.\n\nIt's time to talk affordability with your parents. PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. U Mich is one exception, they may offer some need-based aid to low income out of state students. Ga Tech typically does not offer need-based aid to out of state students. Private universities offer need-based aid without regard to state of residence. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you decide to apply.\n\nIf a large public university setting is what you are looking for, start by checking out your in-state options, both the flagship and regional universities.",
