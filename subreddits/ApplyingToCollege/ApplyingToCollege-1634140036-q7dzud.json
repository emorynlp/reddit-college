I can apply but I will still need help from them for my CPP and visa process. coming to the USA has been my dream for so long but I am not being able to and don't want to stay here. I just don't know what to do. all my friends will be going next September and I don't wanna be stuck here. please... I feel like all my dreams are there but I just cant follow them.",
