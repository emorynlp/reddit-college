  "text": "Title. So I sent my official superscore ACT report to a university that doesn\u2019t accept superscore. I was confused because ACT didn\u2019t let me add two score sittings to the cart, and it said that the superscore report would include one full ACT sitting. \n\nIs it ok if I just go and send the single test score to that university, too?",
