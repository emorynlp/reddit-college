  "title:": "Happy Saturday, Seniors! What You Really Need to Know about Being Rescinded. \ud83d\ude33",
  "text": "First -- It's gonna be ok.\n\nSecond -- Being rescinded does happen, but not often.\n\nStill, the threat of being rescinded \u2014 when a college revokes its offer of admission to a student \u2014 is scary for a reason. All that hard work and stress for nothing? Kids often wonder, *what did that person do to deserve that? It must have been something really bad. Unless it wasn\u2019t. Oh no, what if it was only a little bad? What if I do something only a little bad and I lose my spot?*\n\nI find there\u2019s a bunch of confusion surrounding being rescinded. To be clear, at many colleges, offers of admission are conditional upon several factors. Those offers can be withdrawn at any time if those conditions aren\u2019t fulfilled. This is because the college wants to make sure that students take their commitment to the school seriously. They don\u2019t want to admit students who work hard only when they want something or who demonstrate certain values only to gain acceptance.\n\nFor example, a college might rescind admission if a student\u2019s academic performance takes a dive in the last semester (and I mean a dive). It isn\u2019t always just about grades either \u2014 a college might rescind admission for non-academic behavior. If you get into big trouble, such as by engaging in criminal behavior or doing something really, really stupid that undermines the picture of the person you claim to be, a college might not like that very much.\n\nYes, [being rescinded happens](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/). But it\u2019s not as common as you might think. And if a student has done something that draws negative attention, the university will more often than not ask for an explanation.\n\nBut let\u2019s just avoid being rescinded altogether. Here\u2019s how:\n\n**1. Keep your grades up.**\n\nYou can\u2019t slack off your last semester. Try to maintain your grades as much as you can. You don\u2019t want to put all your hard work in jeopardy right before you cross the finish line. I had a Redditor contact me last fall because their admission to a UC school was rescinded over three Cs. So, it happens. Be careful. Here\u2019s a clear rule of thumb: don\u2019t go down over one letter grade per class and don\u2019t do that in more than a few classes. You definitely want to avoid Ds altogether, and also avoid having your entire GPA go down more than one letter grade.\n\nHowever, know that one bad grade isn\u2019t the end of the world. If you earn a lower grade in a class or even two, during your last semester despite your best efforts, you\u2019ll probably be ok, especially if your other grades remained steady. Look, bad grades happen.  Colleges know you have a whole other semester left when they accept you. IF your grades take a dive and you\u2019re rescinded or asked to explain them, be open and honest. I\u2019ve had students write letters about family obligations that took over their lives and they just couldn\u2019t keep up the grades they\u2019d historically made, and it worked out fine. If your grades plummet or drop down more than one letter grade, you should probably get ahead of it and reach out to colleges, explaining your situation and what you've learned from it.\n\nThis year, more than ever, it\u2019s going to be important to be transparent with colleges about aspects of your life that have had an effect on your report card: limited access to the internet and technology, members of your household who\u2019ve been struggling with Covid 19 or mental health issues, and economic issues are all real issues that students are coping with and colleges understand that the last nine months could have had an impact on your application and your grades -- even this last semester. So be prepared to explain what\u2019s happening to you. Explaining your situation is NOT making excuses.\n\n**2. Don\u2019t be messy on social media OR DO or SAY anything that harms others. Even if you don't post, it will probably be posted on social media by someone else.**\n\nGenerally, you should focus on being a good person, but you especially need to be careful during your senior year, and especially on social media. On the Tulane Admissions Blog, Jeff Schiffman [explains](https://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2019/03/some-thoughts-on-social-media.html) that \u201cThe most frequent reason I rescind admissions is dumb stuff you do on social media.\u201d He goes on to explain that admissions officers aren\u2019t trolling social media waiting for you to slip up \u2014 they don\u2019t have to. Someone will send them a screenshot of something offensive, and that\u2019s how it starts. As he explains it, \u201cBeing a jerk on social media to your peers or your community\u201d is something he has no patience for.\n\nI think you can just extend that to don\u2019t be a jerk. Look, of course, we all have our moments when we act like jerks, but the fact is cell phone videos get posted or sent to colleges all the time. You don\u2019t want to be the kid who has to explain their language choices to an admissions office. You don\u2019t want to be that kid who has to learn the lesson the hard way that your words matter and they can be hurtful.  More than a few future seniors had their applications rescinded this past fall for their behavior and words -- either posted to social media by them or others.\n\nSo, for example, while you and your friends may think your humor is raw and it\u2019s a blast to be super edgy on Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram Stories, the Tulane or Georgia Tech admissions office might feel a bit differently. Don\u2019t let it get to that point.\n\n**3. If something happens and your college comes looking for answers, come clean.**\n\nIf your college has concerns, they\u2019ll ask you what\u2019s going on, which allows you and your guidance counselor to offer a valid and reasonable explanation. If it\u2019s about grades, talk about how you learned your lesson and how you\u2019ve learned to manage your time more wisely. You can say that you got in over your head, and you have learned how to deal with that situation. Explain that if you catch yourself in a bind in college, you will immediately go to the tutoring center and meet with your professor and TA.\n\nIf you did something stupid or mean or illegal, own up to it and talk about how you understand the gravity of your offense. Assure the college that you learned something and you have changed for the better. Reiterate that you made mistakes, learned a painful but important lesson, and you are now ready to steer your academic and behavioral ship in the right direction. Talk about how your experience will make you a better college student now.\n\nFor whatever reason (and I hope this never applies to you), if your application is rescinded, reflect on what happened, learn from the experience, grow from what you learned, and move on to the next experience. Unfortunately, if it gets to that point, that\u2019s all you can do. But please please PLEASE know that being rescinded is not common, and if you keep your eye on the prize and focus on being a good person and keeping your grades up, you won\u2019t have to worry about it.\n\ntl;dr: 1. keep up your grades: don't drop down more than a letter grade, don't make Ds.  2. don't be a jerk.  3. prepare to explain.\n\nAnd I love this tl:dr from ScholarGrade: Keep your grades (reasonably) up, don't drop all your APs for study halls, don't do anything unethical/immoral/illegal in public, don't lie in your application, and don't do anything cruel/toxic on social media.  If something happens, come clean, own it, and work with the college to address it.",

First, are mental health issues due to the pandemic a valid explanation (not excuse) for grade drops? My mental health has been the absolute worst it has ever been, and I'm really really struggling in school. I never see anyone because I'm stuck inside, and I am having a hard time pulling myself together. :-( I don't have any grade drops as of now, but I wanted to prepare in case it happened. \n\nMoreover, I'm an IB Diploma candidate, but I never sent predicted scores to my schools because I'm in the US and my school just doesn't do that. Still, would an IB score perhaps get me rescinded? I take Chinese, and it's just so hard for me as an English speaker. I'm just worried I might not score well. \n\nThanks again!",

Would I get rescinded for these grades. I\u2019m really scared and I just want some peace. Online school with senioritis is a deadly combination. I\u2019m positive I will get no Cs for the year overall but is that GPA drop considered rescind worth or a dive? You\u2019re help would be great because I\u2019m so tense about this",

The best option is to obviously not be a moron who posts dumb shit on the internet, especially with your name attached to it, but if you fail to do this, lying is your best option. It's basic game theory. \n\nIf you fess up, you're getting rescinded. If you don't fess up and there's even a 10% chance you don't get rescinded, that's still 10% more than 0%. Lying can't make it worse.\n\nI get that if you have a B and your college asks to explain, you're a moron if you lie that your grandma died and that's why your grade dropped. You can come up with a far better excuse that isn't a proper lie.\n\nBut if you say something incredibly racist that's sure to get you rescinded unless you lie that you didn't do it, just lie. You can easily cover up traces. Change the email associated with your account, continue tweeting as you usually do even when in investigation, etc. Delete the evidence only if it isn't public. Like if it is a DM, consider deleting it. If it's a public post, don't. That's a surefire way to confirm that you own the account.\n\nAll of this is unideal, which is why you shouldn't be an asshole, but it is the best choice. After all, you don't plead guilty when you're on trial for first degree murder.",

Say that the students who reported you have an obvious grudge against you, so they have incentive to do it and that deepfakes are very common and easy to make these days. There are plenty of sources that make unbelievably accurate voice clones for free some sample audio inputs: https://www.resemble.ai/ and https://www.descript.com/lyrebird\n\nIf all they have is an audio, then you can easily fuck them up. As for video, you need to be more convincing and show them the millions of examples of convincing deepfakes out there (https://youtu.be/IvY-Abd2FfM, https://youtu.be/-0OED73sRXs, etc.) and point out any oddity in the video like low resolution, lack of focus, camera not capturing the face fully, camera capturing the face too front on making it easy to edit, etc. This combined with the serious threat to sue could work.\n\nPublic schools don't have the same kind of due process as the court (private schools are even worse), but depending on how much you press the school and board with your lawyers, you can really increase your chance of not getting rescinded before school ends. The school has race against time. If that doesn't work, you can press your university, but this is almost never going to work as the university won't risk anything for its reputation. As long as only your high school knows and you don't brag about your university, you can avoid your university knowing.\n\nBut yea, if you're dumb enough to stay stupid shit in school on video, you're probably too dumb to pull this shit off unless your parents hired a lawyer to do it for you.",
