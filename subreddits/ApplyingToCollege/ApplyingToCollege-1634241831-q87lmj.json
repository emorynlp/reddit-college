  "text": "So I participated in a pretty big national level competition in my country and was selected for the final round. More than a 1.2 million people apply and only 5000 get selected. I was selected but unfortunately wasnt able to participate in a final round. So should I list is as an extracurricular as I was in the top 5000?\n\nAnd also will it carry any weight as it was not in the US?\n\nThe competitions name is National Talent Search Exam (NTSE) if that helps.",
