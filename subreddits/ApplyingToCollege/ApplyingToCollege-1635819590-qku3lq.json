  "title:": "Can I Go To College if I'm broke? I Need Help Overall.",
  "text": "I kinda need help, its my senior year and I'm trying to apply to all the colleges I can go to and be successful. I already filled out my FAFSA and I think I'm qualified for a pell grant because my parent doesn't work and the other doesn't earn much at all so we're really down bad tbh. I wanna go to college for I.T cyber security on campus, away from my parents and being independent, but idk if its possible.\n\nI asked my schools job counselor to help me apply to Mizzou but she said I probably can't because of the cost and also my GPA is 2.28. She said my best bet was to suffer and live with my parents for 2 more yrs and go to a community college such as Saint Louis Community College.\n\nOn the other hand my counselor that I see every week told me to ignore her and just apply to Mizzou and other colleges im interested in and see what they say. I wanted to try Lindenwood University or Missouri State University but idk if I'm still able to go there.\n\nI really wanna get a good paying job, start anew and live away from my parents, and be financially, mentally, and physically successful unlike my parents(financially I mean).\n\nWhat should I do? Is there a way I can go into a college and live on campus or am I fucked and I should just stick to a community college?\n\nAlso how does financial aid get to u?",

So do I just try to apply anyway or am I absolutely fucked?\n\nI was thinking that if there is truly no hope then ill just stick to community college for 2 yrs then find a I.T cyber security job because I'd prefer to do that than going to a 4 yr college after community college and I don't really wanna go to school for 6 yrs. I'd preferably want to go to a 4 yr college at the start but if I'm fucked then ill just go to community college and hopefully I'll still get accepted into an I.T cyber security job.",
