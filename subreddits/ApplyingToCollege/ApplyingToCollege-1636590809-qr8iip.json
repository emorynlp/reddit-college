  "text": "i applied to a lot of scholarships/competitions for things and some results are starting to trickle in. do you typically update your ED schools with these accomplishments? (e.g. youngarts results are getting released in early december). if so, do you do so through the link directly on the applicatino portal? i've heard mixed things so i'd like to hear your input. thanks :)",

      "text": "Yes they are valuable accomplishments, but those scholarships are probably based on the activities, test scores, and information you already submitted to the college. So if you are using the scholarships to whow you are a good student, they would have already seen that in your application. Its different if you won like an essay competition or a robotics tournament.",
