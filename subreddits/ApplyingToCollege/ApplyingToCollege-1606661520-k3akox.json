  "title:": "Analysis on what T20 Schools WANT",
  "text": "After 1 year of research:\n\nStanford - Most well-rounded school in America. If you have 3.5 UW or higher in hard courses, but extraordinary ECs or an EC, you're qualified to get in. They\u2019re looking for the next-gen.\n\nCaltech and MIT - You'll need to be a straight-A (or nearly) a straight-A student in the most challenging courses offered at your school to get in. (Again, nothing set in stone, but this is what I have analyzed after looking at some Naviance scatterplots.) MIT looks for \"academically talented students interested in an analytical-based, hands-on education, who have shown true engagement, initiative, curiosity, and community mindedness.\" Caltech's mission: to advance the borders of human knowledge by doing scientific research.\n\nDuke and Vandy - A balance of nice ECs and very good coursework. I\u2019d say 3.8 UW in rigorous courses is the sweet spot for these schools, but then again, if you have an EXTRAORDINARY EC, you could get in with 3.6 UW, etc.\n\nUSC - LOVES seeing great extracurricular activities! I attended one of their webinars, where they were so proud of a student who didn\u2019t have straight A's, but had superb EC activities. Remember that they want a balance of ECs and a strong interest in your major; this is evident in the USC essay prompts themselves. If you\u2019re an engineer, make sure that you\u2019re rounded.\n\nUVA - One of the least rounded schools in the country. They want to see excellent course selection and grades (which the GPA does not convey) first and foremost, then strong recs, essays, and activities. Academics have always come first. It's not about doing unusual or unique things.\n\nUMich - A very rounded school that wants to see students who excel academically, but also those who have a personality and cool extracurriculars that \"wow\" the admissions officers.\n\nNotre Dame - Extraordinary school with extraordinary people. The people who go to that school somehow have always stood out to me. Very kind and hard-working souls. Definitely aligns with their mission statement: Notre Dame is dedicated to providing a Catholic co-educational program in a --> \"value-centered\" <--- environment. Be sure that your teachers write you EXCELLENT recommendations. :)\n\n\nIvies - Think they\u2019re the kings of the country. Always asking for top gpa........ That\u2019s like the only qualification. And be URM or an athlete\n\nTufts - looks for students who can balance their extracurricular activities with their academics. They also love students who are passionate about their field (medical, etc.) It is indeed, a pretty rounded school although they look at academics a bit more than UF, etc.\n\nUF and UNC - They absolutely don\u2019t want nerds. They want personality. I\u2019ve talked to the AOs there and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\n\nUChicago - Essays matter 55%. The only school that looks STRONGLY at essays! But then it should\u2019ve been your dream school to apply to since you had to have thought about the essays and written them over the summer. You can't write anything here. The essays must be thoughtfully written out to have a chance of getting in. :)\n\nRice - Rice definitely wants students who are very strong academically and who have good SAT/ACT scores. On the non-academic end, the AOs are really looking for students who think differently, much as UChicago does. Have you ever dealt with an unfavorable circumstance but then created something positive out of it? Can you portray something small in a different light? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what Rice AOs want. Haven't formally attended any of their webinars, so this is just info I got from previous posts on Reddit, online, etc. \ud83d\ude03\n\nLiberal Arts Colleges - I think all LACs are looking for passion. A good balance of academics and ECs. And most importantly, that you\u2019re a rounded student!\n\nUCLA/Berkeley - Academics (since they are, after all, competitive state schools), but if you have great essays or something that sets you apart, definitely apply. A respected Redditor also stated that Berkeley looks for grit. :)\n\nJHU - Looking for innovators with strong GPAs. Let the GPA and SAT/ACT part not deter you though. They love seeing people who\u2019ve invented new things!!\n\nUIUC/Purdue/Northwestern: How have you explored your interest for your major? This is the MAIN thing. For NW though, be sure to have great grades too.\n\nWashington University in St Louis - Mainly looks at SAT/ACT (surprising, huh!) If you have close to a 1500, definitely apply. GPA must be okay too. These guys focus on kids who have a passion for research, so be sure to mention research somewhere.\n\nCMU - Not rounded. You need great grades and SAT/ACT scores. The only other way: have you won hackathons? Etc..\n\nNew post on ECs on the way! I myself am an avid science researcher and have researched in many labs about amoebas! \n\nGood luck guys and sorry for the mediocre grammar. Typed this out in a rush! I know we will succeed!! Also, remember that colleges follow a holistic admissions process. Nothing here is set in stone. :)\n\n*MOST IMPORTANTLY: some people on Reddit will discourage you citing that your GPA is too low. There is NO cut-off to apply to top tier schools!!! Don't listen. tothem! I know 5 people who had below a 3.7 UW GPA who got into top schools! Your other parts of the application are important too!!! NEVER listen to them. If colleges truly are only looking for GPA and don't care about academic improvement, etc., then you know that this country doesn't care for inventors, etc. Then you know the state of the country. :)",

          "text": "Ah it\u2019s not T20, but it\u2019s close (depending on what you consider T20.) These are the great unis that people generally apply to. UNC is definitely a little easier to get into if you\u2019re not OOS, but then again, they have fewer applicants applying from OOS. Naviance indicates that it\u2019s definitely harder to get into UNC and UVA OOS. Same with UCLA/Berkeley, but most people applying to those schools from OOS are geniuses with perfect scores haha.",

When I came here, my counselor calculated my GPA based on the US system and that made my GPA low even though it should be much higher than it is. I plan on explaining this in the additional info section so they can recalculate it and my counselor also mentioned it in her LoR, so hopefully they understand. My essay is about my experiences moving around and living in another country and how that shaped who I am and the things I learned from it, and I think it\u2019s pretty good. Hopefully they appreciate the diversity and accept me because it\u2019s my top school\ud83d\ude2d",

I attended one of their webinars, where they were so proud of a student who didn\u2019t have straight As, but had superb EC activities. Remember that they want a balance of ECs and a strong interest for your major; this is evident in the USC essay prompts themselves. If you\u2019re an engineer, make sure that you\u2019re rounded, but nail 3/4 prompts talking about your intended major. HOWEVER, do NOT mention specific details such as arrays, etc. If you keep it too technical, they said that they DON\u2019T want the person at USC. It must be conversational. For sure, these guys want good GPAs and all, but would definitely accept a 3.66 UW with improvement who LOVES his/her intended major over a 4.0 UW just applying for the heck of it. They are rounded! And I know this for sure. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",

In fact, the biggest mistake my HS friend with a 4.0/1570 and another with 4.0/1580 thought they made (and I quote them verbatim) was \u201cassuming WUSTL emphasized high stats\u201d. The SAT and ACT range for WashU is honestly about the same as other T20s, so idk where people get the \u201cthey especially love high SAT students\u201d shpiel from. Both had strong ECs as well and were rejected RD. Also, almost everyone I know did not do research in high school. \n\nI would say WashU cares more about demonstrated interest than most other schools and showing that they would legitimately be interested in attending the school by showing up to info sessions, attending webinars, clicking emails they send, etc. A lot of students I\u2019ve met here actually weren\u2019t super notable and especially not in the context of this subreddit (i.e many of my friends are Asian but had 3.7 GPAs and 1450-1500 SATs \u2014 one person ik is majoring in Bio but got a 2 on the AP test as his only STEM AP score) but all of them mentioned showing a LOT of demonstrated interest when they applied via ED1/2 or visiting and attending their HS infosessions. The reason for the strong emphasis is that WUSTL has a rather low yield rate for a T20 from losing cross-admit battles with other universities and has earned itself a reputation in the past as a school with a lot of strong students who are salty Ivy Rejects (and anecdotally, I know that a fair number of people actually transfer out to more prestigious universities or attempt to do so from being dissatisfied here). From what I have seen so far, they would 100% reject someone they think is a very competitive candidate in favor of someone who might not be a superstar across the board but shows a definite desire to attend. \n\nAnd as unfortunate as it is \u2014 your ability to pay the tuition matters. Checking that you plan on filing the FAFSA will lower your chances of admission as WashU is need-aware and considers your financial means. I suspect this is why a sizable number of students that I have met come from relatively expensive private high schools / academies as opposed to public high schools (disclaimer that this does not mean that it\u2019s hard to fit in as someone who isn\u2019t as most people here tend not to flaunt their wealth and are relatively down to earth, but it is still worth a note).",

There are just so many factors that go into college admissions\u2014GPA, SAT scores, ECs, essays, recs, demonstrated interest, etc. And then add in a dash of randomness. The post reads as horoscope-y to me. \n\nMy advice to potential Wash U applicants would be to demonstrate as much interest as you can, work hard on your application, and write an essay that really captures your voice and speaks to who you are. College applications can be super stressful and can feel like the be all end all, but you\u2019re going to have the opportunity to succeed wherever you end up.",

In fact, these T20 colleges pride themselves on getting a diverse student body with all sorts of interests, and not just one specific caricature that this post claims they are targeting. The only thing anyone can really say for sure about T20 admissions is that someone should have good grades and SATs and no red flags to be competitive. Beyond that and the information provided on the universities\u2019 Common Data Sets, there is not really any hard data stating exactly the type of persona they\u2019re trying to recruit. I only say WashU cares about how much money someone has because they literally say so themselves that they are need-aware. Anything other than a direct confirmation from a university official or admissions officer is to be taken with a grain of salt.",

There are plenty of schools that look highly upon students who have only a few ECs that they\u2019re dedicated to (even if they\u2019re not rock stars at their ECs).\n\nI think your essays will be important, as well as the tier of school. If you have top grades and scores, I think top 10-20 schools are completely reasonable, especially with good essays. This list is one high school senior\u2019s perspective. Keep in mind that the top schools not only look for well-rounded students but also a well-rounded class of students, and your application will help you make the argument to be the student to help round out that class.",

Just a side note, half of her ECs are continuos (to show that she has passion) and about half are new ECs where she tried new stuff. And yes, these are not your easy going ECs. Her ECs are the types where they met everyday. She also had people from Northwestern and University of Chicago proofread her essay. \n\nWith all that hard work guess what?? Still got denied by Stanford, MIT, Brown, and Caltech. She managed to get accepted to Yale though. \n\nWhen applying to T20s just try your best to have good school records and always remember that LUCK comes into play. \n\nUp to this day, I don\u2019t understand how she got denied. \n\nAs I said, you CAN be the perfect student and still get denied.",

One time advice for the entire sub: college admissions, getting a job, starting a company, etc. all fundamentally on other humans\u2019 ability to connect with a story.  Be intentional with you story.  Show; don\u2019t tell.  That story might actually be useful to you when you show up at college and wonder WTF now.\n\nAs for grades, do your best but don\u2019t sweat it.  I quickly learned that the folks who were to become math professors and physics professors were fun friends, but I also realized that I could create connections across disciplines that they didn\u2019t see.  I was def a bit over my head as a freshman and mostly got Cs at first, perhaps a result of my trying to punch a bit higher than my weight.  In hindsight, my time would have been better spent slowing down and not rushing up the mountain of technical education.  \n\nHave had two successful startups and am working on a third as CTO.  I consider myself very fortunate, but it\u2019s hard to attribute much of that to the Ivy League pedigree and connections.  Most successful people I know did not go to top schools.  \n\nIt\u2019s fine to not know what you want to be when you grow up.  I\u2019m still not sure I do.  But try to focus on derivative instead of position.  Specifically, if you don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s a story that explains you and your current direction (that\u2019s a lot to ask anyone), one place to start with with what you are curious about.  What questions do you have about the world?  What projects, the the loose sense, are you currently working on to answer those questions?  How will your education give you better to tools to not only answer those questions, but also ask better questions?",

I have no idea if this is completely true, but it might play a factor (please correct me if i'm wrong though). My advice to other younger students is to go to a high school where the rigor of the curriculum is self-presenting. (again, someone should correct me if i'm wrong lol)",

On the non-academic end, the AOs are really looking for students who think differently, much like UChic does.

If you have a university that easily lets students take classes there and you haven't, you're probably competing against people who have. If you have a great volunteering opportunity that your classmates have taken advantage of, or even students in your city frequently take advantage of, the person reading your app will be aware of that. Something to consider in the \"black box\" of ECs. Likely other schools do this too, but I know the top ivies do.",

The interview was somewhat informal and asked similar questions to the essay, but the goal was really to see if you could talk about your passions and show that you do really have a strong desire to go to MIT and such. Basically, if they still make you do this, and I think they still do, be prepared to really sell yourself and show how much your really want to be at MIT. I wouldn't say the interview can make or break an application, but they're an incredibly competitive school and almost everyone there will have perfect academic scores and great extra curriculars, so it is a great idea to stand out and get a good recommendation from your interviewer. It might also help raise you up into the accepted pool if you were just below the cut for getting in or not if you interviewed really well, or could even be the difference between definitely not accepted or second round offer.",

Major rankings are mainly fueled by graduate programs. If we're talking undergrad, a Caltech, northwestern, uchicago, princeton, brown, cornell, etc degree all look more impressive than uiuc and will get you better inroads. Period. Talking about major rankings, again, for undergrad, is a coping tale as old as time. Might be one thing if you get into a better school and genuinely choose uiuc for CS (but lets be real...almost no one is gonna choose uiuc over caltech, all else being equal)",
