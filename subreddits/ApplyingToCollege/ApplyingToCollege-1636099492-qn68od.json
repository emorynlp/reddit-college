  "text": "I\u2019m an international student (Australia) and so far I\u2019ve applied early action to UNC (chapel hill) TCU and University of Miami. I\u2019m double majoring in economics and music. I\u2019m a well established violinist who\u2019s had several zoom lessons with the faculty at all these universities and they\u2019ve all insinuated that I have a very high chance at receiving one of the full music scholarships.\nAside from that I\u2019m a 4.00 student and done heaps of extracurricular. However,  long story short we do not have college counsellors here. So I instead asked our head of student services to write me one and submit my reports as the \u2018counsellor\u2019. So this head basically deals with students, their well-being etc. Now as she was assigned the counsellor on my common app, as psychologists/ therapists here are known as counsellors, she incorrectly assumed that in the letter of recommendation that she should disclose some of the acute mental health issues that I suffered earlier in the year. Apparently she wove them into her letter as after she submitted it she told me a brief overview of what she wrote. I assumed that by asking her to write a letter of recommendation she would just write one detailing about my academic performance and extracurriculars associated with the school. As she had never done this before, she had no idea. The letter has been submitted and it cannot be changed and now I\u2019m terrified that not only my scholarship, but admission to my top three schools, is totally off the table. It also was a breach of trust disclosing this information and she did this with very little proof (the proof of my so called mental health issues was a classmate who told her I\u2019d seemed depressed during the year) and I don\u2019t know what to do from here. I don\u2019t want my admissions to be jeopardised especially by this young student manager who obviously thought she was supposed to write a mental evaluation.\nI have no idea what to do from here as i really never thought  she\u2019d misinterpret and misconstrue a simple \u2018letter of recommendation\u2019",

      "text": "You need to have an honest discussion with her. Say that you've learned mentions of mental health issues are the death knell of an application. You can even apologize for not giving more guidance earlier. Then, have her at least read what MIT suggests ([https://mitadmissions.org/apply/parents-educators/writingrecs/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/parents-educators/writingrecs/)) and maybe even the following:\n\n* [https://www.weareteachers.com/tips-for-writing-college-recommendation-letter/](https://www.weareteachers.com/tips-for-writing-college-recommendation-letter/)\n* [https://www.thebalancecareers.com/sample-college-references-2062901](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/sample-college-references-2062901)\n* [https://blog.prepscholar.com/4-amazing-recommendation-letter-samples](https://blog.prepscholar.com/4-amazing-recommendation-letter-samples)\n\nShe can then email a replacement LOR -- and ask that they completely delete the prior LOR since it was inaccurate or she made a mistake or whatever. However, you need to act quickly. Good luck!",
