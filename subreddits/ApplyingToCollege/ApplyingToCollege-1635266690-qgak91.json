  "text": "I read a couple of my friend\u2019s essays recently and I feel like theirs are wayy more deep and profound than mine. I wrote about my job, as it\u2019s a huge part of my life and I have a lot to say about it, but I now I\u2019m rereading it and kinda panicking because it\u2019s not as serious and complex.",

Why do these things matter to you?  What do they say about your core values, personal strengths, foundational beliefs, motivations, aspirations, character, etc?",
