  "title:": "Should I mention the petition I made",
  "text": "Hi,\nLast year me and a friend (mainly me) made a petition that caused a lot of discussion at my school regarding mental health after a suicide and finals that were a week later. It got a lot of signatures (800) and if it wasn\u2019t for my parents, we would\u2019ve made the news. Would this be a good thing to mention because it shows I care and I can do affirmative action? Or would it be bad because it shows I am a trouble maker and can\u2019t keep my mouth shut? \nThanks.",
