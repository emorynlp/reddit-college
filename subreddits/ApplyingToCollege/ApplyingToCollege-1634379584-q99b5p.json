  "text": "Hello guys, I'm in the middle of writing my essays and I'm a bit struggling to find the structure or the topic of some of them, so I thought of buying Dyllen Nellis 113$ essays course. Is it worth it? How can I get help from experts if available? I know people like Scholargrade are experienced, but I can't find their posts about essay writing.",
