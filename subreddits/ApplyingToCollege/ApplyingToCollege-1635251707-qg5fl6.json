  "text": "For some oversharing context: \nTW- AB*SE, KIDN4PPING\n\nI grew up in a very bad home with farmers who were poor and hated eachother. My dad a narcissist, my mom bipolar. My mom left him when I was 7, and he transferred everything on to me because I was the oldest girl in the family. He treated me awfully. One day I took voice memos of him verbally ab*sing me and that was the only thing that kept the court battle going because no one believed me in court. He\u2019s kidn4pped me twice. \n\nI do believe i could write about that, but it also made me develop a personality disorder that I find pretty interesting. \n\nI sort of wanted to write it about my favorite book- Looking for alaska- and how it changed me. It\u2019s about a girl with the same personality disorder. \n\nOr- I could write it about the time I won perseverance at some class award thing in elementary and apply it to other parts of my life. \n\nIdk. I\u2019m stuck! I\u2019m a pretty good writer I just don\u2019t know what sells.",
