  "text": "I'm trying to come up with ideas for if I don't get into my dream school: Chapman. The program I'm applying to has a 30% acceptance rate and I have serious imposter syndrome. I'm filling out my common app, and I don't really know what I'd do if I don't get in, you know? I struggled with high school, and Community College (I'm transferring in) I'm creative so I am applying for a creative program, I have bad mental health issues which was a reason I slacked off a lot in school so my highest GPA is a 2.0. I have a small number of extracurricular activities because I was unmotivated and didn't even want to go to college....I'm struggling guys, to come up with backup plans. I don't have the GPA, or prereqs to get into the public universities in my area, I barely did all my gen ed in CC. I tried to explain this to a counselor at my CC, and they keep telling me to take more classes. My current situation won't allow me/I won't be able to take more classes. I've been in college for 3 years. I don't want and cannot keep taking classes. I was thinking maybe just work and apply again...but that doesn't sound solid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to pick up the mess and change my situation, but I don't even feel like I'll get in. Any backup plan ideas?",

      "text": "Honestly, do you want to go to college? Are you sure it's the best option for you? If you struggled through HS and community college how do you know it'll really be any different at Chapman? I don't want to discourage you because if this is genuinely a school you want to go to and feel like you'd be motivated to do well at then you should go for that! But, I also think you should consider why you have struggled so much and what your goals are. \n\nThere really is no right answer here. It all depends on you. Maybe it'd be better to not continue with college, get a job and do what you can to work on your mental health. Maybe you hold off on applying another year and do the best you can to get your grades up and get engaged with EC's that you love and make you happy. Things you'd be motivated to do and continue. \n\nWhether or not you get in, there are plenty of viable routes you can take. Working is a solid option if it's what you want to do. You can always go back to college if you want. But, again, I really do think you should consider what would genuinely be best for you and your health.",
