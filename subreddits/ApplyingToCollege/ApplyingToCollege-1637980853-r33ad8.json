  "text": "title is pretty self-explanatory but i\u2019ll explain some more i guess. \n\ni had no background or anything on the college application process. so when taking the sat i never marked \u201csend scores\u201d because i figured \u201cwell if i do bad on this i don\u2019t want them to see! i\u2019ll choose which one to send when this whole test thing is over\u201d \n\nthen\u2026 application season begins. i go to send my scores to my selected colleges (one being ED (nyu for anyone curious)) but the cost is too much for me to justify (because again, since i waited i now have to pay). \n\ni ask my counselor for a waiver code (because i need it even though i don\u2019t qualify for reduced lunch) and she gives it to me but in order for it to work i need to sign up for the SAT and send the scores once registered. so i think \u201cwhat the hell.  i\u2019ll sign up and take the dec. 4 test because maybe i\u2019ll do good and my rd schools will see it.\u201d so that\u2019s exactly what i do. This was around Nov. 2\n\nI wait a few weeks because i know it can take a while to send but as of today they all still say that their \u201csent status\u201d is pending. for every single school, including my ed school, which announced their decision on dec. 15.\n\ni haven\u2019t been able to call because collegeboard says they\u2019re closed for the holiday. should i be worried about them not receiving it? will it only receive once i take the dec.4 test? and if that\u2019s the case, is it too late?\n\nedit: i feel like i should mention that my score is a 1410 with 720 reading and 690 math",
