      "text": "Most schools automatically consider you for scholarships without any additional application.   Some schools have a priority deadline (separate from their admissions deadlines) that you must apply before in order to receive full consideration for all scholarships.  A few schools have a separate application for their \"premier\" merit scholarship.\n\nGoogle \"{school} merit scholarships\" and do some research on each school you're interested in.  You're mainly trying to figure out 1. doe they have a priority deadline, and 2. do I have to do anything beyond applying via the Common App.",
