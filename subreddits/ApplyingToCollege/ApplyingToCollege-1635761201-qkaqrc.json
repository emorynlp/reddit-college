  "text": "In the general common app section, I provided my SAT scores. I ended up not wanting to submit my SAT scores to colleges, so in the college specific questions I clicked to opt out. I forgot to take it out of the general common app part though.\n\nso my applications that are submitted have my SAT scores on them, but say that I don\u2019t want them considered. Now that colleges have them, are they going to be considered regardless? The scores are literally on the application even though the application says that I don\u2019t want them looking at my scores.",
