  "text": "I submitted my FAFSA application the day it opened. I submitted my social security stuff and my parents' social security stuff and it got approved a few days later. Signatures were also done the day of. \n\nMy parents then got emails saying \"action required\" and that signatures were still needed. :/ \n\nWhat does that mean bruh i already submitted both my signatures and my parents' signatures.\n\nI checked on the application status and it says \"processed successfully\".\n\nDoes that mean my application was submitted properly and i should ignore the emails??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry if the stuff i said sounds super unorganized. im just rly worried and im just word vomiting",
