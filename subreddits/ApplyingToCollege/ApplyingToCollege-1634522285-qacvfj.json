  "text": "I believe this is a fairly simple question, but I may be totally misunderstanding how the application process works since I am no understanding of how it works. Anyways, i am finishing my resume right now and i was wondering how to list athletic achievements. I am an accomplished wrestler and I am going to be in contact with all the coaches of the schools I am applying to, so i was wondering if I just list my leadership skills or whatever from wrestling or if i make brief mention of my accomplishments. This is kinda confusing and I explained it bad, but please help me out!",
