  "text": "Okay so I know that several colleges say that they'll consider highest superstore only... BUT, on common app, we're required to fill date for when we got the highest score on each section. So they'll clearly find out if it's superscore or not. Also, we're required to tell how many times we've taken it. This makes me wonder... If the colleges did only care about superscore, why would they ask all this...??\n\nEDIT: My main question is the one at the end of post, not the title\ud83d\ude2d",
