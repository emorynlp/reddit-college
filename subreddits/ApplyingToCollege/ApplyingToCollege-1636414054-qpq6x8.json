  "text": "I saw that Amherst admissions video and they literally spend 4 mins reviewing your app before doing a vote on it. Even the admissions officer said he j goes with his gut cuz he doesn't have time to reason thru it.\n\nDo u think other admissions processes (Canada, UK) where it's mostly based on objective merit are more fair? In Canada it's literally highest GPAs get admitted until spaces fill. They barely look at ecs, essays, interviews etc.",

Just wanta throw my 2 cents in. \n\nI'd say both systems have their pros and cons. For UK students, the application process to uni is pretty decent. Predict strong A-Levels (and take them eventually), write your personal statement well, and get a good recommendation, bam your off to university. From what I know it is a problem that some private schools will have so much more available to applicants in terms of the quality of teaching, teacher recommendation writing ability, and personal statement help, but all in all I think the process is pretty fair. Major issue I see is people coming from a low income/underrepresented background who may have less opportunities. Luckily this sort of thing can be contextualized in your recommendation, while it's not perfect it helps. \n\nUS system has more problems in my view. The standardized tests offered here kinda suck. The SAT is infamously a poor measure of student ability and correlates better to income than anything else. AP classes are just not available for MANY, MANY students making it impossible to really use them as a fair metric of achievement nationwide. GPA is basically useless outside of benchmarking you against your high school. Extracurriculars are largely dependent on income and area, as well as student availability, though the embrace of home responsibilities and jobs as extracurriculars in heartening. So what does this leave AOs with? Essays and recommendations? Recommendations are infamously biased against minority students. Essays are pretty good overall, but again it's about who you have behind you. Does the student have a knowledgeable and well paid college counselor whos helping with their essay, or is their final review service their relatively inexperienced English teacher? Awards and honors have similar problems to ecs. Overall US admissions just feels pay to win. UK admissions doesn't feel much better, but it does at least have the benefit that your A levels can be compared to any other applicant (albeit with contextualization in some cases). Also A-Levels are hard enough to where getting an A\\* or even an A is impressive. We in the US see a 5 on an AP exam as impressive, but in the UK many unis see getting a 5 as simply proof you took the course. In their minds anything less than a 5 would be equivalent to a B or less at A level. More distinction at the top makes it easier to distinguish applicants.\n\nFinal disclaimer, I'm just a kid, this is probably all wrong, feel free to point out mistakes I made!",
