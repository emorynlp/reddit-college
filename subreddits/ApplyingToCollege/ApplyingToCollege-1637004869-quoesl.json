  "text": "I'm an international student who applied EA at MIT. Today, while checking my application status page, I noticed that an application checklist appeared with 4 items: 2 teacher recommendations and 2 school transcripts. One of the transcripts is marked as received, while the other one is marked as 'awaiting'. \n\nThe first weird thing is that I indicated only 1 school in my MIT profile - my current one (for security reasons, call it X). My counselor from X uploaded the transcript 1 month ago and MIT had already received it (they sent me an email confirming it). The second transcript is named \"MY SCHOOL IS NOT LISTED - INTERNATIONAL\". I wonder how it got into the checklist.\n\nThe only possible reason I can think of is my CSS Profile, where I specified that my school is not listed (they couldn't find it in their database). Maybe MIT received the profile and updated the application checklist? I don't know. \n\nAnother weird thing is the inconsistency of their website. When I check the application checklist from my PC, the site shows that it received the \"MY SCHOOL IS NOT LISTED - INTERNATIONAL\" and didn't receive the X transcript. However, when I check the checklist from my phone, the site shows that it received only the X transcript. This makes me think - maybe they have only one transcript in their database, but somehow things got messed up and they're displayed as 2 different transcripts in my checklist? Again, I don't know.\n\nI already sent them an email regarding the confusion, but they said that it might take 3-5 days to respond. I will of course wait for their reply, but just to calm myself down a bit: what do you think of this situation? Has this also happened to anyone else here? And what else would you suggest for me to do?",

      "text": "My daughter\u2018s application shows two line items for each recommendation. One say Submitted and one says Excluded. Someone else recently reported two transcript line items.\n\nSee what they say, but I wrote it off as a quirk in their system/process. If you only have one transcript, and you were notified that it was received, you should be fine.",
