  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am currently a senior. I asked my teacher for a LOR in august, and they confirmed that they would write it. I wanted to follow up with them, but I'm not sure how to write the email to them because I don't want to appear clingy. If you guys could give me an example or ideas I would appreciate it.\n\n(btw I'm submitting by Nov. 1)\n\nThanks",

      "text": "I have this same problem, I emailed my college counselor today to ask what I should do and she said she would send an email tomorrow to all the teachers to remind them about the upcoming deadline for LORs. So if you have a good relationship with your college counselor maybe ask them to remind the teachers, or you can just send the teacher a very polite email saying something like \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were aware of the Nov 1 deadline for [x colleges], I really appreciate you writing a recommendation for me\u201d",

      "text": "One thing to do that works. If you have a resume ready, print it out and personally go talk to the teacher. Handing them your resume, thanking them and asking them if there is anything else that can make their process go easier. And then follow up in a sincere email with the electronic version of the resume. It helps them a lot in writing the LOR. And it works!",
