  "text": "Hi, I'm a high school senior interested in applying to NYU Gallatin and I was a bit unsure on what this specific questions is asking for. It is asking to indicate an academic area you would be interested in exploring through the Gallatin Individualized Study concentration, so are they asking for numerous things are just one thing? I know for Gallatin, you can have numerous concentrations and it isn't a traditional one major.",

      "text": "Hey, as the other commenter said it is more open. You do not need to have a specific \u201cconcentration\u201d already in mind, just list whatever you are academically interested in pursuing.\n\nI am a sophomore at Gallatin, so when writing my essay I spoke on my interests in psychology, policy, and education. What I do recommend is exploring how your several interests intersect, as that show you are thinking in a interdisciplinary way. \n\nIf you have any questions, I am happy to answer Best of luck applying",
