  "text": "Basically I have a semi decent common app essay written, but I can most definitely improve it. However, in Colorado we have free app day around the corner, and for the CO schools I'm applying to I feel my common app essay is satisfactory. If I use this essay now for those apps, can I switch the essay later for the other apps I'm applying to?",

      "text": "\r\rYes. When you submit an app, the college receives whatever was in the app at the time you submitted it, as if the app is a PDF. You can change the app before submitting to another college and the first college would not see those changes.",
