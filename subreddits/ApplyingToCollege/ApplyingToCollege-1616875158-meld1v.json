It will not necessarily \u201call work out.\u201d  Please start applying now to schools whose deadlines have not passed yet.  I believe that UPitt\u2019s deadline is March 31, and I\u2019ve heard that Fordham is still accepting applications even though their deadline and decision release date has passed (I could be wrong for both of those, but I\u2019m just trying to give you some ideas).  I\u2019m sure there are plenty of other colleges that you can still apply to, but time is running out.  **Take action now.**",

What happened is a couple things. One, a pandemic, that turned college admissions upside down. What used to be predictable is no longer. The other thing is bad advising. Advisers should've known this year was going to be wack and should've advised better - actually accurately described and suggested real safeties.   \n\n\nIt's just more of the rough year. You pivot. We're resilient. There are lists of school with acceptance dates all the way up until classes start, there are colleges that come out with a list after May 1st who did not fill their classes, and there is community college, which is a super smart way to go. Lick your wounds - the sting is real - and then move forward.\n\nPlus I would re-define \"dream school.\" One's dream school is the one you get into, that's a good fit, that you can afford, that you choose, that you go to, that you have fun at, that you learn a lot at, and that gets you the degree you want to do what you want. So, no one knows what their dream school is at this stage.",
