  "text": "Basically the title. I let my dad handle all the questions about finances and such on the Common App because my parents will be paying for my college education and so I basically checked all the boxes regarding money as he told me to because he knew more about what to do finance-wise than me. However, my school counselors recommended that everyone fill out the FAFSA even if we won't qualify for aid. Can I still submit the FAFSA even if I selected \"no\" for this box, and *should* I do that?",

There are also often merit awards with a need-based qualification criteria.\n\nMany applicants decline to apply for financial aid under the thinking that it will improve their admissions chances.",

          "text": "i mean some colleges don\u2019t require the fafsa for merit aid, and i believe the only college i applied to that needed it for merit aid was fordham. also, many colleges will sometimes give you more merit aid if you\u2019re not going for need based aid. but, i would check on the school\u2019s website and even call the financial aid office to ask your merit aid questions.\n\nhowever, i still think filling out the fafsa is important because you can see if you\u2019re going to get federal aid, or if you\u2019re going to need to take out loans with a private lender. but you also don\u2019t need to send it to any schools if you\u2019re fine with the results.",
