It\u2019s hot food, greasy and salty, and it hits the spot at a low cost. Stanford is many things, but it is not that.",

So in terms of the actual college *experience* Stanford is about ok at best.\n\nYou're paying for the brand, small class sizes, and gorgeous architecture (if you even like that style). But it's not a unilaterally more enjoyable or fulfilling experience than other schools.",

And not everyone at Harvard has parents who donated a building.\n\nYes you have a higher chance of being a legacy, makes sense seeing as you have 2 parents who went there so likely you were raised in a family with hard working parents. And before you say they can slack off and get in that's not true either. Most kids work their ass off bc their parents expect them to since that's what they did as kids. \n\nI'm not a legacy but I know people who are and they go in with just as many, if not more qualifications and then if they get rejected they've disgraced the family, if they do it's nothing special. But trust me when I tell you that the legacies I know work their asses off to get in and are under 1000x more pressure than some kid who might have a shot. The system is corrupt, but just because you make it to the top of a corrupt system doesn't mean you couldn't have made it to the top without that shit.",
