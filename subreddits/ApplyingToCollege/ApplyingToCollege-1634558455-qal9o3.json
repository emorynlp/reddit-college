  "text": "I have already successfully sent my SAT score to all the schools on my list except Wake Forest. On College Board's website, the status of this submission has been \"pending\" for a week...I know WF has been test-optional since 2008 but on its website, it says if you want to send the score, you can. I am really confused. Should I contact the college board?",
