  "text": "My friends and I scored pretty decently on our AP exams last year, and most of the cheaters at our school pretty much failed (as we expected them to lol) \n\nWill we be advantaged at top UCs like UCSD/UCLA/Berkeley? Or are AP scores irrelevant for admissions and all our hard work was for nothing?",

The UCs consider APs the most rigorous of courses\u2026 above honors and dual enrollment. Even though they\u2019ll claim the scores are only used for placement, I find that difficult to believe.",
