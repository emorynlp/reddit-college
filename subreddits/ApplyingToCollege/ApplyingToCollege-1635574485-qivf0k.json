      "text": "With a few rare exceptions, UCs are a poor value out of state. If you cannot afford full pay out of state at UCs, don't waste the app fee. Out of state students *are not* commonly borrowing large sums to attend UCs because that would be financially foolish.\n\n(The important thing is that you have figured this out now. In spring, there will be a few out of state students, overjoyed about their acceptance, who post here asking where their financial aid package is. Then they get the crushing news that there won't be one.)",
