  "text": "I am a super worried senior. I took 5 APs last year and self studied for the AP Macro exam. I also took two AP exams before that. I got all fives except for one 4 on Physics 1. Last year, my GPA took a nose dive since I got a B+ second semester of Lang, despite having all As in other classes. The reason was many students in my class were cheating their way through the Pandemic. Our school crawls with those type of kids. Flunked the AP exams too, but they r like \u201cAP exams don\u2019t matter, SAT don\u2019t matter. I got a great GPA by cheating so like every college would love me now. Don\u2019t forget the Essays too! I am getting my outside college counselor to write it for me! SAT is messed up. It defines kids by numbers. I am more than a number! Get rid of the SAT. All schools should be test blind! Your SAT and AP don\u2019t mean sh*** now\u201d Just sucks for kids like me who actually were stupid and moral and did not cheat. Lol. I was too stupid/moral to cheat and now my GPA is far from a 4.0 . I honestly thought that one way to mitigate for this would be to do well on the AP exams, for which I studied for and did well on. However, I am now hearing more and more students saying that the AP exams don\u2019t matter, and the SAT (which I got a 1570 on) does not matter. They claim only the GPA (which they are so proud to point out) that they cheated to get us all that matters, and that their high GPA would make them much more competitive for college admissions than me. Now, I am very depressed. Every thing I worked my ass for us now down the drain. My GPA will hold me back and I just can\u2019t get over the fact that kids who cheated their way through the entirety of their Junior year will now have an advantage over me in this test optional college admissions environment. Sorry for this being so long. I am basically ranting. Lol \ud83d\ude02",

Beyond a certain range, all your GPA will signify is that you're an excellent, competitive student (same applies to test scores).\n\nWhat's way more important is whether you are an interesting addition to campus, which is where your essays and the rest of your app applies. Don't sweat it, you're fine.",

      "text": "Test optional does not mean test not valuable. Except for the very few colleges that are test-blind, a 1570 will enhance your application.\n\nAP courses show rigor. The exams themselves were never important for admissions, but can be useful for credit or placement.\n\nAnd a B+ in one class is hardly the end of the world. It certainly won't be the reason a college rejects you \n\nGood luck.",

Anyways, unfortunately GPA is highly important at a lot of schools and I\u2019ve heard from t he collegeresults sub that a low GPA is hard to overcome. But bro you got one fucking B. Mostly 5s, 1570, 1 B wtf are you ranting about. And stop with the \u201ceveryone was cheating.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true. And also something you can\u2019t control. Sorry for sounding passive aggressive but just take a chill pill and relax you\u2019ll do fine.",

But there is no denying the fact that a considerable, considerable, number of people cheated their way through online school last year.

Naive me, I hadn't know before my kid told me that story, that grades from the year prior could be changed.  Maybe you could try that.",
