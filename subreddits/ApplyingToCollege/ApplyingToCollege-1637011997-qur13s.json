  "text": "So I know this might be asking a lot but if anyone here has gotten into Brown (my dream school) or would be able to help me, can you please let me know so I can PM you in the comments. I am a current junior and although this is a generally busy time with college, it would be helpful if I knew how to go about strengthening my general application for when ED comes around next year. TIA!",

      "text": "The best advice I can give you for applying to a highly highly rejective school like Brown is to dig in deep and figure out why it\u2019s one of the best schools for you. \n\nDig into yourself and figure out why it appeals to you. And dig into the college and come up with all the reasons why y\u2019all are a good match. \n\nThen make sure you find other colleges to balance your list with where you can go find your dream you.  Forget about the concept of a dream school. It only leads to heartbreak. That doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t learn about and apply to brown. It just means approach college admissions with a healthy mindset \u2014 and that means acknowledging that there are multiple colleges where you can find dream you. So do your research \u2014 both internal and about Brown. \n\nBy having done all this hard work, you\u2019ll be making yourself a stronger applicant for any school you\u2019re applying to \u2014 including brown. \n\nSome things to keep in mind for most highly rejective colleges \n\nGrades and course rigor matter the most. So take the most challenging course\nLoad your can manage while preserving your mental, emotional, and physical health. \n\nMake good grades. \n\nBe involved:\n\nWith yourself\nYour family\nYour school\nAnd your community \n\nStart reading a lot of books \u2014 Fiction and self help books will help you find your voice and become a stronger writer\n\nKeep your life beyond college admissions in focus.",
