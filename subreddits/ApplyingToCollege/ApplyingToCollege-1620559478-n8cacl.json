  "text": "If you got into a top school like the ivies/SM - please, please, please DONT preach about how \u201cwhere you go to college doesn\u2019t define you\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of kids do this on insta where they post their commitment post (as they should) and then in the caption talk about how random and arbitrary the process is like just don\u2019t do that please. We all understand how chaotic this process is, but it doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. \n\nAnd I realize that most kids do this out of a place of goodwill and to be thoughtful but it just ends up looking really pretentious and almost hurtful. I\u2019m happy for all you have achieved and you deserve to be able to post that commitment post, but just leave it there. We will all congratulate you on this huge commitment and then that\u2019ll be that.",

The only thing it did was get me to live in another part of the country. It\u2019s pretty awkward for me to try to use it as cred - it\u2019s a women\u2019s college, I am a trans man, and it\u2019s a whole thing. \n\nYou are only going to be using that college if a) your college has an extensive networking alumni group in your field (knowing your field will likely change at some point) or b) your school is well known enough to have name recognition - this could be because you went to a big sports college and that\u2019s important in your region or it could be because everyone has heard of Harvard. I wanted to go to a small liberal arts school and, as it is tiny and doesn\u2019t have any major sports teams, it isn\u2019t a useful tool in my networking belt.",

I'm a community college transfer, I'm deciding to choose a T40 over two T20s. Maybe that isn't too far of a stretch when it comes to rankings, but I made my decision based on what I know as a college student who has friends at prestigious universities.\n\nMany of my community college peers are more successful than people I know who go to ivies or top private schools. There's a state school in my area that gets clowned because \"everyone gets in\", yet the people I know there get high-paying jobs fresh out of college. Obviously, this is not ALWAYS going to be the case. There are groups of people at every school who are lazy and who work hard.\n\nI think it's hard to find those \"where you go to college doesn't define you\" posts encouraging, since most people writing and reading them aren't even in college yet. Regardless, they really are true even if it's coming from someone who doesn't seem genuine.",

I think assuming that people who get into top schools are a specific way just hurts the person who got rejected even more. I'm not trying to say that people shouldn't be sad if they get rejected from their dream schools. I just think there are just so many better ways to handle these types of things, even though it's harder said than done.",

In addition, I don\u2019t think that right after college decisions is the best time to have that conversation, maybe a little bit later once the wounds aren\u2019t as fresh. \n\nAs a whole, I think that people need to acknowledge that where you go to school does matter - but not on just the sense of prestige. Where you go to school impacts your future life in terms of friends, spouses, future godparents to your kids and more. College is where you will first grow into a true adult with responsibilities so it does matter, but it also won\u2019t make or break you. It\u2019s not as black and white as people may want it to seem.",

      "text": "Well being a student of the 7th best college of my country, I think it's my responsibility to say my POV. Sorry but I do preach that where you go to college doesn't matter. I literally say there is no fucking difference between you and me (my friends who couldn't do well in entrance test) rn. And I still say it. I'll explain why.\n\nEven though I am in one of the best college I can be, it's not the college that's helping me or making me better. It was always me. Sounds like a guru when I put it that way. What I mean is... I expect my professors to motivate us or atleast support our crazy ideas and prove that we are innovative. But that's not the case, they do expect us to understand the concepts rather than scoring marks but that's just half done. Classmates! I couldn't generalise this but I'll say I came to college to get better as a student as learn some shit to make my society better as a engineer. But probably I was 1 in 500 to think like that in our college. So whatever I do is all my doing. I believe now this makes sense. I honestly am afraid that there might be no difference between me and my frnds at other colleges.\n\nBut after being in the shoes of my friends, I realised even though we lack the push we need, we turn to become good Mentors. Our seniors are so good that they laid the foundations for success. They created a curriculum that we don't realise we follow but we do. As a freshman we are expected to explore the student clubs and get active in them. We are expected to take projects and learn something. This actually felt like nothing when I was freshman and sophomore. But now that I'm entering my final year, I'd say that moments have helped me alot in being able to understand friendships and management. What other colleges lack is this invisible curriculum. \n\nAfter saying all this I'd still say college doesn't matter Becoz after all it's us who did. What you need is a good batch. A group of friends trying to do something good with life. If you are surrounded by a guy who says fuck man I might not score A this test, you would be forced to think to get A and work on that. If you have a frnd who says fuck this classes I'm done let's play something, it's no wonder your life is vulnerable.\n\nMy advice for youngsters is to explore as much as you can and create Passion towards things. If you don't people will start creating for you and trust me that's not a good thing. Passion created should not be wasted but has to be pursued no matter what. If you can follow the above 3 lines you need not join college and Elon Musk might hire you. Easily. All the best and cheers to all \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

Then I went on to grad school at one of those super elites y\u2019all are obsessed with, where I was TA to students just a few years younger than me. \n\nMy fellow grad students came from every type of college - Ivy, LAC, Jesuit, women\u2019s, and state, including 2 from really obscure state schools. The elite students we TA\u2019d ranged from incredibly smart to incredibly privileged, but probably more on the privileged end than the smart end. They were still mostly pretty smart, but definitely not smarter than we were. A couple were as dumb as the proverbial box of rocks. (One quite shockingly so.)\n\nThe students who graduated from this elite school did go on to do pretty well, at least as far as I know. Not because the school was so amazing, but because incredibly smart and/or incredibly privileged are predictors of success. I doubt the school made them who they were. It may have contributed, but quite likely these students would have done just as well coming from the obscure state schools my classmates attended. Except for the few who were dumb as a box of rocks - with no brains to recommend them those idiots probably depended upon the elite stamp of approval.",

It hurts it demotivates it makes you feel like the whole world is pinned against you. Such moments reminds us that we do need break and we are not some gods. But do not confine yourself that it's your demise. I really mean it. \n\nTo elaborate, I will consider 3 of my friends. One got into the best college, two couldn't. I am actually very strange compared to what I see in my college, I value the learning curve rather than the certificate and probably the rest of the world is not the same. So this made me feel nothing more or less with my topper friend. Out of the remaining two, one had the same feeling I had and we are a trio. Last one, she couldn't accept that she has failed to perform the best she can. It's absolutely fine and normal with failing we all learn that as a baby while walking. Yet it's hard for us to believe that. Anyway, now whenever I say things that used to bring a spark in her eyes a few years back or something related to personal development she is like.. duh u r from T7 it's so easy for you. I thought she was joking but she is not. She meant that. Now I'm afraid what happens to her.\n\nSo to conclude, yes it hurts. It's ok. Take a break. Throw a few cuss words. Go play ball. And forget that. Don't cling to it. It's the devil that's ready to take control over you and you don't want that.",
