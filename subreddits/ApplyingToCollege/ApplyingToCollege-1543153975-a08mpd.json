  "text": "This sub and r/chanceme are really starting to piss me off. Everything is so ridiculous and people are literally obsessed with getting into a school to the point where it\u2019s unhealthy, and it seems like half of the people on here are only here to flex. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, these subs are great for information and advice. I\u2019ve asked quite a few questions on here and usually gotten helpful responses.\n\nBut ever since I\u2019ve started browsing r/chanceme and this sub, I\u2019ve compared myself to people so much more, and even though I\u2019m well above average in academics, I genuinely feel dumb because I get B\u2019s in AP classes and im only applying to state schools and I\u2019m not applying anywhere with a tiny acceptance rate. That could be a mental health issue with myself, but I\u2019m sure that other people feel the same. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just jealous or in a bad mood. I don\u2019t know. All I know is I spend way too much time on this sub and I need a break so I can actually get my homework and scholarship essays done. \n\nThat being said, I sincerely hope you guys get in where you want to go. If you\u2019re procrastinating, PLEASE get off of this sub and do your work. ",

My sister has a bachelors, master's, and doctorate from big 10 schools and no one cares about any of it besides the people she owes student loans too. \n\nMy best friend is an MD and he started at community college and went to the cheapest university in the area for a bachelors in science for about a semester and a half. They were more impressed with his application to med school than other candidates because he actually learned a boat load in community college and blew his MCAT out of the water. He worked his butt off and taught himself a lot, but he said community college was pretty much essential to his success because it gave him the time he needed to work and go to school affordably. \n\nTo top it all off, my mother had an associate's degree and was VP of her department at a corporate office for a very large medical system... no one cares where she went to community college because she is pretty much the best at what she does. \n\nYour dream school now is so unimportant to your future I can't adequately describe it. You can have fun and friends at any school you go to, and you can get as good of an education as you want if you are willing to put the work in. \n\nQuit this sub, ignore people bragging about what school they went to.

You'll be closer to the big names in your field.\n\n2) The school's endowment. There's always money for a research grant, an \"educational\" dorm trip, or a student group event.\n\nThese things exist at other schools; the only difference is that it's much lower hanging fruit at the top schools. You'll have to work harder for your opportunities. Other than that, the education is largely the same, and people at other schools still go abroad, do research, etc. If you have the drive and wit to succeed, you can.\nI had internship colleagues and old friends that were just as badass as anybody I met at Stanford because they knew how to work their environment wherever they were. I can't drive this home enough: you can be just as successful from anywhere, you'll just have to be more clever and determined.\n\nIf you don't get into your first choice:\nYou can still reach out to leaders in your field. Professors are generally very helpful people.\nMany of the big schools have summer research programs open to students of other schools.\nA lot of courses are online for free (e.g. Harvard's CS50) \n",

      "text": "Searched here from \"Popular\" on Reddit. Teenagers talking about College always sparks my interest. I went to a non-ranked City University college in New York City. I had a top GPA in the college. I made it into a top 75 law school. I left that law school to pursue something else. I now work as a 2nd to highest government scale grade for the Department of Justice and I am still in my late 20s. My only degree is a Bachelors of Science from a non-ranked school.\n\nI have people working under me with PhDs and Masters degrees. They went to much more prestigious schools. Where they went to school didn't help clearly. Some of it is luck, but most of it is about trying your hardest in the real world. Don't make a big deal of where you go to school. Do the best you can at a good school and learn how to write a strong resume and cover letter combination.Don't get caught up in SAT or ACT scores. Don't let it get to your self-esteem. Learn how to be social and create a network for yourself. That's worth more than any college degree when it comes to getting a job.\n\nIf you are smart outside of just being book smart, then you already have an advantage in the real world. Being textbook smart is really not as important as the college game makes it out to be. Plus you'll enjoy having less student loan debt and watch as your classmates that didn't get a full scholarship pay off their loans well into their 40s.\n\n",

      "text": "This is definitely not just you. I've coined the term \"academic-dysmorphophobia\" to describe it, because having been anorexic in the past, I can confirm the feeling is the same: all that's different is the object. Funnily enough, I just realized this is what I'm feeling a day ago. It is most definitely a mental health issue. Likewise, it is us who have to take responsibility for our feelings of inadequacy, insofar as we are the source of it\u2014so long as no negative stimulus is being forced upon us, I think it's safe to say this is the case. Nonetheless, I'm very new to this sub so I can't attest to any \"flexing\" going on. That may or may not be a serious issue.  \n\n\nIt is important to focus on what you *can* control, as you seem to be doing in leaving this sub. A vacation from stressors helps a lot in the short term, but the underlying problem remains. You have admitted to comparing yourself to others and expressed a feeling of low academic worth. I can't say for certain, but this probably indicates that you should step back for a moment and observe from a passive point of view your situation. Easier said than done, I know, yet well worth it. There's even resources in existence that can help you with this, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). If your feelings of inadequacy are significantly difficult to deal with, I highly recommend finding yourself a therapist who is well versed in both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and DBT. I have been doing this for the past couple years and I've experienced an increase in self-esteem and the ability to look at things as they are. Of course it's not a cure all\u2014I am still facing feelings of academic-inadequacy\u2014, but it's there if you need it (I initially attended a season-long group DBT program that charged absolutely nothing; if there are similar programs where you are I recommend taking up the opportunity).  \n\n\nI hope this in some little way proves helpful to you. I know it has me. <3",

I was a hard worker and incredibly self motivated in high school, but the toxicity of this school destroyed so much of that. In the beginning I had a gut feeling that this place wouldn't be good for me, and I had the option to go to a great state school on the West Coast, but \"no one rejects this school\", and I have regretted my decision ever since.\n\nI'm three years in and transferring is not really an option anymore, but if it were, I would take it in a heartbeat. Like many people have pointed out, school isn't everything. Eg. My friend interned at Amazon this summer, but she interned alongside students from all sorts of others schools: state school, small liberal arts schools, elite institutions, etc. Sure, a name may open some doors, but imo the marginal benefits have not been worth the destruction of both my mental and physical health. Look for the school that is actually a good match for you (academically, financially, socially, etc.), and wherever you end up, you will succeed if you're in an environment that's right for you :)",

Its a wise choice to take a break and a mature decision at that, rather than letting it distract you from your goals. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is that the negative comparison usually makes a return later in life, so please listen to my advice as I have been down this road many times before:\n\nAlways do your best, and always remember to be kind to yourself, because you are worth much more than your performance on exam day. Keep your goals in mind and work as hard as you'll allow yourself to, and remember that taking a meassured break can be just as constructive as working hard. ",

      "text": "I'm 24 now, but I remember applying to college and thinking a lot of people were taking the application process way too seriously. I only had enough money to apply to two or three schools, so I did my best to make sure I would reasonably make it as a candidate into a few of the better private schools in the state, and applied. Since they were all good, (in my opinion), I was 'covered' in the instance I only made it into one of those schools. I made it into all three of the colleges, but do you know why it didn't matter? **Because I could only go to one**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of academically bright high school students really need a college level economics course. Sure, it's impressive to make it into every ivy league school plus a dozen others, and if that helps boost your ego, then, more power to you I suppose. But creating an imagine that you exist in an elite club that *belongs* in a wealthy academic community doesn't actually accomplish much. It also masks the fact that your school's status isn't going to determine how successful you are in school, *you are*. People who are competitive over how many brilliant schools they can get into aren't actually making themselves more successful, they're just practicing making themselves *look* more successful. Not to mention, it;s inefficient. As I said, you can only go to one school. On the other hand, if you're obsessed with daydreaming about how going to that one perfect prestigious school is going to make your life that much better, you're going to find out that you've been mistaken very quickly. The second you get into school, you're expected to work. It's up to you to make good friends. It's up to you to navigate your life toward success. The number of clubs you're in right now, and the details of your college interview are not going to matter when you have to face the job market. Having nice stats for college admissions is a nice thing to have, but you should be thinking about how you're preparing yourself for college, in general, regardless of which college you go to.",

They all work the same menial job for the same low pay that I do. After years of beating myself up I finally realized that it didn't matter at all. We're all in the same boat. I'm happily married, have great friends and a job. Plus I get paid to write more than I ever would have thought possible without a degree (not a ton but it helps pay bills.)

That ego down one may feel by comparing themselves becomes meaningless when you are faced with your coursework in college. \n\nCollege gives you the chance to shed all of this unhealthy, comparative nonsense. In college, your SAT score means nothing. Your national merit bs means nothing. Your high school GPA means nothing. Your hs extracirrics mean nothing. Everyone starts off fresh. It's your chance to define yourself in your own way. Even then, comparisons don't mean much as everyone has their own major and professors vary.\n\nSo remember that the struggle will be over soon.
