It\u2019s over competitive, classes are overly difficult, and Berkeley kids say being over stressed and having bad mental health/lack of sleep is romanticized there. Like the more stressed you are, the cooler it is. And politics too, politically things are pretty crazy. I\u2019m a fairly liberal person, but it\u2019s a whole other level there.",

Also wildfire season sucks ass.\n\nPut your time and effort in to Van., dont expect much from the UCs",
