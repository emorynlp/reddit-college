  "text": "Would it be a wise move to submit my junior research paper under \"optional supplemental material\" or does that not at all fit here? I'm really proud of this paper although it is rather lengthy (\\~15 pages)  if that matters.\n\nEdit: I'll go ahead and provide some context for the rest of my application since I'd imagine that'd be pretty helpful:\n\nAcademics: 10/10, expected valedictorian, not submitting SAT so that won't be a factor.\n\nEssays: Anywhere between 7-9/10, mine was very unique and well written and demonstrated my character but it was pretty out there so there are some risks involved with that I'd imagine.\n\nExtracurricular's: I'd say relative to my area (very rural Indiana where practically everyone goes to IU) a solid 8-10/10, several leadership positions, founded a club, MVP / captain of two varsity sports, I basically have two 20+ hr/wk jobs between my actual job and family responsibilities so hopefully I get some leeway for lack of anything truly special here but objectively relative to the average competitive applicant I'm probably at like 2-4/10(for Cornell specifically). My honors were also probably like a solid 2 simply because that isn't something all that prevalent here so I just had all the basic ones like AP scholar, NHS, etc. \n\nRecommendations: 10/10 for one, about 8/10 from the other, not much to add here.\n\nI think that's about it.
