  "text": "When I was going through high school, I thought I was doing all the right things: getting good grades, taking lots of APs, making my way up the newspaper staff chain, competing regularly in debate competitions, and a few other extracurriculars and volunteering here and there. But now that I\u2019m putting everything into the Common App and I\u2019m quantifying all my work, I feel like I\u2019ve done nothing. Where are the extensive summer internships and the national awards and the impressive research and writing accolades? I see so many people with stats and ECs light years ahead of mine still not getting into some of their top choices and it makes me question whether I even worked that hard and if I even have a real shot at a college I would want to go to. Literally the first football game I went to was this year\u2019s HOCO game, I feel like I wasted my high school experience by both not having enough fun but also not working hard enough to get the stats I would need for my top schools. Whatever I\u2019m probably just hormonal. At least I\u2019m an auto admit to my state school ig",
