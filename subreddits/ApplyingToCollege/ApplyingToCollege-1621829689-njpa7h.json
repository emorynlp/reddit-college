  "text": "* We're the last class to have finished kindergarten in the 2000s\n* The last class to start elementary school under President George W. Bush\n* The first class to finish middle school and start high school under President Donald Trump\n* The first class to finish high school under President Joe Biden\n* The first class to exclusively be born after 9/11\n* The last class to be born before Facebook existed\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I find it crazy to think about how different things were back in the early 2000s, when we were born, compared to now. iPhones didn't exist yet, most people still used dial-up to access the Internet, the Gamecube and PS2 were the most popular consoles, and none of the popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Reddit existed yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for 1.5k upvotes! Ngl I was expecting this post to level out at around 200 upvotes.",

Looking back, I don't know why my teacher decided to organize this event to a bunch of Kindergarteners who were clueless about the electoral process. However, 12 years later I still clearly remember putting my vote in the ballot box, so it certainly was a memorable event.",

I remember in 3rd grade the prevailing guidance, which my teacher told us and our parents. was no more than 2 hours of screen time a day which was feasible then but no way in hell would that be possible now. We had a computer lab in elementary school, then in middle school we had a computer lab but also carts of iPads that classrooms would occasionally have, then in high school the district issued devices to everyone (9th thru 11th was iPads; 12th grade was Chromebooks). Interesting to see how pervasive technology has become so quickly yet also so gradually.",

My little brother on the other hand (co2027) doesn't have any memory of the pre-smart-everything age--to him our parents' phones have always been up for grabs, never used a cd player, has always had immediate access to a computer or other device. The first time I had immediate access to any device was when I was only a year younger than he is now, and that was when I got my first flip phone and my dad bought a family computer for the living room.\n\nNow I gawk at the entitlement my brother sometimes shows towards electronic devices, but then again he doesn't have any recollection of the pre-smart-everything age, and thus doesn't share the same appreciation for smart devices that I do.
