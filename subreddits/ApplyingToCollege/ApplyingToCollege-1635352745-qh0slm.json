  "text": "BTW my major is history or International Relations\n\nso some of my schools only allow two letters to be sent but I have three recommenders and I'm having a hard time choosing 2. My first is from my  AP Spanish teacher who has taught me for 3 years (she is probably the least close to me out of all of them) but I'm one of the couple of seniors who made it to AP. My second teacher has taught me global issues, world religions, and APUSH since sophomore year and we have a really strong relationship.  My third is from outside of school, a dance teacher, who I've built a really strong relationship with for the past couple of years.  I wrote my essay about dance and most of my ECs have to do with dance.   any advice is appreciated",
