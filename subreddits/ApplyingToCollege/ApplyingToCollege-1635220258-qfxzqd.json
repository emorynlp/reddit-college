  "text": "I am currently working on my college applications on the Common App website; the site says to select the \"Number of AP Tests you wish to report, including tests you expect to take.\" I took 3 AP classes last year, and only passed one (4 on Lang, 2 on APUSH & AP Phys 1), so I was originally thinking about only submitting 1. This year I am taking 5 AP classes: AP Lit, AP Bio, AP Psych, AP Gov, and AP Calc AB, and have an A in every class except for a B+ in Calc. I was wondering if I should select that I plan to submit 6 AP Tests, or what should be my course of action here...?   \nThank you.",
