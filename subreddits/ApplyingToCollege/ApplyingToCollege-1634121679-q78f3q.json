  "text": "I finished both my SAT and AP exams, and I haven't sent any of them. I heard that by self-reporting through Common App, students don't have to send official test scores unless admitted to the university. That is, I don't have to deal with the score-sending until I decide to attend. Is my understanding correct? Thanks in advance.",
