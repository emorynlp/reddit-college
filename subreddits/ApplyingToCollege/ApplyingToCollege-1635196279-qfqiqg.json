  "text": "Hi guys, I  need some advice for the activities section on the common app:\n\nI currently have one spot left on the activities section, but I have to choose one activity from three that I want to use and I am not sure which one would be the best choice. The three activities are:\n\nKey Club: I have been in this club since freshman year, and have completed 50 hours of service each year, but I hold no leadership position in it.\n\nNational English Honor Society: This honor society was just introduced at our school this year, so this is the first year I will be doing it. However, in order to be a member of it, you had to be accepted through an application, whereas in key club, anyone can join.\n\nTennis: I played tennis my freshman and sophomore year but held no leadership positions.\n\nWhich activity should I use to fill this last spot? Would one look better than the other due to how long I\u2019ve been in it?",
