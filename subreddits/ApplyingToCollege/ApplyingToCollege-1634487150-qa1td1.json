  "title:": "Will I qualify for In-State tuition?",
  "text": "If I rent and work in Georgia while I pay OOS tuition for a community college in Georgia, would I qualify for In-State tuition when it comes down to transfer to a different school?\n\nI want to major in CS, I live in SC, but the schools for my major are way better in Georgia. I'm hoping I can transfer into Georgia Tech as they have amazing co-op and internship programs, which are very important in my field.\n\nI have 35k saved up and I plan to work while I attend college. I'm paying for my education by myself so I want to spend as little as possible.\n\nEdit: I'm 20 and Independent",

      "text": "How old are you, i.e. are you independent of parent support? That may make a difference. Sometimes states make it difficult to get in-state tuition if you relocated to the state for the purpose of education. Please google the in-state tuition residency requirements.\n\nExample, UGA:\n\n>Independent students who wish to establish in-state tuition residency must document that their parent(s) have not claimed them as a tax dependent for the 12 months prior to the start of the term, and that the student provided 100% of their financial support as shown in federal and state tax returns.  \n>  \n>No student shall gain or acquire in-state classification while attending any post-secondary educational institution in this state without clear evidence of having established domicile in Georgia for purposes other than attending a post-secondary educational institution in this state.\n\n[https://www.admissions.uga.edu/afford/ga-residency/](https://www.admissions.uga.edu/afford/ga-residency/)\n\n(As an aside, you would be a transfer applicant.)",
