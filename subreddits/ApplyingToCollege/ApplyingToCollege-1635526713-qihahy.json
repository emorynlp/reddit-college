  "text": "I know students are likely pretty stressed leading up to Monday. Just a few reminders from the admissions side:\n\n1. It has been said time and time again; this is not the end-all, be-all of your life. I know ED/EA applications might feel like the weight of the world, but you\u2019ll end up at the right place regardless of what happens. \n\n2. I often see panicked emails right around midnight of the deadline. IN NEARLY ALL CASES, colleges will give you grace and leniency in submitting your application after the deadline, and you don\u2019t need to email us and tell us you were five minutes late. Yes, the deadline is usually in your local time before midnight, but I know very few admissions directors that literally turn off their application on the dot. Why do that with so many time zones? There\u2019s actually a grace period feature built into the Common App for administrators, and most of use it. Of course, I hope you don\u2019t wait until the deadline and stress yourself out, but it happens. \n\n3. Colleges - in nearly all circumstances - will also accept materials from your school after the deadline. We are people. We understand your counselors are people. They have a HUGE job leading up to Nov 1, and we will not penalize you. Just make sure things get in as soon as you can. \n\n4. Check your applicant portal and PLEASE don\u2019t email us the next day asking about a missing material. You and your thousand other friends are doing the same thing, and it takes a tremendous amount of time to answer these emails. The time we would otherwise be spending on getting materials into your portal. So please just wait a few days, at least. Again, you\u2019ll be fine. \n\n5. If you need an application fee waiver, ask today (or better yet, Google the college\u2019s name and \u201capplication fee waiver\u201d. You can usually find what you need.)\n\n6. Once you submit, take a break for yourself. You crossed a milestone and submitted your first apps. Once you\u2019ve celebrated yourself, I highly suggest you work on your RD apps and supplements. Nothing is guaranteed in ED/EA, and we see it every year of impossibly working on supplements during your winter break. Try to get them out of the way now. You can always withdraw your RD app later on.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. You have worked hard, should be proud of yourself, and good luck with the college search process.",
