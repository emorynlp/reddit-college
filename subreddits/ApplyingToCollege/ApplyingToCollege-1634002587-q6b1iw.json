      "text": "Didn\u2019t use one personally, but went to an international school where 90%+ of kids did. It\u2019s really hit or miss. There are ridiculously expensive ones that pull off crazy results, and there are ridiculously expensive ones that\u2019ll offer worse advice than what A2C can give. And consultants are most useful imo if you start working with them by or before sophomore year, because they can help you add to your ECs/awards significantly. For the price that most charge, I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth hiring a consultant in senior year.",
