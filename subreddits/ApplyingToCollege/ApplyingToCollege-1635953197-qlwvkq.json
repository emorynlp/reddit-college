  "title:": "Homeschooled Applicant: Parent Made 2x Small Typos on Transcript. Does this matter?",
  "text": "Hi all, \n\nI'm a homeschooled student who recently applied to a couple competitive colleges on November 1. My mother put together my transcript and other counselor-related materials and submitted them on time. She was showing me my official transcript again today and I noticed that there were two small typos - in the table outlining our grading scale, a B+ is listed where a B should be, and a C+ is listed where a C should be (I think she used an excel spreadsheet, so the cells must have copied- there are 2 B+s in the table and 2 C+s). A correct grading scale is included on the school profile document and in an additional homeschool information section, but I'm wondering whether she should email the colleges about this issue on the transcript. None of the actual grades are affected by the typo. \n\nThanks!",
