          "text": "You make some good points, but some of it also depends on the age of your interviewer.  If it's an older person, who has been through job interviews or even conducts job interviews, they will like a thank-you email, and definitely won't see it as kissing up.  It's more of a common courtesy.  Sure, if you send a handwritten thank you card (and I've received some of those), some might see it as over the top, but honestly, as a 50++ yr old person, I found it to be a little impressive, since so few kids did that.  You have to keep in mind that before the internet and email, in the late 1980's, everyone did this by USPS, with physical thank-you cards.",
