  "text": "I originally wanted to apply ED to WashU but I saw in a Reddit post that they\u2019ll defer me 100%. My application is not bad and I won't be submitting my sat (1420: 630R&W; 790M). Should I try ED Washu or just focus on my application and next Sat?                     \n                                                                                                \nEdit: major CS and can't pay more than 15k",
