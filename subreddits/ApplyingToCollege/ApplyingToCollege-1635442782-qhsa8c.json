  "text": "I NEED HELP. While i was taking the test i got a thing on my screen saying that my exam was paused because my pointer was out of my screen, which was obviously a mistake?? And i don\u2019t even think it was out of the screen. I didn\u2019t get any message saying that my test was invalidated, in fact, i got an email after the test saying that the moderators were reviewing it (not in a bad way lmao).\n\nIs there any possibility they invalidated my test without telling me? Should I\u2019ve just assumed they invalidated it when i got the thing on my screen? I have still a couple of hours left until the 48 HRS are due, but still I\u2019m nervous.",
