                          "text": "PLTW at my school is a shit ton of work. But still worth it imo. These classes are the entire reason I realized I actually love STEM. \n\nMy group is tackling the problem of safety measures during school shootings. After doing some research we figured the best area to focus on would be be the windows on classroom doors. It's harder to shoot inside the room if you can't see where students are. Locks on doors were an issue too but then you run into a bunch of fire codes if you mess with those.  So we ended up getting some PDLC film which is opaque normally but turns completely transparent when powered. Which means the window gets to be clear 99.9% of the time but in an emergency you can press a panic button and quickly switch it off. The circuit we designed also has bluetooth (in the future we'd probably switch to wifi, for better range) and the idea is that if we had more time we would also create a program on the computer so that the main office could remotely switch them on/off as well. In an emergency they could essentially press one button to quickly block the sight into every room in the school. But right now it's just controlled using an app on iphone that isn't very intuitive. And we don't have the film anymore because we accidentally fried it last week (though we're not sure why it worked fine for a few months before deciding to catch on fire). Now we're waiting on a new one that we can wire to a fuse and plug back into the circuit, but since we ordered it through the school we may not be able to get it anymore. Which is another frustrating aspect. Luckily, we know the circuit still works with everything else.",

I was going to compete at the annual Shakespeare theater festival and a competitive improv match, both of which are now gone. SDSU and other colleges have gotten rid of their prospective student tours, which greatly impact my ability to make a decision about them. \n\nMy robotics meetings are up in the air, and either way we can't have them at school. Our spring play, which I was vying for a top role in, might be canceled as well. And now if I don't get an actual role, I'm literally doing nothing for theater for the rest of high school because our festival's been canceled.\n\nThere's been talks of classes moving online. Our school is on a trimester system, and the third trimester just started. All my hard classes are finally over, and I was finally going to relax and enjoy senior year and just enjoy seeing all my friends while I could. But now school might be shut down. \n\nAnd that's not to mention the fact that I finally have a friend group this year, and I'm finally hanging out with them outside of school. It makes my heart hurt to think of all the fun social events (we have a book club, a weekly tradition of going out to get pzookies, going to movies...) All of these fun things that I finally get to do and will now be missing out on, events that are never going to planned because of the virus. And to top it all off, the school could still shut down prom, graduation, and grad nite.\n\nNeedless to say, I know it's for the best, but I'm extremely sad and even angry right now.\n\nEdit: Our schools been shut down until at least April 6th. This freaking sucks. I was supposed to just enjoy a relaxed school, enjoy seeing people before we all parted. And now I'm missing all that.",

On top of that I am a Chinese kid who didn't make usamo, get a 1600, or 800, doesn't have a 4.0 gpa and isn't valedictorian or Intel finalist. I should have been aborted or shot by sadam Hussein or flogged by all the Asians who are successful which is all of them. I hope you go to an ivy because you will and I'll burn in hell because I'm a blood traitor for not being a true Asian. This is legit-dont let anybody ever call this a shit post. I've written about this before and I don't need any other Terrence Taos trying to convince me that I should not have this \"stereotype.\" Whenever I talk to another Asian which is sadly inevitable, this is all they want to talk about. Good race of people. Glad to be a chink-thats directed towards me, and solely me. Nothing would be better than getting a job instead of failing everything in high school.",

I know it seems like your helping and I'm grateful for your kind words, but use your energy and brain cells to enjoy middle school and eventually high school. It's conterintuitive to help out on the internet because there is no point, just like theres no point of being an unsuccessful asian. You might as well just go get a job or in my case, try and commit hara-kiri, High school has given me a lobotomy and decapitated me.  This virus has pulvertized anything I tried to do. I'm not a usamo or aime 15 or a mopper or whatever, nor am I an all national violinist, nor am I an intel or usaco gold medalist, but I did try to do some community service. The one thing I tried to do to embrace the community not just so I can get rejected from community college, was canceled. I guess I shouldn't have tried in the first place. Guess my \"resume\" will be blank as it was destined to be after my phd parents sadly put their faith in the next generation. The day of atonement or judgement will be this Saturday when I take the SAT. If I have one shred of honor or one brain cell that hasn't denatured, then I'll be happy if I get a 1550+. Asians that think like I do are almost nonexistent because all of them are valedictorians or salutatorians, or at least these are the only people I'm forced to talk to. People like me are a cursed part-we are like opium smokers or prostitutes in China-nobody wants to deal with us because we are parasites to society. Society does its best to pretend we don't exist, and for good reason. Science will never cure this. STEM laughs at me and hurls me down the temple like I am an Aztec sacrifice-the last person to get picked every time, while all my imo friends rejoice at the top. Good luck and I'm only alive to help support my parents and my sister in the future. That's the only point of living-to give my affection and my thanks a million to my family. I'm just a pawn that should have died but now that I exist, I might as well do what I'm obligated to do.",

The thing is, these won\u2019t work. My metals, orchestra, and calc class do not have assignments daily, with maybe 4 homework assignments a semester. My teachers also don\u2019t teach except for calc, so the video conference would be us sitting there working. My teachers are also 80 and don\u2019t even know how to post assignments properly. \n\nIm honestly just so annoyed. What a shitty way to end a shitty high-school experience.",
