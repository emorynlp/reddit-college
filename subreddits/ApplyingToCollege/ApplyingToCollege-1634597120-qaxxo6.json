      "text": "Probably EA. Demonstrated interest, while considered at Northeastern, is still not a major factor, and would most likely not change your decision amyway. Plus, applying EA in and of itself demonstrates some interest\u2014at least, more than applying RD would.\n\nBasically, EA unless you think your personal statement or the rest of your application would be significantly stronger if you applied RD. Personally, I think mine is about as strong as it's going to get, so there's no real use in delaying my application and eventual decision.",
