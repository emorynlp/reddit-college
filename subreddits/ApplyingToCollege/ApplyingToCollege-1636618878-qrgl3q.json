  "text": "I feel like it\u2019s kind of weird and generic but I would go on loke 3-4 hour hikes eveyother day during the pandemic. I also did half dome with just my 2 best friends (16 at the time, they were 17), knocked out a 23 mile hike at 7k elevation while sick also with just my best friend, and generally hiked around a lot.",
