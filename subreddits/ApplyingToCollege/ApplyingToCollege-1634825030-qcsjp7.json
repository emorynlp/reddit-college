  "text": "Hello, \n\nFrom what I understand, University of California system calculates GPA differently from other schools in 2 ways\n\n1) UC doesn\u2019t include freshman\u2019s grade while others school include them \n\n2) UC gives both honor and AP classes 5.0 weight while others give 4.5 to honor and 5.0 to AP.\n\nAm I correct? \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Adding another difference\n\n3) UC doesn\u2019t factor in + or - in the grades (A- and A are the same), while others do (A- is 3.7 if not Honor or AP).",

      "text": "PSA, for out of state students who need financial aid:  public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. \n\n(Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.)",
