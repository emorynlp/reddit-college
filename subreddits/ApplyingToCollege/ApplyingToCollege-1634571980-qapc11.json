  "text": "Hey guys,   \nI am applying to these universities **early** with **1420 sat** as an **international student**. I am very disappointed with my score because I got only a 730 math score. I am sure that with another attempt in December I can touch **1500,** but **is there even a point** in giving another attempt and spending another 100 dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMajor: CS\n\nUnis:\n\n* UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS-- AMHERST\n* PURDUE UNIVERSITY -- WEST LAFAYETTE\n* GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n* UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS--URBANA -- CHAMPAIGN\n* UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN\n* UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- SAN DIEGO\n* UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND-- COLLEGE PARK\n* Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\n* Arizona State University\n* The University of Arizona\n* Michigan State University\n* University of Minnesota\n* The University of Texas at Dallas",
