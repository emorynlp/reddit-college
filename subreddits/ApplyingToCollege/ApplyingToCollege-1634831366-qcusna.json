  "text": "Hey all, I have two basic ideas for my personal statement. \n\n1.) I start off with a weird habit of mine, then tie it into my curiosity and my love of appreciating the parts of a whole. Basically kinda like a \u201cnormal\u201d personal statement. I feel like I could incorporate a lot of stuff into it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll stand out..\n\n2.) I tie a well known \u201cfairytale classic?\u201d into my own narrative (I make myself an extra character in the story). I\u2019ll talk about a challenge that I had and how I overcame it, but it\u2019s more of an internal challenge than external. It\u2019ll read more like a story than the 1st, and I do think it\u2019s more of a risk. I can\u2019t make it sound like a sob story (I am a pretty positive writer so I\u2019m not too worried about that), and can\u2019t be too focused on the og fairytale. I do think that this would have a greater potential to show \u201cwho I am\u201d and the general vibe I give off. \n\n\nOf course, I\u2019m have all of the qualities that are listed above, but I\u2019m not entirely sure which side of me to show as the BIG PERSONAL STATEMENT \ud83d\ude2d any suggestions/advice will be appreciated!! \n\nAlso excuse me for any grammar issues; I\u2019m writing this on my phone in one sitting lol",

      "text": "2 is memorable, but it's a tad risky. You have to make sure *it's about you.* It can show off your narrative skills a lot more, so that's pretty cool.\n\n1 is a solid choice.\n\nI suggest you try writing both. If one doesn't make much sense or if it ain't coming out easily, drop it. I had to choose between five essay topics, so you can drop one after a few revisions. You still have some time.",
