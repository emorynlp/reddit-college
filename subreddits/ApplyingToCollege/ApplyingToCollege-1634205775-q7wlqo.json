      "text": "Both are good at engineering, both have solid coop programs, and the vibe at both schools is similar. Cornell gets a slight bit more tech internships because of proximity to Boston/Route 128 and the higher-ranking CS program. Northwestern will have more internships related to non-tech companies. Both [also field](https://cornellracing.org/) [SAE racing car](https://northwestern.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/northwesternformularacing) teams (though [Cornell has won nine world championships](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/05/cornell-fsae-unveils-latest-car-arg11)).\n\nAs for ranking, I would not look at one year's ranking; however, Cornell has consistently (for decades) been ranked higher for engineering than Northwestern -- so it's not just a one-year difference in ranking.\n\nOther factors? Well, here we go down the rabbit hole....\n\nYou say the architecture does not matter, but it will matter because it's part of the scenery. Cornell has better architecture with the student unions and dorms, in particular, being better. At Northwestern, Norris is just ugly and dark and it's nicest where you can just look out at the Lake and pretend... that you aren't in Norris. While Northwestern's [Deering Library is nice](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/images/libraries-collections/art/DeeringReadingRoom11.jpg), Cornell's [A.D. White Library just slays it](https://www.cornell.edu/assets/images/academics/ad-white-library-1280x720.jpg).\n\nFood? Cornell crushes that one and has for years. I suspect the presence of the hotel school gives them lots of connections to bring in celebrity chefs and do other events. Northwestern's food isn't bad (shout out to D&D Dogs and Coffee Lab on Noyes); but it isn't often amazing.\n\nOn the other hand... Northwestern has Chicago right next door -- and it's easier to get downtown than it is from the University of Chicago: Chicago's [Purple Line L](https://www.transitchicago.com/purpleline/) (rapid transit rail) has [multiple stops a few blocks from campus](https://maps.northwestern.edu/evanston) and service is frequent. You could go to the symphony, opera, see sports teams for almost any pro sport, go to some of the world's best restaurants, or find internships that don't require relocating cities. (Maybe even something you can keep doing at reduced hours during the school year.)\n\nAs for college sports: that's a wash. Football is more of a spectacle, but Northwestern is not great in football while Cornell is ok to good in hockey. (Plus beating Dartmouth is probably more satisfying than beating Michigan State.)\n\nOther than that, each school has fun peculiarities. Both have good courses on relationships (NU: [Marriage 101](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4740/SESP/HDPS/36278), CU: [Human Bonding](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806534&print)).\n\nNorthwestern has the Communication school with alumni like Steven Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David Schwimmer, Seth Myers, and Zach Braff (for more recently-popular alums). So you might get to see a [rising star perform at Waa-Mu](https://wirtz.northwestern.edu/waa-mu-show/); that's pretty cool. Northwestern also has an [intro to sexuality studies course](https://gendersexuality.northwestern.edu/courses/descriptions/220-sexual-subjects-introduction-sexuality-studies.html) (which replaced a [more controversial course](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/northwestern-university-p_n_830423)).\n\nCornell has the Ag and Hotel schools, so you can take courses on [wines](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806221&print), [fermenting food](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=813103&print) (incl. cheese, soy, grains), [beer science/tech](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806244&print), [cider making](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=810997&print), [culinary science](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806225&print) (cooking and planning a meal!), [science+tech of food](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806219&print) (compete for the best ice cream flavor!), [magical mushrooms+mischievous molds](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=808008&print), [cannabis](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=812574&print), [entrepreneurship](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=803784&print), and [fermenting grains, hard ciders, and sake](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=811126&print). There are also a few [massive and popular](https://cornellsun.com/2019/10/10/inside-two-of-cornells-biggest-classes-wines-and-oceanography/) [intro courses](https://cornellsun.com/2021/10/12/cornells-largest-classes-participate-in-university-effort-to-collect-data-on-classroom-transmission/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss): [Wines](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=806484&print), [Psych](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=808028&print) and [Oceanography](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=45&coid=805868&print).\n\nHonestly... they're both great places. Cornell's probably better for engineering and diversity of course offerings and Northwestern is in a better location. No wrong choices; just figure out which you like better.",

They\u2019ve also been in the Big Ten Championship game two of the last three seasons, and they had two players selected in the first round of the NFL draft this season.",

Now... yeah, BCS -- so let's add in that they made it to the Rose Bowl twice -- and won it once. Cornell Hockey has won 12 conference titles, been in the NCAA tournament 22 times, made it to the Frozen Four 8 times, made it to the the NCAA championship four times, and won the championship twice. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the Wildcats to make it to the championship any time soon.\n\nCornell has been far more successful at hockey, but football is more of a spectacle -- so like I said, it's a wash.",

      "text": "I think you should not factor rank heavily into your decision at all, both are good ABET accredited schools. You could look at the coursework for each school and see which pathway is more interesting to you. At Northwestern you have to take a [Theme](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/social-science-humanities-theme-requirement.html), which is a series of coursework you design centered around a topic you're interested in for social studies & humanities. They also have their [Engineering First](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/engineering-first.html) program, and you have the opportunity to choose a concentration within mechanical engineering. Idk what Cornell has because I'm not applying there, but something about the classes you'd be taking at either school might stand out to you.",
