  "text": "I\u2019m a recent high school graduate with hopes of becoming a nurse practitioner. Upon viewing this website (there\u2019s a simplified photo version if you scroll down), it states that in order to do so, one must obtain a bachelors of science in nursing (B.S.N). \n\nI plan on applying to Texas State University and noticed they offer a program for those pursuing a BSN (link [here](http://mycatalog.txstate.edu/undergraduate/health-professions/st-davids-nursing/bsn/). \n\nHow exactly does this work, though? Do you attend college the way any other student would, complete the minimum # of semester credit hours, and then apply? And once you apply, what happens next? Do you transfer to a different school or do you generally remain where you\u2019re at, only with a new course outline? \n\nWhile I\u2019m aware that speaking with a college counselor would be the best thing to do to ensure I receive accurate information, I figured I\u2019d hold off on doing so until I know I\u2019ve been accepted. In the meantime, however, I\u2019m trying to figure out as much as I can on my own and any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
