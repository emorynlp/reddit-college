Is your GPA in the 25-75th percentile or above that for each UC you\u2019re considering? Are you trying for CS/Eng or another major? How eloquent areyour essay/PIQs? You really didn\u2019t give enough info, but maybe thinking about the answer to these questions will give you some clarity.",

OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nIf you're OOS, unless your family is *wealthy* (meaning you can comfortably afford +$70,000/year), I wouldn't bother applying to a UC",

Assuming you can pay that comfortably, apply if you like the colleges and want a shot at them, and don\u2019t if you don\u2019t like them enough. These kinds of posts seem to imply some internet stranger\u2019s idea of your \u201cchances\u201d determine whether it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d applying to a certain college. That\u2019s not true. Whether it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d applying to a college is your personal value decision, based on weighing how much you personally like the college vs the effort and money required to apply.",
