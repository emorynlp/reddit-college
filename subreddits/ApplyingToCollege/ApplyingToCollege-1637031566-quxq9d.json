  "text": "I am an international student and I am required to submit my TOEFL score. I took my TOEFL exam in Oct and my score wasn't that great. So I am taking my exam again today. I will get my score in a week and it will take around 2-3 weeks for the university to receive it. I was wondering if it is too late? Will the university accept my application? I have already talked about this with my counselor and she said it was alright. I have also send an e-mail regarding this to all universities I applied to. I haven't received any reply from the universities yet.",
