  "text": "Hi I'm 1millionbucks, one of the original moderators of A2C. I rarely contribute these days but I thought this news was too important to ignore.\n\nA college degree is an INVESTMENT in yourself; it's far too expensive to be undertaken without careful thought and consideration. If you are going to college unsure of what you want to study, or you feel you're going to college because that's what everyone else is doing, or because that's what everyone told you to do--this post is for you.\n\nA recent study examined the return on investment (ROI) of many degrees from various universities. In financial markets, ROI measures the profitability of an investment relative to its cost. In the study, the ROI of a college degree is defined as **the increase in lifetime earnings** a student can expect from that degree, **minus the direct and indirect costs** of college. \n\nThe study found:\n\n* 38% of bachelor's programs have a **negative ROI**. (You would have made more money over the course of your life by not going to college at all.)\n\n* Attending an elite school is not a golden ticket; some Ivy League degrees have negative ROI.\n\n* Most bachelor\u2019s degree programs in engineering, computer science, economics, and nursing increase lifetime earnings by $500,000 or more, even after subtracting the costs of college. \n\n* But most programs in fields such as art, music, philosophy, religion, and psychology leave students financially worse off than if they had never gone to college at all.\n\nIf you have an idea of what you want to study in college, this analysis is a great way to get a sneak peek into your financial future. I highly suggest searching the dataset for your intended major to see whether it will pay off down the line.\n\n###To read the full analysis, click [here](https://freopp.org/is-college-worth-it-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-1b2ad17f84c8).\n\n###To search the dataset for the ROI of a specific program, click [here](https://freopp.org/we-calculated-return-on-investment-for-30-000-bachelors-degrees-find-yours-1f2f3c5e6dac).\n\nDon't get guilted into an expensive, worthless degree! Think carefully about what you're studying and what you want to achieve in college. I'm available for questions in the comments.",

People who studied chemistry at Harvard can, on the strength of the degree, get high-paying jobs in i-banking, insurance, or some other field that doesn't actually require chemistry. (I know tons of Ivy grads who work in finance and none who were finance majors.) Is it possible that they choose lower-paying lab jobs in a field -- chemistry -- that they care about?",

I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, but I know that Yale (the law top school in the US) grade have super high incomes for private jobs, but they actually have lower incomes in public jobs than graduates from other lower ranked law schools. Yale law grads never *need* to take public jobs long term, so the ones who do probably have a particular personal reason, and they might me more likely to be a public defender or something that could be lower paying.",

If you mean entry-level, that's already saturated but that's because there's a low barrier to entry. There's a huge issue of lack of talent among mid and senior level positions which is why you can simultaneously hear news about SWEs in Apple refusing to work without permanent remote work while also hearing about literally thousands apply for entry level. \n\nIt's one of the fields where once you get actual experience, you're pretty much good to go but the issue is getting to that stage in the first place. \n\nAlso, I'm of the opinion that in the future, a shit ton of roles will open up that are technical in nature. Already, many roles that were historically non-technical are now technical. Marketing has *exploded* but a lot of it is based on data analytics for example.",

              "text": "Two main things:\n\nFirst:\n\nFocusing *solely* on compensation seems like a poor strategy for maximizing long-term fulfillment.  There's a law of diminishing returns when it comes to money and its relationship to happiness, while working a job that one finds intensely rewarding can pay huge dividends.\n\nSecond:\n\nIn this guy's ROI calculations he tries to separate out the portion of earnings attributable to graduate degrees.  That's why he has the average mid-career (45yo) earnings of a Harvard chemistry major at $70k/year.  Compensation is directly determined by one's career, not major per se.  While certain high-earning careers are accessible only by way of specific undergraduate majors (e.g. Chemical Engineering), others are accessible by a wide variety of undergraduate majors (e.g. law, medicine).  Ergo, even \\*if\\* your goal were simply to maximize earnings (which, given the first point above, I don't recommend), you would not necessarily want to use this guy's ROI calculations as a guide.\n\nThis is \\*especially\\* true if you expect to land in the top percentiles of earners for your given major, since the variation of earnings \\*within\\* majors is even larger than the variation in average earnings \\*across\\* majors.  For instance, the median CS major earns more mid-career than the median philosophy major, but the 75th and 90th percentile philosophy majors both earn more than the 75th and 90th percentile CS majors (mid-career).  Probably because, at the 75h and 90th percentiles, you're dealing with people who subsequently went to law or medical school.\n\nCan't vouch for this guy's stats (they're not actually on his GitHub page like he claims), but checkout the image titled \"Distribution of Mid-Career Salaries\" [here](https://medium.com/swlh/what-major-pays-an-analysis-of-the-salaries-of-undergraduate-majors-in-na-9c88d08c5b30).",

You won't get rich as a high school principal, but it pays the bills.\n\nBut here's the thing:  that guy's ROI analysis doesn't take into account that students who earn a B.A. in Anthro don't have to stop there, or get a M.A. in Anthro.  If you were to look only at his ROI numbers, you'd not only want to avoid Anthrpology, but also  Biology and Chemistry.  Does that seem reasonable?

Many who don't get into medical school will be left with low paying job prospects. \n\nThis guy's estimates are not sufficient for decision-making, but given the hundreds of thousands of dollars some bachelors degrees cost and how limiting some degrees can be on future job and educational prospects, it's a disgrace that such an analysis hasn't been performed before now. I have some concerns with some of his work too, but at least he's trying to provide data where very little exists.",

Throughout college, you need to be thinking about what's next and if what you are doing is a path to that. If you don't know what's next, you need to do things to help you figure it out. If you just go to class, make good grades, but spend your summers chilling and working the same job you had in HS, you're not really taking responsibility.  You need to have internships, learn skills beyond what you are taught in class, figure out some potential paths.\n\nIf a kid is am English major with a plan for that degree (law, teaching, whatever)  they will likely be fine. It's the people who just pick a major based on \"the one I find the least boring\" and do nothing else that struggle later.",

Because the field is so big and varied that you can land let\u2019s say an internship at a ThinkTank, and the following year at a Newspaper. Having both on a CV are very good cause it shows you have a varied skill set and since a lot of people do different stuff anyways it can land you future career opportunities. Also try and go abroad and/or maybe focus on a geographic area with your studies if you\u2019re in IR.\n\nBest of luck!",

I'm kind of confused because most studies agree that a single-payer healthcare system provides the best ROI, and the think tank doesn't seem to be advocating such a system. Are there reasons for wanting to do something besides ROI?\n2. The author is foolish for advising students to go to college at all. He should be advising them to skip college and instead go into underwater welding, since that has the best ROI.",

At the minimum, you could work in the field for a couple years and then get a job at virtually any college you want. If you go to a worse school, it'll be substantially harder to get a teaching/academic/research job. \n\nCase in point, my mom went to Texas Tech. She has a natural gift for writing. She still holds the record for most legal briefs written in a year timespan at the Houston Department of Justice. Writes 2-3 legal research papers a year and has been published in Boston College and Pepperdine. She barely got a teaching job at the 3rd best law school in Houston, South Texas College of Law. \n\nThe 3 offices surrounding her belong to teachers from Yale, Harvard, and Harvard. They rarely write anything (1 paper every 3 years), and have 5 years of practical legal experience between them. They make 1.5x as much as her, easily passed the interviews, and joined with full tenure. \n\nI'm sure this is the case with other schools too. If you go to a fantastic college, you can land a teaching/academic job really easily.",

If humanities majors at Harvard were out-earning engineering majors from less selective schools, on average, it would show in the results.\n\nEven for those who do get high-paying consulting jobs, [most don't end up staying in those jobs for their career](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2019/02/why-you-should-look-at-consulting-as-a-career-stepping-stone). They're just smart young labor that's willing to work a 80 hours a week to make the partners rich. \n\nGranted, if someone has their heart set on Wall Street, being from feeder schools is a big leg up, but NYU and U. Michigan Ann Arbor are bigger feeders than most of the Ivies. \n\nPeople also need to keep in mind where these jobs are located. Maybe the pandemic has changed this somewhat with remote work--I don't know--but big consulting and big finance are usually in very high cost of living areas where elementary school costs $20k/year. I know some people who went to top colleges and then stayed in big consulting, and while I'm sure they make a lot on paper, their homes and lifestyles are surprisingly middle class. In many cities, you have to be making nationally top 1-3% salaries to comfortably afford yesterday's solidly middle class homes. Sure, if you grab the brass rings and make big finance bonuses or become a consulting partner, you can be filthy rich, but that's a gamble. This study is about what happens to most people, on average, from each school and with each major.",

Also a lot of those numbers are skewed low when looking at salary because it doesn\u2019t take things like RSU and Bonuses into account which are very common for Tech / Finance jobs.
