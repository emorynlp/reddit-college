  "title:": "Is this a rigorous course load?",
  "text": "I know that colleges like to see rigorous course load in the 4 years of high school and I was wondering my course load is good for colleges. Mostly T-50 colleges. For reference my school offers 14 APs and it is known for having a challenging curriculum. I am currently a senior and in total during high school  I will taken 11 APs. In all of my AP classes I received a mix of As and Bs. The only APs I didn't take are AP French, AP French Lit and AP Art. \n\n9th-grade = no aps as students are not allowed to take them \n\n10th grade =**AP world** and **AP Bio**. (I was now allowed to take the class but I took the AP test.)\n\n11th grade= **APUSH, AP Comp Sci Principles**, **AP Calc AB,** **AP Lang**, **AP Physics** \n\n12th= **Ap Lit**, **AP CALC BC**, **AP Chem**, **AP Comp Sci**",

      "text": "Other than the fact that I'm pretty sure AP French Lit doesn't exist as an AP exam anymore, yes, this would be a rigorous courseload. \n\nRigor is also relative to your school, so maybe as your GC how it stands up to your classmates, but I struggle to imagine a scenario in which 11/14 APs isn't a very rigorous courseload",

For context, my school is in the Bay Area (ultra competitive), with 18 different AP courses offered. That's why I'm not sure if its enough. Also will it be bad that all the AP's are mainly in 12th grade?",
