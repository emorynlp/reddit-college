  "title:": "When should I send my AP exam scores?",
  "text": "Hi, i'm applying to both CSU's and UC's. In my junior year i took two AP exams, and this year i plan to take three. Am I supposed to wait until i get my scores from this year, or do I send the two scores i have right now? I saw online that you can wait until you are accepted into a school and choose to go to it, but then wouldn't it be too late? Also, I only get the results for AP tests in like july of 2022 (taken in may 2022) and in the one school i could (kind of) find what i think is the deadline, it seems to be july 15th. How am i supposed to make the deadline if my scores come out barely before or even after that date? \n\nBasically just when am I supposed to send official AP score transcripts from CollegBoard. I am really lost and I can't figure it out. Please help",

          "text": "i did self-report them in both the CSU and UC applications, but when I clicked to submit my CSU app it said to be sure I send my AP scores to Cal state apply. That got me all confused about it and now I just don't know whether I'm supposed to wait until i take this years' exams. But the consensus seems to be to wait until you are accepted from what i can find i guess",

              "text": "I submitted my CSU application yesterday and also saw that. I just assumed they wanted an official score report sent to Cal State Apply right now and then another sent to the specific school next year if you choose to enroll, but I\u2019m not entirely sure.

                  "text": "yeah, i saw that page as well, its just really vague. All it says is that you can send them anytime during the application process unless specific schools want it at a specific time. It just annoys me that they don't tell me whether to wait for my senior year ap exam scores. I'm probably going to end up sending the cal state apply and the 4 UC schools im applying to my ap scores right now and spending the 75$ college board will charge me for that :/. i guess after that i just wait to be accepted and then send my choice school my scores after this years' exams",

You\u2019ll prob SIR before the deadline of the free score report, so unless you get off a waitlist and SIR somewhere else, you won\u2019t have to pay for an AP report at all.",
