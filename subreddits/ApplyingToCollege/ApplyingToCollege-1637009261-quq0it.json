  "title:": "A friend's counselor asked him to write his own LoR and said she will sign it off.",
  "text": "Recently, a friend of mine who studies in a different school called me out and said he asked his counselor for a LoR and she said she won't be able to write it as she is busy. So, she told him to write it himself and she will review it and send it. THIS IS WRONG, RIGHT?\n\nHe told me that,  his school is not familiar with the process, and they don't even have a counselor. The person was just an experienced teacher who was asked to be a counselor for him by his principal. (and the principal can't be the counselor as he is a \"super busy\" person. lol.)And, he feels like she just didn't want to take the responsibility. She wasn't even interested in helping him out but had no other choice. And, she just told him to write his own letter, whatever he wants to write. THIS IS SUPER WRONG, in my opinion. He called me and asked what to do, but I never came across anything as such. So, what do I tell him?\n\nAnd, now if she is forced to write, he doesn't even trust that she will write anything good.",

      "text": ">THIS IS WRONG, RIGHT?\n\nIs it wrong to give your counselor some notes/talking points for your LoR? What about if these notes are well written and you know it is highly likely your counselor will copy/paste into the LoR without modifying (which it is pretty obvious many do)?\n\nIf neither of those scenarios is wrong, I don't see how *drafting* a LoR for the counselor is wrong.  If they don't agree with, they are free to edit it. Untimately, they have to submit it under their name, so it has to be something they agree with. \n\nIt is their issue, not your friends.",
