I'm looking forward to talking with you sometime in the coming month about your experience at Harvard; I'm applying to the University this year and received your information as my alumni interviewer. Do you happen to have an opening on the weekend of etc., or is there a date and time that would work better with your schedule?\"  \n\nI find it a little odd that Harvard gave you the interviewer's email rather than the other way around. Are you sure the email from Harvard is legit?",

It may also be that they are busy, but a follow up via another modality would be a good thing. Otherwise, send another email. Best of luck!",
