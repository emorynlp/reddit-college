Thanks \n\nOh and I am international so I hope this is a good sign (although I think the interview is based off on availability..)",

      "text": "Had mine last week. In the states. It was short,35 minutes. I\u2019ve heard some near 50-60 minutes but importantly,know the school programs and why you\u2019d be a good fit. Some interviewers have similar majors as your interests, mine did not but was very cordial. We lived in nearby cities and discussed why I want to attend, programs I\u2019ve been involved in. If you\u2019ve got a relevant interesting aspect of your life use it at some point. I practiced a few hours with my parents asking me questions so I\u2019d retrieve info quickly. \n    Remember the interview is considered but not deemed as important versus other aspects( quantitatively I\u2019ve read it is a small part of the overall recommendations and guidance letter category.) no curve balls were asked,not even books I read which was interesting since he was a humanities major.",
