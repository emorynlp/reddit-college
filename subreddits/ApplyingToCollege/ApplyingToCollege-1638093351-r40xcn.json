  "text": "Hello, I'm a 17-year-old (F) outside of the US. I understand you guys must be in a really stressful time right now, but I have so many questions, and I hope you take the time to answer them. I'll be very grateful.\n\nSo, I wanna go for Animation, and it's a HUGE dream of mine to end up working in Disney or Pixar. We do have two really good colleges in my country that will teach me the skills I need, but I want to aim for other colleges abroad as well. Please assume I'm 5 and tell me what all you guys do (I keep hearing of essays and supplements) but I don't really get the entire details.\n\n I want to apply to USC and Sheridan (Canada) since they seem to be the best out of everywhere else, please let me know if there are other universities or schools for animation too! I feel like if I study abroad I have a better chance of ending up at my dream studios. \n\nI'm currently in grade 12, I will be graduating by March/April 2022. After that, there are a series of entrance examinations that I'll be writing until September 2022. I will be able to sit down and apply abroad only after this, when do applications usually take place? Will I have missed it already by September? And when I do apply after September, and suppose I do get accepted, when will the semester start? What sort of changes might be there for an international applicant?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much, and all the very best, I hope all our dreams come true.",

In an arbitrary order...  \n\n\n* transcripts (submitted by your school, showing your marks in all for years of secondary)\n* SAT/ACT (optional this year, but usually required otherwise)\n* Letters of recommendation (*usually* 2 from teachers + 1 from a counselor / school admin)\n* Activities list (a list of 10-ish things you did in HS outside of school, w/ quick descriptions)\n* Awards list (if you have any. same thing as above, nbd if u don't have anything)\n* Essays (split into two categories for the most part: 650 word common application personal statement and supplements that vary in length but are usually between 100 and 500 words)\n* interviews (at some but not all schools)\n\n\\++might have left something out unintentionally; someone correct me below!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I think NYU and CMU are good for design! admissions are competitive asl, but they're nice schools. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) that time frame would most likely be ok, as the application portals open in july\u2014you wouldn't be missing too much time. that said, some things, like your standardized testing, should probably be complete before then. writing essays in 2 months is doable, especially if you have nothing else on your mind at the time, but it might be best to have everything else already out of the way.",

After September I'll be very very free so I can dedicate my time to the portfolio, essay prep, and whatnot, so that won't be a problem. What kind of activities are we talking about? The only thing I can get off the top of my head is that I've been an active participant in my country's equivalent to girl scouts.",

As a fellow international in a country where extracurricular activities are irrelevant to the admissions process, here's what I wish I properly understood a year and a half ago- US college admissions are **holistic.** This means that your entire application overall- Grades, test scores, extracurriculars, essays, jobs/internships, awards, interviews if any, basically everything you've achieved in your high school career will be evaluated, and strong applicants are expected to be strong across all of these factors. It was and still is difficult for me to grasp, but being a student in the US is like a full-time job with everything they do. Over here, being a student basically means just....studying.\n\nThat said, even if you aren't great across all of these things, **do not** hesitate to apply and take your chances! Look at me, I have negligible ECs and what I hope are decent to good academics and essays I'm not at all sure are good. I also need finaid, and I'm still shamelessly applying to a bunch of schools, most of which I have poor chances at. I still have other options in my country, so I'm not toast even if it doesn't work out. Good luck and I hope you get in! Also, a huge range of things are considered extracurriculars, so for all you know you might have great ECs!",

I'm kinda being the black sheep by going for animation and design, so I gotta work extra hard. I think it's nice that the US college applications try to encourage co-curricular activities, unlike in my country where the only way you'll get a college is studying 24/7.",

For the Ivies, e.g., if you apply by the \"early\" date (November 1) you get an answer by mid-December, i.e. 1.5 months later.  If you apply by the \"regular\" date (January 1) you get an answer by mid-March, i.e. 2.5 months later.  You typically have until May 1 to accept an offer of admission, though, for some schools, you will want to put down a housing deposit long before that (since on-campus housing fills up).",
