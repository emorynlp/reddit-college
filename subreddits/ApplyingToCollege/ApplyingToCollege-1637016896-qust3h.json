  "text": "Ok so I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m posting this on the right sub.. but basically, I\u2019m 18 and I thought I didn\u2019t want to do the whole college thing.. I was depressed very badly and had my mind set on not being here that much longer so I gave up on my future entirely. Didn\u2019t apply to any colleges my senior year. Parents said i HAD to do something so I just signed up to take an online class at community college this past semester and i FAILED it. But now I want a future. I want to turn my life around. And I need to get out of my hometown. So basically what I\u2019m asking is, is it too late for me? If I try to apply anywhere else they are just going to look at the community college class I failed right? So does that mean it\u2019s impossible for me to go anywhere now? Is it over for me? I\u2019m guessing no school is going to be willing to give a second chance to some random sob story.",

Right now, you are in the same position as a lot of students who took a gap year.  You need to refine what your goals are so that the next steps feels more successful for you and you are motivated by moving towards something that draws you.",
