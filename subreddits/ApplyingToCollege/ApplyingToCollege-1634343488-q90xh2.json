  "text": "Hello, \n\nI'm almost done with writing my Common App essay and I'm not sure whether it's good or not. I was wondering if you guys had some recommendations on who to ask to edit essays. I don't mind if it's a paid (just nothing overly expensive) or free service. One last thing--my essay is about cultural identity, so I was wondering if it made sense to ask my junior year multicultural literature teacher to take a look at my essay. \n\nAll feedback is appreciated!",

She\u2019s a literature teacher, so the only suggestion I have is to have her comments on the essay, and only take her content-based ideas. I\u2019ve made the mistake of having English teachers over-edit my grammar to the point that it sounds really regurgitated, so just remember to keep your voice :)",
