  "title:": "Roblox as an EC...?",
  "text": "So.\n\nI'm unsure whether to include this into my app but I do this thing on Roblox where I develop games for other people.\n\nIt started as a hobby when I was in 6th grade, and when I realized I could make a good buck out of it (2k-3k robux for a build, that's $25 USD - $38 USD for you non roblox players). I did it aggressively for a good 5 years into 10th grade.\n\nI must have built at least 15 ish games? There isn't a lot of scripting involved, and most of it is understanding how to drag blocks, adjust lighting, and make colors look good.\n\nThe thing is - I don't know if it's unique or worth it to be on my application. I already have 10 ECS but I feel that at least 5/10 are your generic debate club mock trial thing. The EC also doesn't correlate to ANYTHING I want to pursue (like game developing, coding, etc) and it was, in all honesty, just a good hobby I kept with me.\n\nShould I still include it?",
