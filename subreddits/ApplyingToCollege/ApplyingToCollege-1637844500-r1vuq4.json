Ppl signing up for this OPTIOAL demonstration clearly wants to see it. You don't get to judge what is academic freedom, and the activity itself doesn't not hurt anyone. You, good sir, for some most basic human decency, need to learn to just not participate in anything you consider, rather than ruin it for everyone else.",
