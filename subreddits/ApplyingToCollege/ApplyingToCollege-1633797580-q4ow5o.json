  "text": "For me it would be getting rid of that mindset that colleges won\u2019t accept me if I don\u2019t take AP and IB courses and I wish I\u2019ve taken honors/non honors courses in combination with dual enrollment courses to demonstrate both course rigor and also getting a lot of college credits out of the way so if I don\u2019t get accepted to my top uni\u2019s I can always transfer those credits to my state schools which is such a great option since I live in California",

I went the easier route not because it\u2019s easier, but because those classes were a better fit for my interests. I actually didn\u2019t know they were easier, had I known that course rigor was important and the other classes were harder, I probably wouldn\u2019t have chosen the classes I\u2019m taking. However, the AA teacher at my school sucks and his entire class is failing so I guess I lucked out!",

I took the classes freshmen year that I thought would be the most different from my siblings, but it didn't really work and I didn't enjoy my electives. I wish I'd tried a comp sci class, I feel like it's kinda too late now. Non-academic, I wish I'd gotten involved with more clubs. Especially with COVID, I just feel like I missed my chance to get involved, meet new people, and maybe start a club of my own.",
