  "text": "I did a small oopsy on the CSS.  After a few days, it gave me the option to submit a correction and so I did that. \n\nAm I all good now? Because I emailed my counselor about it and they said that I might have to contact all the colleges' financial aid offices, and I've been searching online and most sources also say this... but I also heard that College Board was letting us make a one time correction to the CSS but i'm not 100% sure on that",
