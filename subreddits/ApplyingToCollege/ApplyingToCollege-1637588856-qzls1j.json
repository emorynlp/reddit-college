  "title:": "Duke LGBTQ+ prompt",
  "text": "One of Duke\u2019s optional essays is about the LGBTQ+ community, here is the full prompt:\n\n*Duke\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion includes sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. If you would like to share with us more about your identity in these areas, you can do so here or, if you feel you have adequately represented your gender and sexual orientation in other parts of your application, feel free to not respond to this prompt.*\n\nI am bisexual so I can write about that of course, but then I realized I am not so sure what this prompt is asking\u2026 does it literally just want me to describe bisexuality in 200 words?? Or could I tell a story of a challenge I have faced due to homophobia (that was my original idea)?\n\nThanks in advance",
