  "text": "if yes, in all classes or just non-ap classes? is there some sort of policy like \"u can only get up to a xx% on a retake\" or \"ur new score is the avg btwn ur new and old\" or something... or is it just whichever one u scored higher on?\n\nmy school only allows retakes in regular classes (so not honors or ap), and we can only get up to a 75 on retakes, and we can only retake two tests per semester. but my friends at other schools are allowed unlimited retakes with no grade cap....",
