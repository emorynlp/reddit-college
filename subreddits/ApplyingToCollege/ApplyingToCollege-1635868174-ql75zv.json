  "text": "Hey so I submitted UMich for ea but I made a mistake in the community prompt for LSA. I said something like \"wrap my arm around my arm\" when I meant to say \"wrap my hand around my arm\". I know it's super small but it's a school that if I get in I can just apply to reaches from now on so will this look bad at all? Thank you so much guys and gl to whoever applied to ed/ea",
