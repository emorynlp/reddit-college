  "text": "Australian here, planning on applying for American/British universities for med and just wondered about the necessity of extracurricular/leadership/sport participation. Honestly speaking, my motivation and participation was shit even before the coronavirus and with lockdowns and depression it has basically turned to zero. Academics are pretty much the only thing I've got on at the moment. And for someone in their later years of high school most leaderships positions require experience which I severely lack. Pretty much hit a dead end at this point so would basically appreciate any advice at all.",

      "text": "From what I can gauge on British universities, they generally don't care all that much about extracurriculars and instead focus much more on test scores and genuine interest in the subject you want to study. \n\nAmerican universities, particularly the competitive ones, however, do stress extracurriculars and leadership positions a lot more. If you have specific colleges in mind, google the university's name and \"common data set.\" Typically it's the first link that has the actual data set. On it, if you scroll down a bit, you can find how the university weighs certain parts of your application.",
