  "title:": "Notion is by far the best application I've come across for keeping up with tasks.",
  "text": "Honestly, one of the best tools. The amount of customization and aesthetics it provides for a free application, is just too good to be true. I'm glad I started using this app as a Junior because I've already started working on my essays, and way this app helps with keeping up with everything -- from keeping separate documents for each schools essay prompt, to maintaining the college list -- is just not describable. I'd heavily advice every single one of you to use it. The aesthetics and the features are just designed in a way to keep you more productive. \n\nGood luck with applications to every single one of you, I am sure you will get into your dream college!",
