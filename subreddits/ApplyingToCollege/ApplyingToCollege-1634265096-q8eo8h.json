(I know not gonna happen for us)\n\nBut just wanted to take a moment to reflect that in the middle of an unprecedented crisis, inflation, economic devastation across the globe, schools are becoming richer than ever..",

      "text": "Many colleges saw increases in the value of their endowment investments this year.\n\nSince you mention inflation, consider the possible connection between increase in endowment and inflation.  Also consider other ways in which inflation affects colleges such as recent and future increases in operating costs.  We can predict what will happen as a result of operating costs increasing.",

          "text": "To be faiiiir... schools which have issued bonds will see that reduce the real costs of their liabilities; and, some schools have hard assets in their portfolio. For example, [Yale and Dartmouth own tens of thousands of acres of timberland](https://thenewjournalatyale.com/2019/12/unclear-cutting/) in New Hampshire and Maine. (Weird aside: residents of Wheelock, Vermont can attend Dartmouth for free due to an early land grant.)\n\nI worry far less about inflation (especially since many schools have hard assets in their portfolio and have issued bonds) than about the asset allocation of these endowments -- especially how much they hold of illiquid investments. Thankfully, the CIO said in 2020 they were reducing illiquid investments. That's sensible, especially since just sticking the money in the Russell 2000 would have gotten them a 39% return.",

              "text": "I\u2019m a bit torn on the liquidity concern. Part of my shares your same instinct. It\u2019s what has been consistently drilled into me (being my profession). The difference: endowments at these schools have grown so large that there isn\u2019t an immediate or even medium term need to liquidate. I don\u2019t know enough about Cornell, but WashU\u2019s payout is about 3.5%. There is enough cash to run the campus for a year. There is enough liquid investment to run the university for years and years even if the market value of those equities were cut in half tomorrow and saw zero appreciation. They don\u2019t need to sell a large proportion of their alternative investment position to recalibrate the portfolio. \n\nWealthy universities are just so asset heavy compared to their operating requirements. And their other revenue sources are relatively secure as well. The investment strategy is such an ultra long term play. If the university believes certain alternative investments are the best 20 year plays, they have the luxury of sitting in ways that companies, pension funds, and generally do not.  \n\nThat said, I\u2019m still not a fan of seeing 50% of a portfolio in illiquid alternative investments (even though much of the underlying capital in those funds is liquid).",

                  "text": "We're basically in agreement. I totally agree that universities have a super-long investment horizon and, for their size, very low volatility. So higher-yielding illiquidity-premium-earning investments like PE and VC (and some hedge funds) make sense; and, ideally universities could get in as early seed investors and part-owners on technologies developed on-campus or by associated people. That said... yeah, with many schools having PE/VC/HFs at 40%, 50% or more of the portfolio (with another 10%-15% in illiquid hard assets like timberland and real estate), I start to worry. I also think most university investment offices lack the capability to see which investments have true alpha, but that's not unique to them. However, it does suggest some of their higher-fee investments might not be so great, Hell, YOLOing the Russell 2000 this past year would have gotten most endowments pretty similar results... so what are they paying for?\n\nAlso, having lived through the post-2008 chaos... universities are almost all fixed cost, so even a 5% a rescission is a killer. The UC system almost came down and the infighting over who would live and die had started; some star professors left; their quality took a hit; and, they haven't yet recovered. I know of one university where a steam pipe ruptured and they lacked the free cash to do a proper repair for a month. Those things really hurt a school, so avoiding them is crucial.\n\nI think Cornell's payout is something like 4%. I'm not too worried about that -- though I sure was worried to see WashU issue debt to stay in their investments in the first few months of the year. That could have gone poorly.",

                      "text": "I hear you on 2008. I was actually a \u201cvaluation expert\u201d leading a team on all all sorts of restructuring issues. We were asked to do an MBS post mortem analysis where we cracked into those black boxes. Pretty obvious to anyone what happened. Like if you knew a house fire started in a living room on December 29th, you could guess \u201cChristmas Tree Fire\u201d and be correct 95% of the time. \n\nI think where there\u2019s a difference is in the financial and market characteristics of hyper selective, wealthy private colleges (and especially universities). A recession does nothing to their tuition revenue because they reject at least 2 qualified applicants for each one they accept. Research grants have long since been awarded. Hospital revenue remained strong from 2007-09. Public unis fighting for state funding and less selective colleges who don\u2019t have that extensive pool of qualified applicants do suffer. \n\n\nI\u2019m only familiar with WashU\u2019s case, but operationally, revenues still went up. Not as much as expenses, but they remained in the black. The endowment took a hit obviously.  \n\nThose types of colleges are so well capitalized that taking on some cheap debt makes sense. My concern with the alternative allocation is more a question of if the excess returns are enough to really bother at all. A well funded university doesn\u2019t need to liquidate them. And I do think universities are well positioned technically to pick winners in emerging technologies. But the volatility can reduce the payout anyway and they require more active management. \n\nNo doubt someone can create a strategy that includes 25% AI that both reduces risk and increases expected return over what normal businesses and people can realize. I don\u2019t know where the trade off is beyond that.",
