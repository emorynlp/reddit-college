(I know not gonna happen for us)\n\nBut just wanted to take a moment to reflect that in the middle of an unprecedented crisis, inflation, economic devastation across the globe, schools are becoming richer than ever..",

      "text": "Many colleges saw increases in the value of their endowment investments this year.\n\nSince you mention inflation, consider the possible connection between increase in endowment and inflation.  Also consider other ways in which inflation affects colleges such as recent and future increases in operating costs.  We can predict what will happen as a result of operating costs increasing.",

          "text": "To be faiiiir... schools which have issued bonds will see that reduce the real costs of their liabilities; and, some schools have hard assets in their portfolio. For example, [Yale and Dartmouth own tens of thousands of acres of timberland](https://thenewjournalatyale.com/2019/12/unclear-cutting/) in New Hampshire and Maine. (Weird aside: residents of Wheelock, Vermont can attend Dartmouth for free due to an early land grant.)\n\nI worry far less about inflation (especially since many schools have hard assets in their portfolio and have issued bonds) than about the asset allocation of these endowments -- especially how much they hold of illiquid investments. Thankfully, the CIO said in 2020 they were reducing illiquid investments. That's sensible, especially since just sticking the money in the Russell 2000 would have gotten them a 39% return.",
