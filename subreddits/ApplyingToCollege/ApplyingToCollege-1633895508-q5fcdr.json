  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm a HS senior and I don't have many EC's to talk about for my college apps (applying to UCs, CSUs, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Caltech) so I'm really focusing on my grades and essays. However, there is one EC I've been doing for a few years, which is coding (specifically, game development). I've built more than a few 2d/3d games, and of course I'm gonna describe this passion in my applications. But do you think  this is a good EC? For those of you who got in to CS at the above colleges, did you have a similar interest to talk about? Thanks!",
