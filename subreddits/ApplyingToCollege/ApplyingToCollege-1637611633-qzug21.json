  "text": "Hello, I'm a junior in high school, and I have my mind set I want to do. I want to be a sociologist. I want my research to have importance and credibility, and therefore I want to eventually graduate from an ivy league to assist me in my ambitions. Out of the undergrad schools I think I could potentially get into, which will make it most likely to get into an ivy league for grad school? \n\nReed\nKenyon\nSt. Olaf \n\nWill these schools help me to go to an ivy league for grad? And, are there similar schools that will help me?",
