I made them take the day off from college stuff and just chill/eat snacks/play video games. You don't need permission to cry or to have a bad day. Give yourself some grace and treat yourself with the same gentleness that you'd show a friend in the same situation. Sometimes we have to be our own caretakers. <3",
