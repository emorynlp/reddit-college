  "text": "First off. Example:\n\nNiche and Fiske rating UVM: \n\n- Fiske: basically perfect scores (one academic point off. But I\u2019ve never seen that high of social and quality of life.\n\n- Niche: B+ (not great)\n\nAreas rated: literally the same things.\n\nSo yeah; the fudge? Someone explain please.\n\nALSO: bigger and more important point here, what\u2019s up with people saying that \u201cdon\u2019t worry, undergrad doesn\u2019t matter\u201d or that \u201cHarvards a scam anyway\u201d and then when you say \u201chere\u2019s my stats\u201d they\u2019re like \u201cyour gonna wanna shoot for Harvard (Harvard is def outta my league, but you get it)\u201d. Like bro\u2026 like is this all just cope, or is everyone just intoxicated by the hierarchy of the application process instantly once they think you can get a foot forward.\n\nSo yeah: anyone who has actually researched it (don\u2019t have the time, currently trying to get into Harvard), does this shit matter? Especially for undergrad?\nLike don\u2019t say \u201ckids who go to Harvard end up publishing more, or or doing better, or being President\u201d like that\u2019s literally meaningless, ofc the kids who are able to get into Harvard are going to the be the most \u2018driven\u2019 \n\nI mean would that same kid, the one who goes to Harvard, excel just as much at another university? \n\nDoes Harvard really change anything?\n\nI know I\u2019m going on for a while: but honestly if it\u2019s all just hierarchy and \u201ctitle is better then title\u201d if Harvard and all the other ivy\u2019s are just selling brands, like get me tf out, I wanna escape that cycle as soon as fucking possible. That shits never ending right? You go to Hav then where? Hav med? Then where? When do you get rest?\n\nThank you so much to anyone who takes the time to respond, if you do, I\u2019d love to give you an awesome emoji, such as \ud83d\udc4d, \ud83d\ude4f, \ud83d\ude0e, or even \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b.",

Will college rankings ever demonstrate that?",

      "text": "My husband and I went to respected but not top-tier colleges (T75ish) and have had pretty solid careers and salaries. I worked in unusual positions in finance, management consulting and academia, and saw how graduates of elite schools (and often those with connections and money) were the only ones invited into the best career tracks there. Others did occasionally get in, but it took luck and a lot of effort.\n\nSo, we pushed our smart kids and they excelled. They got into UCLA and Berkeley, both on the recruiting list for every major company. BUT our kids weren\u2019t interested in finance, consulting or academia. So it honestly was t that helpful. The classes were solid but not amazing - my Berkeley girl took a lot of community college classes and the main difference was how smart the other students were, not the teaching or content or overall education. My UCLA girl feels cheated because she struggled to launch a career - UCLA didn\u2019t prepare her well for that and her Cal State friends actually got the same kinds of jobs, and faster because their education was more practical and skills oriented. \n\nIn our case those schools were affordable and probably a good choice. But any Cal State would have done just as well in setting them up for a solid career in most fields. If you are a smart, conscientious person with good organizational and people skills you\u2019ll do well out of any college. You\u2019ll get promoted faster than an Top 40 grad who is awkward or unprepared. And in terms of salary your major and career prep are far more important than going to a high ranked university.\n\nAs a Tiger mom, I helped my kids achieve the goal I thought was important. Looking back, should have encouraged less AP study and more life balance, maybe.\n\nPS Berkeley girl has a friend who went to Harvard. He told her it was so much easier than their competitive high school that it was almost embarrassing. A lot of the success of students there comes from family connections, wealth, and the fact that you have to be reasonably intelligent walking in.",

      "text": "It depends on what you want from a college and what your goals are. There are definitely some fields that have a reputation for school prestige mattering - Wall Street finance is a prominent one.\n\nMore broadly - if you are looking at financial outcomes, the major study cited is usually the one by Dale and Krueger.  The big finding was that for the most part it doesn't make a difference - if you are the kind of student who can get into the most selective schools you succeed no matter where you choose to go. The exception was for low income students - they did better if they went to those most selective schools.\n\nOf course the wealthier students in that position are probably making good choices of schools - they turn down Harvard for a big scholarship at a good school like UVM, not a school with no resources or a for-profit degree mill. Saying that good students succeed with the choices they make isn't the same as saying everything's equal and your school doesn't matter.\n\nFor disadvantaged students the advantages of a school with great resources show up - you might build a network you wouldn't have otherwise, you are more likely to graduate (there is some other research by the JCKF that tracked this), etc.",
