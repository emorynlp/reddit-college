  "text": "I\u2019m sure that most of us are told we must have a few \u2018safe schools\u2019 on our list. I\u2019m just not sold that.\n\nThe only schools that I\u2019m applying to are all \u2018reach schools\u2019. Some might even be high-reach. My thought process is that: in the worst case scenario, if I don\u2019t make it to any of the schools applied, then going to a community college would be an option, since: A) Tuition is cheaper. B) Transferring is always an option. Spending 4 years in a safe school that you don\u2019t like sounds pretty bad for me.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same?",

      "text": "Some thoughts:\n\n1. By attending CC you give up the opportunity to win freshman applicant merit scholarships since you'll be applying as a transfer student.  Given you highlight the inexpensive tuition of community colleges as advantage, I'm assuming cost is important to you.\n2. If you have a legit shot at top schools coming out of high school then two years of 4.0 at a CC may not improve your chances much, if at all.  It's possible (nay, likely) you'll end up spending 2 years at CC then 2 more years at the same safety school you could have enrolled at in the first place, only you may end up paying more than you would if you'd applied coming out of high school.  If you're in a state where there's a \\*guaranteed\\* path from CC to selective 4Y universities, then disregard the above.\n3. You don't like the idea of attending a safety school and yet you're perfectly willing to spend two years at CC, which is like the safety of all safeties.  Odd choice.\n\nBut hey, you do you.",

I have seen ppl turning unis down and applying later to transfer into and get rejected, so worse case scenario there is a chance of not getting into safeties that you could have got in if applied now.",

However, I know a couple of kids who felt a little awkward when their peers all went on to top schools, and they were \u201cstuck\u201d at CC. There is no shame in CC, but seeing everyone else having fun can make you feel left out. Only use CC as a safety if you won\u2019t feel that way.\n\nAlternately, you could pick a 4 yr safety school that you actually like. If your grades are top notch, you could be invited to an honors program or get scholarships.",
