  "title:": "Feeling bad about not having a private college admissions counselor",
  "text": "A lot of my friends have private admissions counselors and I'm really worried I made the wrong choice by not getting one too. I chose not to get one because I wasn't too worried about writing my essays, writing is my greatest passion and I'm either going to major in journalism or dramatic writing in college. \n\nSo far I've been doing pretty well on my essays and I'm happy with how they've turned out. My dad's been helping me edit them (he's a pretty good writer himself) and occasionally my friends read over them too. I'm just worried that I might be overlooking things that a counselor may have been able to notice. \n\nIt's probably too late now but should I have gotten one? What's your experience been like if you have or don't have a counselor? Should I try and look for one?",

      "text": "Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re doing fine. I got a counselor for the Common App essay, but after a long story involving a forgotten computer on vacation, I decided not to use her for supplements. Tbh, everything she helped me on in the Common App was advice located in this sub\u2019s wiki/online, but it was her holding your hand and walking you through the whole thing, ie at the beginning she had me fill out basically the rest of the common app but for her, and she had me do a brainstorming sheet before a zoom where she reexplained a lot of what I knew from lurking and we ended up choosing a structure together. \n\nMy supplements weren\u2019t bad without her, it\u2019s nice to have the admissions counselor if you\u2019re not self-motivated and for certain abstract prompts (think UC Hicago\u2019s weird prompts and/or Stanford) but I think most of the students on this sub would be fine without an admissions counselor.",
