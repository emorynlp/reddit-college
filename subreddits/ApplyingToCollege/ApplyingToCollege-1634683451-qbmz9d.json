I did not want to apply to this school early decision. I talked to my college councilor who said it can not be withdrawn. I just emailed the college telling them I had no part in the application and I hope they will get back. Do I have any further options to withdraw the application? Thanks.",

So you are not violating any laws or committing a legally actionable tort by breaking an ED agreement.  You will not be taken to court over it or sued for breach of contract.\n\nThat said, there are still consequences within the world of college admissions, and that has already been well documented.",

It is 100% fraud for your parents to have sent out your ED app because **you** must attest to the ED agreement. Your counselor is also incompetent for allowing the ED application to be sent because they usually need to attest that you agreed to the ED agreement.\n\nIt is disgusting to me that your counselor and parents are fraudulently completing applications on your behalf, and they should know better than to fuck around with your future like this. This is unethical, manipulative, controlling, and a breach of trust. This disturbing ED submission makes me feel the need to warn you to be very careful regarding FAFSA/CSS because your parents will get themselves in **FELONIOUS** legal trouble by deliberately lying, particularly on a Federal FAFSA.\n\n>The Higher Education Act of 1965 allows for penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of $20,000 if someone is caught lying on the FAFSA. You will also have to pay back any financial aid, so the monetary consequences are even greater. In many cases, the FAFSA is based on parental income and information. In this case, it would likely be the parent who ends up facing the consequences unless it\u2019s proven that another party completed the form without that individual\u2019s knowledge.",
