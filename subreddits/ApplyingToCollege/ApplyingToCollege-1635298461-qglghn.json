  "text": "I\u2019m interested in computer science and virginia tech is my number one, but I want some other matches and/or safeties that have the same vibes as tech. I love how the campus is pretty and walkable, the students seem happy and friendly, and they have living learning programs (especially the engineering one). Please suggest some to me! East coast is preferred.",

Engineering & Applied Sciences House, B. Engineering House,** and **C. Women in Science & Engineering House.**\n\na.
