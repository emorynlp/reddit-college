And how does it work: will they see that\nfrom the beginning or will it be beneficial to me after they've identified me as someone who could be possibly admitted? \nPls Imk as the Nov 1st deadline is coming up\n\nSchools I'm applying to: Cornell ED, UWMadison, UMich, UCs, Brown, Chicago, etc for comp Sci",

I know it sounds semantic, but lack of a disadvantage isn\u2019t really an advantage, per se.\n\nDo note, that if you don\u2018t ask for aid during application, you can never ask for aid at that school in the future. Also, prior to enrolling you will need to demonstrate that you have enough money on-hand to cover the full four years of tuition, fees, room, meals, books, etc.",
