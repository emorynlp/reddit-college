  "text": "I had put my SAT date as Dec 4, instead of Dec 5. I submitted my applications last week and I only noticed it now lol. Should I email the AO of the colleges I applied to or shall I just let it be and nothing bad will happen to my application? Since these scores were self reported, should I send official score reports just in case?",
