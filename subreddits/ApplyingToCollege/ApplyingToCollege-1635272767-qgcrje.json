Essay?\n\nWhat documents do I need to show?\n\nBank balance, property papers, annual earning, anything else apart from these?\n\nTo be eligible for financial aid, I can't show a very huge balance for they might not give aid then, I can't show a seriously low amount cuz then they might not even accept me, so in what range should I show the money? Please help me with anything I missed or got wrong here.\n\nAnything else that I need to know? TIA",
