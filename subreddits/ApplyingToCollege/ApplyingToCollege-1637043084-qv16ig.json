  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized about a week ago that my UMich early Common App application doesn't list which dual enrollment course I am taking this current semester at which college (I'm taking 3 at different colleges) and Common App only allows a max of 3 as a list. My high school transcript does not show it either until I receive grades for the courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not really sure how to go about informing UMichigan about this. The UMich portal doesn't allow updates. Would I simply call their office?",
