  "text": "I am a Georgia resident applying to University of Tennessee Knox with an academic common market major for the purpose of getting in-state in Tennessee. \n\nIf I get ACM in-state tuition, is there a chance I can use my Georgia HOPE scholarship money in Tennessee? \n\nI highly doubt this is the case, but if I am labeled as in-state, does that mean I can use it?",
