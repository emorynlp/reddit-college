  "text": "One of my nieces asked me to read her personal statement, and we got to talking more broadly about schools. I feel bad, it seems like she's been getting some poor advice.\n\nShe has a mixed record: 1410 SAT score, top 10% of high school class (though not a particularly good high school), and took 5 APs as a junior and got (3/2/2/1/1 - the ones being in Calc AB and Physics B.) She didn't seem particularly put off by those 1s, she just blamed it on a bad teacher and covid, and is now taking BC and C. Her parents seem to have accepted her explanation; when I was in high school, nobody with a 1 in both of those would have continued on with APs!\n\nShe decided to apply to only two schools: a non-flagship SUNY (ACT avg \\~26) and Michigan (which is clearly out-of-reach). The SUNY is her top pick because she wants to play D3 field hockey. \n\nHer aunt (who was a D1 college athlete) encouraged her to apply to the flagship SUNYs just to keep her options open independent of sports, but she is convinced that the financial aid package will be more generous at the weaker SUNY. I assumed she meant she was going to apply for scholarships, but she is not. Somebody convinced her that the need-based financial aid package will have more grants in it because her SATs and grades are very high for the school. I can find no evidence of this, maybe there's something I'm not aware of. But obviously Michigan would be far more expensive!\n\nShe says she wants to major in international business. The school she has picked is not particularly well-known internationally, and has limited career resources. She told me that she expects to get a leg up getting jobs because people are impressed by athletes who keep their grades up. I told her no more so than someone who sings A Capella and keeps their grades up.\n\nOne thing she really likes is her part-time job in a restaurant. Her grandparents offered to pay her whatever she makes there if she quit the job and focused on studying but she turned that offer down. I asked her how she thought the college would set her up for internships, and she told me she has already had great internships. She was talking about something she did briefly as a sophomore that I agree would have been very impressive, but she quit after a short time.\n\nIf she wants to pick a school to be an athlete, that's her choice, but it feels like she is not getting the right information. Her dad says he \"wants to let her make her own mistakes\" (he doesn't want to repeat what his father did - drove him hard and he just started drinking and failed out of college.) Her mom is convinced it will be cheaper for her to go away to this college than to more-selective SUNYs.\n\nI know 17-year-olds labor under a lot of delusions, but boxing yourself into going to a school that won't be a challenge and expecting to have a career because you were an athlete seems particularly off even for that age. (I understand that there may be depression or other mental health issues coming into play here that I don't know about...)",

      "text": ">She told me that she expects to get a leg up getting jobs because people are impressed by athletes who keep their grades up.\n\nFor what it's worth, my wife's wealthy uncle specifically tries to hire former athletes.  He feels athletic achievement signals certain traits that translate into more productive employees.  Though, I grant that's he's weird and that isn't very common.\n\nIf  she can get a free ride on the basis of her skill at field hockey then, hey, more power to her.  There's something to be said for taking the money.\n\nThat said, she should definitely apply for scholarships if they're available.  There's no reason not to, even if it's just a backup plan in case her athletic scholarship falls through.\n\nAs for which schools will be a challenge, based on her AP exam scores, I wouldn't assume she won't find SUNY challenging.",

      "text": "Maybe point out that even the less popular SUNYs don\u2019t accept 100% of applicants so to spread her chances apply for a few then if she is accepted she can compare financial packages too. Also she doesn\u2019t have to declare the AP test results. Her grades from her class work will be on her transcript but declaring the 1, 2, 3 etc is completely optional. She\u2019s better placed not to report them given her strong SAT",

      "text": "I would recommend looking at some of the top schools for international business - I just looked at the US news rankings here:\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-international\n \nAnd it seems like the schools on this list really vary in their acceptance rates so there are some somewhat less competitive ones. If she is really good at field hockey, even if she doesn\u2019t end up playing in college that can help her on her college apps because it shows commitment to an extracurricular. \n\nIdk what to say to her to get her to expand her options but shell probably really enjoy being in a program with other motivated kids who share her interests, because if I had to guess, her current high school doesn\u2019t have a ton of opportunities for kids with her interests and isn\u2019t a very competitive environment which would understandably deter a lot of students. Just tell her you believe in her and want her to have all the opportunities possible.\n\nI also know that the website collegevine has a lot of livestreams on how to fill out applications and other application-related topics which she might want to watch.\n\nGood luck to your niece! And I am also only a junior in high school so take what I say with a grain of salt. Lol",
