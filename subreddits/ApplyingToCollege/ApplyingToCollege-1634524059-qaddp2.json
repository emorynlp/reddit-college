      "text": "As an in-state resident, UTD will be much cheaper for you, so it does make sense financially... UTD is also located in the larger DFW area, so there will be a lot of opportunities for jobs and internships in the area - once you're a student there, you'll have access to the same recruitment services, so being a transfer student shouldn't have an impact on that.",

      "text": "Do you lose out on earning potential? Yes. Penn State has a median earning for the category: computer and information sciences around 11k more than UT Dallas two years after graduation. However it just means that you would have to be more active, working to find internships and the data might be a bit skewed because UT Dallas has like 4x the graduates. Just make sure to contact the career center and try to get internships if you make the transfer.\n\nSource: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare/?toggle%3Dfos%26s%3D147767%26s%3D145637%26fos%3D214777.1101.3%26fos%3D228787.1101.3",

Have met tons of friends who have 80k to 120k job offers during their finals semesters. On the other hand  have also met a ton of people who do not want to work to get their first internship because its hard. My only advice to everyone reading is, it really does not matter what school you go to. If it is a reputed university, the job offers you get will reflect the amount of work you put into it.",
