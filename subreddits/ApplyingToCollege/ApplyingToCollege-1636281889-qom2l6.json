  "text": "Sorry for the like 1500th question on this topic but even after reading the two recent UC posts and the UC A-G course guide, I'm still confused on whether or not I meet the requirements. \n\n* ***A:*** If I have not taken any US History courses, am I automatically barred from applying or acceptance? My school only offers two US History classes, APUSH or a non-AP US history class, neither of which I have taken. I've taken AP World History and in 9th grade we had to take a course called \"Humanities\" which covered world history and English (so it was divided into two sections). In 11th grade, I took a business class for my Social science course. Because none of these are US history or US government, does that mean that I don't fulfill the requirements?\n* ***G:*** If I have not taken any of the AP courses or SAT subject tests listed out in the drop-down menu under G, does that mean that that requirement is unfulfilled? I was thinking that any of the courses that I've taken that haven't been used to fulfill the A-F requirements (for example, i've taken 7 math courses between 7th grade and now and C says it only needs 3, or the aforementioned business class, or the 3 other years of fine arts i've taken beyond the 1 year needed for F) but none of these fall under the categories that the \"exams and coursework\" section cover. Does that mean that I don't fulfill G either?\n* What would **health** and **religion** classes fall under? I know that PE isn't counted towards any of these, but I think religion classes are still academic, aren't they? So I have 1 semester of health and 3 semesters of religion.",

      "text": "1/ As an international applicant from an non-US school, you are not required to have  US history. But in its place, they require a year of history if your country/region. So a European history course would count for an applicant from Denmark; a Chinese history course would not.\n\n2/ G requirements are any academic courses not covered in a-f. Computer Science, economics, psychology are examples. Health and PE are non A-G  courses. Religion is usually not an A-G course, with narrow exceptions. World Religions would generally count as a G course; any course with Jesus in its title, or simply titled \"Religion,\" would not.",
