  "title:": "Why do people have to stigmatize rooming with a gay guy?",
  "text": "\nI (straight) decided to room with a gay guy because he seemed pretty cool. He told me that he has a boyfriend which made me figure out he\u2019s gay (I had a little hint before tbh because of his pics) and it didn\u2019t even matter to me and as soon as he knew I didn\u2019t have any problems with it we mutually decided to room together. So I was facetiming my friends and told them about finding a roommate. So one of them just asked his name and started stalking his insta and figured out he\u2019s gay and started making fun of me. Like how can you live with someone who is attracted to you? And like then they started making gay jokes on me. I was like ffs he\u2019s just another guy and it\u2019s 2020 I thought we were over this medieval mindset.",

When they sputter, tell them to shove their homophobia straight up their ass and find out how fun taking it up the ass can really be. \n\nHomophobes deserve no mercy in 2020. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m deeply sorry to any and every straight person I\u2019ve offended with this. You aren\u2019t that cute to make any and all gay people attracted to you, and I know that must trouble you greatly. I understand that you might think this is \u201ccringe\u201d but in reality, gay people constantly get treated this way and some of us would greatly appreciate it if you \u201callies\u201d would actually step up and do/say something about it instead of \u201chey that\u2019s not cool\u201d and then dropping it. I have no tolerance for bigotry, and in 2020, this is what homophobia looks like.

I get there\u2019s a stigmatization against gay men with how some fetishize straight men but that\u2019s such a small percentage of the community.
