  "title:": "How Coronavirus Might Impact Admissions: a post by a former UChicago/Berkeley admissions reader",
  "text": "Many of you might *not* know me, as life circumstances led me to being pretty dormant on Reddit this past admissions cycle (sorry about that). But I'm Marcella (also known as Novembrr), a former admissions reader at UChicago and Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, and a college admissions consultant.\n\nNaturally, I think many of you are worrying about how coronavirus might impact college admissions. I don't know for certain, as nothing is known for certain right now, but here are some of my thoughts.\n\n[Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19wJZekxpewDQmApULkvZRBpBwcnd5gZlZF2SEU2WQD8/htmlview) of all universities closed at the moment. \n\n**For high school seniors and other applicants awaiting decisions:**\n\n* Early to mid March is the season for admissions committee meetings. With universities closing their doors, it is probable that some universities' committee meetings were impacted, and I imagine many continued to work online. It is possible that some universities will be late in releasing admissions decisions this year. I am part of numerous online channels for admissions professionals, and have heard no official word regarding postponed decision dates. Be prepared for them to happen, however; if they do, I imagine the May 1st deposit date could get pushed back. Note: See comments for more opinions/details.\n\n* As you all know, admitted student days are being cancelled or taken online. You can also find virtual tours on [CampusReel](https://www.campusreel.org/). If you do not have access to the internet at home, and thereby cannot make an educated decision about where you will attend college, consider reaching out to the co-leaders of the National Association for College Admission Counseling's [rural and small town special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/rural-and-small-town/). Andrew Moe of Swarthmore is leading an initiative to share information with students offline. Even if you aren't from a rural area but are otherwise impacted by a lack of internet access, please contact Andrew. You could alternatively reach out to the leaders of the [special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/) with which you most closely align to ask for help. I also know the irony of telling you to email someone about your lack of internet access :/\n\n* If your family cannot afford to make a deposit to a university due to economic strain as a result of Covid-19 (or any other reason, for that matter), email the university to outline your family's circumstances and ask for an extension on the deposit deadline or reduction in deposit amount. \n\n* If your grades suffer during this time (because of illness, financial instability, stress, etc.) and you are worried about being rescinded, write an email to the universities to which you're considering depositing (after you've been admitted) and provide them with context into your situation. No, this is not my permission to slack off, but don't overly stress about a situation that is outside your control.\n\n* AP exams might be cancelled, which can unfortunately impact course credit in college. If your exam is cancelled, consider a) asking for a refund on any $ paid to College Board to register for those exams, and b) reaching out to the university at which you enroll to see if your grade in the class will confer any credit, in lieu of the AP exam score. \n\n**For younger students:**\n\n* You can check for SAT test site cancellations [here](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/test-center-closings). This list is slow to update, so please check individually with your test center. \n\n* Do not panic if your SAT is cancelled; my hunch is more and more schools will go test optional in the year or two to come to accommodate for students impacted by Covid-19 test cancellations. At the very least, you can write an additional information statement on your college apps that outline how your test results were impacted by Covid-19. \n\n* As a safeguard, I recommend that juniors (without test scores OR with test scores lower than their goal) investigate [this list of test optional universities](https://www.fairtest.org/university/optional) and add at least one to their college lists.\n\n* Do not stress about visiting colleges to demonstrate interest. You can investigate whether a university even considers demonstrated interest in the admissions process by looking at their [common data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/wiki/common_data_sets). Once you're in a university's common data set, control + F for \"Level of applicant\u2019s interest\" and you'll have your answer as to whether or not they even factor it into admissions decisions. Keep in mind, too, that there are other ways to demonstrate interest! Some colleagues at College Coach wrote this [helpful guide](https://blog.getintocollege.com/coronavirus-and-college-admissions-demonstrating-interest-without-visiting-campus/). At the very least, you can write an additional information statement for the university in question, describing how your plans to visit campus had to be cancelled. \n\n* You can check out the aforementioned CampusReel for campus tours, but many universities have announced that they are working on recording their own virtual tours and information sessions online, so check universities' admissions websites regularly for those resources. I've also heard that some universities are doing regular Zoom/Facebook Live info session/Q&As, so consider registering for something virtual. \n\n* Be prepared for summer programs to be cancelled. If they are, if you remain quarantined through the summer, or if you cannot or will not pay for expensive summer programs, consider taking free online courses through Coursera, EdX, MIT's OpenCourseware and other online sources. Reading, tinkering with electronics, perfecting a hobby, etc. are all reasonable summer activities. \n\n* If you were selected to compete in some prestigious competition or attend some special program or event, and can no longer do so, you can include in your honors/awards section on college apps that you were selected/nominated for the award/competition/event, and/or provide that information in an additional information statement. \n\n* AP exams might be cancelled. If they are, and aren't rescheduled for a later date this calendar year, consider signing up to take the exam *next* year. Like mentioned above, when you ultimately deposit to attend a university, you can also contact them to see if your grade in the AP class can confer credit. Would also be worth mentioning in your additional info statement in college applications that you were unable to take the official exam but practice exams had you scoring XYZ.\n\n* For international applicants, the TOEFL might be headed [online, at home](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/03/10/ets-plans-toefl-home-coronavirus-affected-countries).\n\n* Unfortunately, colleges might take massive hits to their budgets and could rebound by seeking to fill incoming classes with more full-pay applicants. If you can pay in full, great. If you can't, consider broadening your list to include need blind institutions and universities with higher acceptance rates at which you will qualify for large scholarships. My colleague over at My Kid's College Choice sells a [list of merit-based scholarships](https://www.mykidscollegechoice.com/full-scholarship-list/) at universities. I don't know her personally, but I've seen the list and it's fantastic.\n\n**And for students in college/transfer applicants:**\n\n* If classes are cancelled, dorms are closed, and you are unable to go home (you are an international student, you cannot afford to return home, home is not a safe place for you, etc.), please consider reaching out to your alumni association. Many alumni are rallying around current students to offer temporary housing, rides, food, storage, etc.\n\n* If you applied to transfer and your mid-term grade reports are impacted by college closings, please contact the institutions to which you applied to ask for extensions/alternate options. If you have to return abroad, your timezone conflicts with the timezone in which your classes are offered online, and your grades suffer as a result, write a short extenuating circumstances essay and share that with those institutions, as well. On my online channels, I've seen multiple institutions pledge to accommodate transfer applicants.\n\n* Updated to add: I just heard that the U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program has determined that, for students on F-1 visas, having to head home due to your university's closure will not be considered a violation of your F-1 visa. When the university resumes face-to-face classes, all F-1 students will be expected to return to classes. Please double check that information, as it's new to me!\n\n**Final thoughts**:\n\nI will try to update this post as I see more information come in regarding how Covid-19 will impact applicants and colleges. If I find any of this information to be outdated or incorrect, I'll delete those instances. \n\nAt the end of the day, I want you to stay safe and healthy; avoid situations that will put you, your family, friends or neighbors in harm's way; and avoid stressing about situations out of your control. As the parent of a medically-fragile kid, I worry about what's to come for our families and my heart aches for those already impacted. If all you brilliant pre-med kids can become epidemiologists, that would be great!",

Many of your parents are at risk of losing jobs, taking losses on investments, receiving high medical bills, or generally not being able to afford what they thought they could afford even a month ago.\n\nWhen you get your acceptances, discuss the financial aid packages with your parents. Ask them to be realistic. Be kind to them even if the results of your conversations are disappointing. You can file financial aid appeals, but not every college will be able to adjust.\n\nIt would be a good idea to look into community college as a backup option and see if it is right for you. I encourage everyone without a full ride to do that no matter what state the economy is in.",

If one of them does, other might follow.\n\nThat said, colleges will want to know as best they can, as early as they can, what next Fall's class will look like.  They would want to know if they need to go to the waitlist as soon as possible, but if the deposit deadline is changed the uncertainty will be huge. All this to say, they would need a good rationale for extending the deadline.  \n\nAre there rationales?  Sure!\n\nThe fact that students may be missing admit day programs and other chances to visit before making a decision is difficult.  However, only time will tell if extending the deadline would change that.  \n\nMost colleges still have functional operations for processing financial aid and the like, so students should not be awaiting decisions on that.  \n\nInternational students may have the most questions about travel restrictions and general safety, plus complications around being able to get visas processed.  They may the group who most needs more time.",

If some universities do have to push back dates and others don't, I'd reach out to the universities who haven't pushed back dates to ask for extensions, if that impacts where you might deposit. It's also okay to deposit to one school, get into another, and email the original school to withdraw your spot if you need to do so. In that instance, definitely withdraw your original spot, and understand that you might lose the $ you deposited.",

More schools need to get on board, but haven\u2019t yet.\n\nMy friend has actually made and published a petition for this and will be personally reaching out to as many colleges and universities as possible, telling them to follow the lead of other schools and push their date to June 1st too. But she needs more support to be taken seriously and get a valid response. \n\nIf you have time, PLEASE sign and share with as many people as possible. We can make a change if we collectively voice our opinions, and we\u2019ll provide a basis for my friend to properly communicate with these schools.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/u-s-colleges-universities-postpone-college-decision-day-because-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/dashboard",
