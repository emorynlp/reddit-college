  "title:": "Adjusted Gross Income for noncitizen parents",
  "text": "My parents are Indian citizens and filed Indian tax returns for 2020. The concept of adjusted gross income isn't a thing over here, so what should I put down as their AGI in the FAFSA? All the FSA website says about noncitizen parents is to convert amounts on foreign tax returns into US dollars. I tried using net income on my parents' tax returns but it includes pretty much all sources of income and doesn't account for any kind of expenditure whatsoever, and would result in an value of about 100k USD, which is well beyond any measure of ridiculous for my financial situation. Please help I'm so confused",
