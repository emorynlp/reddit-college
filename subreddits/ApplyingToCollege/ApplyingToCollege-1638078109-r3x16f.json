  "title:": "what do you think is a better topic for UC PIQ 8?",
  "text": "i came up with two things (pretty much it\u2019s asking what else aside from what u mentioned in ur app makes u stand out for UC): \n\nthe first is that i like to self-study Japanese on my own but i live in a rural town where no one speaks these languages and there\u2019s no in person classes so going to a UC where it\u2019s more diverse and likely to have folks who speak this language would probably enrich my language learning skills and practice speaking. (i briefly mentioned self-studying japanese in an EC but i didn\u2019t go too in depth, idk if i should add the self-study as a whole other EC)\n\nthe second is that i live in the middle of nowhere with run-down roads and i love skateboarding so it\u2019s really hard to practice unless i\u2019m near my school campus. i made my first real friendships thru skating and i\u2019m excited to see where it takes me. so going to a UC would allow me to network with a larger skate community and have more skate area to pursue something i genuinely love. (i didn\u2019t mention this in my app at all yet).",

      "text": "If you already talked about academics in another piq or if its evident with your grades...I'd say go for the second topic. It seems uncommon, which will make you stand out, and because you seem really passionate about it, it will show in your writing. The UCs love passion! However, I think this topic might fit into the creativity piq or greatest talent (correct me if I'm wrong and the piq you want to write will fit in neither)",
