  "title:": "Gap Year Student: School Report vs Final Grade",
  "text": "Hi. I\u2019m a gap year international student applying for Fall 2022. \n\nDue to the nature of my school, we have a really high grade deflation, so my school report and ranking performance isn\u2019t that great (I did IB, so I got mostly 5s with occasional 6s and 7s). But for final IB, I got 6s and 7s. \n\nWhich do you think the AOs will look at? My school performance and predicted grades, or my final IB scores? Furthermore, do you think they care about TOK and EE? I did very well in those two, but I don\u2019t know how much schools actually care about them.\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

          "text": "Hi! Thanks for your response. I guess hopefully they\u2019ll see the improvement from my school performance to the final exams. TOK and EE are like compulsory \u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201cresearch paper\u201d, respectively, components of IB. You need to pass them to get your diploma. They give you additional 3 points if you get an A in both.",
