  "title:": "Can I use a school-specific fee waiver even if the school hasn't likely provided it to me?",
  "text": "Context: RIT usually sends out the fee waiver \"Brick City App\" in their mailing list. Problem is that I didn't think of applying there until a month or so ago, so I probably have deleted an email with the fee waiver even if I had gotten it. \n\nI'm kind of daunted because they say this: Do you intend to use one of these school-specific fee waivers? *Verification will be required.*\n\nI don't have any verification? What should I do?",
