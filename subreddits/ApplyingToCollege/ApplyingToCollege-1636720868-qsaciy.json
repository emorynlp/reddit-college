  "text": "Hey all, I was just curious about this as I recently read somewhere that around 70 to 80% of applicants, to let's say harvard, are qualified. Idk tho this number seemed kinda high.\n\nHow many percent would you estimate are actually competitive? Like 1500+ with 4.0s?",

      "text": "One of the admissions lawsuit documents indicated that Harvard places this number at around 85%.  Yale's admissions website lists it as 75%.  So I think it's pretty safe to say it's in that range.  This isn't surprising because the education at most colleges isn't that different.  Top schools don't teach a different calculus than community colleges.  In fact, if you look at the labor market for professors, you'll see quickly that quality is abundant because there are so few professor job openings compared to the number of qualified applicants.  \n\nYou don't need a 1500 to be considered \"competitive\" nor do you need a 4.0.  Top colleges could dip quite a bit below that and still bring in people who would be fully capable of doing the work and graduating with strong grades.",
