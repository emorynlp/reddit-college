And now I feel like I have to do it all again, on top of all the other stressful shit I have going on this year. I know I should be grateful to have the choice, but honestly at this point I'm just tired\n\nEDIT: I've calmed down. Like I pointed out to another commenter, I've been dealing with some other (personal) stuff recently so this just put me over the edge. I am now weighing my options more carefully and I can't tell you how grateful I am to have this choice",
