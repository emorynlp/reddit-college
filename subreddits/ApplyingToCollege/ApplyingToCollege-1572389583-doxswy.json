You don't realize how much easier it is to learn when you're actually learning things you want to learn (once you get geneds out of the way) also the party scene is fantastic, but with the frat hazings a lot of my friends are worried that the administration is going to crack down on it soon but as long as you make friends with people who have a car (which is important bc pennstate is literally in the middle of nowhere)  you should be fine haha, once again good luck!",
