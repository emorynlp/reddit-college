  "text": "I am a transfer student applying to a U.C. and I am not sure what to put for my housing situation. I am moving in with a close family friend and my parents are not going to financially support me anymore. This person also does not contribute either for the most part; I just got a new job and I'm going to be paying for everything for the most part. What do I put since nobody is my legal guardian anymore and my parents don't claim me on tax returns or financially contribute?",
