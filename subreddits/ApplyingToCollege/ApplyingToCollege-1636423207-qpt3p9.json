  "text": "So I\u2019m looking for some advice. My mom and I are quite close, but lately it\u2019s been hard to talk to her about college. I\u2019m looking at a school that\u2019s around 9 hours away.\n\nI really like this school. I haven\u2019t felt drawn to a school quite like it yet. It hits SO many of my target boxes for a college and I know it would be an awesome fit for me academic-wise.\n\nHowever, my mom keeps discouraging me going. She doesn\u2019t \u201csee me there\u201d and keep saying I \u201cwon\u2019t end up there\u201d. It\u2019s really getting me down & honestly making me feel guilty for wanting to go.\n\nSo should I start looking into different colleges? I feel really held back by the fact that she doesn\u2019t want me going & her doubts are starting to instill themselves in my own brain.",

      "text": "First off and foremost, this is about 4 years of YOUR life. Seeing as though you are college-age, it's time to start your life.\n\n9 hours away isn't actually very far if you think about it. If this is the only place you're applying to, I'd look into other colleges to apply to as well regardless, maybe one closer to your mom to get her off your back so much and also because it's good to have options (especially financially). \n\nYou said you and your mom are close so maybe having a conversation with her (without letting her dominate it and get in your head more) would be good to let her know how much this college means to you and how much she means to you and set some boundaries. Let her feel heard but make sure it's established that you are applying to the school and that it's your life at the end of the day.",

      "text": "This is just my opinion! But I think 9 hours away isnt far enough! College is the most crucial time to starting your life. And too many people get stuck in a myopic rut by staying close to home and then going back immediately. You need to go somewhere new and exciting, and figure out who you are and what you want out of life. Then if you decide being in your home town  close to family is where you want to be. Do it! But make that decision for you! Not anyone else \ud83d\udc9e",

I would recommend you to apply for multiple colleges, including the one you really like and a few others of varying difficulties (but  within a reasonable range) not only to get your mom off your back, but also to have some back up plans because there's no guaranteed admission in 99.9% of this whole process. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Best of luck!",

So when my son went 1,000 and my daughter 3,000 it was a given. hopefully, by that time, we had raised them to be able to handle their lives and respected the people they had grown to be. Not gonna talk about the next two boys...but eventually, the \"baby\" volunteered for the Peace Corps with two assignments in Western Africa. Didn't worry about him either. Having said all this, families are very different, cultures are very different...both having their expectations and disillusions. I just think it will be awful for you to set your hopes on a school and be unable to attend in the end. Best of Luck!",
