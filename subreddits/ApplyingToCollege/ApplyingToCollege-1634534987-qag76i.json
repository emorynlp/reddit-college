  "text": "So I'm International (Indian) and my school only reports class rank within a particular section (I'm in section S2 for example), where there are about 25 students in each. But I think class rank is to be reported taking the entire batch in consideration. So what should I do? \nShould I just put the class size as the number of students in my section? ( I don't wanna leave it blank because my rank is 1 in my section)",
