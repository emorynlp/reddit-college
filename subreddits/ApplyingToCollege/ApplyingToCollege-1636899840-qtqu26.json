  "text": "ok so sat percentiles obv shot up last year since only higher scores are being sent in by students, and im sure colleges are aware of that. but are AOs also going to be increasing their cutoffs/ parameters for sat scores, simply bc those who are submitting scores, are submitting higher scores?\n\nim particularly worried bc test optional policies note that _not_ sending a score _won\u2019t_ disadvantage you, but that still leaves room for sending a score to advantage you (ie sending a score may advantage you even if not sending one won\u2019t disadvantage you)",

If you have a 1600 then, in most cases, you disadvantage yourself by not submitting that score.\n\nThere is some range of scores where \\*not\\* submitting \\*disadvantages\\* most students.\n\nBelow that is some range of scores where, for most students, submitting neither helps nor harms.\n\nBelow that is some range of scores where submitting would actually disadvantage most students.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody knows the dividing lines are between these ranges.",

Hundreds of schools were test optional long before COVID, and they've been evaluating applications like this for a long time.",

For instance, consider students who take a practice test and do poorly.  They may simply decide not to take an official test at all, since it's no longer necessary in order for them to realize their educational goals.  Over time, this may have the effect of filtering out weaker test-takers.",
