  "text": "Hi everyone! I am interested in applying to US Colleges as an international applicant.\n\nHere are some desired characteristics I have in a school\n\nVibes: Entrepreneurial / Risk-taking / Innovative.\n(My primary motivation in applying to US Colleges is because I am truly passionate about tech & entrepreneurship. I hope the US Colleges mentioned have a entrepreneurial culture!)\n\nLocation: I live in Singapore so I'm more used to the yearly summer temperature, other than this, I don't think I have a strong preference. (Definitely not a make or break though!)\n\nSchool Size: No strong preference! But I would really prefer if the class size is small. i.e. instead of 200 students in a class, I think somewhere between 20-40 students would be good? \n\nMajor: Computer Science / Information Systems\n\nFinancial Aid: I'd probably need full aid because I genuinely doubt I can afford to pay any significant amount - may consider scholarship outside of school\n(Currently i'm researching available scholarship locally and internationally so if there's any good ones please let me know too!)\n\nMy Stats\n- High School Diploma in Cybersecurity (GPA 3.99/4.0)\n(Although I studied cybersecurity, I would consider myself as a general tech enthusiast as i dabbled with software engineering, security researching, artifical intelligence etc.)\n- Several national awards + valedictorian\n- 4 tech internship/research project experience\n- Founder of a School Club + held leadership position in some other\n- Founded a few small businesses throughout middle sch and high sch\n- SAT: Mid 1400 (But I plan to retake for sure!)\n\nCurrently I'm considering Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. (UC Berkeley too but they don't provide aid for international students \ud83d\ude22)\n\nWould love to hear if there are any other college suggestion from others!",
