Can't seem to find any virtual ones on LinkedIn because they don't really want people under the age of 18 to be working with them. Any suggestions or leads? Parents are average middle class people with no friends that can really help.",

However, most intern recruitment cycles are during the vacations so it is a pretty tough job to find one now but since you're a senior, you must be feeling the overwhelming pressure of deadlines too, I guess? I worked at FamPay, and from what I know they have really great internships for H.S students + it's like the next big thing in India, SO FUCKING PROUD TO BE ON THE FIRST FEW BATCHES OF INTERNS!! Anyways, I do have this chrome extension that is invite only that'll provide you with a lot of internship applications :) just gimme your email in my DM and I'll forward it to you",
