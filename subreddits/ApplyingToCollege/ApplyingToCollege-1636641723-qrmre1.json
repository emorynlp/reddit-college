  "text": "hi all, i know that visiting a college can provide some benefit to your chances of acceptance, and I was able to visit a few schools in my local area. i\u2019m planning some visits for schools further away from where i am, but it seems i won\u2019t be able to make it there until after i apply. i\u2019m sure it\u2019s still worth the visit in order to decide if i like the campus, but will i still receive the benefit of visiting to an admissions officer?\nthanks in advance!!",
