  "text": "This hypothetical student can have any test scores, ECs, etc. Go crazy. Only two rules:\n\n1. although the student can be hooked (legacy, recruitable athlete, etc.) they cannot have anything that secures their admission (no parents donating buildings or whatnot) **AND**\n2. no extenuating circumstances. They got this GPA fair and square.",
