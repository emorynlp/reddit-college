  "text": "So my friend and I are starting an investing club. We have some pretty good ideas, like a stock market simulator competition, discussing the latest news in the financial market, writing finance articles that can be published in the school newspaper, and volunteering to teach financial literacy to middle schoolers. But I would love to learn about more innovative ideas!\n\nthanks in advance!",
