  "text": "I feel like I need to spend more time on my essays and EC (write another research/review paper?). I also know if I apply EA, I might not stand out in comparison to other applicants' PERFECTED profiles and my chances of admissions are lower in RD because that's when I am also competing with ivy rejects. How screwed am I?",
