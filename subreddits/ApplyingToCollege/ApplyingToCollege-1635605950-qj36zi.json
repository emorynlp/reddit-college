  "text": "Most of the T20s are private, and I'm trying to major in CS, which a lot of them aren't known for.\n\nI don't qualify for much aid according to the Net Price Calculators, but can't pay the 65K a year half of them will cost, and so I took all of them(except for USC) out of my list. I have good stats(1560, decent gpa) and awards, and my CommonApp essay isn't terrible, so I was hoping to get scholarships from state schools.\n\nI won't be able to go to a t20 unless I get some amount of aid, so my question is, are any of them known to provide aid to kids like me?",

      "text": "Most T20s do not provide merit - right away, cross off all the Ivies, which offer no merit. Some others might offer a limited number of merit scholarships, which are obviously very competitive, though you should look carefully at their scholarship webpages to see if any apply to you (e.g., some may be for very specific situations). What comes to mind: look at the websites for Chicago, Duke, Vandy, WashU, maybe Northwestern. Basically, chances of getting merit to a T20 are tiny, but if you have time and want to spend the app fee, you can always try for a couple.",

Some T20(ish) schools that provide (highly competitive) non-need-based aid:  Duke, Vanderbilt, Rice, WashU, Notre Dame, Emory, Southern Cal, Michigan, Virginia, Wake Forest, North Carolina.\n\nTypically high stats aren't enough to get non-need-based aid at these schools with the exception of USC which has a guaranteed half-tuition scholarship for NMFs.",
