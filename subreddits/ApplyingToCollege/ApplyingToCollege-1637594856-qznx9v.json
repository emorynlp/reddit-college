  "text": "My counselor today asked me if it is compulsory to \"Upload\" a school report.\n\nI am the first one applying to the US in my school and they are not aware of the process and my counselor doesn't know how to prepare a school report and she said the principal won't be able to help much in it since our exams are coming up and they are busy.\n\n(duh, my school sucks)\n\nSo, do we have to upload a school report even if she fills out every section of the profile section? Like. She can fill the profile out but preparing a digital report is something I doubt she will do. So, can I leave it?\n\nThe boxes without the asterisk can be left out, right? It won't be any issue later, yes?",

      "text": "int here! imo it'd be more prudent uploading one to give AOs a clearer picture what your high school is like\u2014which types of classes are offered, what's the school community, course rigor, ECs available etc. as int applicants, even our regional reader might not know a thing about our schools. this is, ofc, based purely on my assumptions.\n\nfaced the same dilemma as you so i wrote the school profile myself and had it fact-checked and verified by them.",

          "text": "Could you please advise me on how you wrote the school profile? I don't think my counselor would be interested in spending a little time on this (my school and its counselor really suck) for me. So, if you could share with me a draft or a copy of your school report to which I could refer to and prepare one for myself, it would be of great help.",
