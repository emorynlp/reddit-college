  "text": "I find this notion of calling schools T20 and T30s slightly troubling since it creates a wrong Idea what this actually means IMO.\n\nIf we look at something like UIUC, which most people (with little knowledge of the admissions process)  wouldn\u2019t consider a T20.\nUIUC is a top 5 CS school, and so are GATech, UT at Austin, Purdue (Atleast top-10) etc.\n\nIs this the right way to think or is there more to this ???\n\n(I am an international student and upon research the above is what I have concluded is the right way to think about unis. It helps me keep my goal realistic and also manage finances better, since these unis are ranked better and cost less than some conventional \u201cT-20\u201d schools)",

      "text": "It\u2019s just a shorthand for high quality, highly competitive schools. There are dozens of \u201ctop school\u201d rankings. I would wager that none have the same top 20 schools. And when you get into specific majors, there are different \u201ctop\u201c schools.\n\nIf you asked everyone here their top 20 schools, you\u2019d probably get 30-40 schools on at least one list.\n\n\u201dOverall\u201d lists are mostly meaningles, IMO, as no one goes to a school for an \u201coverall\u201d degree. Your Purdue and UIUC examples are good ones. They are undoubtedly top 20 CS programs and not top 20 \u201doverall\u201c schools.",
