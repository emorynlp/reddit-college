  "text": "Hi again, I'm a CBSE student and I need to get my marksheet attested by the board/council. But I heard I can also get it attested by a gazetted officer, servant of the government. Is it fine if a Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force attests the copy of my 10th mark sheet? (Reaching out to the board will be a very long process and may take months). This seems to be the best option according to me. Any suggestions?",
