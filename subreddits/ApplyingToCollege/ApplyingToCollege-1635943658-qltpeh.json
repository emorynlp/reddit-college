  "text": "I often see people asking if their scores are competitive for T20s so I'd like to make a similar question. If you could give me some names it would be nice. I already have my college list, of course, but I'm open to changes in it.",

If you are asking about being at the average, then look at slightly higher-ranked schools, into the 40s and 30s.",
