  "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nSo currently I am a Life scout, 1 rank from Eagle Scout. I have already finished my project and now am only working on the application side of thing before I go the the Eagle Board for my final review. I should get my rank in 1-2 months. However, the Early action deadline is November 1st. \n\nShould I put that I am a Life scout or an Eagle Scout?",
