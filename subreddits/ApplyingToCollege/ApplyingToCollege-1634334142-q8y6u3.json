  "text": "Hi,\n\nFor those of you who did independent study/homeschooling for a period of HS, and are now in UC colleges: I wanted to ask y'all: do you think being an independent study student affected ur college admissions? Also, how were your other metrics like (EC's, GPA, essays, etc)?",

Are you an international student?\n\nGPA weighs most heavily for UC admission [https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/](https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/)\n\nPSA, in case it's relevant: public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
