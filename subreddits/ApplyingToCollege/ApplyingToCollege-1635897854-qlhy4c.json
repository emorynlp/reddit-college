  "text": "I have 3 recs. 1 is from my guidance counselor, and is probably solid. Of my 2 teacher recs, 1 is really strong and the other is average. Of the schools I applied to last night, the required teacher recs are:\n\n0 required, 3 optional\n\n0 required, 1 optional\n\n1 required, 1 optional\n\n2 required\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I wrong in thinking that I should just send the stronger of my two letters to all but the last school?\n\nOr is the \"optional\" not so optional? I really don't know, but I need to make a decision and send my recs.",

If a school requires at least one, then the counselor rec is usually one of them.\n\nIf I were you, I'd send the counselor and the strong teacher recs to all the schools except the second one. For the second one, make sure the optional one isn't the counselor rec, and if it isn't, send the strong teacher rec.",
