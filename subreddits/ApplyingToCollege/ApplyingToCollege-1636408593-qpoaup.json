  "text": "Hey, I am applying to Brown University for Biophysics/Physics. I got an A in the class but a 4 on the AP Physics 1 exam. Should I submit the 4? My friend told me not to because it would look bad since I got a 4 for a test based on my desired major. What are your thoughts?",

What are your thoughts?\n\nDon't take advice from friends who have not been through the admissions process.\n\nIn general, I see no reason to not list a 4, particularly on an exam that 60% get a 1 or 2. Maybe if you had 8 other exams that were all 5's, I'd omit, but probably not otherwise.",
