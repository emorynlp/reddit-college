I'm 5'8, 200 lbs man, and *I* felt unsafe.\n\nEvery university has a police staff. It's sad that we need it but good that we have it. Most police I saw at other campuses were smiley. You saw them redirect construction and maybe give out a ticket. These cops had a look in their eyes, they were looking for a body, you could just tell that's what they expected on the job. What's worse, one of the blue light buttons looked *used*. I'm not exaggerating. Plus it's in the middle of Baltimore and I'll be honest, it isn't St. Louis but I'd call it a hellhole.",

I don't understand who these people are that are saying it isn't BAD.\n\nThe front desk staff at the nicest nearby hotel had a face tattoo (which is their prerogative, just weird for a nicer hotel) On the drive up from BWI there were homeless and what I'm assuming to be meth-heads approaching cars as we sat at red lights - in the middle of a summer day.  The campus police were EVERYWHERE, which I've never seen before in those numbers around a college , but they were just kinda...standing...there.\n\nAnd perhaps the weirdest thing was that there's not much around campus, in terms of restaurants etc. We wanted to grab a bite to eat and there wasn't anything near us (northern end of campus) and we didn't feel safe  (in the evening) walking to south end where we had seen a Subway and few other restaurants. We ended up grabbing a slice of pizza at the Hopkins Deli and the shelves were mostly empty and there was standing water in some of the aisles.\n\nI think that's my biggest problem. Campus itself was nice, but there didn't seem to be any safe infrastructure immediately surrounding campus. Where do ALL of those people go to grab a snack or groceries off campus? Venture farther off-campus where there aren't campus police? No freaking way.  I'm hoping my kid doesn't get in. I let her apply, barely, just to see what happens but I won't sleep for 4 years if she's there.\n\nSeriously, if you are reading this and you haven't visited, please visit first. I'm somewhat city savvy, no problem walking around in NYC and I've sat in traffic on the Cross Bronx where people clean your windshield with dirty water and newspaper and scream at you to pay them for it. That was OK. Baltimore is NOT OK",
