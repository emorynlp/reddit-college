I think most students will be accepted  with 4 or more years of both \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen here over the years a number of stem kids accepted without that fourth year of language \n\nAnd  my daughter was accepted to a bunch of highly rejective schools without a fourth year of science as a humanities major. She did have highest level of math and had taken ap bio, ap chem, and ap physics.  \n\nIf this kid were a junior I\u2019d say take the science. No questions asked. \n\nAs a senior is it enough of a reason why they shouldn\u2019t apply? Probably not. Will it be the one reason they aren\u2019t accepted? Probably not \u2014 unless they\u2019re a stem major.\n\nEdit \u2014 hmmm maybe I just assumed they are a senior\n\nOP, if you\u2019re a junior, take the science senior year.",
