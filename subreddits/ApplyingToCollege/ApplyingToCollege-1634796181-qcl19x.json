  "text": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m applying Ed to Cornell for global and public health studies. I recently planned on applying to the College of Agriculture and it is test blind which is an advantage for me with my lower test score. However I noticed that Human Ecology has the same major, but it\u2019s test optional not blind but it tends to have much higher acceptance rates than Agriculture. Should I go test blind at the tougher CALS or test optional in Human Ecology?",

      "text": "I would say CALS because if you apply test optional to HumEc it may indicate that you\u2019re hiding your scores in a sense? However still think about what courses outside of your major you would like to take to really determine your fit. Take my advice as a grain of sand tho I\u2019m also a senior here ;)))",
