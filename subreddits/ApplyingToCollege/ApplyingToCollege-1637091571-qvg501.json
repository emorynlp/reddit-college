  "text": "I applied for this university that has rolling admissions. It is one of my top choices and the deadline is Dec 1. I have already applied and done the proper paper work. Yesterday I wanted to know the status of my application because there was no updates on there website for application status. I emailed them and they called me the next morning and told me that \"They need my Final highschool transcript but theyre gonna make a decision with what they have\" I graduated highschool but I dropped out of early college so thats what has confused all the schools I have applied to so far. Will not having my final transcript affect there decision, I plan on getting through to my counselors to send it to the universities regardless but did this call solidify a no from them?",
