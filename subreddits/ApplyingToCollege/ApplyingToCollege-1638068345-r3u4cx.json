  "title:": "How Creative is TOO Creative? (UC PIQ help)",
  "text": "So I'm on my third PIQ and I feel so conflicted. I keep hearing everyone say that the UCs don't want \"style\" or \"creativity,\" they just want you to get to the point. But I feel like this goes against every piece of writing advice I've ever been taught. Like, no dialogue? No imagery? No storytelling? I can understand avoiding gimmicky stuff (poems, distracting metaphors, etc.), but does that mean I can't use ANY style or narrative elements at all? It just feels... wrong.\n\nI'm actively trying to be straightforward and concise in my responses with elements of my personal voice, but something just feels missing? I've tried to make my 2 completed PIQs more engaging by adding a brief hook and some storytelling, but now I'm worried that I've over done it because it seems like EVERYONE is advising against creativity.\n\nAm I overthinking this? Will having too much \"style\" reflect badly on my application? Someone help",

      "text": "Brief hook and some story telling is ok - since it is only 350 words, they don\u2019t want you to waste words building up a scene. Some PIQs like challenges and creativity requires a bit of story telling. Not using the 350 words effectively, UC calls it missed opportunities- they won\u2019t deduct but it won\u2019t add to your score.",
