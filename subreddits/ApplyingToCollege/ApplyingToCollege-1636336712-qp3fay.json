          "text": "Agree. Duke will want to see a more balanced schedule. Does Psych satisfy the 4courses in \u201chistory\u201d? I thought your year had to have the new consumer finance class. Strongly consider 4 courses in foreign language- most of Duke\u2019s \u201ccompetition\u201d will expect you to have 4years. Does your HS send many students to Duke? If so, your counselor can give you general guidance on what a \u2018competitive-successful\u2019 Most Rigorous schedule looks like.",

You're probably screwing yourself over unnecessarily if you don't.\n\n\\-As another commenter said, drop the adobe/excel/word courses. Nobody will take them seriously as honours-level courses outside of your school.\n\n\\-Drop APCSP (completely useless IMO, especially having already taken Python I and II), unless it's a requirement for APCSA at your school\n\n\\-What are \"CTE Internship\" and \"Discrete for Computer Science\"? I'm not super familiar with these.",

I am taking Biology Honors, AP Physics I and AP Physics II which should be 3, unless you mean 2 AP courses.  \n\n\nAs for Foreign language, I will drop the Microsoft Excel classes and take two foreign languages courses in the same year, I already started 9th grade.\n\nI will consider taking AP Chemistry instead of AP Physics II, thanks!\n\nI do want to keep AP Computer Science Principles, since it is the easiest AP class and can be a GPA booster\n\nCTE Internship is basically an internship at a software job, and Discrete for Computer Science is a math course that goes over discrete mathematics like logic, combinatorics, proof, and graph theory",

I'd still recommend taking some form of chemistry, though (whether replacing Phys II or something else) \u2014 schools really prefer to see that you're taking all three sciences.\n\n2) Sounds like a plan.\n\n4) That makes sense; it's probably not super useful intrinsically but it is true that it increases your wGPA.\n\n5) Oh, that makes sense \u2014\u00a0both of those sound good.\n\n(Good luck with everything! I'm honestly quite impressed that you've got your HS schedule planned out this early, and are this clear about what you plan to do.)",
