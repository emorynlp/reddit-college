      "text": "The app's college-specific questions may have a section called Family or Contacts that may ask if any family members were employed by the college.

I guess you could select uncle if the option is there.\n\nIf the great uncle's employment was recent and he is alive, you should be asking him for advice. Assuming that is not the case, it's hard to see how this would help you.",
