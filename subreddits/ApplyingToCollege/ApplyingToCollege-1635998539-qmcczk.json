  "text": "Hey guys, I ED'd the other day, but I realized I underreported the weekly hours on a couple of activities (reported one that's really 7 hrs as 3). I'm kind of freaking out, is this worth emailing admissions about? And would they look down on me/think I'm dumb if I emailed? LOL\n\nThank you",
