  "text": "Hi! I work as a content writer at a non-profit organisation. I have an (sort of) international award in writing and currently I'm working on my own book :3 Hence, I want to add 'writing' in my ECA list.\nAgain, I work in some other organisations too and will include them as 'community service / volunteer work'.  Now should I include my 'content writing work'  in the 'community service/volunteer work'?  Or do I include that in my 'writing' segment? Or both? \nTIA!",
