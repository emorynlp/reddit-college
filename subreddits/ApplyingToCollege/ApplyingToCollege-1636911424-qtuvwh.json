Do you qualify for one of these waivers?\u201d\n\nFirst- I thought there was an option for a free application from Nov. 1-14th and that option is not there anymore.\n\nSecond- since that option is gone that means I don\u2019t qualify for a waiver, but it doesn\u2019t have a \u201cNo i don\u2019t qualify\u201d option and it\u2019s a required question.\n\nSo I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nUPDATE: it\u2019s fixed :)",
