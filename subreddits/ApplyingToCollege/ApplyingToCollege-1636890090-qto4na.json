  "text": "Is the section that asks parents contribution the EFC? Or do colleges calculate EFC based on the complete CSS?  \nAnd should I just write the maximum amount that my parents can pay without loans in the parents contribution part? But if I do that my EFC will be too less.  \nFor context, I am an international student from India and I am planning on taking loans to fund my education. So can I include the amount I will be getting from loans to the parent's contribution section? I'm afraid that I will be rejected because of putting a small number there.",

They are going to calculate your EFC from income and assets and won\u2019t use what the family says they are able to pay. I\u2019m not sure why the schools even ask that question. Good luck!",
