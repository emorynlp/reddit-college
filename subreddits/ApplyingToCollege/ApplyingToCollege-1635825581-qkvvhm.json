If I were you, i might call them tomorrow just to make sure but that\u2019s what I was told. Now you might have to have submitted the srar by nov 1 but probably not counting processing time ig. Also I made a pen state account with the email I used for the common app. I was able to submit my srar without waiting the 30-40 hours it usually takes to get the link. But ya definitely call the admissions office tomorrow",
