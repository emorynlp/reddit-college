  "title:": "2020 APs are simply unfair",
  "text": "Long rant below:\n\n1. **Questions are not equal in difficulty:** The AP tests are not curved, and thus there is a preset number of points necessary for a certain score. That would be okay if the tests were like normal, but when there are tons of different prompts for tons of different students, how can you guarantee equal difficulty? Especially in a problem set with only two problems. How can you say one DBQ is objectively equal in difficulty to another? In my personal experience, the AP Physics 1 test seems to completely vary in difficulty. You have some problems that are straightforward fundamentals and others that are far more complicated. It seems completely unfair, and with the College Board not releasing much information on how different problems will be graded, it honestly makes some students who clearly received more difficult prompts feel left in the dark.\n2. **A 45-minute test is not enough to test 1 year's worth of material**. When you have a test that is in a new environment, with the added stress of submitting your test in the given time, there is such a high chance of making one stupid mistake. When the tests are normal, one stupid mistake is okay because you have the rest of the test to compensate. But when you're tested with such a small number of questions, getting caught on a question/slipping up once or twice can drastically change your score. On top of that, so much is based simply on how lucky you get with your prompt. In all honesty, I am much better at physics than apush, but got a prompt on apush that I was very knowledgable about and got a prompt on physics that I was not as knowledgable about. With such a small test, there is simply just too much variance for it to be an accurate representation of one's knowledge. \n3. **The College Board did not release enough materials in preparation**. The College Board really emphasized their platform, releasing tons of information on how it was going to work and how students should take the test. While this was helpful, it is important to note that some tests this year, notably maths and sciences, were drastically changed. All the College Board did to compensate for this change was to release 2 practice tests online on their YouTube channel, but these tests 1. seemed to be rough estimates of the actual test and not reflect the test much and 2. are simply not enough for students. The College Board consistently writes convoluted questions in efforts to make questions on simple concepts more difficult. When one has experience with these questions, they can get used to the format, but without much practice of the new format, the test felt almost completely blind. \n4. **Foreign students** have to take the tests at ridiculous times. I don't know much about this as I live in America, but it seems that kids in foreign countries have to take the tests either ridiculously early or ridiculously late. \n\nTL;DR Fuck the College Board",

Additionally, I agree that CB can probably tell generally which forms are easier or harder, but that is still subjective. I heavily disagree with \"the collegeboard isn't stupid\", though (take a look at points 2-4 + dinosauce).",

In the AP Calculus exam, I studied for a possible question on Related Rates, Integration by Parts (or integration in general), Optimization or a Differential Equation; instead, the exam tested everything but those things. \nI don't think it's fair to make all students take half-assed tests that do not cover all the material. That was the point of taking 3-hour long exams, to cover all kinds of details, thus allowing those who even fail at some parts to get a good score by acing the rest of the exam.\nNow we just have to get lucky and get an exam that covers whatever we're the best at, smh.",

With a revenue of 1.07 Billion, and having a monopoly on pre-college testing, they could have done better. The first thing they could have done was take more time to come up with a plan. Yeah they pushed back tests, but only barely. Imo, they should have pushed them back to June. Im aware makeup tests are June, but they are just that, makeup tests. Hell, if they had given themselves more time but kept the tests the exact same, they could have prepared more practice material that would actually be representative of the test style. But instead they don\u2019t. And maybe then they would have actually properly tested their testing procedures with handing in and all. Because clearly they didn\u2019t. but yet they try and blame the students for that blunder even though the demo worked fine for almost everyone. I know the saying isn\u2019t always true, but they could have thrown money at the problem and solved it better. I\u2019ve been lucky and been able to submit all of my tests thus far, but I know come makeup time, people will run into the same exact issues because CB will have done nothing to fix the problems simply because they think that with lower testing numbers, the problems won\u2019t happen. And hey if problems do happen, they still get their $94 per test regardless if you get a score",

I feel Calc will be my worst score despite it being my best class. I actually feel Physics will be my best score despite being my worst class! But like you said, my physics prompt was easy because it was fundamentals whereas some of my friends had much more difficult questions which weren\u2019t fundamentals. And one my friends has to retest to calc because it didn\u2019t let her submit and I feel bad because she had an easier test and was confident in her answers. But the biggest point that you made out of all of this was the lack of materials. CB was flaunting how they are providing numerous materials to prepare but yet the materials were not representative of the actual test. The 2 practice tests for Calc said they were representative of the style but not the content. And those 2 practice tests were, Question 1, about A-F or G, and Question 2, A-D. But get to the actual test, and both are A-H. And you really hit the nail on the head when you said about how the questions are so obscure and weirdly worded that you need multitudes of material to understand and get better at them and we simply didn\u2019t get that. I was unable to answer 3 parts of my calc test because i truly had no fucking clue what they were asking for. but yeah NoN-pRoFiT mAcHiNe Go BrRrRrRr",

It is based on analysis of the distribution of scores of *both actual test takers and control college students*. If a test is easier, then you need more frq points for a 5. Different forms are gonna have different score requirements. Simple as that. They will likely account for cheating in the score distribution, and will lean towards passing people who are on the edge.",

Honestly, a 45 min test that was very cumulative for being so short was the best they could have done given the circumstances. Additionally, the college board gave a few practice tests that were specific to each AP exam, and since it was an FRQ test, previous year tests were still good practice. \nI think your only solid point is the one about foreign students.",

On my apush test, I felt fucking awful- got a relatively unfair prompt that I would consider to be more difficult than that of the other prompts given to other people. it just lacks the comprehensiveness of the previous tests that tests on the entire course, not just 1 or 2 units from the course. honestly, I really don\u2019t care about the score I get from my tests this year as i feel so overwhelmingly cheated out.\n\nedit: this doesn\u2019t apply to me, but a couple of my friends and a bunch of other HS students do and the digital divide heavily impacted this years tests as well. I mean, I\u2019m lucky to have a suitable environment with stable equipment to test ok while some others I know had to use phones that just made the difficultly of the test much more apparent. It\u2019s so fucking unfair for so many people that it pisses me off so much. How is it fair for one person who has the perfect testing/working environment compared to someone else who is limited in technology, internet, or their testing environment? Sure, CB said you can submit a retest ticket, but it seems so tedious to do a retest just because you\u2019re at a disadvantage just because of your digital statute.",

On the day of the actual test, it was 9 parts in 25 minutes. WHAT?! That's close to double, and I'm sure I lost points from the sheer anxiety and shock I felt after seeing how many questions I had to do. I know they said that they wanted to \"test our knowledge by putting more questions than we could answer,\" but maybe \"test our knowledge\" by not making the test 45 freaking minutes long?!?!??? \n\n\nAlso, for APUSH\u2014 I'm pretty damn positive that they released something saying the prompt would be a normal time frame (for example, 30-40 years). The prompt I got was a 96 year time period. That's literally half of the material/time frame we were expected to know for the exam. Meanwhile, other people had normal prompts that only stretched for about 30 years, which seems like an unfair advantage. \n\nUgh. Sorry. I'm just pissed off.  I know that I was really strong at multiple choice, and likely would've gotten a 5 on both exams I took if the tests were full length... but now I'm not so sure.",
