  "text": "Last night, I felt especially bad for my son because he was poring over his supplemental essays, and he had been working on them for hours. I mean, HOURS. (He did bring a lot of this onto himself as he started writing supplements for his 10 RD schools THIS WEEK)\n\nNormally I would chew him out for waiting so long, especially when since he has way more time now. He wakes up at lunchtime and spent hours everyday last week gaming with his friends. But for some reason, I just couldn't do it. Instead, I surprised him with a hug and told him that it was all going to be okay, that he would only have to do this for 2 more weeks.\n\nI expected him to shrug it off (male teenage ego right?), but he just kind of sighed. I could literally see some tension leaving him. Affection isn't really all that common in our Chinese household, but coming from a mom, it really is helpful. \n\nParents, take the time today to tell your kid that you love them, or if that's not really a thing you do, just give them a hug or pat on the back. They need it more than we think they do.",

Especially now that I'm a junior, she is even more critical and some issue to remind me of. If she did this I would definitely not just sigh, but break down and cry. If my dad did this, I would also cry the same way:).",

Instead, love's shown through other ways (all the stuff parents provide their children, for example), but not usually directly (last time I hugged my mother was I think last February).

If parents are toxic and making their children miserable and depressed, it's not because they don't say \"I love you\" a couple times - it's because they're just... toxic. It's not because they're not verbally showing love, it's because they're not showing love at all.\n\nShowing love through actions is perfectly sufficient imo - speaking anecdotally because I can't remember the last time my parents or I have said \"I love you\" to each other except maybe through holiday cards a few years ago, but our relationship is healthy and I don't feel miserable because of them (speaking as a Chinese kid btw). I've always known my parents love me and never needed to be told that, which I think any relationship should be like (not saying verbal love is dumb lol, I do it with my friends 24/7, but like it doesn't need to be constantly reaffirmed if the relationship is actually healthy)\n\nShowing love through actions is healthy and works fine\u2014but if you're making your children miserable and depressed, you're *not* showing the love you should be. The problem isn't withholding verbal love\u2014besides, a shallow \"I love you\" probably would hurt more than heal\u2014but with the toxic behavior. They aren't even showing love anywhere in the first place.",

It's all anecdotal\u2014for me and many people I know, a daily \"I love you\" wouldn't mean much to us because we've grown up without it, but we appreciate daily love and affection in other places (other speech and actions), u know? If you think about it, showing basic affection shouldn't require three specific words, that kinda just seems like a societal construct lmao\n\n>I think most Asian kids living in the US would agree that it\u2019s a flaw in many Asian cultures.\n\nIf you're trying to specifically talk about Asians, the issue isn't with whether we say \"I love you\" but with the toxic achievement/prestige-driven mindset that dominates, especially in Asian-American families. That often leads to withdrawal of affection overall\u2014not just a lack of \"I love you,\" but a lack of any outward care or sympathy (plus the mental health taboo) from parents in speech *and* actions. In fact, it usually just turns into outright degradation and detestation. The flaw is that people feel like their parents just don't love them, but a few words (that will often seem shallow if all you know is toxic behavior) isn't going to fix that if their overall parenting attitude/outlook doesn't change.",
