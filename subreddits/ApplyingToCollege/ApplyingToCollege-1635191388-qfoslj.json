  "text": "None of my colleges require a letter of recommendation, but I was planning on sending a letter anyways. Is it ok if I just send one letter from one of my teachers? And do I need a letter from my counselor? I honestly don\u2019t have any sort of relationship with her, and I feel as though I\u2019ve only spoken to her twice a year, max.",

      "text": "Each college\u2019s admission site will define what they need. If they require a counselor letter, then yes, you need to send one. My daughter had a new counselor this year - she basically collected feedback from current and former teachers and summarized it, along with facts from report cards, test scores, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if a school doesn\u2019t require or list as optional a letter of recommendation,  don\u2019t send one. It will just go in the trash.\n\nIf they don\u2019t require one, but list one as optional, then sending one is fine.",
