  "text": "so I'm ranked 17 out of 92 in my class with a 4.03 w. and my friend is rated 18 out of 92 with a 4.00 weight gpa. we both applied to Yale (although, i wouldn't go even if u got accepted. i want to do nursing and they don't have it.) i honestly only did it for an ego boost.\n\nanyways, we were comparing applications and i noticed that she put she had a 4.1 weighted gpa and that she was the founder and organizer of a organization that provided \"poor\" kids with glasses. now wait a minute, i know she doesn't have a 4.1 and she sure as hell ain't founded any kind of organization.\n\n\nidk why she lied like that. it really worries me. and i think she did it for every college. i want her to get to college, but will colleges look down on her if her common app gpa is higher than her transcript one? like won't they think she's a liar? idk what to do.",
