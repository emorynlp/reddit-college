  "text": "I just wanna give a shoutout to all the seniors in this sub who aren't as naturally intelligent as their peers are. All of those who couldn't just blow off homework or studying. All of those who took the SAT in multiple sittings because they couldn't get a perfect score the first time. All of those who struggled to stay on top of their grades.\n\nWe worked hard to get where we are. And all that hard work is about to pay off.\n\nHigh school will be over before we know it. Keep grinding!!",
