  "text": "I\u2019m thinking about applying undecided, and thought of an idea about writing WHY and connecting it to a metaphor (not a cliche). But I\u2019m hesitant because I feel like colleges won\u2019t want to admit be because I\u2019m undecided and wouldn\u2019t want to read about it. Am I wrong? Need advice I\u2019m really dependent on my essay.",
