  "text": "For the essay prompt of inviting a person from the past or present, what is the main goal of this essay and how do I show anything about myself? I have a person in mind who happened to have created a character that relates really well with my personal essay. However, I don't really know how to express it. After reading my short essay, I learned nothing about myself other than something I find interesting, nothing new about personality etc.",
