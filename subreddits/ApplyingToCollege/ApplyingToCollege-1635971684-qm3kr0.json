  "text": "anyone feel like there\u2019s a huge influx of \u201cextended metaphors\u201d essays? like the ones where they write about something mundane, and strangely relate it to their EC\u2019s and way of thinking? \n\nex: i always make my ramen fancy. follow the recipe on the package? no! i strive to make ramen unique every time, because if you add blah blah ingredient, it will always be better than following the plain, uninspired recipe. my way of cooking also parallels my thought process. i like to try new things, like robotics team, art club, chess club, blah blah. trying new things blah blah aka i am creative and inquisitive. \n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong: some of them, if written well, can sound amazing! but most of them just rubs me the wrong way. it sounds very inauthentic if you\u2019re trying to squeeze every notable EC into your personality. and this way of writing the mundane and extending it to the big picture\u2014 it\u2019s so formulaic if not done correctly. it screams: \u201ci read tons of essays that worked, and i must follow this formula in order to get accepted.\u201d \n\nhow do you guys feel about these kind of essays?",

      "text": "i totally agree w ur opinion. sometimes these essays can be rather fantastic if the writer can do it well, however, i feel as though a majority of them follow some kind of general structure that makes them all sound kind of similar. it\u2019s almost like a cliched topic but w reference to the writing style. i would rather have an essay much more personal abt myself rather than writing abt some random object and relating it to my personality, passion, extracurriculars as ao\u2019s will get a lot of valuable insight on that through ur application",
