  "text": "Context: I'm a senior whos been using my Lenovo X390 Yoga for 2 years. \n\n\\- screen? cracked\n\n\\- storage? full\n\n\\- system? really not working AT ALL\n\n\\- run editing programs or just any programs besides Chrome? NOT POSSIBLE\n\n\\- efficient? I FEEL LIKE IM USING A 10 YEAR LAPTOP\n\nSo I do not like my experience with Lenovo and my school required us \\*our parents\\* to pay $2500 for this piece of machine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really am looking for a laptop that is just smooth with:\n\n\\- storage (it does not run out of storage even if I store big files, and even if it does, it connects to a cloud platform easily/can clear up storage/make space) \n\n\\- speed (it does take forever to load. and even if it has any problems, its easy to fix. IMO My Lenovo has SO MANY problems I don't know where to start of is it worth the money)\n\n\\- Smoothness (You know those times when you got a Crap Ton of work to do and you HAVE TO multitask or open multiple tabs? I really want a machine that optimizes for that and does not make the job harder but instead handles it well or makes it Smooth for you to clear out tasks and do your things)\n\n\\- Video Editing (Premiere), Photoshop, any big programs (I understand that I shouldn't install all those programs my laptop, but I really want 2 or 3 on it that is accessible and doesn't kill off my storage)\n\n\u270c tl;dr: In summary, what laptop you know of best fits all these criteria? Speed, Optimization, Multitasking, Adobe Apps, and just Student Use in General?\n\nI know this is a long read, so thank you so much for finishing it and giving me some advice on it.\n\n\u270c thank y'all and I hope you guys know you will be fine!!!",

On the windows side of things, the blade 14 (amd) has had great reviews and the new surface laptop studio seems very promising. \n\nPro tip: if you want to buy the current M1 macbooks, buy it from apple\u2019s refurbished site, they're basically identical to the new ones and are significantly cheaper.",

Nix\u2019s are the most dominant operating system today by far, partially because it\u2019s way easier to program on it and it\u2019s open-source.\n\nYou could use Windows, but almost all courses are going to be optimized for Macs. It just takes a few hoops to jump through, e.g. dual-booting & adding Linux, installing PowerShell because Windows command line is shit, etc. Having a Mac is just removing all those uncertainties and being able to code in a native environment which the benefits of cannot be overstated. \n\nMicrosoft was famously against Linux until a decade ago when they realized that they lost the war and decided to include Linux in their operations as well. I personally have a MacBook and a PC, and I haven\u2019t come across any coursework that required Windows not MacOS, since most are the other way around.",

You can get decent PC's for any price range, so if you have 2.5k to spend you could get a decent pc that suits your needs for around 1k-1.5k and spend the rest on a laptop in case you want to travel and take your editing software with you.\n\nMacBook's will last you a while and they are pretty fast and efficient. If you don't want to spend all of your money on just the MacBook I would recommend  going to [www.backmarket.com](https://www.backmarket.com) they have decent refurbished items and you can get yourself a MacBook in excellent condition.",

Please don't complain.  \n\nThere are plenty of USB hard drives and SSD drives to help expand storage.  \nYour university probably has a partnership with Microsoft or Dropbox or somebody for low-cost cloud storage.  \nLeverage that partnership for cheap cloud storage.  \n\n-------  \n\nFor your use case, I'd point you towards the ThinkPad T15.  \n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t15-g1/22tpt15t5n1  \n\nI usually prefer the 14\" T14 model, but the T15 gives you something you need - a second M2 socket for a second SSD inside.  \n\nI'd order the T15 with the default, pathetic 128GB M.2 drive, and replace it with a new 2TB SSD and add a second 2TB drive, for the same price as the upgrade to the 1TB from Lenovo.  \nI'd probably buy a 16GB or 32GB memory kit from a 3rd party like Crucial also.  \n\nYou'd be done and dusted for right around $2,000 with a device that should last 3-5 years unless you drop it like you did your other device.",
