Take in the genuine info from this sub and keep the extremes at bay. You know stressed teenagers just blow things out of proportion lol, especially those who have high standards and a lot to lose. \n\nI'm not applying to a single Ivy and am going completely in-state, but I've had a lot of good guidance on the application process with this sub so far.

Not just parties, but events from every club and student sponsored activities every week. The environment for work is quite collaborative from my looking into it, and isn't heavily focused on study study study to beat everyone else to the top.\n\nThe environment around it has the basic New England feel. Burlington is ranked one of the best college towns in America, it has great proximity to plenty outdoor activities, and the atmosphere is generally quite liberal. If you appreciate the cold, you'll enjoy the fact it snows and sticks for all of winter.\n\nI have come across some stuff of it being a party school (like every state college is) but some wisdom from my old boss, \"It's only a party school if you're looking for the parties.\"\n\nI'm sure someone who has family going there could give more clear cut answers, but those are the positives I found from looking into it",
