  "text": "I had a major injury while playing lacrosse in ninth grade that had a great impact on my GPA but I have a huge upward trend and I want to use my college essay to talk about this injury. It changed my life completely and was a huge growth opportunity for me that I took advantage of. I'm just worried that the whole sports injury essay thing is too cliche. Should I avoid writing about this? It's just that it's one of the most significant setbacks of my high school career but I don't want to seem boring. What do you guys think?",

      "text": "I think it depends on how your essay is written.  You are correct that many students write about sports injuries.  However, it is possible for you to write yours in a way that stands out.  Listen to the essay episode of Inside the Yale Admissions Office podcast for good guidance on this issue.\n\nAlso, your guidance counselor could address your injury and its impact on your GPA in their report.",
