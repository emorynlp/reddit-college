  "text": "In 9th grade, I went to a very high level high school in my home country in Asia, and because of that, my grades are very low. They are around 60's-80's, which were actually above average in my case. But then in 10th grade, I moved to another country because of my parents' jobs and since then, my grade average has been around 96. I can assume that it might raise some red flags if my grade average on my UC applications says that they suddenly went up by 30 something points after moving schools/countries.\n\nWhat should I do?",
