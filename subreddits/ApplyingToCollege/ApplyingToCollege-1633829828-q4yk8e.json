  "title:": "can I really put anything on my ECs?",
  "text": "I went to this Northwestern international admissions office hours meeting and a man said that my ECs are literally anything I do except mandatory school stuff and sleeping. I'm wondering if that was general advice or if I can really do that. \nFor instance, I could mention I read an average of two books every month, but common app says I should say what I accomplished with that, and I have accomplished absolutely nothing with reading but getting a big passion.\nAnother example, I am the translator in my church when an English-speaker pastor visits us, but that almost never happens so I can't even say how many weeks/year or hours/week I spend in that.",

      "text": "Those are awesome facts! If they feel odd in your EC section, find a way to slip them into your essay. They IMMEDIATELY make me want to talk to you about them, which is what you want your AO to feel when reading your application. They want students who are \"conversation starters.\" And believe it or not, but a so-called \"perfect, polished\"  application is often a big yawn...:)",
