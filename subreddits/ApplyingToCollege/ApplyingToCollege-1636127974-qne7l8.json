      "text": "I think the intro to engineering/STEM summer programs are worthwhile. Note that these are different from the $2k-$5k-costing summer school programs offered by most schools (and which seem to just amount to CV fluffing). General rule: if the NSF is willing to subsidize it, there's something worthwhile. Also, places offering financial aid are likely worthwhile since they are not just moneymakers.\n\nUIUC WYSE, MIT MITES/MOSTEC, Cornell Curie/CATALYST, GATech, Wisconsin, NCSU, Michigan State, Michigan (miRcore, and others), Duke SWiM, Stanford's SUMaC all seemed to be good; and, most of the good programs aren't $2k or more (unless they have need-based scholarships).",
