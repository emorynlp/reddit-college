  "text": "I write for a student publication that\u2019s online (not related to school but related to my career aspirations), should I put the names of the articles I wrote in my additional info to give a sense of what I spent my time writing? I know AOs won\u2019t click on links, so I\u2019m avoiding that\n\n(I\u2019ve put the general topic in my activity description but it\u2019s really broad; kind of like \u201cSTEM\u201d articles but it still feels way too general like they won\u2019t know what I\u2019ve really written or learned)\n\nThanks!",
