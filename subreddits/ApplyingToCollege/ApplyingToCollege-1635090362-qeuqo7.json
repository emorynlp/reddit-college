  "text": "I participated in a mentorship program for sometime that costed a decent amount of money, through it was selective. In the program, I learned more about a topic but did not produce anything tangible (it was basically learning based and if I wanted to I could create something). Should I still include this on my activities list even though I paid the amount of money I did for it and didn't produce anything? The only reason I can think of to include it is it shows interest in a subject.",
