  "text": "so i\u2019m sure this has been asked before but i\u2019m new to this group so i haven\u2019t seen any answers to this yet. & i have a somewhat unconventional high school history so any advice would be appreciated :) \n\ni transferred high schools halfway through my sophomore year to another public high school in my area. not bc of an uncontrollable circumstance- just bc my first school wasnt the right fit for me. i also graduated a year early since i had enough credits. and finally, i took a gap year (currently am taking it). if i have the space in my app, i really want to share what i\u2019m doing with my year since it\u2019s super important to me. \n\nokay so.. at least on the UC app, the additional info section is really short and unless i limit each topic to 1 sentence, i can\u2019t mention, let alone explain, all of these things. on the common app it\u2019s also a squeeze. \n\nso, from everyone\u2019s experience and knowledge, which of these 3 things should i take the time to explain in the additional info section? what do schools want more explanation about?\n- transferring \n- graduating early \n- taking a gap year \n\nthank you all in advance!! \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nWhen I read this I tried putting myself in an AO's shoes. *Why should I accept this applicant?* I know the additional info section is only one tiny piece of the entire holistic application, it's still important to make that reflection. If I was an AO, I would want to hear about why this person is taking a gap year. It's such a unique thing that the majority of applicants don't have and it leaves an opportunity to showcase more about *you* by explaining why you took that year, what you did, and how you grew. Good luck!",
