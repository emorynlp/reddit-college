  "text": "Hi! I'm Indian and looking forward to applying to UBC. I tried posting this question on the r/UBC megathread, but didn't really get a response. I know this subreddit may not be the ideal place for such a university-specific question, but here it goes:\n.\nHow difficult is it to get the International Leaders of Tomorrow Scholarship at UBC?
