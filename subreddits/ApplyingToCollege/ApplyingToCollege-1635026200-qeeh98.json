  "text": "Hello. Recently, I been told based on my family income that I might qualify for HEOP offered by colleges in NYS.\u00a0 I was told once if you want to apply to a school through HEOP you have to check it off on the common app. But (for example Cornell) I'm not seeing that check box option. I talked to my guidance counselor about it and they said for schools like SUNY you're gonna have to apply for heop though the suny portal. But how you apply for schools like Cornell and other private schools? Will they reach out to you? Do you have to fill our a fourm? etc how can you let the school know you want through apply to that application style since HEOP puts you in a different pool of candidates.\n\nPS: Before anyone ask you should call/email them I did multiple times. I called them and they were like\"I can't answer that question but email\u00a0 xxx...\" and then when I emailed them I get no response :(",

      "text": "The process varies from university to university. For instance, I work at Syracuse and we don\u2019t have a checkbox for HEOP. A student (in the additional information box - which can be revised each time you submit your Common App) or their school counselor (in their recommendation letter) can state the student\u2019s interest in HEOP. I think this would work for Cornell, too, if they don\u2019t have a specific process. For SUNY schools, the program is called EOP. I\u2019m not sure if there is a checkbox on the SUNY application or not.",

I believe Cornell does a process considering they have a questionnaire but their website doesn't go into much detail. But I was interested in finding a way to put my interest for their program on the common app. Didn't think of adding it to the information box. Thank you so much!",
