  "text": "I applied to a school through another website. I sent my transcript and SAT scores to them. They also want an essay and a recommendation. I asked my counselor on Oct 1 to write a recommendation and send it to them. I ended up missing the Nov 1 deadline because she didn\u2019t send the recommendation. Since I didn\u2019t finish my application through the other site, can I just submit another application through Common app Instead? My recommender is already on there so I can submit my application quicker that way.",
