  "title:": "International Students doubt(please read it bc it\u2019s more than important for me)",
  "text": "I know most international students don\u2019t have GPA. But, I was trying to convert my grades in GPA and it\u2019s so low - like a 2.0-2.5 for an average of 73% on 100%. It\u2019s tremendously rare to see a parent from my country that will not be happy for this score for its child. \nI am obligated to take about 15-20 classes each year. Some are more advanced than others(but entering them on the common app is just regular).\nMy questions are:\n1- is someone with 70/100 is bad in the United States? Will this person have a C for that?\n2- Can you please show me one of your transcripts to see how it appears?\n\nIf there is an admitted international student here please show me your transcript and please tell me where you are admitted. \n\nMy background :\nI need a need-based scholarship in the US otherwise I won\u2019t be able to pay any fees higher than 10k per year- I am from the poorest country in the world( I would be the first student in my school straightly admitted to a US College. \nLast year I refused 3 half-scholarship for doing in IB at UWC (I had to pay 14k per year and 18k- But I couldn\u2019t afford it). English is my 3rd language. I won 4 national prices (1 robotic competition, 2  entrepreneurship competition and 1 like an Olympiad ). I was a semifinalist at the Diamond Challenge. I am the president of the entrepreneurship club of my school(last and this year). I am the founder of a nonprofit . \n\nMy dream is to study in the US, community college is also an option If i get rejected by all schools that I will apply to.\n\nAbout the transcript of my first trimester(I do 3 trimesters each year) in 11th grade: My rank is usually 3/51 - that means my score is 3rd best score on 51 in the class(we all take the same courses). My average is considered like your GPA. The rigorous subjects have higher scores- I follow them like 6 hours per week- for math and french. \nAny comments on my transcript would be more than appreciate- it\u2019s in french. \nThis grade is like 78% on 100%. \nIf you need to see it for commenting , please send me a dm.\n(EXCUSE MY WRITING)",

      "text": "1. is there anyway possible for you to get standarized testing? (sat act ap ib) because even if you tell them your rank, its very hard for them to understand how good you actually are.  since your school has no one in the states to give them context of your school's standards.  also because its such a small school you'll have a hard time proving that your ranking means much.  even if your guidance counseller does an amazing job of creating a 'school profile'.  standarized testing solves this, but i understand that might not be an option.\n2. really really hone in on your ecs and essays.  really stress your situation, and show how you were able to do well given limited resources.  your ecs look quite good and they might be better proof of your performance.  \n3. make sure your guidance counseller (or whoevers doing the school profile) puts in the best effort possible.  because everything you do becomes judged in the context of that \n4. look for ways to get your grades in US context.  honestly idk how.  \n5. look for more niche portals to help you with this  ie is there anything like questbridge but for international students?? idk??\n\nim applying from canada rn and my gpa doesnt match the us standards perfectly, but we have a school profile and also ib standarized test to speak for my academics.  so in summary: find way to standardize your scores (most likely via school profile) and make sure to talk about your circumstances on the application additional info section or even in your essays.  \n\nsorry if that wasnt much help, but if youd ever like to talk feel free to reach out!",
