It\u2019s ridiculous.",

I applied ED to a cheaper but very under-ranked school (Clarkson U) instead of applying to places like RPI and WPI or even Cornell (even tho I wasn\u2019t getting in) for the prestige. Feel like I would enjoy Clarkson more and really good career center, but it\u2019s really all what you make it.",

A lot goes into writing all of that, plus the info sessions, plus interviews, plus receptions, plus fly-ins/other events. We actually do a lot when it comes to the \"why us.\" For us though, if enough students don't come, it isn't just, \"whelp on to my safety,\" its, \"ope, guess the college is going to experience serious cuts with many people losing their livelihood.\"\n\nMaybe I'm getting too riled up about that, but just know that there are people on the other side of the application trying to get you to attend (sure there are some that never really have to worry about this, like most Ivies, but still, even they work a ton to get students to apply and yield).",

Anyway, I've heard that colleges are getting worried/bracing for a sharp decline in enrollment beginning around 2026, the main reason being that birth-rates dropped during the Great Recession and this will be the 18th anniversary.  They say that schools--particularly smaller schools--will have to adapt and that quite a few may end up becoming defunct.  One friend even said that COVID restrictions have actually been somewhat of a good thing in that they've forced changes that may be utilized when 2026 arrives. \n\nAs an admissions consultant, is this something that's on your mind?  How \"real\" is this 2026 cliff and what are the expected impacts?\n\nLol sorry to treat this like a \"AMA\" post.",

I was like \"gee, I guess they can only afford so many year-round admissions staff and hire on additional help when needed.\" I now realize how ridiculous that sounds.\n\nThat being said, it has never crossed my mind that students (or I guess it's their adults) would hire a consultant for advice on how to stand out, but it makes total sense!
