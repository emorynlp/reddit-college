Your classes, your grades, your outside school time. \n\nThat\u2019s what they want to really get to know. But the essay can tank a great app obviously if you show you don\u2019t know basic grammar and spelling or you come off as overly conceited or misogynistic or racist. I think a strong essay can help boost an already strong application but it\u2019s not going to get someone in who doesn\u2019t already have strong course rigor or grades of meaningful to them activities.  \n\nYour goal, to me, in the essay is to build a connection with the reader so they\u2019ll see a little of themselves in you and want to get to know you better.  Then they\u2019ll push for you in committee.",

While good essays won't get you in if you have bad stats, bad essays will definitely not get you in regardless of your stats. Don't worry though, what we look from essays is interest towards our college and some commendable qualities. Your writing style doesn't matter as much as you'd think and neither does the flow of the essay as long as the content is rich.\"",

      "text": "I've always said that the [weight of different components in holistic review varies by school, by applicant, and by the content of the components themselves.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pcfpff/how_would_you_rank_the_relative_importance_of_the/hakhmk1/)  In my experience, essays can't make an unqualified applicant look qualified.  But they can help a ton with overcoming smaller weaknesses or helping an otherwise less interesting student stand out.  To give a couple of concrete examples:\n\n1.  Last year I had a student with a 3.5 GPA apply to ~12 T20s and went 0/12.  The essays were outstanding, but just couldn't overcome the mediocre grades.  They ended up getting into UVA, Fordham, and Rutgers (with a full ride).  But they never really had a chance at the most selective schools.\n\n2.  I had a student with an F in Calculus who applied to six top CS programs.  Also had incredible essays and deep involvement/achievement in CS.  Student added a note about the extenuating medical circumstances that led to the F (as well as an explanation in the counselor LOR).  Student also retook Calc over the summer and got an A.  Ended up getting into USC, UC Berkeley (EECS), GT, and UIUC.  To me, the essays/explanations absolutely made up for the one bad grade.\n\nI think a lot of really amazing students get into top ranked schools despite mediocre essays.  It's much rarer for a \"mediocre\" student (in quotes because they're still outstanding, just not T20 level) to get into highly selective colleges with amazing essays.\n\nOne final note - I think Covid made essays matter more because tests became optional and grades & ECs sorta got nerfed by it.",
