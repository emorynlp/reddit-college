  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\n I am currently a first-year student at a university in the Netherlands but am planning to apply to American universities again this year (in the hope to receive a scholarship) with **Early Decision** (so the deadline for my application is **November 1**). I have read that it is better to apply as a first-year because universities are more generous with scholarships/financial aid for first-year students and not transfer students. But now I am not sure whether I should declare that I am currently enrolled in a university for my applications. \n\nIn **CommonApp**, there is a section, where I need to \"list courses that I am taking this academic year\". In my current institution, I am taking 3 courses for this semester (and I will complete them after I pass the exams in the first week of November). Should I list my 3 current university courses, or my high-school courses (I took the IB diploma program)?\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think.\n\nThank you for your time, advice, and support!",
