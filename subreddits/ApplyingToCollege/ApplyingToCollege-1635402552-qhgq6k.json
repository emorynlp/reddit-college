  "text": "I absolutely love Wellesley, but it\u2019s definitely a second choice. Unfortunately, I\u2019m doing an REA, so I can\u2019t do ED. Would applying RD give me a lower chance of acceptance? I\u2019m an international student looking for aid, and a few sources said they were need aware?",

It\u2019s better to do RD in your scenario so you can compare fin aid packages and the benefits of certain schools",
