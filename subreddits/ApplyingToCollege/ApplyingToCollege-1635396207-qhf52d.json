  "text": "I've applied REA to Harvard and as some of you might know, they say that you can apply EA to any other private university after you've received Harvard's decision in mid December and only if the other  decision comes post January-1. Now the problem is that I applied EA to Northeastern. Even though their decision doesn't come out till February (which follows Harvard's rule), I wasn't supposed to apply to Northeastern until I had received Harvard's decision. Would Harvard get to know that I've applied EA to northeastern? Is there anything I should do now?",
