  "text": "CIES were cancelled in my country for May/June 2021 so I'm giving them in Oct/Nov, meaning both my AS and A2 grades are pending, but when i state them both as \"*In Progress*,\" they don't let me submit it because, \"*It appears that you have more than one year of in-progress high school coursework listed on your SRAR. Please be sure to enter final grades for all courses which have been completed. You will not be able to submit your SRAR until this has been corrected*.\" \n\nI'm so frustrated.",
