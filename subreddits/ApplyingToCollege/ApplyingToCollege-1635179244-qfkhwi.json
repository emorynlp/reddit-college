      "text": "this is what i'd do\n\n1) email the teacher. politely ask how they're doing, wish them well, and inquire after the LOR (phrase it gently, like 'i know youre very stressed and i just wanted you to know that i understand if you would prefer not to write the LOR' is how i'd phrase it) \n\n2) like elkrange said, check in with your high school counselor \n\n3) if you have a good relationship with more teacher(s), ask that/those teacher(s) if they would be willing to write you a LOR, and explain that you know it's short notice but one of your teachers quit. if they're chill enough they just might agree.\n\n4) contact the college(s) you planned to send the teacher's LOR to and explain the situation. some of them may be understanding. another one that's just \"if they're chill enough they just might agree.\" \n\ngood luck <3",
