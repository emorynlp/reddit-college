  "text": "During application assessment process, am I compared to much wealthier students, although they come from the same country as me?\n\nI am an international student, and some students in my country is so rich that they spend over $10k to get counselling. They simply have better opportunities, especially in ECs, as they live in big cities, go to prestigious schools, and have lots of money, even parents' connection. I know a girl going to an international school (mine is public), and her profile is just incredible: She led a national volunteer project, joined MIT's and Northwestern's summer camps, participated in an international science competition and get 2nd prize, started a business with an American company, invited as speaker to a conference in Nepal, and did different sports. I'm not trying to say that she is this good just because she is rich, but her money definitely got her some advantages.\n\nMy family is very poor compared to students like her. But I have tried my best to get an impressive extracurriculars CV. I'm still worried tho. Any advice guys?",

Your applications are evaluated entirely in the context you come from \u2014 that means your hometown, your school, your income level, and therefore, access to opportunities.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re doing the most with what you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ll be just fine (seriously).\n\n.\n.\n\nAlso, not to mention that those several thousand-dollar university-specific summer camps are completely useless in terms of admission. As someone who can afford to go to one (but haven\u2019t), that\u2019s not something to brag about at all, unless it was very selective.",
