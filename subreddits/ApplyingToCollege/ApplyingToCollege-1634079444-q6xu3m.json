      "text": "It's going to be harder for you if you are international. \n\nIn fact, even if you *aren't* international, good grades and a handful of ecs *will not* guarantee you any spots. The best thing you can do is, as other mention, try to get as far as possible in your ecs. Win some awards in them. Host an event with a lot of participants. Create impact. \n\nAlso, you might want to brush up on your writing skills. But even then - remember, it's still a crapshot and a roll in the mud - getting into an ivy league is unpredictable if you aren't insanely rich, the daughter of the first African American president, or a gold-medalist swimmer in the Olympics. Cheers!",

      "text": "Like u/tritonthecat said, invest a lot of time into activities you\u2019re passionate about, that also show leadership and the ability to make a difference. The Ivy League isn\u2019t a little club that people want to join. They are some of the most competitive colleges in the entire world. It\u2019s a much harder task to get accepted than it may seem, but with that being said, it\u2019s not impossible, so good luck!",
