  "text": "Yes. In case you\u2019re wondering I\u2019m the kid who nearly shat himself during the ACT\u2014 a title that I shamefully possess. \n\nBut I now write this post in clean trousers, trying to inspire. \n\nThroughout my life, I\u2019ve been perceived as an average student. I always put value into trivial things that have no long-term value. I went through freshman year trying to be one of the popular guys. I was an arrogant ass hole in class who would act childish simply for the sake of approval. I would drink and smoke every weekend. No one wanted me, though. I felt lonely. For the first time in my life, I felt hopeless. \n\nI never cared about school. I never tried. I had low self-esteem cause I was known as the rich kid who could simply bum around and still end up fine working for the family business. And I wanted to change that.\n\nAfter praying for years to find some meaning in my life, I had a moment of epiphany. For an unexplainable reason other than the power of God, I was highly motivated. I switched my 3.0 to a 4.0. I stopped smoking and began to lift weights. I began pursuing more extracurriculars. I was reunited with my childhood best friends. To say the least, my life was changed. I wanted more though. So, I studied hard for the ACT. My friends wondered why I always missed out on playing basketball with them, why I showed up late to parties, why I had calluses on my hands. Well, it was all for a feeling I so desperately wanted. A feeling that would show everyone who turned me down throughout my life that I\u2019m worthy and that I am something instead of the class clown. I achieved a 33\u2013something my parents used laughed at when I told them it was my desired score. I got admitted into a selective summer program. I began taking honors and AP courses. Now, the guys who turned me down and caused me mental anguish my first couple years of high school barely recognize me. Good. \n\nBut I have one more void that I want to fulfill. Some feeling in my gut tells me it is to pursue a top education. Still, I\u2019m told I\u2019m incompetent. This used to get to me. Tonight I decided that it won\u2019t any longer. \n\nThis sub is what motivates me to prove everyone wrong. \n\nTrust me. I know what denial feels like. I\u2019ve been cut from sports teams, rejected by girls, neglected by family members, etc. But what separates me from the rest of you is that I\u2019m not afraid of it. \n\nTwo words you all must live by\u2014\n\nFuck it. \n\nWhat the hell do you have to lose? \n\nMy grandpa told me something on his deathbed while in hospice. \n\n\u201cThe common man can get through life by never swinging. He takes walks. But you go for home runs. That\u2019s why you\u2019re different.\u201d \n\nFive minutes later... flatline. \n\nHe brought my family out of poverty. My father grew up sharing shoes with three brothers. But he hit a grand slam. All because he swung the bat. \n\nSo as you\u2019re finishing applications, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re stressed. Remember that life\u2019s too short to never swing. Take risks. Without risk, there is no reward. \n\nOne last thing. Listen to Telescope by cage the elephant. Listen to the lyrics carefully. I discovered the song at the darkest point in my life. Deepest, most powerful song I\u2019ve ever listened to. \n\nThank you, A2C. \n\nIf this is upvoted enough I\u2019ll maybe check back in to reveal my decision. \n\nI\u2019ll end up wherever I\u2019m supposed to and so will you.",

If you decide not to apply to \\[insert T20\\] because you think you have no chance, you're basically rejecting yourself for the admissions committee. Why would you do that?\n\nFor many things in life rejection is not an issue. And I think working in an outreach role at a business club, and my ongoing search for a summer internship, has cemented that for me. I'll reach out to people with a boothing opportunity or asking for a coffee chat and get ignored. But who cares? Someone out there is going to say yes to me, and give me a job, and all of the rejections in the past won't matter. With the outreach, I sent out hundreds of emails which disappeared until a Big 4 firm got back to me - and they'll be pulling up to our event. Keep swinging, don't be afraid to miss - you only need to strike once and you're golden.",

Also reminds me that I never replied to you with the story of me almost pissing myself during the SAT.\n\nI decided not to go to the bathroom before the SAT because I did not have to. So I thought. Then, during the first break, I had an inkling of suspicion concerning my bladder but I wrote it off. \n\nI have never written that feeling off again as I was barely even able to write after a couple minutes on the no calc section. My sat experience transcended test taking as it became a fight-or-flight battle between me and not pissing my pants. Perhaps I should have just pissed myself but that probably would have violated covid protocol, if someone thought to account for pee in the protocol at least.\n\nAfter the section was done I rushed to the bathroom, but the damage was already done(not in my pants luckily). I missed my high score in math by 100 points, but at least... nah I can't think of some silver lining to put here. \n\nBest of luck on your decisions!!",

Came to college, had a blast even without going to parties. Now I'm a sophomore and I've maintained 4.0 even through difficult engineering classes and orgo. And my mental health is fine. The don't you learn to do things for yourself the better you will do and the less stress you will have. My social life also improved because I learned to enjoy things in life and my friends.

      "text": "I literally was just thinking subconsciously about how low my chances would be for the college(s) that I desired to attend till now, as I was desperately reading and trying to catch up on AP physics, which I\u2019m failing currently, over winter break. I can\u2019t get the thought of anything related to college out of my head; it\u2019s just been so heavily ingrained in my mind, especially the likely idea that I\u2019m not qualified whatsoever in their view to be admitted to college. \n\nI share a similar freshman year experience, though not as articulate and later refined as yours. I had two honors classes as a freshman, and I did poorly in them both. My focus wasn\u2019t on studies as much as it should have been; I was more into girls, popularity, being cool, and just having fun ultimately. Of course that took a turn for my grades which were previously (in 8th grade) stellar. I ended up having to redo one of those honors classes this past summer, having gotten a D in it for the first semester. \n\nI did so much better in 10th grade, partially because I had zero honors classes, but also partially because I wanted it. I strongly wanted to do well. I had a 4.0 first semester, having joined the wrestling team and done fairly well in that too. I did so well in CP Chem that I was allowed to be promoted to Honors Chem. Ended with a 4.2 weighted equivalent, which was the max I could get, although in reality, due to COVID, our district moved to a Credit/No Credit system for grading (I got all credit).  \nAdditionally, I self studied for three notoriously hard AP exams, and got two 5\u2019s and a 4. \n\nThis year I\u2019m doing 4 APs, and partially because of COVID and more significantly because of my choices to somewhat regress to my old habits (to a smaller degree), I\u2019m once again failing two APs. At this point there\u2019s nothing I can do about these two classes as the semester is coming to an end. But why? Why can\u2019t I continue how well I was doing in 10th grade? I want to do well even more than I did last year, so why can\u2019t I?\n\nThis has been the thought that has taken over my mind and it\u2019s so disturbing. I\u2019ve become quite discouraged for the next semester and 12th grade as a result. This post has really given me some courage to do the best I can for my remaining time of high school and to just swing my bat with as much power as possible. Thanks OP.",

I'm down to read a few just pm them to me, not sure how helpful I'll be though. I'd be careful with just giving people your essays btw, bc some people do plagiarize (I'm not planning to do so, but just wanted to say). Good luck with your apps either way!",
