  "text": "SO BASICALLY\n\n\\-I am transgender. If my parents find out it will be bad, and they're insisting on looking over my application. However, since I'm applying to colleges, and they kinda ask about if you're an LGBT student and.\n\n 1. I don't want to lie about it, but if my parents are looking over it when I submit it, then I kind of have to.\n\n2. Scholarships? Or like, diversity kinda things yknow, is it worth it to figure out a workaround for this or should I just submit my application as my legal sex.\n\n**tl;dr is: Is it worth it to try and figure out how to apply to college as a trans student if certain people finding out poses a danger to me?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(and just for clarification I know I am trans, i am sure about this, i've known this for a while, this isn't me briefly considering my gender identity or something . I don't see people who do as less trans, i just want an actual answer and not \"are you really trans?' kinda answers. thank you.)",

That's really hard and it must be very isolating. \ud83d\ude29 I hope college gives you the space you need to transition into who you are.\n\nSecond, I think the idea to do either a pdf of the draft or just edit after they look it over is your best bet if you want the benefits of being honest with your perspective schools. And I think honesty really is the best policy in that sense. There are resources and aid out there for LGBTQIA applicants. Besides, the schools want to know YOU, not the mask you wear around people you don't feel safe with.\n\nThird, I really hope that you end up being wrong about your parents. I don't say that to minimize your struggle, I just want to keep hope alive that parents can grow and change and surprise their children. I am the parent of a LGBTQ /Gender non conforming kid, and I know how important that identity is to them in choosing a college, and I truly wish you success and joy.\n\u2764\ufe0f",
