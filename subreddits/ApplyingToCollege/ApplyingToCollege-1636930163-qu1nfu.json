  "text": "Hey everyone! I know this isn\u2019t exactly a subreddit dedicated to transfers, but I tried posting this in the transfer sub and didn\u2019t get any responses soooo I\u2019m gonna see if I can get any advice from you guys:\n\nSo, from the Fall of 2019 to the end of Spring 2020 I attended an unaccredited arts college in Los Angeles, and I left after the end of my freshman year. Fast forward through the pandemic, I am now in Sophomore standing at a community college, and am working on my transfer applications for CSU\u2019s and UC\u2019s! \n\nMy problem is that the CSU application requires you to input all prior classes and grades that you took at all institutions, and, while I know the course list that I took, my old school has not sent me my transcripts (despite my requests), meaning I have no idea what specific grades I got in my classes. I know that I mostly got A\u2019s with a couple B\u2019s, but again, I do not know with certainty which grades I got in which classes.\n\nHow would you guys approach this? I obviously don\u2019t want to falsify any information, but my old school is not at all complying with my request for transcripts. Will the CSU\u2019s I apply to even cross reference my reported grades with my official transcript grades? Just looking for some guidance here. Thanks!",
