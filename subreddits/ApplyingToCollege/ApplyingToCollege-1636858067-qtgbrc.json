  "title:": "Will I Annoy Admissions Officers with this Update",
  "text": "A literature review that I was a co-author to recently got accepted to be presented at a conference and will be published in the conference journal. The conference and journal aren't super well-known or anything, so is this worth sending an update to my ED college?\n\nAlso would it be appropriate to upload a pdf of my abstract along with the update? Idk if this sounds super paranoid but I already sent a transcript of like the 2 community college courses I took and I'm scared that attaching the document may give too many unnessasary documents for the AOs to go through.\n\nThanks",
