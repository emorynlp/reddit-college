  "text": "I\u2019ve been really struggling with finding a topic to write about, but I think I found what I want to write about. The only thing is that I\u2019m worried it\u2019s too basic of a topic, so I\u2019m jw what you guys think. I want to write about what my definition of family is, and how I feel more comfortable and at home around my close friends than around most of my actual family (for reasons that won\u2019t be in the essay bc I\u2019m not running the risk of turning the essay into a sob story). The essay is basically abt chosen family and I kinda realized this today and now I\u2019m stressed out\ud83d\ude05. Any feedback would be helpful guys",
