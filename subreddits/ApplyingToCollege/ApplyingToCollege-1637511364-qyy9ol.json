  "text": "Hey A2C, been lurking for a while. I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, or if there's a thread already made, or what, but I have a quick question.\n\nWhen I'm applying for a scholarship, and it asks me:\n\n\"Please list any scholarships or grants that you will receive.\"\n\nDo I put all that I'm applying to, all that I've applied to up until that point, or all that I have accepted? I have no idea what's going on.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n  \n(ALSO: where do I look for scholarships?)",
