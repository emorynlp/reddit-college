  "text": "Okay soo...I had my Tufts interview today at 10 am and I'm never awake at 10. I only wake up at 1 pm because I usually go to bed at like 3 am and that just might've been the reason for the loss of judgment. Anyway, the interview started off great. I talked about my undying passion for history or political science or whatever and all my childhood trauma and then I began talking about my long-distance boyfriend because I stalked my interviewer and figured out that she was in one and she's married to the dude. Lemme tell you, she ate it up. I mean, it went HELLA great. My bf is cute and got into Stanford and he's a genius and shit and I showed her the scrapbook I'm making for him. It really elevated my performance, I'd say. And then she asks to see a picture of him because she showed the photo of her family on her desk.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI pull out my phone, open Photos, and find a picture but here's the thing, the iPhone photos app shows at the very bottom a preview of your other pictures like a camera film roll. And when I shoved my phone into the webcam so she could see it, she also got a nice view of all the other pictures at the very bottom. She's like smiling at first and then I see like the slightest shift in her eyes and she like looks away and I'm like \"Yeah, I know he's that fucking cute. I'm all over him too.\" And then I bring my phone back and I look at it and lo and behold, there are my tits.\n\nRight there. All perky and squished together. And I just blink. And I clear my throat and I'm like \"So (interviewer name), what was the best part about your Tufts experience?\"\n\nAnd she just went along with it. I really don't know if she saw it. If she did, she didn't mention anything. Either way, I'm not scared because my tits look great. Like, they look GREAT. But like they are nudes and so, to my interviewer, um, if you're reading this, I am so sorry. I am so so sorry. Please let me into Tufts.\n\nAnd if my boyfriend is reading this, look at what all I fucking go through so you can have pictures of me!!!! Give me more attention!!!!!!!\\* I also love you, Kiwi :)\n\nIt's gonna be okay, right? Yeah, it'll be okay.... :/\n\nEdit: thanks for the awardsssssssssss <3\n\nEdit #2: I've been talking to her since then and she didn't actually see them! I asked her for feedback from my interview and if there \"was anything out of the ordinary.\" She said that I was actually her favorite interviewee and she wished my bf and I the best. Yayyyy but omg this was such a WILD ride!!\n\nEdit #3: I would like to make this very clear to anyone and everyone reading my post. I posted this to share a funny experience. I also read the Yale kissing guy's post and what happened today reminded me of him so I thought I'd share. That was my ONLY purpose. I did not post on here to receive scrutiny over my very private, very healthy relationship or for threatening messages from trolls. Please enjoy my mistake and laugh at it but don't send me hate in the comments. It only makes you seem like an idiot.\n\n\\* IN CASE YOU DID NOT REALIZE, THIS PART IS A JOKE.",

She like said \"fuck\" a couple times and she talked abt partying a lot so I feel like even if she did see it but just lied to me, she prolly won't tell Tufts lol. \n\nAnd Tufts was my first interview so I really don't know if their process is different from others. Just seemed like a normal interview. I'd try to get it as close to a conversation as possible. Like maybe try to ask them questions and like seem more casual so they talk too. The Tufts blog post I read about interview emphasized the word \"informal\" so I'd just keep that in the back of your head. Hope this helps! :)",

Didn't think I'd have to explain this one but here we are.\n\nEdit: If you have trouble understanding what an umbrella term is, look up the word \"queer\" because I really wanna make sure you understand and stop harassing people over things they a) used to/still can be KILLED for and b) are none of your damn business.

I like observing and analyzing them and their speech. And your way of talking is definitely curious. You can call me a freak, but in quarantine all have free time and bored.\n\n>honey\n\nWhoa there lady, who gave you the right to talk to me like that\n\n>Didn't think I'd have to explain this one but here we are.\n\nYou didn't. But you just sound mad.\n\n>it is MY BUSINESS, MY DEFINITION, and how IIII CHOOSE TO IDENTIFY\n\nYea whatever. I am just telling you that it is nonsense, as in illogical to state that you're gay and have a boyfriend (Either way, I don't have any problem with it)\n\nHowever, I don't care at all about all this; I didn't have any secret intentions or ulterior motives behind my comment.\n\nCertainly, it is not necessary to be this defensive to a simple remark.",

It was an accident so I don't really care lol. I'm glad that person had a bit of entertainment today because they probably don't have an actual life and are very alone with no one to talk to most days. Poor soul. Like my applications say, I love community service and I'm happy to have brought a smile to such a lonely, terrible human being. :)",
