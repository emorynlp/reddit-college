  "text": "So filling out my common app activities list over the last few days, I realized that some of my activities might look a little odd to AOs. Technically, I'm in leadership for 4 clubs (2 President, 2 Co-President). In each of these clubs, I have put in a substantial amount of effort and time, and my leadership positions are legit ( I've been a 4 year member in two, am the founder of the third, and was elected by a group of 60+ students for the fourth). I've heard that AOs aren't too big of fans of people who just randomly join clubs or activities, and was wondering if so many leadership positions would make me seem like I'm not devoted to one or two places where I can make an impact.",
