  "text": "Hi a2c,\n\nIf I'm out of state and applying to the UC system, do I have to label every \"Honors\" course as a \"Not Honors (NH)?\" \n\nI took a lot of honors courses throughout my high school, and it just seems kind of unfair to OOS students to not receive credit for doing so. Regardless, I would still like to emphasize the \"rigor\" of my coursework, since I took basically no \"regular\" classes. \n\nWould I be penalized for labeling my classwork as \"Honors Level (HL)?\"",

              "text": "You are kidding yourself if you think CA has a loophole.\n\nPSA for anyone not yet aware, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
