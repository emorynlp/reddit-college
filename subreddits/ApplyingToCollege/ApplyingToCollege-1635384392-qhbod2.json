      "text": "That seems very high, unless you have some property other than your primary residence, or a lot of money in unprotected assets.  If you included the value of your house or your parents included retirement accounts that can throw things off by a lot.\n\n200k income by itself makes an EFC of 50k or so, if you had no assets.  200k in parental assets that are unprotected (like checking, savings, non-retirement brokerage) would add another 11-12k.\n\nIf you have assets in your name that can break things too - you are expected to provide 20% of your assets, instead of the 5.64% from your parents.  If you have money in 529 accounts that isn't protected, but should be included as a parent asset.",

At most schools it probably won't make a big difference - you should expect an EFC of at least $60k I think - but it's not going to hurt you to fix it.",
