  "text": "I wrote my personal essay on something I built. I think it\u2019s pretty unique and cool, but idk whether to send an email to the regional AO. I dont want to look too obsessed but I also want to improve my chances and connect with the AO. Is it better to send something average than nothing at all?",

If it\u2019s average don\u2019t send it since in your essay you should be able to really hype it up and even if you make a functioning calculator off just a few wires and a display that can be a heck of a lot cooler when you write about it vs. a picture where it is the Jerry-rigged mess of wires that it is.",
