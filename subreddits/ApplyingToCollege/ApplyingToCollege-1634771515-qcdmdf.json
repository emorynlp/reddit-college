  "text": "I just finished writing my UPenn supplemental when I found out that the essay doesn\u2019t actually ask \u201chow did you discover your intellectual and academic interests and how will you explore them here\u201d It actually just asks the \u201chow will you explore them here\u201d part. I only talk about discovering them in the first paragraph. Should I delete it and change up my essay. Or should I keep it. I feel like it is the strongest part of my essay.",

It also kind of sets up the rest of my essay and why I am choosing the path that I\u2019m on. I feel like it definitely is the most personal too",

              "text": "As long as the essay as a whole answers the question in the prompt, then I would keep the beginning if it's that strong. After all, you can't really explain how you're going to pursue your academic and intellectual interests without first saying what those interests are, and providing some context to those interests can't really hurt you\u2014unless, of course, you need more word count to answer the specific question asked.",
