  "text": "i've all A's thus far, but I have a 46% in calculus II. mind you, I have an A in calc physics, its largely an issue with the grades being *entirely* based on three two-question quizzes. \n\nI know Columbia requires first quarter grades. I planned on EDing there, but I feel like EDing with an F would hurt me substantially. I also heard (but do correct me if I'm wrong) that UPenn ED doesn't require midterm grades. UPenn is a close second to Columbia on my list. Should I just ED there?",

I do the homework and even unassigned questions in the textbook, I show up to office hours that clash with my clubs -- they're nonnegotiable so I have to do that. and most of my class does the same, yet we still fail. \n\nhe just doesn't care lol. even when emailed about this, he just said to drop clubs and spend more time studying.",
