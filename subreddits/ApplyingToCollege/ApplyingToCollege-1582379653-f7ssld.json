Now, I have the best grades I ever had, and I'm on the Dean's List (at a community college nevertheless but I still feel like that's a feat in itself),  there's a lot of potential in going, especially if you're like me and wasn't 100% sure about what you wanted to pursue as a career.",

I've met up with old classmates who have stated that I don't go to a \"real\" school. Which doesn't even make any sense?  It doesn't even matter a degree is a degree regardless.  \nI wish you the best of luck in your educational career!",
