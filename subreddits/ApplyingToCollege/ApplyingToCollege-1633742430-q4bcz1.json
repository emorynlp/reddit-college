  "text": "I have been working really hard on my Why Northwestern Essay (I am thinking about EDing there).  I feel like I have a really unique and compelling idea that relates to my interests and ECs.  However, I really only answer the explicitly question \u201cwhy I want to go to Northwestern\u201d once.  Will this be detrimental to my essay?  \n\nIn advance I would just like to say thank you for all of the advice!",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply.  The main issue that may affect my essay is that I do not really explicitly say how I want to go to Northwestern.  Ie:  I wrote about something I saw on campus that not many people would notice or have the guts to talk about it in an essay.  Coincidentally, my passion of interest is the same subject matter as this campus issue.  It is only a 300 word essay, so I spent a lot of words setting up this idea and how it makes the university unique.  However, I only talked about my own personal experiences and how I can be a part of the university for a paragraph.",

              "text": "It really depends on what you saw, and how you were planning to go on and write about it. \n\nYou could use the campus event as a mini hook/ introduction to make a thesis about your interests that would segue into what resources (professors/classes, clubs, programs, research labs etc.)  at Northwestern help you in your quest to tackle the issue at hand.\n\nI would approach that with caution as you don't want to paint the school in a negative picture or make generalizations of the school based on your single event (i.e, say you saw a crime occuring and you say Northwestern is a crime ridden school) and then ask them to accept you. \n\nI suggest you take my advice with a grain of salt though, as I am in no position of authority or credibility to go around telling people how to write their essays. \n\nLook at [this guide](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/why-this-college-essay) for advice on how to write a \"why us\" essay.",
