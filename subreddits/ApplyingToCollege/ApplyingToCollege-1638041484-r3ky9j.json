  "text": "This is probably a super dumb question but I\u2019ve asked so many people and they\u2019ve never given me a straight answer.\n\nMy plan was to get my nursing degree and specialize in labor and delivery, but I think I just kinda settled on that idea cause I know that it will always be in demand and will make good money. But I really wanted to go to art school and just do something with art. I think I\u2019d like nursing but I feel like art is way more in my league. \n\nSo, what could I do with an art degree if I chose to go that path? Could I possibly get my nursing degree but also go to art school at the same time?\n\nI\u2019m a sophomore in high school right now, so I know I have some time to decide but everyone has been on me about since freshman year.\n\nThanks for reading :)",

      "text": "Specialization. An art degree is essentially useless unless it\u2019s from like THE French art school. However a degree in industrial design can be useful and employable. My friend\u2019s dad got his degree in industrial design and worked doing interior design at a Mitsubishi plant before it closed down. They have decent [pay](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/mobile/industrial-designers.htm). If you go to a school with a decent design program and an amazing CS program like UIUC you might be able to focus on UX and get a degree in graphic design and might be able to get your foot in the door at some tech companies.",

      "text": "I think if you're getting into art you need a lot of financial literacy, and you have to be prepared to work several jobs. Fortunately, artistic skills can be very versatile so there are jobs out there for you.\n\nThere are some online magazines like *It's nice that* that hold annual events where they publish graduate student portfolios (mostly design students) so they can get a job. Now design itself can be used in so many areas, there are people that work designing t-shirts for band merch, designing posters or videography for stores and concerts. Observe your surroundings when going to a shopping center, for example, a lot of it is design. And *somebody* needs to make that, therefore there are jobs out there for artistic people.\n\nThe game is mostly about researching what other people do (animators, illustrators, designers, etc) and getting your skills up to that so you can build a good portfolio and apply for jobs. It never hurts to have a passion project either, let's say you want to make publish a comic book. A lot of comic book publishers take in submissions, if you can pitch it properly you might get your project out there, you can add it as a credit, add it to your CV and you could get money from it too.\n\nArt school is very expensive, so I'd suggest researching a university that has a good art program and offers scholarships you can apply to. Overall I think it's best to invest in good equipment rather than spending so much just to go to college. \n\nI hope you can choose what's best for you. Good luck.",
