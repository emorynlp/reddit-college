  "text": "If this is not the correct subreddit for this, please let me know. \n\nThis is mainly directed towards  international students, but anybody can answer! I\u2019m from Canada and I\u2019ve been having trouble deciding whether or not I want to apply to US colleges (late, I know). It\u2019s been really stressing me out because I want to put myself out there and try because we never know what could happen, right? But I also don\u2019t want to put so much time and effort and get rejected. Not really sure what this is for, I guess I just wanted to hear what others thought haha! Anyways hope everybody reading this has a great day and good luck with applications! \ud83d\ude0a",
