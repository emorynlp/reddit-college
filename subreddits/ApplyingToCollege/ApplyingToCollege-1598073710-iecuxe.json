College is only a flare of time in your life. Keep learning and you'll be ok.\n\nSchool gonna be online/test cancelled? chill, you can't do anything about it. Enjoy life while it lasts.\n\nStressed out? chill, look back to your worries last week/month/year, they seem minuscule. Your worries now will too in no time.\n\nFeeling unproductive? chill, you're just a high schooler. play video games or whatever, do what you love. you don't have to manage your time like bill gates. Enjoy it while it lasts\n\nSad, depressed? sending love. you'll be fine. Know that you're loved no matter where you go. keep rocking.\n\nHey, we're all gonna be ok. Every single one of us. It's going to be fine. Life is full of bumps, but we'll pull through. It's ok to not feel ok though. Just chill, and enjoy.\n\nSending good vibes.",

      "text": "I agree that you should try not to get stressed or anxious about college apps. That being said, starting your application early and finishing early so you have more time to perfect is what I would reccomend doing (went through this shit last year). After I submitted my applications, and had time to reflect, I realized that a lot of my stress came from feeling like I was not being productive or putting out my best work because I was procrastinating. I agree, don't sacrifice your health and sanity by only doing college apps, but also don't sacrifice your health and sanity by not doing it either. \n\nSince submitting my apps, I started trying to change myself for the better, and not procrastinate, so I am going to give 2 tips that worked for me, but of course may not be the right solution for everyone. \n\n1. START EARLY: Start working early so you can achieve the best you can while putting in less work per day on average. Take some portion if the day (doesn't matter if it is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or however long you want) and work on your apps. A side effect of this is that a majority of the time, you will have finished your work way before a deadline, and you can spend the time from when you finished your work to the deadline proofreading and perfecting your work through tiny changes rather than approaching the deadline stressed about completing it.\n\n2. USE A CHECKLIST: assigning yourself smaller, manageable tasks daily will leave you feeling accomplished, while also working towards a larger overall goal. (I've found this is a good thing to do not just for school work but for everything)\n\nAside from that, just don't be too hard on yourself. Take pride in the work you do, and take breaks if you are starting to stress out, but limit this break to 1-2 days max, if not you will start stressing about not working. \n\nGood luck to you all you guys doing apps. YOU GOT THIS!!!",
