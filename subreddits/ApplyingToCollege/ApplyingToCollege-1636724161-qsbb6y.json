      "text": "Well most colleges that have ED tend to also defer and reject, but the exact percentages that get deferred vs rejected vs accepted vary greatly from school to school so it's hard to tell just based on the percentages for deferred students since not all colleges release this information. However, since most colleges defer and reject, I would think Harvey Mudd does as well.",
