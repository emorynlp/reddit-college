  "title:": "Where should I talk about these two things on my UC application?",
  "text": "Hi! So I'm working on my UC application and there's two particular things I'd like to talk about. I'm thinking of putting them in the \"Additional information\" section that immediately follows where you enter your academic history, OR in the \"Additional comments\" section under personal insight, at the end of the application. Here are my two situations:\n\n1) I want to talk about my junior year grades (particularly AP Biology and AP Physics, both of which I got D's in). Given just 550 characters I could so far only fit what I had to say about this (after several revisions and shortening adjustments) in the additional \\*info\\* section after academic history, which I figured would fit there since it does immediately follow where they'd see I'd had two D's in junior year.\n\n2) I want to briefly mention that I plan to take further community college courses during next summer (after I graduate HS and before starting college). Basically my plan is, living in California, to complete several CC courses that are articulated at some of my priority colleges (UCLA, UCI, Davis, etc.) where I want to major in biochemistry. I'll have already done general chemistry, calculus 1 and 2, introductory biochemistry, introductory biotechnology (if applicable) at CC, while I plan to clear other required classes and whatnot with AP credit. After I graduate HS, I'll be able to take *more* CC courses as I would no longer be restricted to 11 credits a semester, which I currently am due to being a HS student. \n\nNot sure where to talk about this second thing, but I really do want to include it because it would hopefully show that I'm taking my intended major and everything more seriously than my grades in AP Bio/Physics would probably indicate.\n\nSo where should I ideally talk about each of these situations? One in additional info and one in additional comments? Or both in additional info? Thank you!",
