  "text": "A lot of students build school lists based on \"safety\" schools that aren't actually safe at all. E.g., UW's non-resident admissions rate is a 51%. Safe, right?\n\nWell, their non-resident CS admissions % is, [according to their own breakdowns](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/by-the-numbers/), 4%. Uh.\n\nI would really like to write a post for the community about the **actual** admissions rates for popular faux-safety CS (and potentially engineering) programs. I'm starting the research process but I figured that people on this sub probably have the sauce.\n\nSo if you want to contribute, please share the school name along with the general application rate and CS/Engineering rate, and your source! Thank you!\n\n**Others I can think of in this somewhat deceptive category**: Maryland College Park, Wisconsin Madison, Purdue, WPI / RPI, Umass Amherst.",
