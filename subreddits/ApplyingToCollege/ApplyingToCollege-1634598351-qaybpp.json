They shape their classes with people of different races from different places alongside the full pay kids with connections. You need more than just a test score at these places. \n\nFor the next tier, say T30 schools, the score will help. They still shape their classes, but they usually have room for academic stars.  \n\nFor T50 schools, it may help the most because it could mean a large merit scholarship. Look very hard at these. School loans aren\u2019t your friend. \n\nMy advice is to try for a large scholarship instead of trying to use the score for admission at a very top school.\n\nGood luck",
