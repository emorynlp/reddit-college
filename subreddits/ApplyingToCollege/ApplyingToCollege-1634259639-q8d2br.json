  "text": "for the academic/honor society section, is there a way to report what they are without \"providing the highest level of leadership\"? actually, for all of the sections. it asks how many youre in, then the only way to put what youre in is to click a number for highest level of leadership. can i just click 2 for total number then not put \"highest level of leadership\" for any? bc national hispanic scholar doesnt really have leadership positions",
