  "text": "Hi everyone! I hope to gather insights from the community for some college suggestion.\n\nI'm an asian male from Singapore who is passionate about technology and entrepreneurship. My primary intention of applying to US College is for its Entrepreneurial environment.\n(Desired Major: Computer Science / Information Systems)\n\nHence schools with very entrepreneurial environment is super important to me!\nAlso, financial aid may be an area of concern for me but I'm also considering securing scholarship locally and internationally.\n\nLove to hear from you guys!\n\nThanks in advance!",
