They also spend money and contribute to local taxes anytime they buy food, gas, pay living expenses and shop or travel.\" To answer your question, those who can pay full price are welcome. Those who are clueless are just donating application fees.",

I help a lot of internationals coming from Peru and generally most universities don't go harder on internationals, especially safety schools that often struggle to attract a lot of international applicants. Easy diversity and whatnot.\n\nBut money plays a factor. Since internationals get just about nothing from public schools and their admission rates can be adversely affected if they need a lot of aid from private ones, that can be difficult to deal with. A lot of popular private safeties don't have the deep pockets for international aid. \n\nAssuming you have the money to afford the school though, there's really not much of a drop for international admissions rates.",

You can either ask for financial aid or not ask for it you can't be like my parents will pay 30k give me 10k (you can fill CSS profile where you can indicate that your parents/family members are willing to pay x amount of money) do your research because a lot of colleges don't give financial aid to international students, feel free to DM me if you have other questions",
