  "title:": "US Citizen living in the UK for past 7 years; what would my application process look like?",
  "text": "As in the title, I was born and brought up in the US (still have family there), but we moved to the UK a while ago for work. I studied at an American International school and as such will have a High School Diploma and have taken AP classes. I am mainly thinking of applying to Liberal Arts colleges (Amherst, Carleton, Macalester, etc.) and my counselor thinks I'd look better as an international applicant. Nearly everything I've read contradicts this and just purely based on stats they seem to accept many more domestic students.\n\n* I have a valid US Passport\n   * Family in US (though I don't live with them)\n* I have Indefinite Leave to Remain in UK and have applied for citizenship\n   * Been here (UK) since 5th grade\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help clear up my confusion and let me know if there's any more info needed.",
