      "text": "You cannot apply for medicine in the US right after Grade 12. First you need to do an undergraduate degree in something (could be anything as long as you take the prerequisite classes for medicine). Then you do the MCAT, get a good score. After this you apply to med school in the US which by the way is extremely competitive.",

Acceptance rates are really low though.
