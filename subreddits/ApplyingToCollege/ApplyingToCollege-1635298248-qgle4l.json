  "text": "Specifically essays like NYU\u2019s which is \n a \u201cWhy us\u201d essay. I\u2019ve noticed from advice I\u2019ve gotten that it\u2019d be more useful to implement specifics about the school regarding professors or unique programs and how you would fit into them for academic goals. I know that it\u2019s not just all academics but generally when writing the essay I should be following this path right?",

      "text": "I believe so. The NYU Supplement asks about the interest in your particular major, so if your major is academic based then you should probably try and specify what about that particular major interests you so much at this particular school\n\nAlso, just a note for reference, I'm pretty sure they can tell when someone namedrops a professor without really even knowing them/just for the sake of namedropping, so I'd personally be a bit more careful when it comes to that",
