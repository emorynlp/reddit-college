  "text": "Should I say that I am a National Merit SF on my Common App? I saw somewhere on here that USC may reject NMSFs at a higher rate than non NMSFs because there is an automatic scholarship for national merits. Could it be a smart move just to omit it from my additional info section? My awards section is good without it, and I have a solid SAT. I really appreciate it!",
