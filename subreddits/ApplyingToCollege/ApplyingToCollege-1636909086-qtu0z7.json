  "text": "1. you can bring up to 30 credits in-- become a first semester sophomore without even taking a single class at canisius. you can bring credits in through ap class, just regular high school classes, or classes taken through other colleges. \n2. honors college is awesome-- hella cool classes ( why wouldn't you want to take a class called black mirror reflections, where you just analyze black mirror episodes, to fulfill a requirement? ), a thesis at the end ( full semester to write with help from a professor of your choosing about pretty much anything you'd want to write about ), and a separate lounge just for honors kids\n3. transparency-- anybody can sit in on the undergraduate senate meetings for the full length of the meeting & they are always at the same time and place every week so you know exactly what's being voted on, what members of the senate think, and can bring up any concerns you have \n4. smaller college-- would you rather walk 20+ minutes to get to class of like a billion people where the professor doesn't know your name/ you have to work incredibly hard to stand out or walk across the quad to your freshman class of 20 people ( and that's considered a big class! ) where your professor knows you\n5. like literally I can not stress enough you're going to get so much more personalized attention and a much deeper connection with your classmates, professors, and all your coaches/advisors than you will at a bigger school \n6. free to apply, no supplementals, hella scholarships and financial help\n7. uh I know this was kinda a short list but if you have any questions lemme know \n\n[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/iw3ufx/why_i_simp_for_a_school_nobodys_heard_of_canisius/) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/juo7br/why_i_simp_for_a_school_nobodys_ever_heard_of/)",
