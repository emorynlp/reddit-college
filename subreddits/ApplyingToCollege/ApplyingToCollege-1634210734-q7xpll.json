  "title:": "Reverse Chance Me, a student with stats all over the place who has no idea where to go.",
  "text": "**Demographics:** Asian Male from NY State.\n\n**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science\n\n**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1530 SAT (770 Math, 760 EBRW)\n\n**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.7UW/3.7W. Ranks aren't out yet. I'm not sure how to compare the competitive-ness of my school to others, but mine is probably moderate. There's growth over time in my GPA from my freshman to sophomore year, but my junior year reversed that trend because I struggled with online learning. I'm currently working as hard as I can in my senior year to fix that.\n\n**Coursework:** Unfortunately, my courses haven't been very rigorous. I've only taken AP World History and  AP US History and got a 4 and 5 on them respectively. I'm currently taking AP European History and AP Government & Politics. My school unfortunately does not offer any AP Computer Science classes.\n\n**Awards:** National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist.\n\n**Extracurriculars:** Lots of these are left intentionally vague.\n\nBlack Belt, spent years as an instructor teaching children martial arts. A good amount (not sure how to quantify this) of volunteer work in the community. LOTS of freelance and hobbyist programming work. I've started lots of services and websites over the years, some of which have accrued tens of thousands of users. This is probably one of the strongest parts of my application but I don't want to get very specific here. Have been in my school band for years and do marching band at school sports games, concerts, and parades. The usual clubs, Sci Oly, language clubs, Mathletes, etc. Not any particularly exciting roles in any of them.\n\n**Essays/LORs/Other:**  I believe my Common App essay to be very strong; I'm not so sure how to judge it but I've always considered myself a strong writer. LORs are probably meh or average, I had to ask my sophomore year teachers because I don't think I really connected with any teachers that much during online learning during my Junior year.\n\nA lot of my teachers and myself suspect that I have ADHD for reasons I won't get too deep into, and this might be the reason my grades and classes are not very great compared to my SAT score. I'm currently in process of getting evaluated for ADHD, but I won't get results back until December which is past the EA/ED deadline. If my test results come back positive, I'll write about it in the additional info section of the Common App for any RD/rolling schools. I also have written the COVID essay about some special circumstances, explaining a bit as to why I'm not taking AP Calc and why the pandemic impacted my grades, but I'm not too confident colleges will care about it.\n\nThanks for any help. I'm really worried and stressed out about my school performance ruining my aspirations at any better colleges, especially because it's too late to undo the past. I'm mostly looking at schools along the East Coast, but I'm open to applying to a few other schools anywhere in the country really. Also, suggest the best CS schools that offer full-ride scholarships to National Merit Finalists so that I can have a nice backup plan if I get rejected from all of my reaches. I've been looking at UT Dallas so far, but I'm not sure if there's any better options. Thanks!",

He was out of state too, and that made it significantly harder for him to get into those schools (UC Santa Barbara is where he decided to go to). UT Dallas is good, also would look into University of Washington and possibly even Georgia Tech. \n\nAlso, could you tell me how you managed to build up your websites? I don't want to know the specific websites, just some tips on how you built up the user base and got traffic and such. Feel free to DM me about that.",

I've made a lot of friends in communities for video games and other subjects just by joining Discord servers and being mature & friendly. Lots of my projects grow just because my friends find them useful and they share it to others from there, and exponential growth takes over. I've also been able to get the attention of moderately sized content creators (<500k YouTube subs) by being active in their servers and they end up hiring me to make things like Discord bots or sites for their community. You can find a lot of other programmers this way, and I've gotten invites to work on projects with them. TLDR, I don't spend too much time working on advertising/marketing, but I make products that I'm sure other people will want to share.",

I've felt pretty disheartened and suffered from imposter syndrome a lot because everyone with similar SAT scores as me or is a National Merit Semifinalist has MUCH, MUCH better stats in other areas. It especially sucks since I feel like if I had tried a bit harder than I did or cared a bit more I could have done so much better.",
