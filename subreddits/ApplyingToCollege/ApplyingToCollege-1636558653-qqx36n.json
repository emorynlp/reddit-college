  "text": "sophomore, want to major in cs/programming/software engineering \n\nBasically, my Mom only wants me to consider applying to one college: michigan tech. she doesn't want me to even apply to another school. i don't want to go to tech because \n1. software isn't the focus of most courses\n2. i feel like i could get into a school with a better software program if i tried\n3. my family is abusive and i want to get as far away from them as possible when i graduate.\n\nmy mom's reasons are:\n1. it's cheap\n2. it's in state\n3. i'd be closer to her\n4. my aunt went there, so like 5$ of legacy\n\ni'd rather go to university of washington or caltech. what's your opinion?",

There\u2019s time. Gather info to bolster reasons why other schools are worth it. Don\u2019t bash Michigan Tech. She\u2019ll just shut down. Additionally, consider talking to your aunt about it to maybe get her on your side\u2026 she may have realized how far Michigan Tech *didn\u2019t* get her.",
