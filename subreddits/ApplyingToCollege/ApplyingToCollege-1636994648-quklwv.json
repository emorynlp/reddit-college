  "text": "I\u2019m an OOS student applying to UC schools.\n\n1. If I took honor courses during high school, do I report them as HL (UC-approved honors level)? Does HL only count for students in California?\n\n2. I took multiple businesses classes throughout high school. What subject area/course category do they fall under? The closest description I could find was \u201celective- interdisciplinary.\u201d Do I list them under academic history, or do I add them onto the extracurriculars as additional coursework?",

      "text": "1. Unfortunately UC does not consider honors courses taken outside of California as honors on their application. They do want to know about courses that your school designates as AP though. \n\n2. If these business classes were taught at your high school you definitely want to include them in your high school academic history, and it probably doesn\u2019t matter exactly how, so long as the A-G requirements are met.",
