Seriously AP Chem is kicking my ass and I kind of need it as a chem-related major. \n\n\\-Not finding a job earlier\n\n\\- Taking AP Classes just for the gpa boost.

The only art class I've taken was Photography in freshman year and it was just to fulfill a 1 year VPA requirement to graduate.

Hopefully it can calm someone's anxiety :)\n\n* Not immediately getting into the metagame of college apps right at the start of freshman year (basically finding this sub)\n   * Although I started taking the SAT/ACT during the fall of my junior year, I didn't start looking at college apps even a little bit until the summer before my senior year. I had to work hard that summer and fall, but the timeline worked well for me\n* Not starting my SAT prep sophomore year\n   * I took an SAT class during the fall of my junior year and took two SATs that fall. After that, I ended up with a score I was happy with.\n* Skimping out on an AP exam sophomore year\n   * I agree with you here that AP exams are important -- I got college credit for all of mine! But that's not the case at every college, so if taking an AP exam would overwhelm you, don't sweat skipping it.\n* Skimping out on an AP class Jr year\n   * I skipped out on APUSH my junior year, and I'm honestly really glad I made that decision. I got to become more involved with orgs within my school and got to focus on cross country -- both things that made me much happier than APUSH would've.\n* Not starting a club or ever really being a leader in my school\n   * You don't have to start a club, but I do agree that leadership positions were valuable for me.\n* Not starting college shopping until summer before Senior year\n   * Don't sweat this till you're graduated! College shopping will be a ton easier once you know where you're going and what your dorm layout will be like!\n* Never doing \"research\" with a professor or whatever / Never looking into pre-college programs / Never having a legitimate job, only doing freelance work / Not doing enough with my summers\n   * I don't think any of these are really necessary, and I was in the same boat as OP. Didn't do research, no clue what a pre-college program is, nannied during my summers but didn't have a \"real\" job. Colleges just want to see that you can be committed to *something*, but that something doesn't need to have a fancy title.\n* talking about ECs in the A2C discord server\n   * Not in the Discord so I don't really understand this/why you regret it.\n* Not forming a close enough relationship with any teachers besides participating in class / Not forming a relationship with the head of the school (counselors, Principle, etc)\n   * These relationships are valuable to me so I agree with OP on this one for sure! But I never really went out of my way -- I got to know these people through my classes and leadership positions.\n\nOverall, I had a nice balance and didn't try doing anything too overwhelming or unattainable. Be kind to yourselves and try to meet yourselves where you are. You're doing great, and the work you've put in is more than enough!",
