  "text": "so my safety-ish school sends out acceptances in three \"rounds\": regular acceptances, then honors acceptances, then bs/md program acceptances. (so, if you got into bs/md, you'd receive the regular acceptance around mid-nov, honors acceptance around mid-dec, and bs/md in jan-feb.) \n\nso the regular & honors acceptances are both, like, safeties for me. getting a GOOD merit scholarship isn't, and the bs/md (ok it's actually ba or bs/dmd program but im js bs/md for like easier reading haha) program isnt either. \n\nso im looking at my regular acceptance and im like, \"wow it's so weird that i got accepted to MAJOR. maybe INTENDEDMAJOR is, like, within the department of MAJOR?\" so then i go on common app, and..... NO, I JUST CLICKED THE WRONG MAJOR. now, this wouldnt be a big deal.... except for the fact that all of my essays, including my bachelors/dmd one, SPECIFICALLY reference this major bc its like unconventional for a pre-dental student and it was like a whole moment..... and then i CLICKED THE WRONG ONE OMG. \n\nso anyway i submitted an appeal to change my major LOL?!?! i mean its not a big deal but also how could i mess up abt smth this big. what if this jeopardizes my scholarships .. </3 </3 </3 </3",
