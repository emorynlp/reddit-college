  "title:": "Possible previous college course from 20 years ago: should I include it?",
  "text": "Without diving into too much crazy detail, due to a financial aid snafu, I had to drop going to college back in the Fall semester of 2002. I didn't complete any classes, but I didn't technically withdraw either. I didn't even pay for them--out of pocket or otherwise.\n\nNow, for the past two years, I've been going to community college, getting good grades, and I'm now ready to transfer to a uni. Both my current CC and the instructions on the uni site STRESS that I need to include any previous colleges attended. The problem is, I'm not even sure where to begin with requesting this information or if I should add it at all. I don't understand why they are stressing this to begin with, I didn't get anything by being at that previous school nearly 20 years ago.\n\nWhat do I do here? Is there some major database where they type my name in and see all the schools I attended? How could they find this out if I don't include it? This seems like a hassle that's just making this process 10 times worse than it already is.\n\n**An update:** So I tried to request the transcripts from the college but they said the account was on hold and I had to call them (they are currently closed.) Secondly, the debt I owed them I discharged nearly a decade ago during a bankruptcy. Thirdly, none of the credits (even if they did grant/grade them) are transferrable.\n\nHere's my biggest question, how would the university I'm applying to even find out I went here. When I spoke to a counselor about this, the answer I got was, \"They just find out. You have to put everything down.\" \n\nSo, is there some secret name/SSN search they put me through where they see that I once attended *X* school? If someone knowledgeable in this area could answer or reach out via PM, that would help me greatly, otherwise I'm in for a headache here.",
