At the same time, ask them what else you can be doing to improve your chances of being admitted as a transfer student.  If you do end up going this route, it will be paramount that you do as well as possible in your CC classes.

I don't have much knowledge about this, but as others have said, after two years at wake tech, if you keep up a certain GPA you have guaranteed transfer to NC state, but you also need to make sure you meet any program specific requirements for your major. I know for NC State, computer science is in the engineering school, so there are probably courses in math and science they'll expect you to take while at wake tech. It's definitely doable, just make sure you contact admissions to make sure you understand the exact requirements well ahead of time so you can plan ahead.",

      "text": "I had a 2.45 gpa in high school, took a gap year working to figure out my shit, and then went to community college, discovered computer science at my local CC. Put in my best effort over the next twoish years and transferred to a top 20 CS school (at least according to cs[rankings.org](https://CSrankings.org) ). It's very possible as long as you try your best and keep an open mind. You're more than welcome to PM me for more advice other than what I give here\n\nFirst off I took the most difficult classes offered at my community college regarding technical classes which included Calculus-based Physics I and II, Calc I-III, and and my gen eds. I overall had a 3.75 which is pretty good but obviously not the best but my last semester I got all A's so as long as you keep the trend that your grades are consistently getting better than that's a positive thing colleges will see. It made all the difference when I was deferred to my top choice transfer school and sent in a Letter of Continued Interest where I pointed out that my final semester grades were all technical classes and straight A's. If you're community college offers honors classes, it's ideal to take them if you feel that you can do well. This shows that you can handle the workload.\n\nMake sure to look at the NC state school's CS curriculum requirements. Try to see if they have a transfer guide or some sort of thing where they list out the requirements to official declare that major. After figuring out what required classes are need to to declare CS, take those classes at your CC school and DO WELL in them. This is really paramount because you're showing evidence that you're capable of handling the CS curriculum there if you can knock out the basics. \n\nI don't know the situation at your community college regarding CS, but my community college had a very sparse CS program so it was quite limited in terms of what was available. This is where being a self-starter is really important. I was curious about iOS development so I went to the subreddit and looked for recommended resources, found Angela Yu's Udemy Course and went through the vast majority of it and was able to learn Swift that way. Key point is this, take it upon yourself to do your own projects and learn coding. There are so many resources online, you can go to the learnprogramming subreddit for guidance on where to start. Im not gonna go over which language is best here, do your own research, but please do do do your own projects so you're able to talk about them in your applications. This shows initiative and passion, which is what they'll want to see. It doesn't matter whether its a small game, app, website, etc. Just build anything, that's how you learn the most anyways, through hands-on experience. \n\nI don't know about my own essay, because I dont want to toot my own horn. But I seriously did put a lot of effort into my own essay (started months before application season began), and I really think my essay was what kept me in the game instead of being rejected outright. Have people read your essay get feedback early and quickly, thats what helped the most for me. If you have a hard time knowing what to write, theres this quote from Stephen King that I love from his book On Writing, \"It doesn't matter what you write, as long as it's the truth.\" Don't worry about being creative or original to stand out. If you just focus on telling your truth, you'll end up with something more authentic than if you tried to focus on standing out without any regard for your personal story and what you have to say. \n\nSome books and resources that helped me,\n\nUltralearning by Scott H. Young, you don't have a be an ultralearner, just applying some of the ideas here will help you anyhow\n\nHow to be a Straight-A Student by Cal Newport\n\nCal Newport's blogs on study techniques\n\n[https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/11/do-it-now/](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/11/do-it-now/)  this blog post on time management was extremely helpful even though his scenario was extreme, you'll still be able to glean some insight from it\n\nThis is as much as I can think of off the top of my head. If you have more questions for me, please feel free to PM me. I don't check reddit too often, but I'll keep an eye out for the next couple of days just in case.",

      "text": "Just wanted to say, I'm in the exact same spot as you... and it sucks. Learning the consequences of our actions is the biggest slap in the face I'll ever receive, and I wish I could just turn back time and do it all over again. I actually attended a university after High School, but dropped out after the first semester. Leaving me with a terrible gpa and academic probation. I felt so lost and had no clue where to go. Shortly after that I decided to just work. Worked until I realized I wanted to go to school. Not even for the degree, but for the experience as well. I feel that when I look back at my life from when I'm older, not going to school will be the biggest thing I'll regret. \n\nSo the steps I'm taking now; applying towards a transfer degree from a CC to redeem my gpa, then make the switch after 2 years. It seems like you have everything figured out and a good solid plan. Keep those goals in mind and keep striving towards them. ***Find out extra things you can do to stand above the average CC applicant***. Internships, employment, etc. These will help you guarantee your chances of getting in. So study what classes you need to take from each school in order to complete a successful transfer. Call an advisor from both schools as well to help solidify what needs to be done. Best of luck and I hope it goes well! Keep us updated!",

I see it as a \"second chance\" to open your doors to some pretty top universities. Keep in mind to get as close to a 4.0 as possible. With that GPA you can even receive some scholarships to college. Using myself as an example, I graduated early from high school because it was not a great culture fit and I knew with my GPA I would have trouble getting into top schools anyways. I worked really hard at CC, got a 4.0 and lots of internships/ec's under my belt and was able to get a full ride to UC Berkeley for the summer and a ton of help from admission officers and counselors to transfer in the fall :)",

      "text": "u/purple_legion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour best bet is to talk to the folks at your destination university.  If you want to go to NC State, speak with NC state about what credits they accept and transfer directly into your anticipated Bachelor program.  Matriculation agreements will generally give you 3rd year/Junior standing, but that doesn't mean you won't have some program specific coursework.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGPA requirements can be both school and program specific.  At least 2.0 (as cited below) will get you a matriculation into NC universities, but the program requirements for your particular school of choice may be higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour admissions/enrollment folks are probably great at your Community College, and won't steer you wrong for your particular Associate degree... but if the state university recommends something different, best to go with them to make sure all credits transfer into your BS degree program.\n\n[https://www.waketech.edu/post/wt-news-story/3207](https://www.waketech.edu/post/wt-news-story/3207)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.waketech.edu/programs-courses/credit/transfer-choices](https://www.waketech.edu/programs-courses/credit/transfer-choices)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.waketech.edu/programs-courses/credit/transfer-choices](https://www.waketech.edu/programs-courses/credit/transfer-choices)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/sites/default/files/basic-pages/academic-programs/attachments/caa\\_tac\\_08.2016.pdf](https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/sites/default/files/basic-pages/academic-programs/attachments/caa_tac_08.2016.pdf)   \n\nD. A. Transfer of Credits\r  \nThe CAA establishes the procedures governing the transfer of credits for students who transfer from\r  \na North Carolina Community College to a constituent institution of The University of North Carolina.\r  \nThe CAA does not address admission to a specific institution or to a specific major within an\r  \ninstitution.\r  \n1. Eligibility\r  \nTo be eligible for the transfer of credits under the CAA, the student must graduate from the\r  \ncommunity college with an Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degree and have an\r  \noverall Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and a grade of \"C\" or better in all CAA\r  \ncourses. Students who do not complete the degree are eligible to transfer credits on a course-by\r  \ncourse basis.\r  \n2. Definition of General Education Courses and Pre-major Courses\r  \nThe Associate in Arts (AA) and Associate in Science (AS) degree programs in the North Carolina\r  \nCommunity College System require a total of sixty or sixty-one semester hours credit for graduation\r  \n(see Appendix F) and are transferable to any UNC institution. The overall total is comprised of both\r  \nlower-division general education and pre-major courses. This curriculum reflects the distribution of\r  \ndiscipline areas commonly included in institution-wide, lower-division general education\r  \nrequirements for the baccalaureate degree.\r  \nThe Associate in Arts (AA) and Associate in Science (AS) degree programs include general education\r  \nrequirements that represent the fundamental foundation for success and include study in the areas\r  \nof English composition, communications, humanities and fine arts, natural sciences and mathematics,\r  \nand social and behavioral sciences. Within these discipline areas, community colleges must include\r  \nopportunities for the achievement of competence in reading, writing, oral communication,\r  \nfundamental mathematical skills, and basic computer use. Students must meet the receiving\r  \nuniversity's foreign language and/or health and physical education requirements, if applicable, prior\r  \nto or after transfer to the senior institution. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/transfer/north-carolina/](https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/transfer/north-carolina/)\n\n[https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/transfer/north-carolina/#baccalaureate-degree-plans-bdps](https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/transfer/north-carolina/#baccalaureate-degree-plans-bdps)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/future-students/index.php](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/future-students/index.php)",
