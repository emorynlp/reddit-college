  "text": "I was filling out the common app and I had a few questions:\n\n1. In the activities section, I've listed a position for which I invested time every week this year, but only started july of last year. I've listed participation level as 11th and 12th grade. Should I keep the weeks/year as 41/yr (which is this year's commitment) or put something else? \n2. I started this EC as part of a competition but stopped in the beginning of jan bc of a disagreement w my cofounder. So I restarted a separate initiative (but doing something v similar) and continued it till now. Should I list them as two separate things?                                  \nNext 3 are for the honors section:\n3. I've got a certificate of 'best student' in a few subjects, can I mention this?\n4. can I combine 2 honors? eg: receiving institutional prizes for two different subjects\n5. is qualifying your national olympiad to participate in a regional olympiad (it was a little different this year, you had qualify this to get into the actual international round, but I didn't qualify further) counted as an honor?",

If they're the same grouo giving it, I think so \n5. I do not understand what the question is asking fully, but I think so.",

          "text": "2 - For the comptetition, we developed a tutoring/mentorship program for underserved students, so most of our time went in R&D and some execution at the end. we made it to the national finals (one of 12 schools selected) in december\n\nin jan, we went our separate ways becuase my cofounder was being unethical and didn't have any vision/passion. I developed my own tutoring program in partenrship with another adult run nonprofit and ran it, and now I've expanded it internationally after narrowing down the target audience\n\nnot sure whether I should mention these as separate things and how it would reflect on me\n\n5 - this olympiad had three stages - national, regional, and worldwide. I qualified the nationals and made it to regionals but didn't qualify for the worldwide stage. Can I just mention qualifying for regionals as an honor? It is an official olympiad so I thought it'd be significant",

              "text": "thank you for the clarification.\n\nAs for 2: I think your fine either way. It really depends on whether you consider them to be \"seperate\". From how you describe it, you could do it either way but I'd lean towards seperate. Side bonus of giving you more room to describe them with two bots. If you decide to write about them as a single thing that's fine too, but I wouldn't dwell ( or probably mention) the reason for the split. It would be easy for things to go awry. Just mention that you did things with a partnership, jargon jargon, and then moved on to your solo thing xyz. \n\n5. Yeah that's  great.",
