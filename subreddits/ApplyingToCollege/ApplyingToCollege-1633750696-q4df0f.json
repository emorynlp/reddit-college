  "text": "Hey everyone, im a senior applying for colleges majoring in computer science. I was looking at different computer science schools such as UIUC, CMU, UW, Purdue, Georgia Tech, etc.\n\nI have a 3.2 gpa. Weighted. Yes ik it is very sad. I have a 31 act but im retaking it in a couple weeks and expect 33+. I know my gpa is absolutely terrible, but realistically where could i get in? \n\n(Not sure if it makes much of a difference but im a latino male applying from Ohio.)",

      "text": ">but realistically where could i get in?\n\nYou\u2019ve listed some of the most sought-after schools by prospective CS majors. CMU is tied for #1 CS ranking with MIT and Stanford; their middle 50% ACT score ranges from 35 to 36. Not sure what the typical GPA is, but I\u2019m betting it\u2019s commensurate with a 35/36 ACT score.",

      "text": "Like, I don\u2019t think you could get into UIUC or Georgia Tech. Just cause your gpa is like super low for these schools. Same thing is doubly true for CMU. Try looking at: University of Portland, Worcester Poly, Rensselaer Poly, UWash-Bothell. Since they have strong outcomes for CS with higher admit rates.
