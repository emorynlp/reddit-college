I'm an incoming freshman at Grinnell College and my freshman tutorial (mandatory freshman class about an unorthodox subject but teaches you how to research, write college papers, discuss with others, build relationships with professors, etc.) Is a Critical Analysis of Pokemon! I was excited yet nervous because I like Pokemon but never had the Nintendo consoles or cable TV too keep up the newer generations. I played Pokemon snap, Fire red, watched some Pokemon and Pokemon diamond and pearl on TV, and that's about it. I got Pokemon Go on my phone, but that's about as up to date on Pokemon I am up on. I'm afraid I'll be behind on such a cool class that I know many people will be envious of :/ I'm sorry!",

      "text": "This is super cool, and I love the effort you've put into the questions!\n\nI do have some comments and suggestions to make regarding specific questions, though:\n\n**Question 4:** While Mandibuzz technically has the best type advantage in the matchup with STAB Fly and no Super Effective damage from Pangoro, there's an argument for Mimikyu being better due to quad-effective Moonblast and Disguise to practically negate the type disadvantage. Life Orb Pangoro can beat Mandibuzz by using SD on turn 1, Hammer Arm turn 2, Bullet Punch turn 3 if Mandibuzz flies turn 1. Conversely, even uninvested Mimikyu OHKOs with Moonblast and cannot be OHKO'd in return by anything because of its ability.\n\nBraviary also works better as a check than Mandibuzz with the stated movesets. Unboosted Fly is a guaranteed OHKO, while unboosted Superpower has a 62.5% chance to KO uninvested Pangoro, while LO Pangoro fails to OHKO in return without Stealth Rocks.\n\nI would **change some of the sets and Pokemon listed** to better give a single correct answer.\n\n**Question 11:** Mold Breaker Earthquake hits Elektross (sic) super effectively. Also, it's spelled 'Eelektross' with the extra E.\n\nThe only truly weakness-less Pokemon in the game is a **Pure Fire-type after using Burn Up.**\n\n**Question 12:** Iron Ball's a red herring - it doesn't increase the Pokemon's weight, if that was what you were going for. Heavy Slam hits at 60BP between those Pokemon, and will never be optimal. The Enigma Berry is also a Red Herring here - avoiding the healing from Super Effective damage turns out to not affect Rock Slide being the optimal choice. These calculations require usage of the damage formula and a preexisting knowledge of specific Pokemon weights, as a 120BP Heavy Slam actually does situationally beat out Rock Slide depending on Pokemon sets. **This might not be an AP-level question.**\n\n**Question 38:** The answer to this question is situational, depending on how much HP the opponents have and whether or not you need the Skarmory healthy for more opponents. Muddy Water is the obvious solution to hit both opponents super effectively while avoiding your own Skarmory, but 85% accuracy gives them a chance to hit you Toxic or Knock Off or something before going down. Surf's better accuracy makes it favorable for ending the battle, while Earthquake is a reliable midground if both opponents are already weakened.\n\n**I would recommend changing the player's available moves and Partner Pokemon to make the choice more clear-cut.**\n\n**Question 44:** While ChestoResto is a strong combination, Sitrus Belly Drum on its own is very potent and keeps momentum better as it doesn't require an extra turn to use. A strong argument can be made for either answer.\n\n**Change Sitrus Berry to Iapapa Berry, which does not synergize as well with Belly Drum without Substitute.**\n\n**Question 47:** The answer to this question is dependent on the Manaphy's set. If the Manaphy additionally has Tail Glow, which is admittedly rare in combination with Heart Swap, then +6 Z-Surf OHKOs Blissey. Even if it isn't Tail Glow, Rain Dance + Z-Surf at +3 will also OHKO 75% of the time. In either case, Blissey cannot retaliate in any significant manner and basically prays for repeated low rolls and no crits until Rain ends. If the Manaphy has neither Rain nor a Z move, then Blissey can be a correct answer.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are no hazards on the field and either Bastiodon or Mega Sableye (if Mega Sableye is an option) has not taken any prior damage, it can Metal Burst hoping to tank Manaphy's attack and OHKO in return. While Mega Sableye can do this on non-rain non-Z move sets, only Bastiodon can use this strategy on the heavier hitting sets. This requires the Beheeyem to not get an attack in before the Bastiodon can Metal Burst, which requires the Manaphy to attack immediately and the Beheeyem not target the Bastiodon, OR for the Bastiodon to speed creep the Beheeyem.\n\nI would recommend you **rewrite this question entirely**. Manaphy is too potent, we have no knowledge of the Player\u2019s other Pokemon in the doubles match, and there are three options that could potentially work here. A Singles battle would be much simpler to set up.\n\n**Question 51:** Trick Room Alakazam??? Besides being uselessly bad, the choice of TR setter results in the answer being heavily set related. Alakazam has a higher base speed than all of the answers, so depending on its EV and IV distribution, it can be faster or slower than Gengar and Lucario, both of which can OHKO it if they act first. \n\nAssuming standard TR build for 0 speed, both Snorlax and Parasect can win against the Alakazam. Uninvested Crunch or moderate attack invested Frustration from Snorlax OHKOs Zam, while only Z-Focus Blast Crit OHKOs in return. Leech Life from uninvested Parasect is also an OHKO, and crit Z-Psychic is again an OHKO in return. \n\n**All four answers are valid depending on sets.** Change Alakazam for a slower TR Setter, and differentiate Parasect and Snorlax more in the context of this question. \n\nReading this was a really fun trip, and I love the design of your essay questions. I look forward to your follow up answer post!",

          "text": "Okay, I have a few thoughts on this.\n\nQuestion 4: I think OP's intentions with the type effectiveness question were to focus on the **Scrappy** ability, which would allow Pangoro to hit both Mimikyu, Aegislash and Mandibuzz. Granted, it is a bit unclear what the correct answer is but, in all fairness, Collegeboard does litter their AP tests with unclear questions, especially in analysis.\n\nQuestion 11: Again, I think OP's intentions were looking at the general trend, rather than super specific sets, i.e. a Rampardos with Mold Breaker that knows EQ. Eelektross is **token** for not having a weakness due to Levitate, and so that's why it would be the best answer.\n\nQuestion 12: The Iron Ball is a Red Herring, as is the enigma berry, but of course, the course material of the AP Pokemon test is not covered in the question, yet I believe that it'd be easy to deduce Heavy Slam would be the best answer in this scenario since all the other moves will either heal or be not very effective. The set doesn't really matter in this case, since it would do more damage than steamroller, rock slide, or thunderbolt.\n\nQuestion 38: I do see your point here, but I believe OP was going for Min-Max-ing damage in a battle scenario, from more of an in-game standpoint rather than a Competitive standpoint. I think they were trying to go for, \"Earthquake can hit both pokemon, has more power than Bulldoze and doesn't hit my ally, so it's the correct answer\" in this scenario. Again, I believe it's about taking a look at how Collegeboard would do an AP test, and rather than looking at every possible outcome in the subsequent turns, they would have you give a reaction to a specific scenario (say within like a one-turn window).\n\nQuestion 44: I do completely agree with your logic here, it's not necessarily a good combination of berries as possible answers. This one has multiple answers.\n\nQuestion 47: Again, rather than being a competitive scene, I think OP's idea was that no other held-items or moves are assumed and that you would just be able to defend the next turn. In this specific scenario, I believe that Blissey was the right answer because it's clear that Manaphy has just gained a x3 boost in Sp. Atk, and therefore, a strong special wall would be optimal. This is where you can easily rule out Sableye and Bastiodon,  and Shuckle at that as well since Manaphy is a Water-type. I believe OP is not looking at this from a competitive scenario and rather a comprehensive whole. Again, battle scenarios can be very subjective so no other assumptions should be taken other than the information given in the questions. (as with **MOST** Collegeboard tests)\n\nQuestion 51: I think OP's intentions with this one were also pure-type matchups. Assuming **NOTHING ELSE** and just using the information given in the question (as you are to do on AP Exams), Parasect and Snorlax's base stats are the same, yet Parasect has the type advantage. And yes, TR Alakazam is not an optimal set, but I think OP was going for setting a specific scenario and just choosing a pokemon to set it rather than the OPTIMAL BEST competitive pokemon set.\n\nAll-in-all, the test is AP Pokemon man, not AP Smogon.",

              "text": "Thanks for your feedback! Here\u2019s a few more thoughts in return:\n\n**Question 4:** In my experience, good multiple choice questions have one strictly correct answer with one other similar, but technically incorrect answer. For this question, the reader has no indication whether having a 4X effective STAB move that OHKOs is more important than not being weak to a non-STAB priority move, so the correct answer is somewhat arbitrary. Bad Collegeboard questions are less clear-cut, but why aim for the bottom?\n\n**Question 11:** I agree that the question isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s factually not the only weakness-less Pokemon in the game. Including \u2018Fire-Types after using Burn Up\u2019 as an answer would still not make it a free question - you\u2019d be surprised how many people, me included, who initially thought they turned into Normal-Types after using the move!\n\n**Question 12:** Heavy Slam is *not* the move to use under 99% of situations. Burn Up turns Moltres into a pure Flying-type. Rock Slide is STAB Super Effective base 75. Heavy Slam is non-STAB and maxes at base 120 damage. The only case where you\u2019d want to Slam is if it\u2019s full physdef Moltres and you\u2019re 0-attack Golem-Alola, because only then does Enigmatic Berry\u2019s healing put a 120BP Heavy Slam consistently above Rock Slide. The problem with Enigmatic Berry being a red herring in this case is it actually affects Heavy Slam\u2019s viability on edge cases where the reader doesn\u2019t know both Golem-Alola and Moltres\u2019s weight stats. If the AP Pokemon syllabus require knowledge of specific Pokemon weights, then that\u2019s\u2026 kinda crazy. \n\n**Question 38:** The most correct answer by your reasoning is Muddy Water, which doesn\u2019t hit your allies anyway. That\u2019s the problem - Earthquake is an acceptable answer in some situations, as is Surf, depending on what is most valuable: power, accuracy, or not hitting your partner. \n\n**Question 47:** Part of defending against a threat is neutralizing it. Blissey does not adequately deal with +3 Manaphy, let alone +6. Chansey can, but with difficulty. I\u2019d feel much more comfortable with a hazer or a phazer to get rid of the boosts, or just enough raw defense and damage over time to beat it. Toxapex and Fini can do the first regardless of set, and Ferrothorn is the ultimate \u2018screw you\u2019 to Manaphy everywhere, so I would\u2019ve added one of those as the correct option. \n\nAlso, as the question was phased to specifically be in doubles, I\u2019d favor offensive strategies to take it out more, given that it\u2019s difficult to defensively wall a setup sweeper in doubles, which would make Bastiodon and Mega Sableye more appealing picks. It would be simple to change the question to singles format and pick similar, but better answers to remove any ambiguity from the situation. I don\u2019t recall AP Stats, Chem, Calc or Physics papers being *this* ambiguous, and this part of Pokemon is as objective and straightforward as anything on those papers. \n\n**Question 51:** Here\u2019s where taking the question with the given information and nothing else causes trouble. Assuming in-game sets with random EVs causes literally all four answers to be good. Assuming 0 speed TR Alakazam is hella unintuitive, and still generally puts Snorlax ahead of Parasect because Snorlax is hella bulky specially and Zam needs to hit a 70% accuracy move to hurt it. Again, it is *trivially* easy to pick a TR setter that fits the question better, which is all that I\u2019m suggesting.\n\nThe majority of this paper is exacting and specific and requires in-depth knowledge of cities and NPCs and quotes and story points, as well as a good understanding of breeding mechanics, *and* a firm understanding of battle mechanics and specific moves and strategies. \n\nFor example, question 36 requires knowledge that Grass Knot is a rare *special contact move*, while Bulldoze is a *physical non-contact move*, which is not immediately apparent, and question 33 possibly requires knowing that Magician works *after* the move finishes dealing damage, preventing it from stealing a Focus Sash if the item is used on that turn. (Though, one more point on that question: **Level 1 Alolan Rattata is the Pok\u00e9mon that should be listed**, because an equal-Level Alolan Raticate will not be OHKO\u2019d by either Delphox or Weavile, rendering the question pointless).\n\nIt\u2019s just a few battle-related questions that don\u2019t hold up to the standard set by the rest of the paper, which is why I wanted to improve them. \n\nAlso, Smogon, as per its full name, is University level content. An AP Pokemon test should cover introductory college-level content, right?",

Chimney later. I'm assuming this is the intended answer, as there is no beach at the base of Mt. Chimney, there is a hot spring.\n\n**17. No correct answers.** The braille text does not refer to Regigigas, it refers to the members of the Regi trio. This specific text is the original Ruby/Sapphire version, Regigigas didn't even exist at the time.\n\n**41. Both (C) and (D) are correct.** Tri Attack is the obvious answer, with a 30% chance of inflicting multiple possible status conditions, but Rock Climb also has a 20% chance to inflict Confusion. Big Malasada heals all of these.\n\n**43. No correct answers.** It used to be believed that Pokerus was contracted by making physical contact with an infected Pokemon, but it's actually that the Pokerus has a chance of generating on your own Pokemon after a battle.\n\n**51. Both (B) and (C) are correct.** This is subjective. Both are equally slow, Snorlax is all-around a more powerful Pokemon, but Parasect gets Super-Effective Bug STAB on Alakazam. Both can OHKO the Physically frail Alakazam, making them equally effective.\n\n**58. Apparently no correct answers.** As far as I know, there is no reference to (B) anywhere in any media. (A) makes little sense, as it wasn't UB-01 being specifically targeted but all Ultra Beasts, plus \"sacrifice\" isn't the intent but a possible side-effect. The answer must be (C), as it has the most accurate description of events, but the Aether Foundation does not use Nebby to re-seal Ultra Wormholes, but to open them. No answer seems right.\n\nA large number of questions are also highly subjective and/or situational, where multiple answers can be made strong arguments for. Particularly in match-up questions, there are many variables we don't know or cannot predict that can drastically affect the answer.",
