  "text": "Hi, I went back and looked at my common app essay and I realized I used \u201cfeel\u201d when I should\u2019ve used \u201cfill\u201d in a sentence. I added the sentence before I submitted to help the flow of the essay, and I messed up. Will this one word be a huge deal? I checked and didn\u2019t have any other typos.",
