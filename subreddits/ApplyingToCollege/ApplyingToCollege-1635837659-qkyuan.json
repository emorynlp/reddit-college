  "title:": "Best Top State School for PoliSci",
  "text": "Which top state school (i'm thinking UMich, UVA, UNC-CH) has the best political science program? Umich has a higher amount of specifically polisci but the other two have strong social studies programs. I'm an SC citizen so it seems like there are slightly more scholarships for UNC. Financial aid is pretty important for me too.",

      "text": "If you believe US News, then Berkeley/Michigan followed by UCLA/Carolina.  However, this is based mostly on the research strength of each school's department, which maybe shouldn't be your primary concern as an undergrad.\n\nAlso- financial aid will be hard to come by as an out-of-state applicant to public schools.",
