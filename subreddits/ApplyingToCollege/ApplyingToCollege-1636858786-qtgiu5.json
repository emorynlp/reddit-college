  "text": "I just submitted my CSS, IDOC, and FAFSA (November 13th) and the priority deadline for the Stanford REA Financial Aid Application is November 15th. I was unaware that it takes 3-5 days to process the information on the documents. I know the college can see that I submitted before the deadline, so will they count me has having applied before the priority filing date even if they receive it when it is processed after the 15th? \n\nI don't really care if I get my reward notification later than I would have if it were considered on time; I'm more concerned about whether the amount of money parents would hypothetically have to pay would increase. \n\nSince I'm applying REA, I'm assuming the amount wouldn't increase because they still would have received it way before the other Regular Decision applicants have likely submitted theirs, and it's not like REA decreases parent contribution. Is this an okay assumption to make?\n\n(Also, this is all in the context of whether I actually get accepted or not, which I probably won't, but if I somehow manage to!)",

A bank statement isn\u2019t going to tell them that info though, so hopefully the 1099 doesn\u2019t apply to you?\n\nIf you did work for someone and made over $600, your employer should be able to give you a copy of the 1099.\n\nEdit: these are usually issued for people who did contract work (i.e. you didn\u2019t have taxes withdrawn from your paycheck(s) ).\n\nEdit 2: A 1099 can also be issued if you had interest and dividend amounts in excess of $10 for a bank account, government payments, and other miscellaneous reasons. But the bottom line: they are about taxes that are due that weren\u2019t already withheld. Does any of that sound like it might apply to you or your parents? If so, then the bank or employer will have sent this to you (and they can usually be pulled up online if it\u2019s from a bank). \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions that you don\u2019t want to share publicly.",
