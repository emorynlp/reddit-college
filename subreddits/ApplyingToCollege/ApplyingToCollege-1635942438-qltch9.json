  "text": "I'm a high-achieving student and have naturally been stressed before. I'm an athlete and have naturally been anxious before. However, I've honestly never had such severe stress to the point of it physically making me sick. A few days ago I experienced severe lethargy and a feeling of unwellness, exactly like that of being sick but no other symptoms. This went away two days later. My period has become irregular, I have no motivation for anything, my dentist has noticed I started grinding my teeth, my hair is just shedding, and I wake up with my whole body aching. I realized I submitted a supplement with a typo in it and threw up. I had no appetite for weeks. I visited several doctors and all said the same thing: stress. They said they see it every year with high school students applying to college. I'm dealing with it better now, but I just wanted to share how much college apps can affect us. No college is worth your health- mental or physical. Read that again. I ignored my needs to a very unhealthy point throughout the process. Please listen to your body.",

      "text": "A similar thing happened to me. I had excruciating stomach pain and constipation from stress. I would spend hours curled up in a ball with stomach pain, and then i\u2019d get even more stressed out because I was wasting time writhing in agony when I had so much work to do. Thank god I\u2019ve submitted my college apps. Hopefully everything gets better from here and i\u2019m less stressed. \n\nNgl tho. (UNPOPULAR OPINION) I don\u2019t regret sacrificing my mental/ physical health in order to submit a perfect college app. Sacrifices have to be made. Plus I used to do Wrestling and I was pretty much conditioned to not feel pain and to be mentally tough. So I used that \u201cWrestling\u201d mentality when things got tough.",
