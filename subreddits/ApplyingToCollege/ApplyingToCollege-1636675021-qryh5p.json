      "text": "If you apply for aid and they ask for your finances, it's up to them to decide whether or not you deserve it, so you should not feel guilty. Also, not what you're asking but I'd be careful with paid programs. Not going to call them scams but a lot of times there are just like glorified summer camps that provide no real value to your college app. if you want to explore some interests, or experience \"college\" particularly at pre-college summer programs, or are just going for fun and can scrape up the money then by all means attend.",
