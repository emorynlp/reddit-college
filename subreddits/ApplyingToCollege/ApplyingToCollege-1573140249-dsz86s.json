  "text": "This is what I tell my kids that I  interview each year. And I'm very forthcoming with them from the initial  phone call/text/communication of the \"questions\" that I ask. They're  not really questions but they are objectives.\n\nTell me about your background and what you're interested in studying.\n\n(I  personally don't care about why Stanford because you wrote about that  on your app presumably. Most interviewers will care so you need to have a  very solid, specific answer to that which goes beyond the academics but  gets into fit more than anything else.)\n\nTell  me what's not on your application that you want to share with the  admissions staff. This is your last shot to communicate with them so  make it count. Tell me about additional context or more detail on your  accomplishments or weaknesses. Family circumstances, health issues,  mental health crises, anything. I want it all and the kitchen sink because this is  the gold that helps make you more human to the admissions committee.  This is where we spend most of the time. In my interviews it is 50% of  the interview. We both brainstorm what else we want to add to strengthen  your app.\n\nWhat are your questions  about Stanford? I tell them that I only answer questions that aren't  googlable so don't be offended if I shoot your question down just move  on to another one. Hint: asking me questions that involve my opinion or  make me think a little bit are useful.\n\nSo  I tell my kids everything I've written above to you. Total  transparency. I don't want to know your stats but I do ask where else  you apply because I give them feedback on the culture of those schools  and whether they think it's a fit for them.\n\nI'm  not the norm but I am one of the university's most experienced  interviewers and I have developed my own method that works well for me  and adds something to the application. I hope that others in the future  will follow suit with the transparency aspect.\n\nIf  you can answer these confidently you'll be prepared for any college interview.\n\nI  go into it with the attitude of being your advocate rather than another  person to judge you. I want to share my experience and help you as much  as I possibly can and I often stay in touch with my kids forever  regardless of the outcome. \n\nPlease comment with any questions or PM me.",

Obviously things like that impact grades and whatnot, make life harder. They certainly lead to growth, when you fight through them, but I've heard that it's still too taboo -- \"oh they might be a problem for us\" etc etc. What do you think?",

          "text": "Completely true. Agreed for essays. Don\u2019t put it on your app. \n\nNot so for the interview though. It is good context if you feel like you\u2019ve got a good rapport with the interviewer and can trust them. This part is key. I\u2019m very chill and laid back and it it easy for my kids to trust me. Many might not be like me so use your judgment here. \n\nI\u2019d only recommend this disclosure if you feel it is a major reason something on your app isn\u2019t flattering and that is the reason behind it. It can be very relevant context. For instance I had someone once that had selective mutism (not mental health), someone homeless, someone that was a refugee, and all of these had to deal with the problems associated with living through trauma. I made sure I covered that extensively in the report because it was relevant. This was core to them as a person so it needed to be discussed. \n\nBottom line: it is ok to do in an interview if you feel it is appropriate and RELEVANT. relevance is crucial. \n\nFollow up if this isn\u2019t clear.",

Would one consider another chronic health condition something to hide? or Cancer? \nI\u2019m truly flabbergasted that you would be encouraging such archaic views that mental health would be taboo to discuss in this day and age but not another health issue? Biochemistry and neurological disorders are very much real and not character weakness. The brain is not just an organ it is the organ that controls the very ability to become the exceptional students you seek. \nIf one can show exceptional grades, achievement, and ability, in spite of mental health difficulty, it is far more of an achievement than dealing with homelessness or lupus-other chronic conditions that is looked upon with compassion rather than ridicule. You just showed the trauma put upon those that suffer from a variety of mental health and neurological issues from establishment that actually contribute to the suicide rate. Can you imagine overcoming cancer while being told hide it because it\u2019s, \nit\u2019s....what exactly is it that makes it taboo?

Telling anyone involved in the admission process about problems you have would make as much sense as telling an interviewer for a job that you are bipolar that suffer with anger issues and hates authority figures.  I'm sure a college wants to know if you have mental issues but I'm equally sure that the lawyers at the college are constantly warning the folks in admissions that everytime a student jumps out a dorm room window that it hurts the university.  \n\nDo you think someone that does interviews is really going to tell you the truth about how something isn't going to be held against you?  While an interviewer might tell you the types of questions they will ask and might tell you what they want to hear, that doesn't mean you should be stupid enough to give honest answers to those questions if you know that the honest answer is going to hurt you.  Getting into college is a game and you have to play the game to win, playing by the rules when everyone else is gaming the system is a sure fire way to screw yourself.",

Expectations are different for kids with a lot of resources at home (wealth and educated parents or other family members) and where they live (urban vs rural) and the school (many different types of schools or home school). \n\nMaximizing the resources at your disposal and doing the most with them is what's expected.\n\nLast, I'll say this. This is subjective but from my time there I think the underlying thread that connected all of us was a curiosity about the world and about each other. As well as respect for our fellow students because everyone there deserved to be there (maybe one or two exceptions every once in a while but generally speaking this is true - crazy things like the scandal have impacted a lot of top schools). We value learning from classmates as much as in the classroom. That openness is crucial for the campus vibe.",

I don't have your app. The admissions committee does. By the time they read my interview report they will know what you app says very well. So the only VALUE I can add is giving info that isn't on it and provides more data or more context.\n\nSome students aren't used to being so open with a stranger but I'm an advocate and it is in their benefit to share anything they think relevant so that we can capture it in the report. I suggest preparing and writing your thoughts down in advance to discuss.\n\nBut remember, I'm only one person that has a very specific approach to interviewing because of my experience and the large numbers I do each year (I do the outskirts - think 200 miles away from my city and emergencies when other volunteers have to cancel and the suburbs so I do way more than most people and I had to develop my own process). \n\nThe average interviewer might do 3 or 4 for the entire cycle so they probably ask specific situational questions. It's on you to drive the interview though after their questions have been answered. \n\nSo say \"Thank you [interviewer name], would you mind if I provided some additional context that I'd like the admissions committee to know about?\"\n\nMake sure you add your points in. It shows your maturity and preparation and you can end your interview with a bang even if the interviewer doesn't have the same style as me.\n\nLast, I recommend doing it in person instead of online if that is on the table. I rarely do online interviews because I prefer that personal interaction.",

As an international student wanting to apply for Computer Science, do you look for higher scores (in SAT, SAT Subject, and my current high school education is the IB program) than you would in an American student, because I personally feel that the American thresholds and boundaries are considerably lower than those for internationals, and in terms of grades and test results international students have the harder time. \n\nFurthermore, how many applicants do you accept that are part of the early decision wave of applications? Have I hindered my enrollment chances by not applying early? (I guess this question is slightly more general, but I worry about it most for Stanford). And, lastly, how do you as an admission team decide which of the students receive financial aid? I know it depends on family income and whether you have any other siblings going off to university and other factors, however is there anything within the essays or interviews that hint to you that the candidate would be worth investing in? Because even if I do get accepted into Stanford, it would have to come with a considerable scholarship amount (I need at least $30,00). Is this too much of an aspiration would you say? What kind of grades/other requirements would I need for this figure to be considered? \n\nI hope to hear from you, thank you for offering this opportunity to hopeful applicants :) and I apologise for the bombardement of questions :P, I never thought I'd have the chance to talk this openly with a Stanford admissions officer.",

Or would the grades be the first requirement in getting your application read?\n\nAnother question, if a student is aspiring to reach to the level of being a Stanford student, what should one aim to have if one had a rocky start?  Would they be able to salvage and try their chances applying to Stanford or is it a lost cause only for the privileged and smart (those with a clean slate in terms of academics). \nThe road to Stanford is arduous, and starts many many years before one decides the conscious decision to apply there. Considering the stats most students have not had a single \u2018bad day\u2019 in their life, as evident in their transcript. If anything most had the drive, the discipline, and liveliness to solder all their high school years to earn those stats. Now assuming that the probability to earn those stats, one must have had a good fortune in their lives. Is it not off putting to admissions, when the whole archetype of a Stanford student is one who challenges their life more in practice, rather in knowledge? \n\nApologies if those sound weirdly written, I just wanted to write something that I would have loved to ask in person if I had the chance.

I really believe the culture and academic rigor at Stanford would be an excellent environment for me. I do, however, have an unusual background. I did not go to high school. My parents wouldn\u2019t let me continue beyond a couple of months into the 9th grade, so I\u2019ve studied as much as I could over the last 4 years to keep up with my peers. I recently took and passed the HiSET (GED) Exam (and was pleasantly surprised with a perfect score), and I plan on taking the ACT in December, as well as SAT Subject tests in Math Lvl. 2, Physics, and Biology. I have also thought about taking CLEP exams in a couple areas I am very familiar with, as I\u2019ve heard a lot of homeschoolers do this to sort of back their curriculum, and perhaps it would strengthen my application. I haven\u2019t really participated in any extracurricular activities since I left school. I was fairly active in clubs/communities back then, but I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do much since.  \n\n\nIn your opinion, what can I do to strengthen my application? I know my odds are tiny, especially with my background, however I\u2019m determined to give it my all. I\u2019d love any input on what I can do to improve, and any thoughts on what I\u2019ve done/plan to do thus far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I know they do interviews in Atlanta, I just couldn't find info on the website about specific locations. \n\nAlso, I know you already said not to discuss information that is already on my application, but do you think it is a good idea to reference what was on the application, to maybe provide more detail (e.g. I said I am an eagle scout on my application, but I didn't talk specifically about my project or outings or stuff like that)?\n\nLastly, like I said, I am an Eagle Scout. Do you know how much this impacts my chances of admission?\n\nThank you again for answering any or all of these questions!",

Be patient for the interview invite. There were issues with the portal so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Be sure to reach out to the oval staff on 11/13 if you haven\u2019t heard anything because that gives you five days to get on someone\u2019s schedule.",

Sure, you should prep yourself for possible questions by thinking on it and maybe brainstorming your response, but wouldn't it be better to set aside all notes during the interview and just talk? I think that would humanize the applicant a great deal more than reading off a script. Also, do you think that's something I could do? It's not that I'm trying to skimp on work, I just don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to stand out otherwise.",
