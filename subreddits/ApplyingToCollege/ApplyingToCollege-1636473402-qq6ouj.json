  "text": "Hello!\n\nI recently took an SAT (730 english, 790 math) in August and an ACT in October (35 math and science, 36 english and reading). If it matters, I think the curve was bad for math and science (I only got -1 for each), but I'm not sure.\n\nIf I'm applying to CS/Stats schools (like MIT, Harvey Mudd, Caltech, etc), which would be better? ACT composite is higher, but SAT stem is higher. I know both are very good, but I'm stuck between which would be better.",
