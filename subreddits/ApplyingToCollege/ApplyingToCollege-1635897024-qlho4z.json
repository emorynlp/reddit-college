  "text": "ok so basically my ex boss tried to groom me (in very much the \u201chow far are you willing to go to get ahead in this industry\u201d way). and it was kind of a big thing. I\u2019ve cut off contact now but I want to know if this would be a bad topic for supplemental essays? like does it make me sound weak or whiny? or is it a taboo topic in general? it wouldn\u2019t be a main essay and would mostly be about my growth and not him (I don\u2019t really like taking about him for obvious reasons lol). Thanks",
