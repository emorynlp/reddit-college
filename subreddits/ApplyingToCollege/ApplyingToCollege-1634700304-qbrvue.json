  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nAs many of you know, Common App has 5 spots to list academic awards. I am not sure which ones I should include because I am not sure if my achievements fall under academic honors, I don't know if they are relevant enough to be included in my application, and I have more than 5.\n\nMy awards:\n\n\\- Best Delegate at an international Model UN conference\n\n\\- 4 school awards for academic achievement in biology, english (twice), french\n\n\\- National Merit Semifinalist (finalist pending)\n\n\\- School Award for best performance in theatre class show\n\n\\- National Honor Society Member (would this be considered a national or school honor??)\n\n\\- California Scholarship Federation Member (would this be considered a state or school honor??)\n\nBy the way, I have room in my Common App Activities section to include NHS and CSF. I am applying for business and poli sci, but I am thinking my academic achievement award might make my 3 in AP Bio look better? I am so lost in this process. Thank you in advance!",
