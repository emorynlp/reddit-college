  "text": "I turned 30 this year's and was finally fed up with jumping from one construction job to another. I've always loved tech. Knowing the inner and outer workings of technology have always fascinated my. So I quit my pipeline construction job and now work at a department store. I'm ambitiously applying to a tech school for a network specialist degree. I'm attempting to register for classes. I watched the video and followed the steps. It tells me to check the boxes next to the classes I need to take but instead of boxes is either a C or NR. I don't know what this means. Am I to late to register? Or am I to early? Any tips, tricks, work arounds, or guides on how to fix what I'm to ignorant to understand would be greatly appreciated.",

Which I thought I did when they gave me a tour of the campus and sign some paper work. But I'll try again Monday",
