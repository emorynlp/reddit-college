  "text": "One of my required recommenders is having issues submitting my LOR on the common app for my early action schools. The invite went through on email but he doesn't see my request in his common app account.\n\nIs anyone else having the same issue? Do y'all know if there's a way to send an LOR directly to the schools instead of through the common app? I'm worried that I won't be able to figure out the issue in time for the deadlines (nov 1)...",
