  "text": "My school counselor has uploaded my transcripts, but is yet to upload my Letter of Recommendation. He says that he has uploaded it, but my portal says \"Not Started\". It's been one week, and the portal still says the same. \nIs there any step by step tutorial which I can send to my counselor to show how to proceed? \nPlease help out guys, I have a deadline for December 1, and the college requires every document by then. Thanks",

The funny thing is that he has uploaded and submitted everything except for the LOR. Even if he had forgotten to click review and submit, it should still say Started on my portal.
