      "text": "Different colleges value legacy to different extents. Not all legacies are equal, e.g. a donor legacy vs a non-donor legacy. There is the major confounding variable that legacies tend to be from wealthier families that could afford tutoring, more extracurriculars, fancy high schools, etc., which all create an above average profile to begin with, even excluding the legacy aspect. \n\nTLDR it\u2019s hard to say. \n\nThat said, admissions for T30s are so competitive now that I don\u2019t think \u201cdecent\u201d everything would be enough to guarantee acceptance for a non-donor, non-celebrity legacy. Of course, this also depends on your definition of \u201cdecent.\u201d",

      "text": "Hopkins got rid of legacy in admissions and their president said it had a huge effect previously, something like equivalent to 140 points on the SAT, which is kinda hard to believe. I get the sense that he found one example like that and exaggerated.\n\nAlso some schools like Dartmouth are kinda clear that legacy matters but only in early decision.\n\nUnless the parent is a big donor or famous, the effect is palpable but not huge at most schools. But even a slight advantage can be a lot\u2014if it\u2019s down to two almost equivalent applications and they always take the legacy, then it will have a massive impact.",
