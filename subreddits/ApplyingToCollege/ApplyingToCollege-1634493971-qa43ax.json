      "text": "1. Are you a resident of a U.S. state?\n2. How sensitive are you to cost?\n3. What is your EFC?\n\nWith that score you will almost certainly want to apply to test-optional schools and not submit.  Assuming your weighted GPA is on a 4 point scale, that's pretty good.  The question is:  what are you trying to optimize for in building your college list?  US News ranking?  Cost?  Mix of both?\n\nIf you a resident of Pennsylvania or New Jersey it may be hard to get into a more well-regarded school for a comparable price.  On the other hand, on the basis of your grades, you can probably get into some less selective schools and pay even less than in-state tuition at PSU or Rutgers.\n\nIf your EFC is lower than in-state cost at PSU/Rutger, then that puts some additional private schools on the table.",

              "text": "Ok, so, Rutgers COA is around $30k.  If they don't require test scores then you \\*might\\* get some merit aid based on your GPA, but I wouldn't count on it.  I would also apply to whatever the next least selective state schools in NJ are; they might be more likely to give you non-need-based aid.  Maybe Montclair or one of the other Rutgers campuses.\n\nBecause your EFC is roughly $30k, then there are some private schools where, if you get in, you might end up paying roughly what you'd pay at Rutgers after financial aid is applied.  The problem is that these schools are often hard to get into.  Then again, they are also likely to not require test scores, and your grades are pretty good, so maybe you have a shot.  You might look at Davidson, Colby, Colgate, Lafayette, assuming they don't require test scores.\n\nAnother option is less selective schools \\*out of state\\* (usually public) that have large merit awards based on GPA alone.  I don't know off hand which schools have that, but there are a few usual suspects.\n\nBasically the name of the game is:  the less selective the school, the more likely they are to let you attend at a steep discount.  So build your list accordingly.",
