  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently applying to 6 schools (Pitt, OSU, GW, BU, AU, and Case) and my parents think I need more schools on my roster. I cant say I agree or disagree with them, but I thought I had a pretty solid system - 3 safety, 1 match, 2 reach, with my ED falling in the safety category. I've done a lot of research, but I was hoping you guys could recommend some additional schools to me. My basic stats are as follows - SAT 1380, WQPA: 4.03, UWQPA: 3.65, 3 really great recs, 4 leadership positions, 100+ volunteer hours, 3 other basic EC's, a solid essay, etc. I did post a chance me in r/chanceme so feel free to look on my profile to see that for a more extensive understanding. School wise - I'm looking for a more urban school, or at least in very close proximity to an urban hub (AU to Washington DC commute time). I'm looking for small to midsized, preferably with a strong gay population. Options in the arts and communications are a must, and I would love a campus focus on sustainability. Please list some recommendations bellow! :)",
