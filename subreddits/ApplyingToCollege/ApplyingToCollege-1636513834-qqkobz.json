  "text": "Hi. I'm currently attending a community college and I would like to transfer to a top university, i.e, Cornell, UC Berkeley, etc. I'm getting associate's degrees in pre-engineering: electrical, mathematics and physics. I have a 4.0 GPA but it is only my first semester.\n\nUnfortunately, I live in a relatively rural area and I'm just going to my local community college. Does that matter? Are my chances of getting into top universities lower? I can't really find information on this. I don't really have the money to move to another area, but if going to a community college in New York gives me a better chance than rural Tennessee I would work for it. \n\nCommunity college was not my first choice, by the way. I was denied the opportunity to take any AP courses in high school by the faculty.\n\nIf this doesn't fit here please redirect me to another subreddit. Thank you.",

You need to add other colleges to your list. \n\nPlease note that if you do two years in pre-engineering, most (but not all) of the CC courses will transfer to a four-year college. You should contact transfer admissions counselors at a few four-year colleges which interest you to get some insight on if/how/which specific courses from the CC will transfer to the major you want to purse at the 4-year colleges.",

It is a very competitive public school and they have a low acceptance rate so you will need a compelling app. \n\nMy route I started at a CC, went to UCR, and eventually NYU. Do a year at your CC and try and transfer to a decent uni like uc Santa Cruz who have a great engineering program. Earn your AA and try and transfer again to the top schools you have in mind for your BS. This is one route you can go, but it\u2019s all up to you!",
