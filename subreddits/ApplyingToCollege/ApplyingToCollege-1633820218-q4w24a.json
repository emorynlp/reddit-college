      "text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one of the super overdone ones. \u201cFind x\u201d and the department name changing one both seem to be consistently popular. Division by zero was the most popular of last year\u2019s new prompts. But I wouldn\u2019t worry about the overdone part too much\u2014part of the point is that you get to be creative about your interpretation and direction. This essay is one of the few (if not only) where I would say directly answering the prompt isn\u2019t super important.",
