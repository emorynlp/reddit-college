  "text": "Hi! My counselor gave me the Nacac Request for a Fee waiver paper and I\u2019m not sure how it works. Since it\u2019s a request, do I need to mail it before or after my application? Sorry if that\u2019s worded weird, I\u2019m just confused! I looked at the website I\u2019m still not totally sure!\n\nThanks!",

Some colleges let you apply first and then ask you to mail the waiver in through your counselor, while platforms like CommonApp ask you to indicate using the waiver and then your counselor certifies it.",
