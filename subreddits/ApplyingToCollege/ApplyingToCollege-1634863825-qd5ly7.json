  "text": "i'm sorry if this is a bit incoherent but i just need to rant because i'm so nervous right now\n\nok so basically i asked one of my teachers to write me an LOR for michigan state. she did but gave it to me as like. an actual paper letter. i emailed her and said thank you, the letter's very nice, i invited you to my commonapp can you please copypaste it in\n\nshe replied the next day and was like oh of course, i'll send it in asap. a few days pass, fast forward to tonight. i was thinking oh, i'll be productive and get my msu app in now rather than wait till the weekend. HOWEVER, the problem is that my dumb ass submitted my msu app tonight without even thinking that my teacher might not have actually submitted the LOR, because the recommenders and ferpa tab was checked off as done. it didn't even cross my mind until after i'd paid for everything, but as soon as i was done i thought of it and checked the tab. of course, she hadn't turned it in. i don't blame her cause apps aren't due till the 1st and she's busy and all that but i just feel so stupid for making such a silly mistake\n\ni feel so scared rn. i have no idea if this is going to break my app, i'm kicking myself right now guys i think i'm gonna worry myself to death. is there any way to let the admissions staff know and change it or am i just absolutely screwed???",
