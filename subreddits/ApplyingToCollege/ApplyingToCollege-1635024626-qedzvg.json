  "title:": "Kinda weird question about how far GPA and test scores get you in terms of college admissions",
  "text": "Let's say there is a college where the 75th percentile GPA of accepted applicants is 3.8 and SAT is 1450.\n\nThere are two applicants to this college who are near identical in terms of essay quality, ECs, recommendations, etc - basically almost the same in everything except GPA and SAT.\n\nApplicant A has a 4.0 and 1550, applicant B has a 3.9 and 1500.\n\nDoes applicant A have a better chance of getting in than B, or do they both have equal chances of getting in since they both surpass the 75th percentile stats?\n\nI prefer answers from any college admissions officers, also sorry if you don't fully understand the question",

(which you\u2018ve specified are \u201cthe same\u201d for the two applicants.)",
