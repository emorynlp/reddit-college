  "text": "Hey\n\nHope you're doing well!\n\nAs an international student, I have to do a foundation year. Most universities have a foundation year program. If a university doesn't, do I apply and possibly reserve a spot, or do I apply after completing my foundation year? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance.",
