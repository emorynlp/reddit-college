  "text": "So this morning I checked the portal and I got into ASU. Since I'm international student I didn't receive any financial aid. So if I was to attend, I would have to get scholarships.\n\nLooking at the scholarships on the ASU website ([https://scholarships.asu.edu/](https://scholarships.asu.edu/)), I saw that there are 4 featured scholarships, and it says that the deadline is 11/15/2021, which is tomorrow. \n\nIs this scholarship for current freshman students? or prospective students like me? I'm guessing there's no way it's for prospective students since it's really early but I just want to make sure since I can't miss any scholarship opportunities.",
