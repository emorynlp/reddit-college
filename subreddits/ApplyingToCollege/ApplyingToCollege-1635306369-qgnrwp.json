  "text": "So I\u2019ve the past year and a half or so I have gotten into jailbreaking my iPhone and tweaking the operating system. The main things I do are installing file system tweaks other people have made (nothing special here), and then I have also dove into system files on my own and changed various values to change the battery life/performance ratio among other things. \n\nMore recently, about a half a year ago, I started getting into jailbreak development. I have been trying to learn apples objective-c programming language to be able to write my own tweaks.\n\n\nMy question is, would colleges frown upon me doing things like this? \n\nI would probably either list it as jailbreaking and jailbreak development, or iOS file system development/modification (with the mention of learning objective c in the explanation)\n\nJailbreaking is not illegal but it\u2019s frowned upon by Apple because it removes their lock on the phone, so basically I can see and change everything on the phone.",

          "text": "What if I wrote it as iOS file system tweak development? Then I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to mention jailbreaking. Could just talk about learning objective c and writing programs for the iOS file system.\n\nI don\u2019t really like the idea of saying jailbreaking. To someone who doesn\u2019t know what it is... it does kinda sound illegal. But saying it like this I think would leave that out and just stick to the meat of the activity, which is me learning a coding language and learning how to use that on the iOS operating system.",
