  "text": "Okay, so I\u2019m a senior currently and running a small business. I\u2019m selling products (it\u2019s not an online service). The problem is, I\u2019m worried how I\u2019ll run it when I go to college next year. Who\u2019ll run it? What\u2019ll happen to my customers? \n\nIf anyone has experienced the same thing/similar situation, I would love to hear some advice because it\u2019s been concerning me so much.",
