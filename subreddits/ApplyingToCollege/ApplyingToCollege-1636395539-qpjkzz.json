That being said don't stress because if you don't submit the financial aid stuff, but do submit the application they will email you about the getting the financial aid stuff in even if the period for submitting applications has ended. If they bug you about it it's usually a sign you also were accepted just a little tip/trick. You can even submit stuff after you get in you just won't get your financial aid award with your admission letter.",
