      "text": "The schools that have been test optional over the years and not just during the pandemic, understand that the SAT or ACT do not tell the complete story for students.  If you apply test optional, then they will look more closely at your grades, activities, major of interest, etc. If you're still considering new schools, check out Temple Univ in Philly.  www.temple.edu",
