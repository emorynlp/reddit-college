  "text": "Hi everyone! I am applying to Yale REA. I'm an international student so English Proficiency Exam is one of a part of my application. When I went to Yale website, I saw them wrote: \n\n\" Students at Yale must be able to express themselves fluently in spoken and written American English. An English proficiency exam is\u00a0*not* required for any applicants, but\u00a0students who are not native English speakers and have not received at least two years of secondary education in an English-medium curriculum are encouraged to demonstrate their English proficiency with an exam score.\"\n\nI intend not to submit my English Exam score because it is not required but just \"encouraged\". However, I am concerned that if it will hurt my chance if I choose not to submit IELTS/TOEFL/DET scores?",
