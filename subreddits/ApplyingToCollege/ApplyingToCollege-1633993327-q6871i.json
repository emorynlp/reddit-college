  "text": "I want to apply to a couple of colleges later this month since my state has a free application week coming up and I\u2019ve heard its good to apply early. However my gpa isn\u2019t the best and my current transcript doesn\u2019t reflect the upward trend that has been happening my senior year. Should I go ahead and apply and send my completed transcript later, if they request it, or just wait until the spring to have my 1st semester grades on it.",

      "text": "I would ask the colleges you are planning on applying to if there is a benefit *at that college* to apply early vs regular. If there is no advantage to apply early or regular, then you can make the decision of when to apply based on when you feel your application is the strongest.",
