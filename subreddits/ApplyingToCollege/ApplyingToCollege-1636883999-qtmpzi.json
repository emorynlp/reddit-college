  "text": "I created this account to browse through this subreddit in hopes of learning how to get into great schools with the transcripts I have composed for the past 4 years.\n\nHowever, these 4 years seen growth in me far more than any letter grade or an essay can put out of me. I know I have grown much. However, I\u2019ve only grown from my failures and reluctancias to try.\n\nIt\u2019s my senior year now and I don\u2019t want to say I have much regrets, I just keep seeing my potential in a perfect world in which Everything- and I mean it, everything, I tried succeeded.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case and that might be why I always compare myself to people I honestly don\u2019t think highly of in school or online.\n\nI don\u2019t know what school I will end up in, however, I truly just want to live out Senior year with ambition and passion and reflection, cross out the comparison and anxieties.\n\nI know I can Do great things, and I promise to return to Reddit in the future if I wish to extend my academic ventures.\n\nFor now though, it\u2019s much important for me to become a person I want to be. Then gradually producing fruits that corresponds to the tree in which it belongs to.\n\nI\u2019ll come back to the subreddit, and class of 2022 I hope y\u2019all do well in your great colleges.",
