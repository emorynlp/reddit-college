  "title:": "Will my bad AP scores affect me chances of top schools admissions??",
  "text": "So far, I feel like my application is pretty solid. I\u2019m applying to one Ivy and Stanford early action but I feel like my AP scores (never got above a 3) are gonna hold me back if I send them in. Apart from that, I have a 4.7 (w) gpa and a 3.95 (uw) gpa, top 2% of my graduating class, along with pretty high SAT scores and solid activities. I\u2019m still working on my essay to make sure it really represents me but these AP scores man... I got A\u2019s in all the AP classes but the test scores are honestly giving me such a mental break down. \n\nI heard from the EAOP at my school that schools want to see the scores because they want to know that you took the test since it shows \u201cdedication\u201d to the subject but I\u2019m not sure if I should since these are top schools.\n\nAny advice? Should I send them in (2,3,2,3)? Will it ruin my chances?? \ud83d\ude14",
