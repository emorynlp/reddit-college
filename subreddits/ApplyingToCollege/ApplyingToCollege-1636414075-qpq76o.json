  "title:": "Things that will not 'ruin your chances' (from a current college student)",
  "text": "I'm a current college senior (Dartmouth '22 if you care about where lol) and was recently reminiscing with one of my friends about applying to college - how horribly stressful it was, and also how ridiculous it is in retrospect, especially looking back on the things that we used to think would 'ruin our chances' at getting into college. I haven't looked back at this subreddit in nearly four years at this point, but I thought I would just make a post that I wish I could've read back when I was in y'all's position: things that ended up NOT ruining my (or my friends') chances at getting into college. \n\n\\- Getting Bs\n\n\\- Not being ranked in the top 5 of your class\n\n\\- Going to a bad public school\n\n\\- Guidance counselor not knowing you at all before writing rec letter\n\n\\- Submitting recommendations late (I submitted my dartmouth rec letters about a week late and they still let me in!)\n\n\\- Typos in essays (though I would say, for your own sanity: don't reread your essays after submitting!!)\n\n\\- Not doing that many extracurriculars (I did some volunteering and was in 3 clubs, and also played an instrument.  Nothing crazy, no major awards)\n\n\\- Being deferred (I know people here who got in off the waitlist and after being deferred)\n\n\\- Not doing any sports\n\n\\- Not doing any internships/research in high school \n\n\\- Not having visited (& therefore writing a very vague \"why \\_\\_\\_\\_\" essay lol)\n\n\\- Not getting an interview\n\n\\- Other people from your school getting into/applying to the same place(s)\n\n\\- Not doing anything academic over the summers \n\n\\- Having a bad freshman year (I did NOTHING freshman year! Literally nothing! And it didn't matter!)\n\n\\- Writing a silly/weird essay (I got my biggest merit scholarship offer from a T20 LAC for which I wrote an essay about having a crush on Megan Fox)\n\n\\- Getting non-perfect AP scores (I got mostly 3s, a few 4s, no 5s)\n\n\\- Not having a 'sob story' \n\n\\- Not applying ED/EA\n\nThis is a NON-EXHAUSTIVE LIST!! I know how terribly stressful this period of time is. I literally have never been as stressed in college as I was during my senior year of high school. So I hope this list maybe helps you worry a little bit less about things that I thought would prevent me from getting into college - I promise that it will almost always work out so much better than you expect it to :)\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so glad that so many of you found this post helpful! Thank you for the awards! I\u2019ve been asked the same things a couple times in the comments, so I\u2019ll just put a couple answers here: I\u2019m a white girl from the south and I\u2019m an english major. I think I got into Dartmouth because I wrote some really good essays, and admissions could probably tell how much I loved my subject. I had a really good interview too, which definitely played some role in getting in. I also got lucky - like everyone else.",
