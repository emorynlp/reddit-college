  "title:": "Guidance Counselor Dislikes Me",
  "text": "My guidance counseler is a pricky woman and she seems nice but she gets annoyed easily and displays her annoyance. I liked her in the first 3 years because she helped me. However this year, I was a mess. I felt depressed and I needed help changing my schedule. I constantly emailed her but she never responded. She once responded and she said she could not switch my class. But when another teacher confided in me, she switched it for me herself. Guidance counselers are supposed to be the ones doing that, no? I emailed her about dropping a class and emailed her again, but I emailed the principal after because I felt overwhelmed. It was a huge mistake. The principal sent it over to the guidance and she definitely dislikes me. I feel terrible for this. I emailed both saying I\u2019m alright now, but she said that that email was obviously lost because they are receiving thousands everyday. Anyway, she is sarcastic about helping me and it makes me feel bad. They are the people you go to to talk about issues and I understand I am a bit much at times. But now she will write a rec and I\u2019m worried.",
