  "title:": "Are these essays too cliche?",
  "text": "I'm working on my UC Personal Insight Questions and\n\nOne of my essays is about my identity as a gay dude who did club swim for the past 4 years and my experience being resented by my teammates, leaving the team, until I learned to accept my sexuality and used it to go back to what I love most (swimming) with a different mindset\n\nThe other I want to write about my trip to South Africa as I was there for a month, but I do not want to give off the \"savior complex\" as it is far from what I intend on sounding like, but I want to highlight the issues that I experienced first hand\n\n(The majority of my extracurriculars regard to human rights & grassroots organizations, etc)\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how to successfully write these essays without sounding like the other billion people that write about such things? Should I scrap it and come up with something else entirely?\n\nThanks! :)",
