  "text": "On my first SAT I got a 1550 but a 11 essay (which is like... really bad)\n\nOn my second SAT I got a 1540 but no essay.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if I send the first one, I'm required to send the essay as well. Should I still send it?\n\nAlso, superscore is 1570, so I think I have a pretty big incentive to send the first.",
