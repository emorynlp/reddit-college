  "text": "I'm an international student, and some of the colleges I'm applying to have an to option to waive the CSS fee, however, since the non custodial parent makes a different css account then mine, should I ask for two fee waivers? Is that how it works, or if I get a fee waiver for my account it will automatically transfer it to my dad's account? I'm generally confused with how this works, so any help would be appreciated",
