  "title:": "The gap between rich students and poor students is just getting worse cause of the pandemic",
  "text": "I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to write for the title, I\u2019m also pretty sure it\u2019s been already talked about. But, here\u2019s something that\u2019s just been sitting on my chest for a while. \n\nI used to go to a really elite private school with the top 1 percent (no, not in America but, they could qualify in top 5 percent there, I think), and now I go to a middle class public school. I still kept in touch with my friends from the rich school and with the pandemic still raging on, the opportunities they have compared to students like me in public schools is really really disheartening and discouraging. Just like other kids, I\u2019ve not even been able to do most regular extra-circulars because everything is shut down. Meanwhile, their rich parents are getting them very impressive ECs like internships at big companies or even just handing them smaller companies to \u201crun\u201d. They have access to things like high level tutors that essentially just help them cheat. I\u2019ve even heard rumours of certain parents bribing teachers (it was kind of a small school). \n\nOn the other hand, people at my public school are struggling with online school and trying to teach themselves subjects. Covid is getting worse and nobody has the chance to get vaccinated so, no idea if even next year things will go back to normal. It\u2019s pretty apparent that applications like mine would be nowhere near as frivolous or nice as theirs. Most of the kids at my public school are such hard workers and they honestly deserve at least the opportunity too. The pandemic is just making the gap bigger and bigger. I don\u2019t think schools are going to pick applications like mine, when their applications are definitely stronger. \n\nSorry if there\u2019s spelling or grammatical errors, I typed this pretty fast on my phone.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards!! :)) It was great to see all the different and similar opinions in the thread!",

It was based on a game and everyone was glorifying the cause of meritocracy, which really angered me. Not only is it bad enough with opportunities in the original and wealthy form, but it provides no help to those who have the potential.\n\nThey want you to already succeed in things. They don't care about your potential if you provide no benefits. For those that haven't found their passion yet. The ones that want to live a simple life can't because they're on the \"lowest tier\" according to the rules. It's true that it's been like this since forever but it sucks. So bad.",

      "text": "YES!!! That\u2019s why I absolutely hate programs that are advertised to low-income students while expecting them to be \u201chigh-achieving\u201d when post of these kids are either working to support their parents or just simply trying to survive. \n\nThe opportunities for low-income students are so much scarce because a lot of students literally don\u2019t know where to look and they don\u2019t have people in their lives to truly support them and guide them through life. So many people can\u2019t afford to pay for admission counselors, tutors, or even take on unpaid internships!!! \n\nThe opportunity gap is such a large problem and combined with the pandemic and the reliance on technology, it really has set a lot of kids back but they\u2019re often overlooked. The kids in my neighborhood are so smart and so hardworking but because of the underfunding in our schools and just the state of the neighborhood, they aren\u2019t able to pursue their passions. And then don\u2019t get me started on tuition costs!! There\u2019s so much I can talk about in terms of how the education/opportunity gap + standardized testing and ugh!!! \n\nI still can\u2019t believe people have the nerve to tell others to \u201cwork harder.\u201d I\u2019m sorry if this was all over the place but this topic means a lot to me but there\u2019s so much to talk about !!!!! I honestly think we need to do more to support low-income students :,)",

The huge focus on 'going back to normal' fundamentally crippled a lot of school's responses to the pandemic and online learning.

There is no such thing as not being a good test taker, the people don't put in the work or they have ADHD or something and they need to request extra time accordingly.",

However, the reasons for this are not the test themselves obviously, but the resources, similar to the EC disparity, which wealth enables access to, from tutors to property tax funded public education.\n\nEdit: I'm being downvoted for some reason, but this data isn't hard to find, just do a search of \"SAT Score vs Family Income\". I get that it is often possible to overcome your disadvantaged situation if you work hard enough, but the thing is, us on this sub aren't representative of the majority of students. Just because you were able to prevail over your own adverse circumstances doesn't invalidate the reality of the clear correlation between wealth and scores on average.",

                      "text": "I disagree, I think this sub has a warped perception of how the majority of students are. I will concede that, in the event that one puts in the effort, disadvantages in standardized testing are easier to overcome than lack of access to ECs. However, the idea that standardized testing is somehow \"a lot more meritocratic\" is what I take issue with, because if that were true, then somehow, that would imply that somehow, merit increases, on average, with wealth.\n\nI know this isn't the intention of this statement, but the reality is that standardized testing largely measures merit to the extent that it has been developed by the educational resources provided to the students, not to their actual intellectual capability. This is especially true at the lowest ends of education, students who have few resources and hence little inclination to apply their own efforts. This is the same wealth disparity in resources which fuels inequality for ECs.\n\nOverall, I understand that given the nature of this subreddit's participants, there is a strong bias to see standardized testing as more of an equalizing factor, but as I said previously, this is simply not representative of the vast majority of students.\n\nEdit: If there is some flaw in my reasoning here, I would appreciate replies in addition to the downvote.",

They ran more clubs, they levied their connections to get \"internships\" where they did nothing, they had more leadership positions, and their grades were better. Heck, I got waitlisted at the MIT/Berkeley/Stanford intern's dream school while he got rejected.\n\nIf nothing else, know that fixating on everyone else's sucesses and privilege gets you nowhere - it makes you a cynic, and it corrupts your worldview. Try to focus on your own hard work and passions, be sure enough in your character that you can portray yourself healthily in essays without painting a false facade, and you'll be fine. I promise.",

I'm a huge globalist in my beliefs, but Americans should be able to have their own schooling without worrying about how to make it fair for the entire world to apply. \n\nAlso, a huge misconception I've seen on this sub is that only public universities get funding from American taxpayers. Most private universities are completely dependent on federal funds as well. They get tax cuts on their endowments and new construction, federal funding for research, and depend on federal loans and grants for students. Every single school, except for the crappy for-profit schools, get federal funds. The difference in funding between private and public is *state* taxes.",

Our enrollment numbers actually went UP for 2021! But when you break down the demographics, we lost a ton of kids from the low income bracket, and that's not ok. \n\nOur state univ is working hard to build programs and financial supports to bring them back. I can't say that for the elite univ or the college system as a whole. Covid will have a generational impact that will reverberate for a decade.",

I hope its not too late to bring back standardized testing for future college applicants to benefit from but the cancel momentum has been pretty strong so it\u2019s not looking good.  I hope for a resurrection because at least underprivileged kids could buy an inexpensive book and practice independently to get a good SAT score.  Not too bad considering other alternatives.\n\nThis situation seems similar to the crime increases in less fortunate neighborhoods in our well meaning defund the police states.\n\nUnintended consequences of trying to cancel imperfect institutions that were doing more good than harm, and then suffering with the alternative, which is worse.",
