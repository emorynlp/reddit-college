  "text": "My school offers a class where we can take H Precalc B our first semester and AP Calculus A our second semester. How should I input this into the UC and CSU applications because H Precalc B fulfills my G requirement. Yet, I know it isnt recommended to manually imput it. The class name also goes by H Adv Math (but it isnt stated like that in the transcript yet all the teachers call that class name as H adv Math and the name comes up in the dropdown menu as a course name when you type it for the CSU app ) but for the UC App, it is under the C requirement (Math requirement) rather than the G requirement (College prep elective) Should I just input it manually anyways for the UC App ( H precalc B for the first semester as a math elective to fulfill the G and AP Calc A under the C requirement for the secondsemester)? I think the CSU App has a A-G matching portion where we can change it so it fulfills the G requirement rather than the C requirement.",
