  "text": "I've done a lot of stuff revolving around E-sports in high school since my freshman year. I've ran and played on teams, ran a semi-popular league, was a coach (both with and without pay), and was an analyst for multiple teams.\n\nMy application would be incomplete without it, but how legitimate would it all look, and how much would it help? Are Esports seen the same as normal sports (apart from all the scholarships and offers), and would running a league at around 15-16 be seen as impressive.",

      "text": "I generally have mixed feelings about putting gaming achievements on applications, because imo implying you spent thousands of hours on league doesn\u2019t quite convey the same positive traits that more traditional ECs do (community involvement, leadership, creativity, resilience, etc). \n\nBut in your case, I\u2019d definitely put it down. You\u2019ve done more than just playing the game. Focus on the leadership, organizational skills, teamwork, analyzing, etc skills that you\u2019ve gotten from those experiences besides just playing the game. I think those legitimately show the same traits colleges look for in other traditional ECs.",
