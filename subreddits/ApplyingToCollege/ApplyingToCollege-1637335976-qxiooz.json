  "text": "So I'm currently in AP CS and AP Calculus AB, and I'm kind of struggling in these classes due to bad teachers, and just the fact that they're both pretty hard classes. I have almost all A's on my transcript, but will 2 B's in these classes mess up my admissions chance, especially in top schools? The semester is almost over, and I don't have much time to get them to A+'s. What should I do??",
