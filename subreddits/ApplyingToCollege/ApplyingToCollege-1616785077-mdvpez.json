  "title:": "Happy Birthday to my Mom, my inspiration for AdmissionsMom.",
  "text": "This is raw. Written once and not reviewed. \n\nToday is my mom\u2019s 81st birthday. She died a little over 6 years ago in 2015, when she was just 74.  Way too young. \n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know this, my user name, AdmissionsMom, is inspired by her. Mom was a huge advocate of college access and she created college availability and opportunity for generations of students in deep East Texas, an area not known for its college-loving culture at the time.  Mom dropped out of UT Austin after her sophomore year and married my dad and moved to Hawaii, where my dad was stationed in the navy. My dad likes to say that was her real education \u2014 moving far far away from home to learn about the world basically on her own \u2014 Dad was frequently in Vietnam or Thailand.  I know her years in Hawaii (two of them with baby me!) were instrumental in her development as a person who cared about educating others. Even as a college dropout, she began teaching in the local schools and was awed by the grace and strength of her students.  She talked to me about those years in Hawaii throughout her life. \n\nLater, after my parents divorced, she was a single mom to me.  While she remarried, we never lost our tight-knit bond from all those years together \u2014 just the two of us. When she grew sick and needed care for the last few years of her life, I became her primary caretaker. Those were hard years, but I would never exchange them. \n\nThroughout her life, she set an example in caring for others, being fiercely independent, and using her privilege to make a difference. \n\nWhen I went to college, Mom went back, finishing her bachelors and masters while working full time in just 5 years. She then developed and led the Early Childhood Development Program at Angelina College. This is where she really began the work of finding students who needed someone to guide them (or push them) on their path to education. For the next thirty years, we couldn\u2019t go anywhere in all of East Texas, without bumping into some student she\u2019d created an opportunity for \u2014 often not within her department. They would always stop and tell her how she\u2019d changed their lives. \n\nWhen she died, I was pretty lost \u2014 Id recently retired from my teaching position at Houston Community College to have more time to care for her, and I was a fresh empty-nester. Actually, \u201clost\u201d is putting it lightly. And a wise friend told me to focus on living my life in a way that would make Mom happy. \n\nu/AdmissionsMom on Reddit was born a couple months later in 2016. I\u2019d known I wanted to work in admissions consulting but didn\u2019t know what that would look like. And after years of being a Community College writing instructor, I knew college access was just as important to me as it had been to my mom.  When I first found a2c on Reddit, I had no idea what I was doing as far as Reddit goes, but I found a community that was aching for guidance, for help. So after lurking for a month or so, I started jumping in with basic Mom advice. I wasn\u2019t an admissions expert. I\u2019ve never been on either side of the admissions desk, but I had gained lots of knowledge about dealing with stress as I coped with my own grief and life changes, and I\u2019d been a writing teacher for fifteen years. I named my Reddit handle after my Mom and the kind of advice I wanted to give. While I\u2019ll never have the immediate impact she had, I found a way to keep her mission alive in my own way while honoring her with my name. \n\nSo, Happy Birthday, Mom! Through your example we are continuing your journey of helping others find their way.",

I realize this is not a mistake that can be fixed solely by words.  I hope you had a good day with you and your daughter today, and although I realize a sorry can never illuminate the gravity of a situation, I am so sorry to hear about your mother.",

Very beautifully written!\n\nI would like to tell you that your posts and the hundreds of hours you have spent here have helped many low-income students like me who can never afford college consultation. I was turned down by many counselors because they didn't have time for those who cannot pay. I was devastated. I felt lost. Then I found Reddit and I was so happy and surprised. I realized that there are people, like you, who are willing to help. I am completely sure that your mother would be extremely proud of you. You have directly and indirectly changed many lives like mine and I hope you continue to do so. You have also inspired me to one day help others. Many thanks and happy birthday to your mom!! <3",

And even well into my forties there were days when she drove me absolutely bat shit crazy. Sometimes that\u2019s just what moms do. \n\nI know I was lucky and not every mom is as great as demonstrating unconditional love and support as mine, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your mom doesn\u2019t have her own way of showing it. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t, and you\u2019ll be able to grow up and be a parent or mentor in a completely different way.",
