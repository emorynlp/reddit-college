  "text": "I\u2019m an international applicant. \n\nSo in the interview, my interviewer suddenly asked me something pretty political and I didn\u2019t want to go against her possible stance, so I just kept shuttering and said something that didn\u2019t make sense at all. Eventually, I got to know that she was pretty neutral. \n\nI just messed up. What can I do? Should I explain in the thank you email, or even re-answer?\n\nThis is my second alumni interview (no idea why), would it break my application?",
