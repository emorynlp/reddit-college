  "title:": "Can I omit or not report an SAT score?",
  "text": "My score in the October SAT was way better than my August one, and includes both best section scores, so I only want to report this one. \n\nThe common app says \"Number of past SAT scores you **wish** to report\" so I think there is no problem there, but the MIT portal says: \"Students should report official full sittings (including future sittings) of the SAT, ACT, or English proficiency exams\". Does that mean all of them? Can I just select the second one in the college board page and not send the first one to them? \n\nI am international, and without counselor so every piece of advice is really appreciated.",
