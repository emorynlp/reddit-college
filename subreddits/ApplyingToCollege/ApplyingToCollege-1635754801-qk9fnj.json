  "text": "I'm kind of torn between these colleges. \n\nThey're all great at CS for sure, but which has the upper edge in the field? The better connections? The best overall campus vibe? The friendlier students? \n\nSo far, USC is looking pretty good as it has nice weather all year round (I particularly don't like the cold but am willing to suffer if need be), is next to LA, and has nice housing. But I'm also concerned about the weight the ivy league brand carries and how important it could be in establishing future connections (like alumni networks) or even getting hired. Furthermore, the ivies attract a lot more events and job opportunities for undergrads. But yeah, I apologize that this is a bit of a niche question, though I would really appreciate any answers. Thanks!",
