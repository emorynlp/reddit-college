  "text": "Hi! I'm currently a junior in high school, and I'm trying to decide my college major asap to start planning everything out goals wise and execution. I really enjoy graphic design, specifically promotional images/advertising, but I also do want to get into UI/UX. After doing some research although, I've seen that a starting graphic designer may not make as much starting out and just from talking to freelancers, it's a lot of hustle it seems trying to find work. \n\nAside from graphic design, I find business somewhat enjoyable. As of right now, I am doing some minor social media management which involves marketing and networking, I really enjoy those aspects. I've also had experience with working with current businesses, and I'm thinking I'd like to potentially start one in the future. I also do have knowledge with looking an analytics and trends as I've built up a YouTube channel from the ground up, filming and editing my own videos, planning shots and scripts, thumbnails, etc.\n\n\nMy GPA right now is a 4.1, but the courses I am taking aren't terribly difficult. I took 2 AP classes and one honors in sophomore year, didn't pass the exam for one of them. Taking 2 APs as well this year.i will be taking the SAT in December, on practice tests right now I'm averaging around a 1500. I'd like to make a comfortable living in the Bay Area when I'm older most likely, and I'm struggling to figure out what colleges to take a look at and what major or minor I should be taking. Any help is appreciated!",
