  "text": "First and foremost, college admissions is ab to be 10x harder for us. Why?\n -so many 2024s are deferring to 25 so our admissions round is even more competitive (yale and harvard have reported that 20% of 2025s spots have been reserved for gap year students)\n -we aren\u2019t in school so reaching out to teachers for advice/LORs is a bit more difficult and a lot less personal. Same goes for any college prep/help meetings with counselors (my school is small so we normally do a lot of those) \n -No visiting colleges. Fortunately I did most of mine fall of junior year, but there are still a few schools i really wanted to see and didn\u2019t get to. It\u2019s even worse for other students who had planned to go during spring/summer breaks and haven\u2019t visited a single school.\n -don\u2019t even get me started on SAT testing issues. it\u2019s a goddam mess. Even though most schools are test optional, in my state we need SAT scores for a lot of in-state scholarships. That is huge.\n\nYes CO 2020 missed a lot of monumental moments in high school, but so did CO 2021.\n -A lot of us started online for the first day of school and will be online indefinitely.\n -There are no fall sports (at some schools), meanwhile seniors last year at least got the beginning of their spring seasons. That also means no football games, and consequently no homecoming.\n -we also lost junior prom last spring (for those of us who\u2019s schools do it) but that\u2019s not too big a deal so long as we get prom this year.\n\nTL;DR i\u2019m honestly not that mad ab missing some of this stuff. The only thing that pissed me off so much that I wrote this rant was finding out ab the harvard/yale students taking up 20% of next years admissions by deferring this year. I haven\u2019t worked this hard in the last 5 years just so my chances can be significantly reduced bc of a fucking virus. \n\nanyways, hope you guys are doing well\n\nedit: oml guys it\u2019s a rant. it\u2019s not exactly supposed to be positive and uplifting \ud83d\ude33 i\u2019m just letting it out here rather than in an inappropriate manner or smth. damn.",

At Yale for example, a reason they can still admit the same amount of students may be because they barely used the 2024 waitlist to fill the 20% of gap year openings. Therefore, CO 2024 is smaller than usual, and CO 2025 can be bigger than usual. The capacity for the college ends up balancing out.",

      "text": "i guess in your mind it appears to be the worst.\n\na good chunk of your argument mostly applies to the kids applying to top tier schools (aka the kids on A2C). cause the reality is is that most people apply and attend their state schools or a mid tier/average school (based on rankings). those schools arent as demanding as top tier school.\n\ni think most kids will be fine during the college application process cause like i said before, most will be applying to local/state schools. or atleast will be aiming for this. \n\nnow this is what i think/predict. i may be wrong.\n\nand yes, it sucks that homecoming and fall sports are canceled for most seniors. just like it sucked when prom, graduation, spring sports, & end of year activities were canceled. and yes it sucks that theres a good chance that senior year will never be the same and the same can be said with college freshmen.\n\ni do not want to downplay your situation at all. i agree that it sucks for class of 2021. hopefully everything turns out well for everyone.",

I'm a senior too, and on top of that an International student.\n\nI haven't taken my ACT yet and I'm not sure if I will be able to take one as well. Look for alternatives, try looking for other countries you can study in, that are less affected. There are many more things we can do than have negative thoughts. Don't waste your time over-thinking, rather put that to a good use. Anyways, Take Care Man !",

                                  "text": "Well, its how you feel so I can't really argue with you. It's fine if you would prefer to attend a full only T5 than an in-person state school. I would've said the same thing during my freshman year of high school. I also would've never thought that I would choose my state school over a T20.\n\nBut after some time (junior year) I realized that some state schools actually are pretty top-notch and provide a great education - also it depends on what you major in and what you want to do in life. Sure top schools open many doors for you, however, it all comes down to your skills and your drive. I think I first started to realize all of this when my high school held an alumni day. There was a mix of people who attended ivy leagues and T50-100 schools. I would say that all of them were equally successful - a handful of them had jobs at places like Google, Big4, Microsoft, JPMorgan, Goldman, etc. (i just named a couple of the most well-known companies but there were other small but great companies). Some did not have jobs at tech/banking companies however they were doing really well and were quite successful. I was shocked. I honestly thought that ivy league graduates were mainly the ones who were capable of achieving such greatness. How ignorant was I?\n\nBut yea, my point is is that people shouldn't completely rule out state schools. It's good to explore your major in different schools - its good to keep your options open. And I know that many people would choose a T5 over a state school - especially if interested in concentrations like finance/business. Duh. I guess I said yikes because saying \" I'd take online T5 over in person state school any day\" could mean many things. Maybe I read too much into it. In-person school is so much better than an online education - especially if its cheaper. But again, sometimes depending on your concentration, you would be better off at a T5.\n\nI wrote way too much but if you agree with most of my points then that is great. If not then that's fine too. It's fine if one cares about prestige. Maybe I'm a bit biased because of my career of choice. However, I tried to balance it out a bit.",

The validation and prestige that comes with a school of such a high calibre far trumps any money that would come from a future salary, imo. I'm looking at tech or quant, and for the latter going to a T5 would undoubtedly help. Regardless, you bring up some good points and I appreciate that you spent the time to respond so thoughtfully.",
