  "text": "I submitted my REA application and realised that my counsellor made a mistake in reporting my current course name in my predicted scores. I typed in my course by the right name - \u201cComputer Science\u201d. However, my counsellor reported it as \u201cComputer Applications\u201d. Is this a serious mistake? If so, can it be rectified? Any help is appreciated!",
