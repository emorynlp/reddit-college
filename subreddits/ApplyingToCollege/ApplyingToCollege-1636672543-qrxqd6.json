  "title:": "Is it considered bad if my EC hours on CommonApp don't match my recorded service hours on my transcript?",
  "text": "I did many ECs but I didn't send all of them in to count towards my service hours recorded on my transcript. So, it says I have \\~200 hours on my transcript, but based off my activity descriptions on CommonApp, everything would add up to 600+ hours. This is because a lot of it was volunteering for a religious activity, and I didn't feel right counting that towards my \"mandatory service hours\" so I left it out (and I still fulfilled the hours through other activities). Would colleges think I am exaggerating my hours then, and should I just decrease the hours on CommonApp to match my transcript?\n\nThank you to anyone that read this far and can help!",
