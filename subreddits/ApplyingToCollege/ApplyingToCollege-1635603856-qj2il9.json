  "text": "I was planning on applying to a college EA, but atm I\u2019m not too sure about my supplementals and am also swamped with tests/hw, so I was thinking of pushing back the deadline to RD and applying later once I\u2019ve touched up some stuff. If my teachers already submitted Rec letters to all my ED/EA colleges, is it bad for me to change deadlines to RD? I\u2019ve heard that colleges don\u2019t care and they\u2019ll jus file away early letters until the rest of the app comes in, but I just wanted to check.",
