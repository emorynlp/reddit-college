      "text": "PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nOOS students pay 65-70k/yr to attend UCs, *no need-based aid*. U Hawaii OOS 52k/yr.\n\nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nKeep in mind that FAFSA is just a form that colleges use to calculate financial need. The only money a student can get \"from\" FAFSA are federal student loans and a Pell grant (small, for low-income students). The bulk of need-based aid comes from the colleges themselves.\n\nIf you need financial aid and want to attend college on the West Coast, look at private universities or schools that offer large automatic merit (like Arizona and ASU, if that's west enough for you).",

      "text": "There's not many reasons to study at any University of Hawaii really unless you're from Hawaii, are Hawaiian, or want to live in Hawaii for the rest of your life. Or wealthy and want to vacation in Hawaii for 4 years. Or if you're studying in a topic they specialise in (I imagine their departments for marine biology or something should be very strong.) \n\nThat's not because I think it's a bad school or anything. But realistically speaking, paying OOS prices for a university which will have very few alumni networks in the continental US and is for all intents and purposes isolated from the rest of America is a bad idea. It doesn't make sense unless you want to live in Hawaii and if you're from anywhere in America, you probably have a comparable flagship or public uni that is as good if not better career-wise near you. In your case, the SUNYs would be much cheaper and have better career prospects for example. If you want to permanently relocate to Hawaii though, I imagine the University of Hawaii would be one of your best bets.",
