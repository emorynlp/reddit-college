  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm applying to the UC's and I recently attended a webinar for UCLA (their fall open house). I remember them saying that many, many admits apply as undeclared. My intended major is CS, though, which is hyper-competitive and selective. So I wanna ask: should I apply as undeclared or directly to CS? To those of you who got admitted, and desired to major in CS, what did *you* do?\n\nFor your reference, I have a great GPA and essays , ok EC's, and yet to take SAT.",
