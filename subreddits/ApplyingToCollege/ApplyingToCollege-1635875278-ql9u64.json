  "text": "I have been extremely stressed and dealing with anxiety ever since I started working on my applications. I am an international student applying to a bunch of universities, all in the top 50. I know I\u2019m capable of getting in at least a couple but I still get so stressed to the point that I am unable to read, which had never happened to me before. For example, I tried doing a sat practice test this morning and everything seemed blurry, I couldn\u2019t make out a single word on any passage or question (I dont need glasses and never did).\n\nIf you have any advice on how to deal with this I\u2019d really appreciate it.",
