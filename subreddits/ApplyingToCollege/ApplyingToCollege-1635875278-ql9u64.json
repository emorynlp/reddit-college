  "text": "I have been extremely stressed and dealing with anxiety ever since I started working on my applications. I am an international student applying to a bunch of universities, all in the top 50. I know I\u2019m capable of getting in at least a couple but I still get so stressed to the point that I am unable to read, which had never happened to me before. For example, I tried doing a sat practice test this morning and everything seemed blurry, I couldn\u2019t make out a single word on any passage or question (I dont need glasses and never did).\n\nIf you have any advice on how to deal with this I\u2019d really appreciate it.",

      "text": "print them out if you can, and try switching to physical textbooks and books in the two hours before you go to sleep. try drafting ideas for supplements and organization with pen and paper, too -- you tend to write more to the point and spend less time cutting to meet word counts. switching away from screens was huge for me this season, since my glasses prescription was getting worse and I was getting headaches",
