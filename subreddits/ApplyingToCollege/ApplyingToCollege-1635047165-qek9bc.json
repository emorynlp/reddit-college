  "title:": "Do I write the course name exactly as it appears on my transcript even if it's wrong?",
  "text": "My school's transcript has a character limit for each class name, so many classes' names are truncated. For example, the word \"Exchange\" is written as \"Ex\", \"Electricity\" as \"El\", \"Learning\" as \"L\", etc. And sometimes a part of the course name is just removed. Should I use the actual name on our syllabus when filling out Courses & Grades/Current Year Courses, or do I stick to the transcript's spelling that may look confusing?",
