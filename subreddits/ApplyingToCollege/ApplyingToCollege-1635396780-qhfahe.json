  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a quick question to ask y'all:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took an MBA-level business course at Columbia last summer (and then I became a teacher's assistant for it), and I got a recommendation letter from the professor who gives the course. I am obviously using that recommendation letter for Columbia, but I was wondering: should I use it for other schools too? Or would it annoy them to see a recommendation from another university?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks; and good luck to all of you EA/EDers!",
