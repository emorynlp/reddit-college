  "text": "So I'm looking for options right now, I've decided I wanna study on an economy related area, and my country Chile doesn't have good direct options for this career choice from my understanding, I'm not sure how to do this. \n\n\nI'm proficient with english, and I'm looking for options right now.  At least if you don't know could you give me some advice on where to look?",

              "text": "Okay so for USA you usually can apply to either community college (relatively cheaper) or to universities (mostly what this sub focusses on, and on which I have information on) so there's an app called the CommonApp via which you apply to universities. They mostly require your transcripts from High school (all four years) , your Extracurriculars, financial information and you're supposed to write an essay. Individual colleges might have different requirements so I'd recommend you look into that by individually visiting the website of colleges of your interest.\nYou're also allowed to put in your test scores (SAT, ACT ,AP etc. If applicable) and since you're not from the UK, or Canada, you have to give an English proficiency test as well (IELTS, TOEFL, or the Duolingo English proficiency test).",

Not much myself, although I'd take a side job if I have to, I'm pretty sure family is willing to cover about 2000 dollars monthly for my expenses as long as they see me studying. \n\n\n2. My grades school grades Chile uses a different system but my grades where about a 6.2 out of 7. \n\n\nMy scores on the ptu tests which is how we apply to the Uni and college here average on about 650 out of 850. Which is certainly above the average at 500 but still not at top student level with the hardest careers on the best unis cutting at 780.\n\n\nI've been studying this year though, doing a math intensive right now in fact, and my mental health is consideraly healthier so my scores should be higher overall.",
