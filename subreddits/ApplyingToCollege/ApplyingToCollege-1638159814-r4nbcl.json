  "text": "i've written about two supplements already where i talked about my personal experiences with the universities (a duo program with my high school and the other with a summer program i attended as a kid). since i had a idea of what to write in those supplements, they were a bit easier to get done ~~(even though i felt like they weren't that great but thats beside the point lol~~). \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni ~~probably~~ have a small chance getting into nyu but i'm still trying anyways! i've been pushing off writing my \"why nyu?\" essay, i'm feeling stuck with how to start my introduction/hook for my supplement. i really want to write a decent/good supplement (nyu is also my last application left to finish :DD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni would attempt to tie in \"my major\" in my essay however i'm thinking of going undecided so i don't think that would really help me (unless??) ~~i honestly need some motivation to write my last supplement and tips !!~~ \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni'm super tired so i apologize if this post has any typos u\\_u",

      "text": "Why essays work best if you can demonstrate that you\u2019ve looked deeply into that specific school \u2014 that it\u2019s not something you copy/pasted down on every school you applied to. Even if you don\u2019t have a specific major in mind, look into what makes NYU special, and write about that. Get!!! Specific!!! Write about a specific program, extracurricular, professor, building, etc that appeals to you. Name it. You\u2019re gonna need to do research, and pick something unique to NYU (not \u201cNYU\u2019s engaging curriculum.\u201d) Then later in the essay, you can broaden and get more generic, and talk about the culture and whatnot. But still do it through the lens of the thing you started with. \n\nFor instance, I started my Carleton supplemental by talking about their \u201ccookie house\u201d (a fully stocked house in which students can bake cookies), and then used it to broaden out: the presence of a cookie house is reflective of Carleton\u2019s care for their students, sense of community, \u201cquirkiness,\u201d etc, all of which I look for in a school.\n\nHope this helped!",
