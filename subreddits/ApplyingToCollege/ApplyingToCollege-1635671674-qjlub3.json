  "title:": "Just got told by my friends that my main commonApp essay is too general and not good",
  "text": "I was planning on applying to Stanford REA but like two days ago I had a couple friends look at my main commonApp essay, which I wrote about a shift from 8th grade to high school, where before I didn\u2019t feel like working hard and didn\u2019t want to because I was scared, to working really hard throughout it high school because I realized failure was not bad and I can achieve so much if I push past my limits, and they all said it was not specific and personal enough, felt like it could have been written by anyone.\n\nIs this essay salvageable at all, is there any way I can make it more personal or interesting or add symbolism? Could I talk about my parents experiences growing up really poor and putting themselves through college? Or do I need to completely scrap it and do something else\n\nIm so upset right now I feel like crying",

      "text": "Sorry in advance if this is brutally honest// I mean, it is a little generic sounding from the blurb you gave us. The general arc of I didn't work hard, I decided to work hard, I am now successful isn't particularly interesting; i've seen it mentioned in about 1000 youtube essay videos. You can apply RD and rework your essay concept. Or if you think you're a strong writer, make edits today and tomorrow and submit REA",

      "text": "As another person said, it\u2019s very generic and doesn\u2019t reveal a lot about you as a person. I feel like the best course of action would be to pick a new topic as adding things such as your parents working hard to put themselves through college doesn\u2019t reveal anything about you either.",

      "text": "Was there one incident that made you realize this, and change?  Sometimes a personal story or event or book or anything specific to you can be the catalyst, and may help you flesh out the essay.  My kid wrote the common app essay about starting at a high school in a different state, which should be a trite topic, but did it using clothing as an analogy/example of slowly adjusting to a culture change.  Of course, this should also be a trite analogy, but kid did it through a series of personal vignettes, linking in the lows of certain failures and the highs of awards (doesn't hurt to emphasize your awards).  I once read the CA essay by a Stanford admit who used colors as an analogy for events in his life - pretty cool, for an Asian male.\n\nI have to say, it's not as good as the Costco or I-hate-the-letter-S essays, but it flows, isn't boring, and is very personal - shows how the kid thinks in different situations.  At the end of the day, most essays aren't make-or-break, they just need to be serviceable and talk about YOU.  I think you can rewrite what you have and it will be fine.  \n\nBest of luck to you - you GOT this!",
