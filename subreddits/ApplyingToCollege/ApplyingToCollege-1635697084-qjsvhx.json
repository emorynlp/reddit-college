  "text": "This may be a dumb clarification question. \n\nSome colleges give you the option to use your self-reported scores that you put in the \"testing\" section of Commonapp. When I went to review and submit my app for ED last, it said that the scores are not shown on the pdf, but the data will be sent to the AOs. My AP test scores were still there. What is the reason for this, and do I have to additionally send my ACT scores through MyACT or smth like that just to be safe?",

If you decide to enroll at a school where you had self-reported your scores, you would send an official report at that time, to that one school.",
