  "text": "Transfer student here. I was wondering if the UC have access / can look at my freshman application. In my freshman application, under the sexual orientation question, I put heterosexual despite being bi because I had family and friends look over my application. Now that I am more familiar with the process, that isn\u2019t a problem. However, I don\u2019t know if being truthful this around can hurt my chances (like, if they can see my freshman application and wonder what\u2019s up). Might be sort of a weird question for this sub but any insight is appreciated.",
