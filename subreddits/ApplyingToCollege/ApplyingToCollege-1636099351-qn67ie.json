  "text": "I have lots of things to add in my application, mainly my passion and hobbies that showcase my personality but I have already used up the activities section. What should I do If I have more than 10 things so show the AO's in my application but nowhere to add those in.\n\nCan I add them in the additional info? Some unis give out an optional resume thingy..can I add stuff there.\n\nI would like to say that I am not adding all the things I took during my high-school. The things that I want to mention connect to other parts of my app and overall will probably give a good look for my application\n\nAny advice? And how I should go about losing things in additional info box? More like just down what I did this and that (like how you do in the activities section but with proper sentences) or give a more of a in-depth explanation and how this all connects back to me for each thing I list down (not trying to write another essay or supplement, just writing a good para while also remaining concise)",
