  "title:": "PIQ Ideas (need feedback on them)",
  "text": "Hi so I am applying to UCs this month and I have one more PIQ I need to respond to. I am currently doing \"academic subject that inspires you\"(math), leadership (positive attitude during sports), educational barrier (having to learn English) but I am stumped on the last PIQ. I was thinking of doing #8 (what makes you a stand out as a applicant) and talking about wearing really weird clothes because I feel like it or idk how to explain it but i have a tendency to just go off on my own a lot (best example I have is I went to hike half dome with 2 friends on a one day notice, completed the hike on 4 hours of sleep after a chem 1a exam).  Any advice, critique is great. I have no idea what im doing.",
