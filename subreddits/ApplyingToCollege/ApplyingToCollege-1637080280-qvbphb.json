  "text": "So I'm torn apart between two extracurriculars and I have space for only one. \n\n1) One was internship at an organization that teaches students in slums and helping them find their potential. Almost 1200 kids were assisted in total by my team and several teams over the summer.  \n\n2) The second was a competition that I founded outside school to improve school spirit within students: I had to handle several sub-teams, delegate tasks and familiarized myself with managing large teams. It had a total of 154 participants and was voted as the #1 student tradition within school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought the competition was slightly more unique than the internship although it had a lesser impact considering the numbers? Should I go with the numbers?",
