  "text": "I took 3 SATs over the past year, but I only want to report my latest two. (My first one is not terrible, but not spectacular either). I know you can superscore when you self-report, but does Dartmouth require all official SAT scores or can you pick and choose which ones to send through CB?",

If you self-report in the application, and then later are accepted and decide to enroll, you may use Score Choice to choose the two test dates that prove the scores you reported in the app.\n\n>If you submit multiple scores from the SAT or ACT, we will accept superscored testing, i.e. your highest section scores in either test, regardless of the test dates.  \n>  \n>How to Submit  \n>  \n>On Common App, you will have an opportunity to indicate if you would like Dartmouth to consider your test scores as a part of your application.  \n>  \n>You may self-report your scores on your application, and we will consider these scores until we receive your official scores.  \n>  \n>The fastest and most direct way to submit official scores is to request the testing agency report your scores to Dartmouth. You are also welcome to ask your school counselor to submit your scores to Dartmouth with your transcript or by emailing them to [submit@dartmouth.edu](mailto:submit@dartmouth.edu).  \n>  \n>Please note: if you indicate that you wish your scores to be considered in our review of your candidacy for admission, we will require that you submit your official scores before you enroll.",
