  "title:": "my academic career has been unconventional so far. I need some advice on getting into Stanford.",
  "text": "I'm an 18 year old from Sri Lanka. I completed 11 years of school (O Level) in SL and moved to Canada for several reasons, without completing my 'high school' (A Levels). \n\nI understand that Stanford requires 'an equivalent' of high school graduation. Will a GED do the job for me? do I also need SAT/ACT ?  Just any advice you would have in general for applying to Stanford is welcome. \n\nalso note a few things: \n\nI am very smart. Not to be boastful, just letting you know in advance. And for extracurriculars, I was the president of the student body and I composed music for a traditional school drama in grade 9.\n\n I am also a self taught software developer (which I think is relevant because I'm applying to Computer Science)\n\nwhat are my chances?",

      "text": "Sorry to break it to you, but you're not getting into Stanford (or any other T30, let alone a T5) with a GED unless you've cured cancer or won the nobel prize. You'll almost certainly need to take A-levels, or get a good SAT score and attend a less prestigious university (although I'm not sure how many places you can even do that, since many universities have HS curriculum requirements which you've almost certainly not met).",
