  "text": "Title. But seriously I've seen different things, like do they include your class's average ACT/SAT scores and GPA and stuff? Do they see that no one has gotten into a T20 school from here like...ever?\n\nAnd more importantly, my school doesn't have weighted GPA, so although I've taken every AP class offered the \"top students\" haven't taken a single one. Is this portrayed in the school profile?",

      "text": "I think that if you take advanced classes, it should show up. Although I will say that since our school also doesn't have a weighted GPA, many people do not see the incentive to take a more challenging class when they could just have a higher unweighted grade in an easier class.  (Which is why I think our school should also have a weighted GPA lol) Maybe type in your school's and pdf into Google, or ask your counselor.",
