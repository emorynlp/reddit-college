  "text": "For example, for leadership I wrote about band and what I have done to make it a better place. If I already included the topic of band in one place can I have it another like prompt #3 saying that my greatest skill I have developed is playing the drums. Is relating piqs usually a red flag in UC application?",

With that said, I've seen people write two essays with similar topics and still get into their target schools. \n\nHope that helps! If you have any other questions, you can dm me!",
