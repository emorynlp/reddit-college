  "text": "I wanted to take DE because I don't want to be drowning in debt in college. Also I much prefer that than taking a nerve wrecking AP exam. By the end of high school I plan to have taken at least 7 dual enrollment classes which amounts to at least 21 credits for the school (UMD) I am most likely to attend. I think I will have more DE classes than APs. Will colleges reject me for taking too many since I am technically paying less for college in addition to the fact that my family is poor (meaning that I will get higher financial aid)? Also how does colleges view DE?",
