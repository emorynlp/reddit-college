  "text": "I need all of you kids to understand that. Right now you are working your ASSES off in high school to get into good colleges right?\n\nWellm, in said \"good colleges\", you will quickly discover, you have to CONTINUE to work your ass off to get into a good graduate program or be one of the people on top of this good college that impresses Google, Deloitte, Ford, whoever.\n\n\"Well, it gets better once I graduate and work for said company! I made it! I'm living the good life!\" -Tsk tsk tsk Kurisutina, so na\u00efve\n\nAt said good company (and in good college mind you) there are indeed many good perks and you are, treated well. But in a lot of those cases, there is a shit ton of stress and pressure to perform well, work hard, AKA STRESS.  You'll get exposed to a lot of that. The stuff you worked so hard in high school and college to live a life avoiding? If you're not careful, you'll end up living a life of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is, don't aim for greatness. Be realistic and identify what will make you most happy. What do YOU want, not what society expects of you. Have awareness of why you want it. Take the time to map this out so you aren't miserable. You can end up finding your dream is to build AIs at Google. But that is your dream. *NOT WORKING AT GOOGLE FOR THE SAKE OF WORKING AT GOOGLE.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, work on making your goals specific and live your best life. Don't join the rat race to run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best.",

          "text": "A lot of \"party schools\" and safeties will have a lot of opportunities available through their honors program so that's something to keep in mind as well. \n\nUltimately it really comes down to what you are looking for in a school. I am a parent and both of my kids are high achieving students. My junior studies and researches random shit for fun. She would love nothing more than being surrounded by intellectual like-minded individuals. She wants to be pushed and challenged academically. My sophomore is smart and does well academically but needs to be involved in order to feel complete. He couldn't do his normal fall sport because we thought it was too high risk given pandemic and the amount of close contact so he switched to cross country. He can't do his normal winter sport for the same reason so he took up fencing. School is fully remote but he's still active in his leadership roles in student government, Spanish Club, and honor society. He wants to have fun and be involved in college. My daughter spent yesterday studying for the SATs. My son spent it watching a movie (socially distanced, everyone masked) with friends on our outdoor screen. My daughter's studying plan was just as well thought as her brother's safety protocols for the movie.\n\nNeither is the wrong approach. It just depends on what you are trying to get out of it. If a stressful and competitive environment fuels you then go for it. If a more easygoing environment is more your speed then consider those safety schools. There are happy and miserable people at both. Happy kids find success and miserable kids struggle no matter where they are.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that I am not pushing my kids towards anything. If my junior wants to go to a party school and my sophomore wants to go to an academically rigorous school then that's fine. I don't care where they end up and both kids care more about their grades than I do. My wife and I both went to state schools for undergrad, enjoyed college, and found plenty of professional success. I was just trying to show how two kids can have completely different ideas of what they want out of college and there is no one size fits all.",

      "text": "Just to add my own two cents. This post gave me a lot of \u201cthe grass is always greener on the other side\u201d vibes. Yes, going to a top school is stressful. However, college is stressful everywhere. If you don\u2019t go to a top school, the courses are probably going to be the same amount of difficulty and work yet you don\u2019t have as many opportunities handed to you, so you\u2019ll have to work harder for those which can bring  on a lot of stress as well. Most kids at top schools can leave with the job they want whereas it\u2019s a lot harder if you don\u2019t go to one. I don\u2019t think most kids go to a top school because they want a \u201cstress free life\u201d. Looking at your post history, it seems you go to UMich. As a general note, typically the private top schools are a lot less intense than the public ones because they usually have better funding for less students. And also, on the whole company thing. Some people don\u2019t have the financial means to take a job that they love and pays less, it\u2019s all relative. Also someone working at google might wish they pursued a career at a startup, whereas the person working at the startup might dream of the stability at google. Everyone experiences stress, it\u2019s a part of life. There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cstress free life\u201d. It\u2019s just all about how you manage and deal with stress.",

I should have said that gonig to top tier schools won't ultimately give you a life with less stress (it won't be guaranteed, and I wanted to say you can end up with more stress) so for those who have a choice, really think about it. I didn't realize people weren't able to just, not pick higher paying jobs in some cases. That's a lesson. Thank you.",

I want to be an engineering major which I fully know is already stressful enough and was considering applying ED to Cornell. Yet I came to a realization that if I managed to even get in here school would most likely absorb me and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do much else (as I would most likely be in the lower end of acceptances and I good friends going there who are very stressed and smarter than me). Instead of reaching for Cornell I am deciding to apply ED to a very underrated T100 (Clarkson) engineering school with a great career center and career prospects in the same range as Cornell, and even more importantly at Clarkson I can graduate completely debt free as I have 60k scholarship guaranteed and another 60k very likely (and a extra scholarship for applying ED) and I can even Be on a D3 Athletic team which is an experience in its own!\n\nSorry for the rant, but thanks!\n\nAnd listen to this post above! Go where you think your going to be happy!\n\n-edit another advantage that isn\u2019t spoken much about is that when you have more time away from school you can gain more experience!\nAt Clarkson I am planning on being a part of competitive engineering clubs/teams which I don\u2019t know if I would have time for at Cornell, engineering recruitment is half about your experience in applying your studies so that most clubs/internships the better your career prospects are!",

My decision was driving me crazy for a period of time too, (couldn\u2019t stop thinking that I was \u201csettling\u201d or \u201climiting myself\u201d) but I have come to terms with it am happy with it.\n\nMake whatever decision you think you will be happier with! \n\nWhat other places are you looking at?\nAnd what are you concerns?",

                  "text": "If you're a high school/college student and you've never worked a corporate job in your life, you might find out that working for a big company might not be for you. At big companies like those, there are a lot of people who are as smart or smarter than you, so you might feel in constant competition with those around you. You probably won't get to work on the things you want to, and you'll end up working on something esoteric like google heatmaps and you won't get to see your actual contribution to the company. It's also hard to change things in the company. \n\nBut if those aren't a problem to you, then by all means go work at those corporations. It will be quite hard to get in tho as 0.2% of people who apply to Google actually get the job.",
