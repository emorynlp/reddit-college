  "title:": "Mistake in Honors Section (NHS)",
  "text": "So I made a mistake in my Honors section. My school has an NHS chapter, which I am a part of, but I accidentally put down being a part of my school's NSHSS chapter in my honors section for my EA schools. I know NSHSS is somewhat a predatory organization, so should I email admissions offices about this mistake? They might realize though because NSHSS does not have chapters I think.",
