  "text": "There has been a crazy influx of applicants, for reasons unknown to man. Why? like wtf. it\u2019s not like there was a baby boom so why are so many more people applying to these schools.. because of a pandemic? that wouldn\u2019t make much sense it\u2019s very odd.\n\nI have seen way too many OVERQUALIFIED people on this subreddit get deferred or straight up rejected, and it\u2019s not fair to them. 80% deferral rate is absurd. This is ridiculous, and you deserve better than this. \n\nYou did NOT work this hard for them to be like:\n\n\u201cOopsies! tough year lolz i\u2019m not even reading this til march\u201d \n\ncuz everyone needs even more anxiety during a FRICKIN PANDEMIC right?!?!\n\nYou guys are so talented it\u2019s insane, coming from someone who didn\u2019t apply to T20s I am absolutely in awe of your raw talent and work ethic. \n\nPLEASE READ THE BOOK \u201cWHERE YOU GO IS NOT WHO YOULL BE\u201d BECAUSE YALL ARE GONNA DO SUCH GREAT THINGS IN LIFE AND AN IVY ISNT THE REASON WHY. ITS BECAUSE YOU ARE A HARDWORKER AND HAVE TALENT. \n\nSomething everyone has to realize is that a school name isn\u2019t what is going to land you a great job or make you successful, you might\u2019ve gone to your dream school and realized you hated it! \n\nwho cares if some harvard AO overlooked you, they\u2019re an AO they mean nothing to your overall life. show them they are wrong, i KNOW you have the ability to conquer the planet. You have been blessed with so many wonderful gifts, and you\u2019re gonna go off into the world and show it who\u2019s the boss!\n\ni love y\u2019all so much<3",

I know a lot of schools are really struggling with their budgets right now, so I wonder if they're deferring in hopes of finding out more about what next year will be like + what their financial situation will be like.",

That was a long rambling sentence that\u2019s just really saying we don\u2019t know why more people applied early, but it won\u2019t necessarily transfer over to a massive increase in RD rates.

Colleges can't reasonably expect students to have a test score this year, and they'd be turning down very qualified applicants if they demanded test scores, which they obviously don't want. As I understand it, schools have basically accepted the fact that they can't compare applicants between the test-optional and test-submitting cohorts, so they're taking the opportunity to run an unofficial experiment with the class to see whether or not testing really does make an impact on academic performance. It sucks for everyone in the applicant pool to be a part of this (except for those who get in test-optional who wouldn't have performed well on testing otherwise), but there isn't really anything we can do about it.",
