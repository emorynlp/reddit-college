  "text": "Hi A2C,\n\nI'm working on my UT app at the moment and I am dead set on Polymathic Scholars if I get accepted. Turing Scholars feels less likely for me to be accepted, but it also feels like it doesn't fit me in the same way. Still, would throwing together a (thoughtful) essay be worth having an extra set of eyes on my application? I don't see my chances as zero considering I'm applying to Stanford. I am lacking the personal coding projects I see on every code monkey's applications to Turing, but I could spin my EC's effectively.",
