  "text": "Hi everyone, hope you all are doing well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just had a quick question- Last year I applied to UPenn Regular and got waitlisted, but was ultimately rejected. I am now applying again Early instead, and was just wondering if I could use the same supplementary essays from last year? The other parts of my application will be different wherever possible but UPenn is using the exact same supplementary questions from last year and my answer to them hasn't really changed. So I was just wondering if it'd be wise to reapply with the same supplementary as I'm still interested in the same things as when I last applied? Thanks!",

      "text": "since you didn\u2019t get in last time you applied, i would rewrite them even if the essays were good to show that you have grown as a person and also for demonstrated interest purposes to show that you are willing to put the time in. with that said, i\u2019m a hs senior so idk how qualified of an advice giver i am.",
