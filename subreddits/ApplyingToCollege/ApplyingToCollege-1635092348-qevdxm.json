  "text": "hey guys! i need help deciding on who i should ask for a LOR\n\noption 1: my 10th grade AP world history teacher. i did well in her class and we had a good relationship + she\u2019s super sweet. i heard sophomore teachers could be a red flag, but is her being AP helpful?\n\noption 2: my 10th grade alg2 teacher. shes sponsor of a club that i have leadership in and shes also very nice, but im iffy about her being my sophomore teacher\n\noption 3: my junior AP seminar teacher. he is an EXTREMELY good writer, to the point everyone in the school respects him. also an amazing guy all around. i only had him over zoom tho :/ but we did have some meetings \n\noption 4: my current AP comp sci A teacher. he is super nice and i really enjoy the class, but idk if ive gotten to know him well enough (mainly why ive held off on asking for LORs for this long) but i want to go into cs so i think his word would have a lot of weight\n\nik this decision ultimately has to be mine, but i would really appreciate some outside opinions, thanks!",
