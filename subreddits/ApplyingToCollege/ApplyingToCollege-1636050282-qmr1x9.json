  "text": "So I'm not from the US but on the common app it asks for a GPA. Where I live, they take the top 7 grade 11 courses for your grade 11 avg. The top 8 courses are used for grades 9 and 10. \n\nDo I submit my avg amongst all my high school courses, or an average for a certain year, or the average based on how my province calculates it?",

      "text": "Honestly, I'm not sure, go with what you think best reflects you as a high schooler, but I think that all colleges will get your transcript and your high school profile (a document which should explain courses available and how grades are calculated), so they will be able to calculate these things themselves, and they often give more weight to official documents over self-reported stuff",
