  "text": "My interviewer was so nice and we got along super well. But at the end of the interview he said \u201cyou\u2019ll do great wherever you end up going\u201d\u2026. I am now in a spiral and have convinced myself this means he thinks I\u2019m a terrible fit for Princeton. I just need someone to give an opinion of if this is true or if it really doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nEDIT: thank you for all the kind words, I got super nervous after the interview and hearing from everyone helped so much. Definitely a reminder to not give into the pressure and stress from app season! Stay strong y\u2019all",

You could get accepted to Princeton and still end up enrolling somewhere else.  Even if you applied ED.  Things happen.  \n\nSo don\u2019t read too much into it!",

It was right in the middle of a Presidential primary, and I was really into the whole process.  I was actually volunteering locally for a candidate.  My interviewer and I talked politics for what seemed like hours!  \n\nAfter the interview we walked out to into the parking garage together, and proceeded to our cars which were parked near each other.  His car was the biggest piece of shit I had ever seen.  I politely took my time getting ready to leave thinking I would let him exit the parking garage ahead of me. And as he tried to drive away \u2026. his car wouldn\u2019t start!  I pulled up next to him and asked if I could help, and he asked me for a ride home!  \n\nAfter I dropped him off, I proudly and confidently drove home extremely pleased that my interviewer\u2019s misfortune was definitely my fortune.  Well \u2026. I didn\u2019t get in. \n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t read too much into how well or how badly you feel your interview went \u2026. it probably won\u2019t change the course of your fate either way.",
