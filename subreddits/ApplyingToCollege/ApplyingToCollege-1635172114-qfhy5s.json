  "text": "Hi, I want to submit my calligraphy as a supplementary material, but they don\u2019t fall under the \u201cArt Portfolio\u201d descriptions at any school. Should I submit it as a link on the additional section? Or do I not submit it at all? I think calligraphy really showcases my interest in art and I\u2019ve won a National award in it so I think including my work would be a good idea (although i\u2019m not applying as a art major at any school).",
