However, what they show is aggregated -- so we cannot see if there are certain schools for which their model has poor accuracy.\n\nThis past year's data and the switch to test-optional will likely throw their models off. Worse is that test submission has strategic choice with an equilibrium that messes strongly with the statistics -- so the new 25%-75% range will probably correspond to what *used to be* 45%-95%.",

                  "text": "You can definitely predict this fairly accurately; people predict *much* harder events than admissions. They are using their data to estimate effects for 75 variables. Now, SAT and ACT have now changed with schools going test-optional/blind, so they will need to re-estimate that variable; however, GPA, course rigor, major, in-/out-of-state/international, and a few other variables will still work decently well. Add in AP scores and that's probably just as good as SAT/ACT. Shoot, with enough data they could even use a person's school.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, the hardest cases to forecast are people near the 50-50 cut point. I also suspect there are probably some schools where they are very accurate (some state schools are almost formulaic) and some schools where they are not so accurate (Olin? Stanford? Arts schools?).\n\nOn an only slightly related note: I'm wondering how long it will take for people to coalesce around the equilibrium SAT submission cutoff.",

But aerospace is a small enough and selective enough major that I would think it would be a difficult read. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re out of state at each of these too, right?  \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an experiment if you\u2019re willing to try. Add Michigan and MIT. Record your precise aerospace odds at all five. Change your major to CS and do the same. Then change it to psychology and do the same. It would be interesting to see the differences in all three+those two. Seeing the deltas between those schools and between those majors would give you some level of confidence.\n\nIf the aerospace odds are materially lower than CS, something is wrong with their estimate (likely too few data points). If your psych odds aren\u2019t near 100% for your 3 schools, something is wrong. If the aerospace odds at the other two schools are not a significant step down, it\u2019s wrong.",

And that\u2019s where you are. If there isn\u2019t a big jump from aero to psych or between MIT/UMich and your schools, the model is almost definitely trash.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pick near 0% and near 100% with those models with tons of accuracy. That\u2019s not where these models should be judged. If that\u2019s 70% of their data points, those models will look accurate even if they\u2019re garbage in the 20-80% range.
