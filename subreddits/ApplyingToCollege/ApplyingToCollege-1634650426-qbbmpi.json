      "text": "No. Last year, my kids were rejected from multiple schools that CollegeVine had designated as \"safeties\" with >90% chance LOL. Meanwhile, they were admitted to some targets and one was WL at a high reach.\n\nKeep in mind that test optional policies have made chancing much more difficult *even when the student submits a score*. Apps increased significantly and colleges are still learning how to approach evaluating apps where only half of them come with scores.\n\nPlus, CollegeVine cannot account for ED vs RD.",
