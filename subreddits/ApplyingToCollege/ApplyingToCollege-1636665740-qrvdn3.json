  "title:": "Dear counsellors, what counts as a parent",
  "text": "I'm an international student who's lived in a single parent household with my mother for basically my entire life. My father's name is not on my birth certificate and there is no proof that I am biologically related to him on paper.\n\nThus considering my circumstances, I plan to entirely leave out anything to do with my father when applying for financial aid. Thus my question is simple: as there is no legally recognized proof of a relationship to my father, would it be legal/ethical to leave him out of the financial aid process.\n\nKeep in mind that I am in contact with my alleged father on a weekly basis and he lives in a different country plus the financial support he gives us, if any, is VERY inconsistent even though he is a man of means.",
