  "text": "Is the over looming sense of dread about my top pick school just a me thing? Or is everyone else feeling almost queasy about that top pick whether it\u2019s in range or it\u2019s not. I\u2019m losing sleep over my dream school for which I applied ED (the acceptance for ED is like 80%!), and I feel like it\u2019s just me. Everyone around me seems so calm about applying. Even to places I know they\u2019ve been considering and dreaming about for months. They all just seem to fine with it, so calm, and so assured. I\u2019m trying so hard to convince myself that I\u2019m just as good as the other applicants because statistically speaking her I am! But the other applicants at my school have sat on pedestals their entire lives and I have just merely looked up at them. Any advice on how to stop the constant anxiety?",
