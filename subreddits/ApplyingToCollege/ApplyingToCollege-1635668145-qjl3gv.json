  "text": "So I recently applied to msu and soon after pressing submit I realized I made a typo.   The typo I made was adding a parenthesis where a comma should be.   I feel like this is a pretty big typo so will it lower my chances of getting in or even worse will they not let me in at all.",

      "text": "I mean this is the nicest way possible but please go get some rest. Sleep deprivation causes one to overthink a lot imo\n\nThat typo will not affect whether you do or do get in, so youre good. Most likely it won't even be noticed at all. Even if it is, that one thing will not make the AO think \"hm that typo. Everything else is good, but no we cant allow them in bc of that.\"",
