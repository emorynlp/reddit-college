  "text": "I think it went really well. I enjoyed my conversation and the interviewer gave good signs in my opinion. \n\nSome of the questions were generic, though we spent a lot of the time naturally proceeding through a conversation about a variety of topics (history, Harvard life, politics [we agreed on virtually everything], etc).\n\nHere\u2019s what I can remember:\n- Tell me about yourself.\n- What are some of your extracurriculars? Why did you pursue them?\n- What academic areas are your favorite? Why did you pursue them? How did you pursue your academic interests in and outside of high school\n- Why Harvard?\n- Most of the questions weren\u2019t general and built off of my responses to those questions listed above",
