  "title:": "C'mon you CS nerds, help a gal pick a good laptop",
  "text": "I'm going to college next year and need a good laptop to get me through my classes. My current laptop takes a solid 5-10 minutes to fully boot up and it's miserable waiting. Also, I'm only looking for something that runs windows OS. I'm not at all familiar with any Apple/Mac OS since I've been using androids and Windows 10 my whole life. \n\nI usually run discord, spotify, and google all at the same time, with steam booting up when I start up the computer. I'm looking primarily for speed, as I don't need to run any heavy duty programs since I'm a screenwriting major. Weird requirement, but it would also need to run Portal 2 smoothly since I replay it every year. Lmk if you need more info and please give me some good recs.\n\nEDIT: It's a bit hidden within the rest of the text, but I am going to be a screenwriting major, not a CS major! I was just calling on CS people because I understand them to be tech savvy. Sorry for any confusion.",

          "text": "Yep. Also, Android and MacOS are both versions of UNIX/UNIX-like operating systems -- which most people will encounter in a CS program. Also, UNIX makes it less likely that a programming error will take down your whole OS. I wouldn't recommend coding in a Windows environment if UNIX/Linux were an alternative.",

              "text": "The only argument I could see for Windows is that some college courses may require you to run proprietary software that only supports Windows.  Usually if that's the case the department will publicize that fact.  Or, possibly, if your coursework will involve .NET development and/or creating application software targeting the Windows environment.\n\nOtherwise, learning how to get around in MacOS and/or how to do things in a POSIX environment is useful.",

It's well worth the cost (considering you're gonna be using it for at least 4 years, so might as well invest in a good one).\n\nIf that's too expensive, just get like a Lenovo and install Linux or another Unix distribution on it\n\nEdit: Just realized you're not majoring in CS. Disregard everything I just said lol, my bad",

Having a tech come to your location and fix something in a couple of days is much better than waiting 2-3 weeks for a fix by mail.\n\nThis would be Dell\u2019s match - [https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/2-in-1-laptops/inspiron-15-2-in-1-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-7506-2-in-1-laptop/n27506eyvdh](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/2-in-1-laptops/inspiron-15-2-in-1-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-7506-2-in-1-laptop/n27506eyvdh)\n\nHP and others will have similar models.\n\nThis should meet most needs, but specific CS specialties require higher powered machines. You\u2018d probably know this already if it\u2019s required.",

      "text": "My son has been a Windows guy for many years, but started using a MacBook Air lately - hated it for the first couple of weeks, but is loving it now - there is a bit of a learning curve, but it really isn't that bad.\n\nIf you want to stick with Windows, there are a ton of options... I would visit a Best Buy to see what screen size and weight seems ideal for you - if this will be your primary school laptop and you'll be carrying it around, get something light, around a 13\" screen size... And if you have a Costco membership, their deals and service is the best!\n\nAs for specs, with your requirements, you don't need a very powerful processor - you could easily get by with an i3, although an i5 would future-proof you for a while... Memory is more important - go with at least an 8GB RAM, although a 16GB would again be better in the long run... And make sure the storage is SSD - at least 256GB, but again, 512GB would be better.",
