  "title:": "Just got my Nov. SAT results, any schools that I should consider?",
  "text": "As for location/geographical stuff, I am pretty open right now. I'm currently in Washington so weather is a non-issue and but a drastic change could be fun. I'm mainly looking for some more West coast schools to add to my list as I'm starting to think East coast is a bit too far for me. Ideally they should give decent financial aid and have a public health program (or an adjacent major ie. health services). Other than that, I am pretty open to anything.\n\n**As for stats/ecs,**\n\n3.99 UW (maybe around a 4.35 W)\n\n1400 SAT\n\n\"Good\" ECs but nothing crazy. Just shows that I was involved in school with 4 leadership positions in clubs and other various club positions and leadership stuff.\n\nWashington Resident\n\nAsian Male\n\n**Schools I'm applying to:**\n\nUniversity of Washington Seattle\n\nSeattle U\n\nUNC Chapel Hill\n\nBoston U\n\nUSC\n\nAny other suggestions? The UCs were my \"dream\" schools but they rarely offer aid to out of state students so I gave up on that. I really don't see myself on the east coast but am applying to some of these schools just to keep my options open. Any California schools that I'm missing?",
