  "text": "Hi, I\u2019ve applied REA to Stanford. The website says they offer interviews based on availability in the first few weeks of November. Now that all interviews are online, on what parameters would they offer interviews? Does anyone know by about what date I can expect to hear about an interview? Also, there are mixed opinions on  whether an interview means you have a strong application or is offered randomly based on availability. What do you guys think? Appreciate the help!\nP.S. I\u2019m an international student.",

Don't sweat it if you don't get one, and be patient for the next few weeks.",
