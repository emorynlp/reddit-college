  "text": "Everything I've heard in my life is that you can get your AA in two years when taking four classes each semester. However every community college I've looked into provides only three credits per class, with a requirement of sixty credits to pass. This math obviously doesn't add up to two years. Is the two year four-class per semester just a myth at this point?",

      "text": "Based on your own observation yes\u2026unless you take classes over the summer semester for the other hours. Almost all colleges say 15-hours per semester (5x 3-hour courses) will get you AA in 2-years and most Universities day 5x 3-hour courses for 4-years will get you a BS/BA.",

      "text": "Most AA programs take 2 years if you schedule your classes correctly. 12 credits a semester is technically full time but you will not graduate in 2 years at that rate. You need to take at least 15 credits a semester to complete an AA in 2 years. \n\nFor reference, most full time students take anywhere from 12-18 credits a semester. This works out to 4-6 classes usually. \n\nMaybe what you\u2019ve heard includes take 1-2 classes during the summer and winter terms as well?",
