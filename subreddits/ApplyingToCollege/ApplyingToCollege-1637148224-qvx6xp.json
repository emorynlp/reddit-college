  "text": "Hello everyone, im sure you guys are having a busy day these days stressing about college & you'll start to hear back from colleges soon.\n\nI was very active here and got lots of help from this community so i just wanted to help. \n\nWhen I was choosing&applying to colleges, I only looked at worldwide rankings.. and applied to about 15 universities worldwide, all from top 50 QS world ranking LOL\n\nI got into various colleges in UK, USA, Singapore... \n\nhighest was top 8th in the world, and of course i had to pick that one just based on ranking\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis was a major mistake. i always wonder if i would've been happier if i didn't choose based on the ranking :( yeah college ranking matters when you're applying for jobs, but i think its better to live your best 4 years of life not regretting your choice you made based on ranking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are things I wish i considered when picking the college, not particularly in order.\n\nlocation - really important in terms of the culture, and whether if its close to home\n\nstudent life - my college is very very competitive and its mentally draining. make sure you do plenty of research on this.\n\nalumnis - especially if you want to go into any kind of business. connection is super important. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni know these are basic, but please please learn from my mistakes ... :(\n\nthey are more important than you think!",

If you're able to make it to other top universities in the world, I'm sure you have the capability to succeed anywhere you go. If you can't take it there, transferring is always an option.\n\nAnd yes I agree, take all rankings with a grain of salt. I find them better judges for graduate school outcomes compared to undergraduate, where the things you listed matter a lot more. These rankings heavily rely on research output after all.",
