  "text": "our school had this really cool opportunity where we could pay around 3k to perform in carnegie hall (150 students), involves weekly group recitals and personal learning to play 40+ minutes there. \n\nwould this be something i could write as an activity? ik it\u2019s not prestigious bc i\u2019m literally paying to do it, but i feel like all this effort should go towards something lol\n\nthoughts?",

      "text": "You could still write it down as an activity since it\u2019s something you\u2019re putting time and effort into outside of school. Just don\u2019t lie about it or purposefully mischaracterize it, such as by saying that you were *invited* to play at Carnegie Hall, which wouldn\u2019t be true.",

      "text": "If it\u2019s $3k/150 = $20 per student, it would be a fun effort.\n\nIf it\u2019s $3k per person - I sure wouldn\u2019t.\n\nDo it only if you think you will enjoy it. Don\u2019t think it is beneficial for a college application. Like expensive unaffiliated summer programs that are held on prestigious campuses, paying for this benefit is not impressive to AOs.",
