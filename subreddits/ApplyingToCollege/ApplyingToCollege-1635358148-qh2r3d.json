  "text": "So basically, in my awards section I mentioned something I did b/w the summer of 11th and 12th grade, but I wrote 11th AND 12th there by mistake. And then I further elaborated on that in my activities section but their I only wrote 12th.\n\n(It was a summer program which I only did one year)\n\nI alr submitted this app to one college (my safety), what do I do?
