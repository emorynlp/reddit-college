It always sucks when you can't find a job, but the job market is incredibly competitive right now. \n\nThere are a lot of unemployed people with far more experience than a recent high school graduate with no experience. And there's people who were laid off that the company might hire over a new employee out of preference for someone they've already trained. There's also people applying for jobs below their usual pay grade or level of experience because they can't find their usual work, either because of competition or their field is no longer operating at full capacity - i.e. isn't looking to hire in the first place. \n\nEven people who aren't completely new and have 2-3 years of college and work experience (like myself) haven't been able to find a job in over 6 months, even applying to more than the unemployment minimum of 3 jobs a week...that's over a hundred jobs at least. All rejections. \n\nAnd that's just the world we live in right now. So realistically, it's probably not that you're doing anything wrong...there's just hundreds of people applying to that same job that you normally wouldn't have to compete with.",

Around 70 million Americans have filed for unemployment since the pandemic started, and 11 million people who were laid off at the beginning of the pandemic are still unemployed. ^(Also these are from about 10 minutes of google searching, and some sources were about a month old, projecting the data for December. It is a rough but generally accurate estimation, +- several hundred thousand)\n\nJust thinking logically, it makes sense that you can\u2019t get a job. All the odds are against you. All of the odds are *not* against you to get into university. \n\nAlso I just realized you might not be american. All this data is for the US :)",
