  "text": "I was talking to a friend today whose applying REA to Yale and asked about his ECs. besides the usual sports, his leadership positions, etc. he straight up admitted that he ran out of ECs toward the end and put that he WROTE A BOOK, but hasn\u2019t gotten it published. Like, he said he\u2019s been writing this entire novel throughout high school and just hasn\u2019t shared it with anyone. Surely colleges won\u2019t give this any weight bc it isn\u2019t verifiable? Or will they ask to see his book? he\u2019s aplying for a humanities major so i feel like this is a significant unfair advantage",

If he gets in, it would be because of other reasons and if he's denied, it probably be because of other reasons again (plausible deniability so there's no way to verify his statements).",
