  "title:": "Applying to colleges after being accepted before a gap year",
  "text": "I applied to colleges in my senior year of high school (2019-2020) and got into my safety school, which was UMD. I then deferred twice in order to take a gap year, and I'm planning to go to college in fall 2022. Would I be allowed to apply for other colleges again this coming application season while still retaining my spot at Maryland in case I don't get in to any others?\n\nThanks",
