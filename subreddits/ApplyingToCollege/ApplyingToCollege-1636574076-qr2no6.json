  "text": "Alright so on the Cal State app, there's a question that asks about \"extracurriculars, hours of participation and leadership\". It specifically asks within the last 36 months. Thing is, even though I was very active in ECAs, I've been in the military the past 4 years. \n\nDo I just put zero hours? Or is it really asking for the last 3 years of high school? I'd hope to not have to put a flat 0 for this question.",
