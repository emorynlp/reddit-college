  "text": "The vast majority of other seniors at my school are really competitive and have been talking a lot about college applications the last few weeks. They have also been sharing their ideas for their commonapp & supplementals with one another just to get feedback and advice.\n\nAs much as I try not to, I find myself constantly comparing their ideas to my own and questioning whether the ideas I have can measure up to theirs, even though when writing, I felt really good about my essays. \n\nIt's pretty brutal right now, so if anyone has any positive stories to share about how life moves on and things hopefully getting better, please share them!",

      "text": "All me and my friends/classmates seem to talk about lately is college and I hate it, the small talk and comparisons are so redundant. I hate how our lives revolve around academics and college, so I hope after November 1 we can shift back to reality- probably not though. Day after day its the same question \u201cwhat colleges,\u201d \u201cwhat major\u201d, etc. \n\nThe other day we were all going around in a circle reading our personal essays \ud83d\ude2d it was brutal. Now, when I find myself stuck in those same conversations I just ask if we can talk about something OTHER than what we talk about 24/7\n\nIt\u2019s definitely easier said than done but try not comparing yourself to everyone else, the people always trying to talk about it and compare tend to be the ones that know they\u2019re way further along in the app process than everyone else. You are already doing so much and theres plenty of people who don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing at all and that\u2019s also alright. Just take things one day at a time and give each day your whole energy and live in the present. My math teacher had a really good quote that I just tried to emulate, but unfortunately it did not work.",

      "text": "I find solace in the fact that I will apply with my essays, my ECs, and my scores. My application is ME. I'm not comparing myself to anyone else or competing with anyone. Whether I get accepted or rejected to any school, I might be sad, but that's ME. They didn't want ME, so I wasn't supposed to go there anyway. I will be happy to go anywhere that accepts me for who I am and what I've done.",
