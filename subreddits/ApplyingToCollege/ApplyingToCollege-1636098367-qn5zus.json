  "text": "Applying to a college through common application. It says \u201c300 word maximum\u201d in the prompt. However, the Common Application text window where you actually type in your essay has an actual maximum of 3000 characters. I managed to paste in an essay far over 300 words, and was limited by the character count.\n\nAm I supposed to stick to the stated word limit, or go for what common app technically limits me?",
