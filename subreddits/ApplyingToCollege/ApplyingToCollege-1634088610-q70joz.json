  "title:": "As a US citizen, I genuinely feel horrible about how hard it is for internationals.",
  "text": "Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Indian so it pulls at my heartstrings. Maybe it\u2019s because my parents struggled to find employment here after coming to America. Maybe it\u2019s because I know that I couldn\u2019t have even thought of trying to go to a US college if I was in another country. Maybe it\u2019s because I know what it\u2019s like to not have stable housing or a stable income. Maybe it\u2019s because I understand how hard it is to be part of the diaspora because your country won\u2019t provide you opportunities.\n\nMy mom grew up in a time when she, her sister, and her mother were called prostitutes under everyone\u2019s breath because they had to run away from a father who wanted to burn them alive. My mom studied like crazy to attend AIIMS because she knew that she couldn\u2019t live like that. But here, her degree was nothing more than a state college degree.\n\nI refuse to let that happen to me so I push myself but, when I think about it, it\u2019s because my parents gave me the opportunity to even dream like this.\n\nTo all of you internationals who stay up all night studying to make a dream that looks impossible to everyone around you become your future, only to encounter obstacle after obstacle, keep pushing forward. Compared to many here, you\u2019ve already exceeded us. \n\nI wish you could see how proud I am that there are so many kids here who are trying to make the most of what they have.\n\nKeep at it\u2014your future awaits you and I hope that you\u2019ll be able to achieve your goals and get to a place where you can live your dreams\u2014whether that be in the US or abroad.\n\nSending you all lots of luck, especially to those who are applying this year or are taking board exams this year. <3",

You're right though, applications are probably not the best metric. I think it's something like a million or couple million US high schoolers go on to college and most would probably love to go to a top school, so demand is still similar to what I was saying. And ya I don't know, it just seems the logistics and negatives of expanding aren't really worth it considering it would hardly put a dent in satisfying the demand.",

In the end, if we want to go to a T20, we ultimately have to self study aps just to show how much rigour we can handle.

      "text": "It's challenging and competitive for sure, especially for those who need financial aid. But there is help - I always encourage international students to go check out /r/IntlToUSA.  There are tons of helpful posts and people over there.\n\nThere are only 7 colleges in the US that are need-blind for international students and meet 100% of demonstrated need: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, Curtis Institute of Music, and Minerva Schools at KGI (note those last two are a little different, so do your research). Every other college is going to consider your ability to pay when evaluating you for admission. That doesn't mean you can't still get in, but it makes it far more competitive. Of course, because of this, those 7 schools are also incredibly selective and difficult to get into as an international because literally millions of top students from around the globe would love a six figure education for free.\n\nThere are already thousands of qualified domestic applicants who are also requesting lots of aid. Many of these will be rejected too, even though they require much less aid than internationals. One reason for this is that domestic students can get state and federal aid, in addition to having more access to loans. Since internationals aren't eligible for US government aid, the institution has to pay the entire cost (often including travel, because most students with a $0 EFC aren't in a position to spend $2K+ per year on travel). So as an international student you have to convince the college to admit you AND give you more money than they would have to give a similar domestic student.\n\nYou may also find some valuable information in the following links and the /r/IntlToUSA sub in general.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/guxvib/paying_for_college_is_hard_heres_a_guide_to/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/f7e03h/helpful_resources_for_international_applicants/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/dcf9hz/three_of_the_greatest_resources_available_on_ed/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/aztnqz/heres_a_good_resource_for_finding_scholarships/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/96ahq5/the_best_us_schools_for_international_students/\n\nColleges usually allocate more aid to domestic students. Here are two great resources to see how much aid you might expect and which colleges offer generous aid to internationals.\n\nhttps://www.ivyachievement.com/2019intl/\n\nAlso check out the last link on this page: https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources.\n\nThis shows information on ED vs RD as well as the number of international students, the percentage of the student body that is international, the percentage of internationals receiving aid, the average aid award, and the college's policy on awarding aid to internationals (need-based only, merit-based only, both, or none).\n\nThese two resources are the biggest gold mine out there for international students who need aid. They can help you find colleges that you might not have considered but could give you a significant award making education in the US a real possibility. It also goes beyond the standard 20-50 colleges that all of the other international students are hammering with applications and requests for aid - potentially increasing your odds significantly of getting in and getting aid.",

          "text": "I see your point and I completely agree that the reason why many spots go to Americans is because of tax dollars (and from an institutional perspective, I totally would do the same). \n\nThe part that rlly makes me sad tho is that a lot of kids who are international could truly thrive in a US college moreso than a college in their native country. Yet, because they quite literally would need to travel across the world away from their family and *still* face so many obstacles during the process of applying, they aren\u2019t able to achieve their true potential.\n\nIn an ideal world, colleges around the world became amazing places for everyone to thrive on their own tax money\u2014but until then, I really hope that internationals achieve their dreams <3",

This infrastructure was built for the citizens as an investment (which has paid off in states like CA). It's hard to even direct the aid in other countries who don't want to expand their higher education infrastructure or doing it quickly enough.\n\nAlso there is a maximization, while international students will dish out more money in tuition and fees, what net gain do they bring to the U.S? Will they immigrate and join the work/research force? Or will they return back to their nations. It's a skeptical way to look at it, but it is real. Education/knowledge is not as free flowing as people perceive.",

Nobody understands it, not even the holistic AOs.

How the hell am I supposed to learn about stem on my own while studying at a public school. Curriculum sucks as well in my country, and the grading system at school. I don't know what am I gonna do. Reality is so HARSH. You want to do something, but you cant do just because of financial stuffs. It's a horror, i repeat, it's a horror to grow up in a developing country. I know there are people in a worse situation, but it's HURTS a lot when you can't fulfil your dream even after having the capability just because of your environment and stuff. Sorry to rant. :))",

Not to mention, if they're able to find a job once they graduate, they'll be paying just as much in taxes to America as an American Citizen will.\n\nI'm definitely not saying American students shouldn't be prioritised, they are American institutions after all, but the college admissions process is ludicrously hard for internationals and that should definitely count for more.\n\nNot only do we have to study and pay more than Americans to give standardised tests like the SATs and APs on top of our local curriculums, but also compete with thousands of other highly qualified candidates for a single seat at a top institution - it's literally statistical suicide to be applying from a country like China or India. Doesn't just stop there however, we also have next to no job security after graduating.",

Most people avoid it because they either don't want to put the effort to go through the extrance examinations or don't want to study in Indian institutions. It's not about less acceptance but less application or not enough score in the entrance.\n\nEdit:  Found out  foreign students don't even have to appear for JEE main and have reserved seats. As quoted by this article \"Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) have created 10 per cent supernumerary seats and reserved over 1100 seats for foreign students across courses and institutes, the number of international applicants for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced \u2014 the entrance test for IITs \u2014 was 807. Out of these, only 53 students appeared for the exam and only one qualified for admission to one of the most prestigious institutes in India.\"\n\nSource: https://indianexpress.com/article/education/no-jee-main-reserved-seats-yet-iits-fail-to-woo-foreign-students-5695439/",

Let's just say the path is set up for undocumented migrants to achieve immigrant status faster than for international students. It is almost impossible unless a big company hires you and they want to take the time and resources to follow through with a visa petition. Including, posting in the newspaper and accepting candidate resumes etc..\n\nI was in aviation so I had zero chances of getting hired.",

Private colleges can do whatever they want, but I'd be paying taxes for international kids to come here, take Americans' spots, and go back to their own country to live.\n\nI'm glad I'm an American, but I'd rather give education opportunities to our own citizens rather than internationals whose education won't benefit us in any way.",

And I say this for schools in India as well where the competition is already shit crazy. If someone is qualified enough to get an ivy League education, they should get an ivy League education. Also, applicants like me are much more common, who wants to stay in the US and give back to the country. If I land a good job after going to, say, UMich, I will try to give back to UMich and increase the GPA of the states and pay the tax greens to the federal government. Ngl, no offense but a large part of American youth is not planning on going to college and land vocational jobs which makes enough for the family (not a majority, but it definitely makes a difference) and the int'l settlers are taking the average wayyy up. Be in the Indian software engineers or doctors.",
