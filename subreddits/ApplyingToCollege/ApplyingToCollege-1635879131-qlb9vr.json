  "text": "Basically I mistakenly didn't waive FERPA and invited my counselor. As I am an international applicant, my counselor already submitted the LOR without noticing that FERPA was not waived..Now I can't waive my FERPA. I haven't applied to any colleges yet..now is it possible if I request my counselor to unsubmit the form and he does that , then will I be able to waive my FERPA? Please provide me some help..I am basically having a panic attack rn :\"((",
