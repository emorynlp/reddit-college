In addition, a lot of those programs listed above make really good money out of college especially in the states. \n\nAlso when you are applying (and really before) I can\u2019t emphasize enough how much you should reach out to departments and professors at schools you\u2019re interested in to ask about opportunities for interdepartmental study. Most professors, at least in my experience, would be absolutely willing to chat with you about that.",
