      "text": "For journals in English, it is usually quite obvious whether a journal is legitimate or not. \n\nPredatory journals tend to prey primarily on authors whose first language is not English. If you are working with a qualified supervisor, you don't need to worry about this. \n\nIf you are trying to publish something on your own, you should try to find someone at a college or university who can provide you with guidance. It is not easy to publish your work and you shouldn't try to navigate the process on your own.",

If it\u2019s other high school students, it won\u2019t be as impressive as say something that requires professors to do a blind review. \n\nRemember, AOs have access to faculty if they really have questions. This individuals and a quick Google search can tell them a lot.",
