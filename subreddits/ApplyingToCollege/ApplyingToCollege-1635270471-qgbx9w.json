  "text": "I have this ap lang teacher who makes his tests abnormally hard with no curve,and only 1/10 people in my class got an A-, and even so barely as she got Bs and Cs on the tests. This man takes pride in people not passing.. he makes his test on random details on books that only he can do because he has photographic memory.\n\nAnd when I mentioned the difficulty to the counselor she said, \"but hes a good teacher that prepares you for college\" ...\n\nLike if hes preparing me for the bs professors but This is a highschool course... 10 hours of nonstop studying just to get a C on the test bro smh.\n\nHe doesnt have good pass rates or anything for the AP test either... hes just weird.",
