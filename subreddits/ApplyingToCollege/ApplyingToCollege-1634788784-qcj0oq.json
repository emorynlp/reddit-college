  "text": "I'm looking at Hamilton College and Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT. Idk which to apply to Early Decision 1 or 2, but if I don't get into the first I'll apply to the second. Both are small, liberal arts colleges in New England that are always high on the list of best colleges. Both have open curriculums and have beautiful campuses and in the same sports leagues. These are the things that I'm looking for and am not sure which school is better at:\n\nStrong STEM Program\n\nPolitical diversity (I'm center left but I don't like when either side is throwing it in my face and I want both sides to be represented)\n\nParty life (I'm not a big party person, I just want to know if they're available)\n\nResearch/internships/study abroad\n\nand/or anything else that makes them stand out. If anyone knows anything, which sounds better and why?",
