  "text": "Hello, I am an international student hoping to apply to any LAC/private school for ED. The biggest caveat is I need a lot of financial aid for my socio-economic position :)\n\nMy profile:\n\n1) top 2% in high school\n\n2) I have a good ECA profile (hopefully) with multiple leadership roles and high-end research competitions along with tutoring and community service. \n\n3) My sat result is yet to come. \n\nMy shortlisted colleges are:\n\n1) Middlebury college\n\n2) Amherst college\n\n3) University of Rochester \n\n4) Williams College\n\nplease help me decide on which college should I go for (ED) considering where I'd get the most amount of financial aid as an int' student. Also, do drop suggestions for other colleges if it seems fit.",

It's a long story and It's really late here already so im going to explain it briefly.\n\nLots of financial aid budget, you basically can earn up to 5k during summer(2 months period) if you choose to do an internship or summer research, share prestigious intership programs with Harvard, Yale, MIT, Stanford, Cornell, and UChicago. The dorms and food quality are rated constantly top ten in the U.S.\n\nIts admission standard is similar to Bates and Colorado College, but for whatever the reason, it is often not in most international students' radar due to its underperforming rankings. It's a hidden gem.",
