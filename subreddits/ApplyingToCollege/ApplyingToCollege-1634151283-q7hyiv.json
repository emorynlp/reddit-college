  "text": "Hello, I am an international student hoping to apply to any LAC/private school for ED. The biggest caveat is I need a lot of financial aid for my socio-economic position :)\n\nMy profile:\n\n1) top 2% in high school\n\n2) I have a good ECA profile (hopefully) with multiple leadership roles and high-end research competitions along with tutoring and community service. \n\n3) My sat result is yet to come. \n\nMy shortlisted colleges are:\n\n1) Middlebury college\n\n2) Amherst college\n\n3) University of Rochester \n\n4) Williams College\n\nplease help me decide on which college should I go for (ED) considering where I'd get the most amount of financial aid as an int' student. Also, do drop suggestions for other colleges if it seems fit.",
