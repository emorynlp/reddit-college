It kinda makes me stressed that people already have at least one college they know they can attend. I know it is very early right now but I just wish I had at least one acceptance from somewhere that can put my mind at ease.",

What the OP is talking about is mostly rolling admissions, which typically take only a couple of weeks before decisions come out !",

I\u2019m not sure what your situation is or if you are able to randomly throw another log on the fire, but I have heard they will give most (maybe all) applications an answer really fast.  They have rolling admissions.  Their acceptance rate is excellent.\n\nLike people have said, depending on what colleges you applied to, you may have to wait a couple more months to hear anything, so if you are really freaked out and you have the time and funds (I think their application fee is $40?) it may make you feel better to get at least one answer \u2026 and I have heard they are really fast.  Good luck!",
