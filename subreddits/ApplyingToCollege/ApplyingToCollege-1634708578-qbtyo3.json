  "text": "I know that the maximum amount of universities in the CommonApp to add to a college list is 20; however, I was wondering if I could still apply to other universities after I have already received an answer from the previous batch of colleges (accepted/declined). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSay I were to apply for 20 colleges in early admission.\n\nCould still apply to a different batch of 20 universities for the regular applications?",

      "text": "I don't believe so. It's also not needed for the majority of cases. Even if you want to apply to more, the UC app, the Coalition App, and school specific apps should be enough. Spoken as someone who maxed out the common apps 20. I understand applying to a lot of colleges, I did so in order to maximize my chances of good fin aid, but beyond 5/10 you really need to ask that question and answer it for yourself.",
