  "text": "I am currently in the process of filling out my ApplyTexas applications for the fall of 2022, however I am absolutely stumped on how to fill out the extracuriccular activities page.\n\nThe page states: Please list, in priority order, the clubs, teams and other organizations you have participated in throughout your high school career..\n\nThe activity level is also a list from local to national, and I assume this requires some recognition in a form of school involvement.\n\nHowever, I have never been involved in a club at my school. Before the new ApplyTexas website was made, it was never specific about \"clubs, teams and other organizations\". I have plenty of hobbies, earn income as a freelance programmer and YouTuber, and was planning to go ahead and list these, but it seems like the page is so specific to direct involvement with an actual organization and I'm not sure if they're supposed to be listed here now! The page is so different from the old website.\n\nDoes anyone know if I can go ahead and list my personal extracurriculars or should I just mention them in my short answers/essay? I fear that an empty page here would be detrimental to my application review.",
