  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m applying to UBC Sep 2022 intake. I\u2019ve drafted my essay and was wondering if someone could give me constructive criticism on what to improve on in my Essay? I\u2019m worried about my drafts and them not being good at all. Everything I\u2019ve written is all over the place. \n\nIf interested just comment or send me a Dm. Thank you, in advance.",
