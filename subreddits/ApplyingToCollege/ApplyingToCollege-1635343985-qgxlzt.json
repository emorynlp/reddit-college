  "text": "First off, the most important thing\u2013 Int'l student having an EFC of \\~ $10k/year\n\n**Grades:** 90%+ all three and a half years of HS (Indian CBSE curriculum) \u2013 Probably equivalent to a 4.0\n\n**Rank:** 1st/81\n\n**Coursework:** Not THE most challenging but the CBSE science stream is considered very rigorous IG.\n\n**Test Scores:** 1490 SAT (770 Math; 720 English)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AWARDS: 1 national**; **2 regional** (one where my research paper was selected as one of the 3 best in the region, one where I represented my state in a STEM competition, **2 state** (one where I was in the top 99.75 percentile out of 1 million participants, one where I was selected as one of the best 30 out of 300,000 students)\n\nAll awards are merit-based (through tests and activities).\n\n**ECs (probably my strongest part):** I'm describing them vaguely in this post but I promise this is not how I've written the descriptions on the common app\u2013\n\n1. Leadership position in an NGO (established in the 1980s by a very influential politician); impacted 5000+ people; Won State awards for the NGO (awarded by top-level politicians); Received tons of local media coverage.\n2. Volunteer Teacher and some leadership position at an international award-winning program. Basically taught low-income indigenous tribal students who subsequently won multiple national awards; I gathered around 20-30 volunteers for the same and also hosted a camp for around 200 students\n3. Executive Board Membership in an initiative that attracted more than a million impressions (i.e. social media \"hits\") with thousands of active users.\n4. Founder of an NGO that helped a few hundred animals and have a few dozen volunteers working every week (I'll admit, this is more of a cookie-cutter Instagram NGO kinda activity but it did get some traction)\n5. My business (like a sole trade) \u2013 earned enough money to live a comfortable single life for 2+ years in my country (i.e. pay rent, utilities, food, etc.) (although when converted to dollars, it doesn't seem like much I guess).\n6. First author in a research paper (interdisciplinary research)\u2013 it did **not** get published in a predator journal but I must admit that the journal is not impressive.\n7. Co-author in a research paper \u2013 Collaborated with 2 national labs/universities. This one is pretty big. Got published in an okay-ish to good journal (okay-ish for PhD students so I guess for me it's pretty good?)\n8. 2 times intern for a mid-sized company\u2013 First time I interned for free; the second time, they were willing to pay me money to intern (i.e. paid internship). Couldn't really help much except sort some data for them but I did spot a few errors in their system that saved them thousands of dollars so I guess that counts?\n9. Freelance visual artist with around 400,000+ social media hits (Behance, Dribbble, Youtube, etc.) and 5 years of commission experience (got paid in pennies though).\n10. Family Responsibility- Took care of a family member who suffered from a very serious and terminal disease.\n\nA few additional activities\u2013 Writer in a blog with over 200k+ reads, Won a few MUNs and was the president of one; Been playing drums for more than 5 years, Piano for around 2 years, and a music producer (and DJ) for around 3-4 years now. My performances have been featured in local TV shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LIST:**\n\nSkidmore College\n\nLafayette\n\nVassar\n\nDavidson\n\nColgate\n\nGrinnell\n\nWashington and Lee\n\nHaverford\n\nWashU\n\nMiddlebury\n\nAmherst College\n\nColby\n\nDartmouth College\n\nUChicago\n\nPomona\n\nWilliams\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need some suggestions for my college list. Can you suggest some other colleges where I might have a good chance of getting a near-full ride?\n\nAre there any colleges on my list that I should probably remove?\n\nDo you know of any full-ride scholarships that I might have a chance of getting?\n\nShould I aim a bit high and apply to T-10s?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease note that this is **not** a chance-me post but rather me asking for college list suggestions.",

It's just that my views don't align with their policies).\n\nThe most important factor is financial aid though.",
