      "text": "Harvard and Georgetown are some big names in those majors, especially with Georgetown being in the capital. A lot of the crazy selective schools are good for these majors, really.\n\nThere's the University of Michigan, William & Mary, Northeastern, UNC, University of Virginia, American University, Wake Forest, but they all have a \\~20%-40% acceptance rate.\n\nBut definitely do your own research, those majors are pretty different than mine, so I don't have much knowledge on the best schools for your interest. I tend to use Niche and similar sites as jumping-off points to kick-start my research into a school.",
