  "text": "ED Decisions are coming out soon. In case I don\u2019t get accepted into my top schools, I\u2019m already planning ways to transfer, lol. \n\nI\u2019ve done some research, but i\u2019m still confused\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve heard that colleges weigh your SAT/ACT less because your transcript is already enough proof of your ability to succeed in college. If I begin applying fall 2022, how would they have any idea of my grades?\n\nAlso, should I still be volunteering?\nIs there an essay similar to the common app essay?\n\nSo many questions lol.",

      "text": "I\u2019d you\u2019re a transfer student, you don\u2019t get your HS record considered **at all**. Though I seriously would highly recommend against immediately planning to transfer out of a 4-year just because you didn\u2019t get into your top choices\u2026 walking into a new experience with one foot on the gas pedal ready to go is a bad idea and you\u2019re going to miss out on a lot of fun and good experiences you could have at wherever you do end up.",
