      "text": "I have a friend who would literally brag about some prestigious colleges like Princeton or Brown just sent him another email asking him to learn more about these schools. He thinks that by receiving these emails, he's at the top 1% or something.\n\nThe twist is, he signed up for these emails. Because when all of us started to get emails from colleges, he didn't get any. So he literally went and subscribed to these schools. \n\nYeah, rather sad.",
