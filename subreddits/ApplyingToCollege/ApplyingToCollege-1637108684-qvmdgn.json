  "text": "Ik Arizona State is really good for CS opportunities, but what about University of Arizona? Do companies like recruiting from UofA as well? I\u2019m just looking at my safety schools and ASU recently changed their policy on a huge automatic scholarship I was depending on getting (I don\u2019t have the financial aid package yet but the reason why I applied was bc of that scholarship + the CS opportunities so it was like the most perfect safety but things don\u2019t always work out :///) \n\nbut the University of Arizona is offering a me lotttt of merit aid (and then some!) and also automatic honors college admission so I just wanna know how their opportunities and quality of cs program compare",
