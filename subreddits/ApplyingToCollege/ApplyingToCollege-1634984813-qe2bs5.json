  "text": "A hallmark of the Columbia experience is being able to learn and live in a community with a wide range of perspectives. How do you or would you learn from and contribute to diverse, collaborative communities?  \n\nShould narrative be included in supplements or should I keep it very concise? I want to talk about the work that I've done for my school in terms of equity diversity and inclusion. Should I just talk about the work I've done and how I would bring that to Columbia? Or should I use storytelling to talk about my experience?  It's only 200 words so I'm not sure.",
