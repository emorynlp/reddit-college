  "text": "I\u2019m an internation student and wondering what is the difference between top 10 schools and low acceptance schools? In my country, universities are ranked based on acceptance percents. For example tulane has a 10% acceptance rate but it is ranked quite low on best schools rankings although it is very hard to get into Tulane?",

      "text": "the reason tulane has such a low acceptance rate is because they have no application fee! also, all their supplements are optional (though writing them benefit you always). therefore, you can apply with little to no effort if you want. with this in mind, basically no one gets in RD. if you genuinely want to attend tulane, i recommend applying ED or EA, although it might be a bit late for that.",

      "text": "Yeah, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. But acceptance rate is less accurate. The rankings probably give a good idea of where a school is ranked, as Harvard is always considered a T5. Etc.",
