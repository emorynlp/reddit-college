  "text": "So, to start, I'm trying to find different colleges to apply to that aren't really extremely selective and ones that I don't need to be the absolute perfect human with 36 ACT and all that. I'm an A and B student, I've done early college credit and tons of volunteer work around my local community, but I'm probably not up to par with the big names, so I'd rather have some good safeties. My dream field is a political science and international affairs major and I aspire to be a lawyer, so I would assume that the perfect place to be is near DC or the East, but anywhere is fine. \n\nI've been looking into GMU, just since that seems relatively easy, and it seems like a good school considering the location, but I'm worried about my apps, so I would like to at least get many places to apply. So if anyone can give ideas for good safeties and not extremely selective schools for these fields, that would be great. Thanks :)",
