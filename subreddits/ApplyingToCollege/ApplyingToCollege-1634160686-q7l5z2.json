  "text": "Before I took the SAT I remember reading on here how people hated it and I remember thinking psshh it can't be that bad...\n\nWrong. Two months later, after spending tons on fees I've had it. It was beyond stressful actually trying to get to testing centres due to lack of sites and a lot of people on here have faced problems and cancellations, which isn't justifiable with the amount paid. It is not worth the stress. \n\nI hope colleges/universities continue with this test optional policy or implement a better, alternative option. Something has to be done about this monopoly from CollegeBoard and ACT.",
