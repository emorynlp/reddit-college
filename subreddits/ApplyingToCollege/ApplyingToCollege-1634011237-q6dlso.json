      "text": "Keep in mind that your reasons for not applying ED at Cornell does not apply to regular admission. In most case, ED is binding so you would have to attend if admitted (not legally required but you would essentially be blacklisted if you don't). This also means you wouldn't be able to negotiate your financial aid.\n\nHowever, with regular admissions, you can go to any school you were admitted and compared financial aid between those schools (could negotiate for higher aid if other schools offered you more). So while I think you made a great decision of not applying for ED at Cornell, you can still apply there for regular admission if you really want to go. Plus, private schools generally give more aid and ironically can be more affordable than state schools.\n\n**TL;DR:** Basically the main difference is you can wait and see what other fin aid offers you get during reg admission but not w/ ED. Hope that helps. Good luck.",

Cornell will NOT be offering a financial aid package that is substantially different from what the NPC says.",
