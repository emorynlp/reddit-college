  "text": "So I\u2019m conflicted- is it better to chose to list larger awards, like scholar with distinction & NHS (both national, and NHS is more competitive at my school than most) or smaller, more unique awards like one for poetry or being the best in a class that was only school-wide? I don\u2019t have room for them all. Thanks",
