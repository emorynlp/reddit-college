The videos are posted on YouTube and usually feature a speaker who lectures for about five minutes. The organization relies on donations, and much of the early funding came from hydraulic fracturing billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks.PragerU is not a university or academic institution. It does not hold classes, does not grant certifications or diplomas, and is not accredited by any recognized body.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
