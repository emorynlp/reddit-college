  "text": "Does test optional hurt your chances? I have a low gpa due to circumstances but because of the early college program i'm in I was really busy and couldn't take the sat or act. I'm guessing without a really good test scores my reach schools won't look at my application even bc of my 3.3 lmao. Is it possible to take the sat and submit late?",

If you have a reason for a low GPA you should mention that, maybe make it the topic of your essay if you think it is that prominent.",

Tech is probably a high target if you go optional with a 3.3, with a good essay and EC\u2019s you definitely have a realistic shot.\n\nJust doing 2 minutes of research on Niche scattergrams (not the most reliable source ever but oh well) it looks like the average 3.3 acceptance had like a 1400 SAT so going entirely test optional is gonna make it tougher but I understand that the only way to have a real shot with Tulane is to apply early so I\u2019d go for it still. As long as you aren\u2019t going for direct admission into an impacted program where they have minimum gpa requirements you have a chance",
