  "text": "After writing all my essays and finally being happy with my application status, parents tell me none of my financial aid will be submitted by the deadline (they have a financial aid scheme where they want to pay off everything like cars and houses so we get more aid) and are making me to submit everything regular decision. I've really just been crying the entire night and idk what else to do. My dream college Wellesley I have been planning on applying ED for a year and now I have to apply RD and I feel like I have no chance at getting in now. Hahahahah life.",

      "text": "Please check the deadlines because the financial app might not have the same deadlines as your EA/ED app. Worst case scenario in *some* cases is that your financial aid award info would not be released with the ED decision but for need-blind schools, that financial aid app might not be due this soon.\n\nEdit: looks like Wellesley does want your supporting materials for financial aid within one week of the deadline. They do have ED II however. With that said, you may still be able to apply and then learn your financial aid answer later but make sure you look into it all first.",
