  "title:": "Graduating High School Early and Transferring to University",
  "text": "As of right now, I\u2019m considered a junior in high school and about the equivalent of a sophomore in college (through dual enrollment).  My dad and I came to the revelation at 2a last night that I either have all or just one/two credits left to graduate high school.  I also am set to obtain my A.A. Degree by the end of this year.  The college I am taking the courses at for my A.A. has a guaranteed transfer to a higher university (Direct Connect program).  The only issue from stopping me from graduating early is the high school I attend is top five in the state and has some extra requirements to stop students from graduating early, but if I did have all the credits to graduate (or take the one/two other credit courses online before the end of this school year) would it be beneficial to attempt an early graduation instead of stick around just because of a few credits?  I believe my school would just make me transfer to another high school to avoid me bypassing the extra requirements to graduate from their school.  By graduating early, I would have excelled three years ahead of my peers in terms of academics.  As background for my standing as of right now, my GPA is a 4.0 unweighted, 4.7 weighted, have always taken challenging courses (AP, dual enrollment, honors), am taking AP Capstone Seminar right now, Varsity Golf and have number of accolades (such as finishing twelfth overall in standings for state), involved in HOSA and other clubs such as NHS, etc.  I plan to go biochemistry major, minor in psychology, along with premed track.  Would graduating early from high school and doing the transfer to university be a wise decision given the above?",
