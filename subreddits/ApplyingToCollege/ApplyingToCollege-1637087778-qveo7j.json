      "text": "This may be a consideration: you can no-longer double major across schools at Cornell. So if there\u2019s something you want to double with biology, be sure it\u2019s offered in whichever school you apply to.  Related, if you think there\u2019s a chance you might change majors, it\u2019s somewhat easier to switch within schools than across schools.\n\nThere may also be some subtle differences in core/elective requirments between the two schools.\n\nPS - I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re out-of-state, right? Because you\u2018d obviously choose CALS in-state.",
