A lot of time  I thought I knew answers In class but lacked the confidence to speak up so going to office hours helped build confidence and a rapport with a teacher who otherwise would never hear me open my mouth.",

So I know that students have to most of the time CHOOSE to take my courses and have me as a teacher. So for me as an example, I recognize that even a student that hates the class can be a positive voice to other for taking the course in the future (I have actually had that regularly where students tell me they dislike the course but took 3 or 4 years of electives with me simply because they liked the way I was as a teacher/person). Part of that is built on handling even situations like the one you mention with tact. But I will say - you are correct in your original statement. I will prioritize recommendations and even write unique ones for students that do little things or go above and beyond and like with anyone in life - having a positive relationship is tremendous. I as a teacher still communicate regularly with many students that have come through my classroom thanks to social media etc. and in turn I share that with students to do the same in college - I am great friends with many former professors due to how I treated and interacted with them in those courses as a student myself.",

But for a lot of us, it\u2019s a chance to be your cheerleader and tell a university or a scholarship committee the story beyond your GPA. The easiest letters to write are the ones for students who have done things to challenge themselves/made an impact/separated themselves from the herd. So for you 22\u2019s, turning your camera on is a good start, and going to office hours is a good idea as well, but if you have a teacher that you want a LoR from, think about joining the club they advise or asking about opportunities to apply what you\u2019re learning. For example, I teach APES, and I had a student last year tell me that they really liked the unit on water quality. So I got them started on a water quality assessment in their local creek. They were able to do this remotely, with a little guidance from me, and then enter the paper in a science fair competition for a scholarship opportunity as well as serve as the perfect story to write a LoR on. Yes it\u2019s a little more work do something like that vs just turn the camera on, but let the turning on of the camera be the first step, and then keep on trying to find ways to do more.",

For some teachers they look at the totality of a student to gauge how genuine they are or are not and can see the fake. (Which can and will end up with you getting no letter of rec or a canned one).",

Figure out early on in the course whether or not you like the professor and would want a letter from them and start building a relationship. \n\nSome professors will write a letter for anybody who gets an A, but if you want a strong one you need to know them.",

If that's the case, look for ways to make yourself known to your teacher.\n\nBe an asset to the class.  Show up, be there on time, participate when the teachers asks you to, be decent to your classmates.",
