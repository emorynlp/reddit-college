      "text": "1. Different colleges have different deadlines. Score reports generally take a couple weeks to go through, so at the very latest submit a couple weeks before the deadline.\n\n2. You could send your scores now, but it would cost a lot of money. See if you get into your ED school first.\n\nEdit: If you don\u2019t trust your counselor to get stuff in on time, it might not be the worst idea to ask about sending transcripts and LORs soon. Otherwise don\u2019t worry about it.",

      "text": "For SAT scores, check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - these can take a couple of weeks sometimes, so order soon for Nov 1 deadlines.\n\nYour high school probably has a process for ordering transcripts. Ideally they may want a couple of weeks' notice because they may have a number of students with the same deadlines. Order now for EA/ED.",
