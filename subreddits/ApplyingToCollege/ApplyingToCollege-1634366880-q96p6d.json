  "text": "As someone who wants to major in a STEM field, it's obviously super important for me to be on good terms with my STEM teachers. Yeah, nope. At my HS the STEM AP teachers are literally so irritated whenever I (or anyone for that matter) ask questions. Some people try really, *really* hard to pander to their teachers to get them to like them. Some people even ask for letters of rec (which I'm not gonna get from these teachers by a long shot). They just make the classes really hard and it's like they're mad at you for wasting their time whenever you ask a question. even though the content in these classes is very difficult and there'll be times when you inevitably need help. Plus some STEM teachers would make fun of you or try to belittle you even though they're teaching a class full of hardcore nerds who're probably the most academically motivated out of their graduating class (no I'm not saying humanities ppl can't be academically awesome but you get what I mean).\n\n**TLDR:** my stem teachers are rude and I can't rant with structure :)",
