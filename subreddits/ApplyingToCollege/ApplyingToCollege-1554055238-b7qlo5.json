  "text": "I see so many people here doing stuff like applying to only the absolute best schools and one safety (i.e. Oregon State) and then crying when they get rejected everywhere and have to go to \"a school I didn't even have to try to get into\"\n\nOr they shotgun to only Ivies with no safeties at all and start crying when they have to go to community college.\n\nI don't get it, there are so many schools between these options that are still very very good schools but apparently some people don't even bother. Is it because other schools don't offer financial support or something?",

To me, Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc are all too \"good\" to be safeties, so they're low matches (it would be fair to consider them safeties though). For some reason, when I think of safeties I think of auto admit schools and non-flagship state schools. Michigan, UNC Chapel Hill, NYU, etc are all too selective to be regular matches, so they're high matches. They aren't reaches, because the chances are still decent of getting in. There's also a good chance of getting rejected by all of them though, like many people here have. To me, a match should be like a 50/50 shot of getting in, a safety 100% chance, and a reach less than 30%. I'm just rambling at this point lol\n\nIt's all semantics really. We are trying to put thousands of colleges in three separate large categories, when ideally it would be broken down into smaller sub categories as well (I could consider Wisconsin and Michigan as being matches, but really they're on different levels of selectivity) ",

I live in the area and what I will say is that Davidson is infinitely smaller than UNC. If you want the big college life with a big campus and a strong area to support it UNC is your choice, but if you want something smaller and more homey Davidson is nice and the surrounding area is full of very nice small shops and the Lake Norman area is pretty nice. Just my two cents. ",

My number one choice was Michigan, and despite having slightly below average Sats (which I expected due to the fact I only wrote them twice and did only 4 months of studying), my GPA was up to tier and so were my predicted grades from A level (which are A,A,B). In addition to this I was confident with my essays and got great teacher references and also included a bunch of sports and other activities I do outside of school. Another thing I thought would play to my advantage was, that I was also offering to pay school fees without financial support as a International student. What ended up happening was that I ended being rejected from Michigan and Berkeley and ended up on the waitlist for Irvine. Not only am I super disappointed but also angry, due to the fact that I find it hard to see consistency with who they accept. For example Michigan accepted somebody with a GPA as low as 2.0 and Sats as low as 800 points (and I highly doubt it\u2019s just athletes) however rejected somebody with 1600 Sats and a 4.0 GPA. As a result I am super nervous and am looking for other great schools to apply to with late admissions. I am already applying to Michigan state and Purdue, however I would really appreciate some other options if you would happen to know them.\nThanks",

                      "text": "Firstly, sorry for replying so late. When it comes to the major, I incline more towards social sciences since I applied at Michigan for the College of Literature, Arts, and Sciences. The specific major was sociology, however I am more than happy to pick a major, that catches my eye, and can benefit me in the future. I checked out the colleges and the Link you sent me and I definitely see some colleges I am  interested in. In college I look mainly at the courses and school activists they offer, however the location, campus, and the people are a big plus. However when it comes to colleges, both my parents attended \u2018prestigious\u2019 universities if you will, and expect the same from me, and believe that education is the underlying foundation for a successful future (hence them offering to invest so much). As a result my parents especially my mum expect for me to graduate at a top college. Therefore if I attended a college such as Michigan state or even Penn State, could I later transfer to for example the University of Michigan or Berkeley?",

You\u2019d have to look at the transfer rates for Michigan and Berkeley. \n\nPrestige does have its value, but most of the colleges I listed have around the same level of prestige. None are as prestigious as Berkeley or anything, but they are well known flagship state schools. They all receive a lot of funding from their respective states. They all offer a lot of opportunities. Some would offer better opportunities in some things than others, but overall they are all around the same level. I\u2019d try to find one that has the best opportunities for what you\u2019re interested in studying. Also make sure that you like the campus, and other additional non-academic details. ",

If you wouldn\u2019t mind me asking however, there are three more questions; regarding Michigan state would it be difficult to transfer between it and the University of Michigan, as I heard it\u2019s difficult to transfer with in states (due to the fact that Michigan is my number one college due to course, location, and ranking). I would also like to know if I should continue to write my Sats even though I would get accepted to one of the colleges you mentioned, in order to reach the average for the other colleges such as Berkeley if I decided to transfer. And the finally question is if you wouldn\u2019t happen to know any other available colleges in the California region apart from UCI which postponed its applications date, due to the fact that many colleges  are not available via common apps, and you seem to know your stuff, so just in case (for example occidental?) I would also like to say a massive thank you due to the fact that when I received my Berkeley rejection and UCI waitlist list/appeal, I was still hopeful, however when I received my Michigan rejection just 2 days ago I was absolutely destroyed ( as cliche as it sounds it was my dream for ever since I knew I wanted to apply to the US to go study there) and you through some quick suggestions helped me gain some new hope (once again sorry for the cliche) so for that I cannot say thank you enough.",

What I did was that every time I heard someone mention a school I hadn't heard of, I'd put it in my giant university spreadsheet. My spreadsheet had columns about selectivity (acceptance rate and avg SAT score) as well as things like whether they offered my major, location, general atmosphere, campus size, and number of undergraduates. Basically I had an idea of things that I wanted in a school (like lots of academic freedom, smaller campus size, and medium-sized student body), and I'd move the schools I liked to the top of my list.\n\nA match school for me was any school with an acceptance rate greater around 15-20%, where my SAT score was a bit higher than average for admitted students. Ofc this depends on your stats. I tried as hard as possible to find match schools that I fell in love with. For example, I *really* liked Tufts, and I'm still kind of sad that I won't be going there next fall. (That's a higher match, but still I think my point stands.)",

Their business/Econ programs are good, but not $50k+ per year with a twin in college as well good. I\u2019ve also looked at Penn State, Villanova, and some LACs in the 40% acceptance rate range but the costs are iffy and I\u2019d need to be lucky with a merit scholarship or financial aid. Believe me, I would love to apply to BU, UNC, UVA, Kenyon, Oberlin, or Villanova, but unless they change their financial aid and merit policies, I think I would be wasting money and time on an application that may take up the spot of someone else if I\u2019m accepted but can\u2019t afford it or if I can but it financially doesn\u2019t make sense.\nHope this gives some insight into my thought process. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m a midwest White male with a twin brother. I\u2019m a sophomore and we are starting to visit schools and research costs/programs. Most likely going to shotgun 10-15 reaches and have 1-2 safeties.

Most schools publish a middle range of stats for their accepted students, with the 25th percentile being the low end and the 75th percentile being the high end. If you're within that middle range, it'll likely be a match. It's always best to look at stats for specific majors, but it's a good rule of thumb. Safety schools are schools you'll get into 100% and reaches are schools you'll almost definitely get rejected from. Matches are schools that are definitely not a sure thing, but if you apply to enough (I would say 3-5) you'll probably get into at least one. \n\n",

The deadlines for applying through WUE are sometimes different then their main admissions deadline so theres still an oppurtunity to apply. \n\nFor example, I managed to get into one of my reaches and my safety. I cant go to my reach due to cost and im not as in love with my safety. So now, I just applied to Oregon Institute of Tech, and assuming I get in its only roughly $13k for tuition. ",

These are also the people who basically have no concept of how difficult it is to get into college, let alone with an impacted major.  And then these same people are the ones either crying or giving me dirty looks because I got into UCLA while they went 0 for 8 on the Ivies and only got into mid or bottom tier-UCs.\n\nAnd while this may not apply to everyone on this subreddit, I also cannot express how valuable it is to have the Cal State AND UC  system as a California resident.  Sure the Cal States get a bad rep from the people who are obsessed with US News Rankings and such but people need to look past these factors and take into account other factors.  Such as the fact that Fullerton's Business Honors Program has an astoundingly high placement rate into the Big Four firms.  Or that San Jose State's proximity makes it prime pickings for companies in the Silicon Valley. Etc, etc.\n\nObviously, some people at my school also have parents who are out of touch with the process and tell their kids that it's Harvard or bust.  And that applying to state schools (including UCLA and Berkeley) ought to be a last resort or safety.\n\nTLDR: clout isn't everything, take advantage of your in-state public schools, actually do research on your safeties, T20 fever is a disease",

They meet 100% of need like most top schools but they also give out merit scholarships so it isn't expensive. Because of this they are one of the most socioeconomically diverse elite schools.\n\nAlso, despite being a LAC they also are very strong in STEM fields. They're also really good a Poli Sci. They are really highly ranked but because of their location, they are less selective then other schools of their tier. They have a campus culture similar to Brown and aren't cutthroat or uber-preppy like lots of other top LACs. They have the 2nd best undergraduate teaching in the country (and having visited I can tell you that they deserve that ranking). All for half the price of a typical T20. Highly recommend applying.",

Just because a school is the most difficult one you could get into doesn't mean it would be the best experience or even lead to the best opportunities. Failing to ditch this mentality early could lead you to a lifetime of chasing the most prestige and clout without any better motivation for your choices.",

Community isn\u2019t a bad choice, but it could leave you lacking in opportunity. People need to recognize that there are schools that provide opportunity in different ways than an Ivy, and although getting into an Ivy is an incredible accomplishment, you don\u2019t have to get to it now. I got into all of my 7 safeties (3 of them out of state) and 2 of my matches, one in and one out of state. This is great, but I applied to a total of 38 schools, and although my stats weren\u2019t the best, they were decent enough and if you would like my stats and what schools I applied and got into I\u2019ll leave it in a comment. The kind of education that I want is geared towards multiple degrees, so me not getting into a top tier school isn\u2019t the end all for me, but if it is for you, you need to consider your future options. If you want to work for transfer, that can get you there fastest but it\u2019s difficult. If you want to try to succeed immensely in college and go for a second degree through scholarship or attend college and find a plan for your future, that\u2019s also possible, but recognize that you are learning wherever you go. You will be ok. Work hard until the end and it will pay off. This season has been rough for so many, and with forums like this we all can connect and recognize how shitty this can make us feel, but hard work is needed for much longer than just high school, so enjoy as much as you can in each situation you are in now, and prepare for the great years of work to come!",

The schools you all mentioned are good and I will definitely consider applying and will check the Link. My biggest regret is the fact that I unfortunately started my college prep a little to late and therefore missed the opportunity to apply to colleges such as occidental (which I would have liked), as I was to focused on the top 1% of colleges, which was to ambitions and unrealistic, with the time bracket I was given. However another problem being is my mom, who don\u2019t get me wrong is loving and caring, however believes that education is the most underlying factor to a bright future (hence her being offering to invest all the money into my school) and only wants me to apply to the best schools. Therefore, let\u2019s say I would apply to some colleges such as Michigan state, could I for example after 2 years transition to Berkeley or Michigan?",
