  "text": "Just wondering cuz I know if you overreport you score you will get rescinded. So if your sat is at a 1570 and you say you have a 1550 and colleges accept you will you get rescinded for lying. Before you ask why anyone would do that, idk who ever will, I\u2019m just curious as to what will happen.",
