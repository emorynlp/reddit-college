  "text": "Honestly, title. But it is so frustrating at times because I see all of my friends with parents that read their college essays, know their way around the process, and everything in between. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t even be ungrateful because without my parents I wouldn\u2019t even be here right now writing out my college apps in America, and I have the audacity to complain about helping them. It can just get super overwhelming sometimes. I have a CollegePoint advisor, read millions of articles, read up on how to help your \u2018kid\u2019 through the process, and am fortunate enough to have been admitted to a top high school with more resources than I even knew existed. But it is still horrifyingly difficult and it just makes me upset. How have y\u2019all dealt with it?",

      "text": "My parents speak English well but they know absolutely nothing about the college process. I'm also the first child so everything is new for everyone. I've just been watching lots of videos and reading many articles. My school counselors also have lots of resources which I try to use. It still does get really overwhelming. Like I can't really talk to them about the college process bc they don't really understand it. Im still very grateful for them :) but it does get stressful at times",
