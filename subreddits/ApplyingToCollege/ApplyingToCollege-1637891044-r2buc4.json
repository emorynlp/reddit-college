  "text": "so this is a bit of an odd post as i\u2019m not actually asking for myself, but rather a friend. let me explain:\n\nso i have a group of online friends (same state, jus different city) and we\u2019re all about to go off to college after this school year. we have one friend in the group, however, that lives actually a few states over. while i haven\u2019t been planning to group up with any of them after i get out of highschool, a few of them are, including the out of state friend. they don\u2019t intend on going to any crazy prestigious school, it\u2019s just some cheap state school\u2014 that is if you\u2019re on in state tuition. this is kind of where my issue sets in.\n\nIs going to an out of state college worth it, given the cost? as much as i want my friends to be happy, i can\u2019t help but feel like i should intervene. the cost goes from like 14K (in state) to 40K (out of state) a year. is that really worth it? how hard would that be to pay off? \nany feedback/experience would be greatly appreciated. :)",

Full ride is the same price in or out of state, & that can be 10 different scholarships put together, not necessarily 1 giant prize. It's hard to gauge what scholarships you'll win though, so tough call unless you know you're the shit.\n\nAlthough side note, I'd never choose a college based on where my friends were going. Make sure it makes financial sense for you & you like their program.\n\nSo I'd make sure the friend really actually considers what's what & isn't joking or fantasizing.",
