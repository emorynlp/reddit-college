  "text": "So I started college back in 2012 until 2016 but back then I didn\u2019t care for school, I was depressed and in a bad place. I basically did the bare minimum and would get F, D and C\u2019s. I eventually just gave up and stopped going, I started working part time jobs instead. Last I remembered I was in academic probation with a gpa 1.5 I wanna say. I tired again going back in 2018 but again I failed. During the pandemic and quarantine I started realizing that working part times and barely making ends meet that this life wasn\u2019t worth it, I wanted something better for myself and a better future. I told myself to go back to school this fall semester and do something with my life but I was still were I left off. Unable to focus and think. I started realizing something was wrong with me but I didn\u2019t seek out help until well last month. I started talking with a psychiatrist and a therapist we came to the conclusion that I have ADD (which would explain so f-ing much) and now that I\u2019m on medication motivation, focusing, thinking is so much easier for me. I regret not doing this sooner. But with my past, my grades, I\u2019ve been to 2 community college, but honestly both community colleges I went to I failed and was in academic probation. This semester I\u2019m going to fail, I tried talking to all my professors and the situation I\u2019m in but they said it\u2019s to late to catch up and that the highest I can get is a D\u2019s or fail. I feel like I keep screwing my life up and chances. I just don\u2019t know what to do now. I just feel lost. I\u2019m honestly trying to fix my life but I don\u2019t know what to do with school.",

      "text": "Keep your head up. The way I approach these kind of things is by realizing that if I\u2019m not doing well in something, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m incapable, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not working hard enough. Everyone can do anything, but some people just have to work harder than others and in your case maybe you just need to work even harder than you were before. Are you doing all your homework and time and fully understanding it? Are you going to lectures and attending office hours if you have any questions? Are you actively engaged in your work and have motivation to do well. It\u2019s not easy, but you will end up needing to sacrifice free time, fun and even sleep to succeed - it just comes with the territory. But all that being said, it really isn\u2019t worth all the stress and tension on your mental health. You need to take a step back and be proud of what you\u2019ve already accomplished and keep moving forward. You\u2019ve got this and trust me, you\u2019re not alone in your struggles! \n\nAnother thing is that school really isn\u2019t for everyone. If you have anything that you really love doing as a hobby or side interest, maybe take that up and try to monetize it while also working a job, anything\u2019s possible. But my dad always tells me that nothing that\u2019s worth it in life ever comes easy, and this couldn\u2019t be more true. You will encounter tough times but you just gotta keep moving forward.",
