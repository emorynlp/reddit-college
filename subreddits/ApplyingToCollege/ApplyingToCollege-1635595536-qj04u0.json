  "text": "I sent my toefl score report and sat score report to my ED/ EA colleges: Carnegie Mellon (ED), Umich(EA), GATech(EA), MIT (EA). Both of them will be received in 8-10 days. Is it ok if scores reach within a week after the deadline especially for schools like UMich. FYI I\u2019m self reporting the sat for all the EA colleges except CMU it\u2019s just the toefl report that I\u2019m concerned about.",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster.\n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. CMU requires an official report.\n\nIn the past, U Mich may be one of the few schools that was strict about the deadline. But, at least for SAT, U Mich accepts self-reported SAT scores this year. MIT and Ga Tech also accept self-reported SAT scores. Go ahead and self-report by the deadline.\n\nI see your addition at the end about TOEFL: GaTech doesn't require TOEFL. MIT accepts TOEFL self-reported. Most (like CMU) won't care that they are a few days late, though possibly U Mich could. U Mich does not seem to indicate whether they accept TOEFL self-reported - if they do, perhaps there is a place in the portal.",
