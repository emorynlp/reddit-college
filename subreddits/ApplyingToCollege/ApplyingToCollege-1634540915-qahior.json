  "text": "Would it be bad if I didn't talk about the core curriculum here?? I've looked at a fair amount of examples online, and a lot of them talk about the CC.\n\nI wrote about a specific double-major concentration that only Columbia has, which I really want to study in the future, and a professor whose research I am interested in that particular department....but absolutely no mention about core lol I literally could not fit it in\n\nDo I look bad for not talking about it because it is one of the most defining traits of Columbia??",

      "text": "A LOT of people talk about the Core, and most of them just vaguely mention it. The best way for an AO to tell if you're showing genuine interest is if you specifically mention a professor, class, or program you're looking forward to, beyond just vaguely praising the Core. So, no, you're good.",
