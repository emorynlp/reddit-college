  "text": "Sorry, this requires a bit of backstory in order to get the full picture!! \n\nLast year, my school did classes a lot differently than it normally would for online school. While we normally have a block day schedule, we instead had alternating quarters. This meant we had 4 of our classes everyday for an entire quarter, then switched to only taking the other 4 classes the next quarter. Unfortunately, this meant that people taking AP classes during in quarters 2 and 4 had less time to be taught the material, since Quarter 4 was cut off early by the AP Exam.\n\nThis is what happened in my AP Comp Sci class last year. We ended up having to rush through material about twice as fast as the people who took the class in Q1/Q3, which resulted in me getting a lower grade than I wanted in the class for Q4. Our teacher didnt really teach anything after the exam, so our final grades were basically locked in more than a month before school was over. Is this something I should emphasize in the additinal info section on my apps or should I just let it go?",
