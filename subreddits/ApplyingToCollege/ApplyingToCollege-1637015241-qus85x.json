  "text": "Hello! I'm sure this question has been asked 1239012930 times, but I wasn't able to find a post for my specific circumstances.\n\nMy interviewer is a current senior at the university I applied to. I was going to refer to him as Mr. lastname, but he prefaces his interview request by saying \"My name is firstname\"  \n\n\nShould I stick to the formal approach (Mr. lastname), or should I use his first name?",

Even if he wrote, \"My name is firstname lastname,\" no college student would expect to be addressed formally.",
