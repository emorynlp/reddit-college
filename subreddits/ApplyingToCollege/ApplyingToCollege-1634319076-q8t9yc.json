      "text": "Most school counselors have their own school profile they submit that we as applicants don\u2019t have to worry about. If you feel that the counselors don\u2019t know and such, you can find the school profile form on the CommonApp. If you go to a college, then go to Ferpa and Recommenders, you should see a hyperlink to school profile. Hope this helps.",
