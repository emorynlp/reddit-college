  "text": "So I haven't done well in my recent SAT and I don't really have a choice but to apply to colleges that have a November deadline.\n\nBut I'm thinking about retaking it and applying my December scores to colleges that have a January deadline. Is it true that colleges award scholarships to those who apply first and the one's that apply later don't get awarded scholarships because they applied a little late?\n\nI personally don't think this is true but my parents that didn't even go to college keep yapping about how I ruined my  future and all.",

      "text": "Many colleges have a priority date you have to apply by in order to be considered for the full suite of scholarships they offer.  Many also have a date by which you must submit your FAFSA/CSS in order to be considered for financial aid.  It's to your benefit to meet both those dates.  It's unlikely that applying earlier than those deadlines confers any advantage.",

      "text": "Check each college's scholarship webpages and deadlines.\n\nColleges do sometimes run out of scholarship money earlier rather than later. So, your parents are correct that applying early can be better if you are hoping for merit scholarship money. But, you are also correct that a higher test score can be beneficial.\n\n(Need-based financial aid is a different animal from merit scholarships.)",
