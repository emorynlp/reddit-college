  "text": "The prompt for the Georgia Tech supp is: Why do you want to study your chosen major specifically at Georgia Tech? I treated this as a Why School essay and didn\u2019t mention anything specifically about my major. Is this okay or should I talk about my major. I\u2019m not really too certain about my major so idk how good that would be.",
