      "text": "I initially misread the question. If you\u2019re considering medicine, major does not matter. The pre-med core does: Gen Chem, orgo, bio, biochem, calculus and physics is the bulk of it. You may want to major in biology or chemistry or you may do something completely different like history. \n\nSome people like the overlap bio, Chem and biochem provide. Some people only want to take what is required for med school admission because they\u2019ll see plenty of science in med school. It\u2019s your last chance to study something else and mixing it up rather than taking more science courses isn\u2019t s bad thing. \n\nNursing is a completely different animal. Different courses and clinical requirements. Outside of physician shadowing and bench research, which are only strongly recommended to help make your case for med school admissions, there\u2019s nothing really \u201cpractical\u201d in a pre-med core. Lab units in the sciences is the closest thing.",
