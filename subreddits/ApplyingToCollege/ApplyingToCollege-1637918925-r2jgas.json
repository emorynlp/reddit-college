  "text": "I graduated from an American high school in 2021, but was initially class of 2022. Cuz I graduated at 16, I took a gap year in India, but the Indian college counselors are extremely incompetent and it's been 7 months now and they still have not provided me with any kind of information and now I am freaking out, and just to be extra double, triple sure I want to apply to Finnish and Norwegian colleges as well but my counsellor is obviously not going to provide me with any info. So can someone please drop a bunch of top unis for economics and finance in Finland and Norway, along with any kind of other application information I might want to know.",
