  "text": "so recently i found out that i have inattentive adhd (undiagnosed-going to a doctor to get diagnosed next month) and this screwed my gpa over, so much to the point where i have an 85/100 gpa (i think this translates to a 3.1?) but a 1520 sat. My extracurriculars are average, wouldve benefitted from a couple more substantial activities.  1) am i screwed for schools like pitt, rutgers, temple 2) should i mention it on my college apps as an explanation for the gpa? idk if thats the best idea since they may question if i really can handle college curriculum, whether i know my issues or not.",

      "text": "Your SAT score is really good. I don\u2019t think you should have any issues getting into a school with a 50% acceptance rate. Also if you\u2019re reaching for a certain school and don\u2019t want to compromise with a different one if you aren\u2019t accepted, many schools accept transfers from certain community colleges. I went to community college and then transferred to University of Florida after getting my AA. I saved like $30,000 on my education and I\u2019m still graduating from a university ranked #28 nationally.",
