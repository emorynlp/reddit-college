  "text": "Sorry for the rant, but it seems like very unoriginal posts, such as asking for top 3 colleges that people have applied to, are getting a lot of attention. I recently uploaded a post about summarizing the Common App essay in one sentence, and even though I am grateful for a lot of comments, I only got around 10 upvotes. I am just wondering certain posts are prioritized by the community?",
