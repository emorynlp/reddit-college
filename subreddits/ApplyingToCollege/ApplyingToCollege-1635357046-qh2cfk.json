  "text": "I got sick junior year, had brain surgery and a stroke so my grades dropped drastically from A\u2019s to C\u2019s and D\u2019s. My GPA went from a 3.5 to a 2.9. \nSorry if this is a dumb question but I talked to my counselor today and she made it seem like I wouldn\u2019t get into college at all and now I feel horrible. \n\nI\u2019ve done a few applications, all except one require a GPA of 3.0 so I\u2019m panicking. Granted I do have til the end of the school year to bring it up but I feel it won\u2019t be good enough.",

      "text": "Please don't panic, and don't listen to your counselor, either. You can still get into college with a 2.9. It will depend on other factors that strengthen the rest of your app, but I think having a stroke and brain surgery is a pretty reasonable story.\n\nOnce you're in, you just need to maintain the college's minimum GPA required to stay in. Once you graduate, nobody really cares what your college GPA was unless you're applying to grad school.",
