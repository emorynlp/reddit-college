  "title:": "Very niche question about applying as a trans student",
  "text": "  Hi. \n\nI\u2019m a fully out trans student in his junior year of high school and use my chosen name only. I will have all my school transcripts, letters of recommendation and even SATs under that name. I have an official, school-issued ID under that name. However, this is still not my legal name, as in my country you can\u2019t change your name before you turn eighteen. I will change it immediately after I turn eighteen, which will be in August 2023 (after I have graduated from high school). Would it be possible for me to apply to universities under that name? I really don\u2019t want to apply under my legal name, as I don\u2019t look like that at all and every time I\u2019ve had to use it, it has caused me many problems with the police etc. Besides, having everything under my actual name and then applying under a different one might cause some confusion. So, what do you think? Thanks in advance for replying or even just reading.",
