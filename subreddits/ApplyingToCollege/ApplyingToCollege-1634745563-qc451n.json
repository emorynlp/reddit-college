  "text": "So my GPA isn\u2019t the best (85 UW 89.44 W on 100 pt scale) mainly because I did really bad Freshman year (78 UW) and Junior year was COVID year so I didn\u2019t do as good as I could\u2019ve. Anyways, I will probably get deferred if not rejected in my EA apps, but if colleges defer me will they care about Senior year grades at all? I\u2019m asking because I plan on majoring in Engineering and my estimate for what grade i\u2019ll end up in for AP Calc AB is 60+, barely passing or under passing. Should I just drop down to CP calc and get a better grade or would staying be better? Or should I stay until EA apps then drop?",

They will see your first semester grades.\n\n>Should I just drop down to CP calc and get a better grade or would staying be better\n\nGetting a higher grade in AP Calc is obviously the better move. There are plenty of online resources, including Khan Academy to guide you. If you continue to struggle in calc, you might want to reassess your choice of a math-driven engineering major.\n\nThat said, failing a class is never preferable to dropping down a level.",
