  "text": "My MIT interviewer is from the same high school as me, and has played the same sport I have for the past 4 years. Is it too weird if I bring this up? I\u2019m not even sure if I would get the chance to, I\u2019ve been told they\u2019re a little\u2026 introverted and they try to end the interviews quickly after asking questions. What do I even do to make the best out of this situation? I have about a week to prepare.\n\nAnything helps, thanks everyone!",

In the same way that we ask interviewers not to look up Penn applicants online, we ask that you refrain from researching your interviewer using internet searches or connecting with them through social media.
