  "text": "Hello, I recently submitted my UNC chapel hill and Fasfa around the same time. Let me ask about Fasfa first, can I change or add schools to my fasfa even if I already submitted it/waiting for processing, and will affect my financial aid in anyway? \n\nAnd for my essay, I submitted it then I see some mistakes after looking at it over and iver for 2 hours straight. How bad will that affect me? Basically have no ec beside one club for sophomore year and just started a part time.\nand grades 4.25 but not act or sat.",

      "text": "Once the FAFSA is processed, you can delete schools, add new ones, and release it again, to get it to more than10 schools.\n\nWait the 3-5 days until,it shows as processed.\n\nPresumably, the data wouldn\u2019t change, but I\u2019d delete all of the original schools,so,it\u2019s not sent again, just to avoid confusion (though I\u2019m sure schools are very used to that happening).",
