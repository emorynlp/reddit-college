  "text": "I submitted four applications in the early round and all the other colleges had the testing section filled out properly on the pdf. For whatever reason, my Penn application said there were no tests to submit. But on the Penn portal they have it seems that they have my sat, but idk if they also have my ap scores. How do I check, and what should I do if they don't. Also, how big of a deal is it that the upenn pdf doesn't have my testing?",

However, for students who are submitting test scores, we will still receive the test scores as part of the data that we import from Common Application, and students will be able to view the test scores that we have on file for them through their Penn Applicant Portal.\"",
