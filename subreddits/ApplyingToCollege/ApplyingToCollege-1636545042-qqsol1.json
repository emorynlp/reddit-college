  "text": "As a university student, I think studying Systems Theory/Systems Thinking (ST) and pursuing an accredited degree in ST offered by a university would be fulfilling. Does a degree in ST exist? If so, which institution(s) offers such a program?\n\nAdditionally, I am compiling a list of sources that explore ST. Any recommendations on where I can direct my studies are most welcome and appreciated.\n\nThank you.",
