  "text": "so i just submitted my application and it was supposed to be due today for engineering early action ( although the deadline was only on the college website i didn\u2019t see it anywhere on applytexas). But i\u2019m kinda new to this and wanted to know if it still counts into early action because the school won\u2019t receive it for a few days and i haven\u2019t gotten the portal to report my transcript but i have submitted the application so idk how that works. Does anyone know?",
