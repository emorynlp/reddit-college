  "text": "Hi!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't know I had to send dual enrollment transcripts to some of my early schools, and just sent it after the deadline (Michigan). Will I be taken out of the early pool if I submitted all of my other materials? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, my dual enrollment courses are already listed on my high school transcript.",

UM REALLY REALLY isn't a fan of breaking any of their rules in the slightest.\n\nHowever, it's possible that it won't hurt at all if they receive the transcript pretty soon and don't bother asking when it was requested (but the postmark requirement is kinda rough).",

Totally not the end of the world, but just to be clear, if you bug them too much, it is likely to hurt your chances. That's why I'd recommend just leaving it. Hope that helps, and good luck out there!",
