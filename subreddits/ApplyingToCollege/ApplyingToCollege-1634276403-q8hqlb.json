  "title:": "A different approach to a MIT essay",
  "text": "I will be applying to MIT under the early action program this year. One of the essay prompts is  \n\n## Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations?\n\nNormally, a student would talk about how their community has inspired them and motivated them..the usual fluff. When i first wrote the essay, I had placed emphasis on the negative aspects of my communities' expectations and how those negative expectations led to my decisions with college.\n\nMy question is, do colleges expect this kind of essay to be positive and full of the usual fluff, or including a negative perspective to the community be unique?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny and all help is appreciated. Thanks in advance",

      "text": "Negative points should come across as societal critiques rather than your whims solely, you know what I mean? I think you can focus on character growth and how this taught you a lot, just in a very non-cliche manner. Or even how this motivates you to \"change the world\" or whatnot.",
