  "title:": "is it necessary to apply EA to Penn State?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m a bit procrastinator and my grades haven\u2019t been stellar (except for last year) and I only got a 1020 on my SAT. People say Penn State accepts most people EA but I\u2019m not finished and I don\u2019t really feel like doing it because today is my birthday hahah. Anyway, Penn State is the only school I\u2019m applying EA to so I\u2019m not very worried but at the same time I\u2019m scared that it means I won\u2019t get accepted now? I also emailed them and they say that they don\u2019t look at senior year. I did amazing junior year but I\u2019m still left with a 2.8 due to a horrible freshmen and sophomore year.\n\nHas anyone gotten accepted to Penn State UP with less than a 3.5? Thanks!",

      "text": "I got accepted with a 3.4 cus of how bad I screwed up the last yr with covid but my sat is alright(1480). Penn State does accept more with early action since it's rolling but the thing is, it's still rolling so the earlier you apply the better. This is at least my understanding of it. I think you should retake the SAT but you definitely should email them and talk to someone.",
