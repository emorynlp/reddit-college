      "text": "Here\u2019s what you write about \u2014 what you think. What you care about. What you worry about. What you are excited by.  What scares you. What keeps you up at night? What you believe. \n\nThe personal essay isn\u2019t so much about what you do, but who you are and what you value.  \n\nspend some time focusing on you and what you believe, what you love, what you think, what you worry about, what you get excited by. Channel your inner Shrek and peel back those onion layers. Really dig in and get to know yourself. Become the expert on you and then prepare to teach that lesson in your essay. What is the essence of you-ness you want the readers to know about you? Practice just writing for fun and to get to know your voice. Go to www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com and answer these questions -- one or two a day:\nWhat do you believe?\nWhat do you think about when you wake up in the morning?\nWhat's important to you?\nWhat would you fight for?\nWhat's one thing that comforts you?\nWhat do you value?\nWho are your superheroes and why?\nWhat do you think about late at night?\nWhat's your secret sauce?\n\nIf you\u2019d like to go into more depth, I recently wrote this post about the personal essay with my step by step guide and links to some of my fave resources: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ppetbb/hi_seniors_you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nIt can feel frustrating and overwhelming, I know, but honestly, we got your back. You got this! Good luck!",

      "text": "I had the same issue for months - I\u2019m not a \u201chooked\u201d student, pretty average life, etc. You might be average as well (the opposite of what A2C has conflated the image of college applicants to be in our minds) but even so you\u2019re an individual with your own experiences and way of seeing the world. Writing about something you\u2019re passionate about has the potential to show readers who you are more than restating ECs. I ended up writing about my interest in nature, for example. As for what AOs thought of my approach, well, that\u2019ll take a few months.",
