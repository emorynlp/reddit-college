  "text": "Hey!\nSo I\u2019m a junior and new to this sub Reddit. After years of focusing on grades and extra curricular activities, I\u2019m starting to narrow down some college option. I am in state for UNC and Duke. Does anyone know if you have a better chance of getting into these schools if your in state? Mainly asking for Duke. Thanks for the help!",

      "text": "For UNC, there is absolutely a higher admit rate for in-state students and it's not close:\n\n>[UNC-Chapel Hill received 44,379 first-year applications for fall 2020. The overall acceptance rate was 24 percent \u2013 48 percent for North Carolina applicants and 14 percent for out-of-state applicants. To learn more, visit the profile of the 2021 entering class.](https://admissionslawsuit.unc.edu/about/admissions/)\n\nFor Duke, they don't release separate admit rates for in state vs OOS because they are a private school.  We can see that just 14% of their incoming class is in-state, so they are definitely not putting the same emphasis on NC students that UNC does.  It may be marginally easier to get into Duke as a NC resident because they want to cultivate relationships in state, they know the high schools there better, and they know they will get slightly higher yield from NC applicants.  But it's not a major driver for them.  See this link for more data and details:  https://www.cappex.com/colleges/duke-university/admissions",

          "text": "Duke does give preference to applicants from the Carolinas (as per its charter) and has specific scholarships for those students (Trinity, Benjamin N. Duke).\n\nFurthermore, most private universities give *slight* preference to local/in-state students because most students do not go far from home. That improves their yield (which aids in planning) and also may have local political benefits.",
