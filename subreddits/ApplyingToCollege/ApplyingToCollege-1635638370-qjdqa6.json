  "text": "My personal essay takes a chronological order with 2-3 sentences per paragraph per event in the first half  and a mood change in the middle(moment of growth). My English teacher and school counselor say it\u2019s good and \u201cbeautiful\u201d but stem teacher and student say it\u2019s confusing and choppy. \n\nI know it\u2019s my style and it does tell my complicated life story very well in 650 words,but some part of me is doubtful because I\u2019m first gen and I don\u2019t have a guide to help me. \n\nI don\u2019t even know why I am posting on here asking for advice because I would be quite upset if I needed to change it. But idk if I should take the advice from the stem teacher or not. :,(((",

Often times when you get too many people input on your essay, you get stuck trying to please everyone who\u2019s reviewed it and then the integrity is gone. Don\u2019t doubt yourself, it\u2019s your style, it\u2019s good, english teacher loves it, it\u2019s good. That\u2019s all",
