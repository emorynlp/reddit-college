Im looking to apply to 4 medical schools.My only problem is that I\u2019m not 100% confident that I\u2019ll get accepted into any of them. Im thinking of applying to 2 colleges for engineering as a safe option in case I don\u2019t get accepted. Any advice on what I should do?\n\nP.s. I have around a 3.9 gpa and I\u2019ll be participating in a national scientific research competition.",
