  "text": "My school is a condensed 3 trimester 7 month school year. Each trimester class is .50 credits. I think on common app I maybe should have used semesters because of this? I\u2019m getting emails that it\u2019s incomplete. And if a school already downloaded it what do I do? Thanks for any input!",
