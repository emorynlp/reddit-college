  "text": "One thing that I absolutely love to do in my free time is to solve jigsaw puzzles. I have a huge collection with 30+ puzzles ranging from 500-1500 pieces and I solve at least one a week. Can this count as an EC because I\u2019m not sure if hobbies or therapeutic activities like this can be listed.\n\nYeah and I\u2019m also considering writing about my love for jigsaw puzzles and maybe connect it to the type of person I am",
