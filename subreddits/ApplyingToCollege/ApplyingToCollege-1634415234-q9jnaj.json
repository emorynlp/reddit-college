  "text": "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/09/confessions-of-a-prep-school-college-counselor/302281/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/09/confessions-of-a-prep-school-college-counselor/302281/)\n\nThis is an old but still relevant essay from a college counselor who worked at Harvard-Westlake, LA's feeder school which sent about a quarter of its students to Ivy League colleges and Stanford.\n\nIn case, you don't read the whole essay here are some of my favorite parts:\n\n> Each of the hot hundred colleges held a certain position in a vast and  inscrutable cosmology that only the students and their parents seemed  to understand. The very names of schools I had always considered  excellent made many students shudder\u2014Kenyon, for example. They would  snap briskly to attention if I said \"Williams\" or \"Amherst.\" So why not  Kenyon?  \n>  \n>On the other hand, schools that I had never considered  particularly dazzling turned out to be white-hot centers of the  universe. In vast, high-achieving droves, for example, these kids wanted  to go to Duke. Fine, but here's where I couldn't figure them out: they  were dying to go to Duke, but Chapel Hill left them cold. Why? They  couldn't put it into words exactly; it was as inexplicable and  irreducible as falling in love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> The second thing applicants ought to consider seriously is that it's a  great big PC world out there in Ivy-admissions land, and they can either  get hip or go to State. Rachel Toor seems to think that her progressive  social views\u2014which she showcases to a curious degree in the book\u2014put  her in the minority among admissions people at elite colleges, but this  was not my experience of these people as I came to know them during  school visits and conventions. In my experience her viewpoint is the  norm rather than the exception. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In evaluating students' extracurricular activities Toor is \"personally  most turned off by Junior Statesmen of America and by kids who started  investment clubs at their schools.\" Pity the poor kid stuck out there in  Louisville or Grand Rapids: he knows no better. Get a clue, kid! Dump  the Statesmen! Join the Gay/Straight Student Alliance. Enroll in a  women's-studies class\u2014I don't care if you have to take two buses to get  there. In fact, get to know the people on the bus and become incensed  about their oppression (but not so incensed that you liberate the  housekeeper while Mom's tied up in moot court).   \n>  \n> The goal here is to raise your consciousness enough to attract the  attention of an admissions officer at an elite college, but not so much  that you find the very idea of an elite college objectionable. It's a  fine line.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Today's applicant to the elite colleges enters a game in which the  opportunity for committing a faux pas is just as great as it was fifty  years ago, only now the faux pas is on the order of joining the Junior  Statesmen of America rather than of sporting ill-fitting khakis. The  Junior Statesmen strike an infelicitous note in the elite-college  admissions office in part because they are presumably not keenly  sensitized to the tyranny of the patriarchy, but even more so because  the very name is redolent of the kind of middle-middle-class earnestness  that the elite colleges have always shunned \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Do the most highly selective colleges really offer a better education  than less selective ones? This would be a much easier question to answer  if the University of Chicago weren't such an unfashionable place among  so many undergraduates. There it sits, with its dreamy Gothic  architecture of the precise type that kids nowadays go in for, its  bumper crop of Nobel laureates (the most in the nation), its hugely  impressive student-faculty ratio, its demonstrably extraordinary  programs and departments. But the kids don't really like it. Why? It's  too intellectual. What, then, do they mean by the term \"good education\"?  Good but not too good, I guess. It's the kind of education you can get  at certain places but not others\u2014at Georgetown but not at the University  of Washington; at Duke but not at Chapel Hill. It's the kind of  education you can get definitely at Stanford, less so at Berkeley, much  less so at Michigan, hardly at all at Wisconsin, and not at all at the  University of Illinois. That kind of thinking has always bewildered me.  Even though Rachel Toor has genuine respect for Duke, she finds herself  unable to provide a rational explanation for the school's current  enormous popularity with students eyeing elite colleges.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> The perception of what constitutes an \"elite\" school often has little to  do with academic excellence. After all, one important measure of a  university's quality is how many of its faculty members belong to the [National Academy](http://www.nationalacademies.org/)  of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of  Medicine. The ultra-selective Brown counts among its faculty sixteen who  are members. Duke, the object of many a prep school student's swoon,  has thirty-five. But the University of Washington has seventy-one,  Wisconsin sixty-four, Michigan fifty-eight, Texas fifty-four, and  Illinois fifty-three.",

Sometimes this is what it feels like to be an lower income international student watching wealthy peers getting their parents to funnel money into their social justice causes - impossible to establish without a certain level of income, soon to be abandoned after ED deadlines. What it feels like to see Instagram non-profit founders talk about women's rights and police brutality while their Iphone 12s are funded by corporate-sector parents.",

Duke is a private college.  UNC-Chapel Hill is a public college.  82% of UNC-Chapel Hill students are in-state.  This leads to two qualms for any prep-school kids applying there from out of state:\n\n1: The knowledge that your parents poured tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars into your education so you could go to a school that you probably could have loafed your way into from a North Carolina public school.\n\n2: The knowledge that UNC Chapel Hill is going to be packed to the brim with in-state brainlets.  They are going to degrade every class discussion, lower the standards of interaction, and just make every aspect of college life worse.\n\nI can barely fathom why anyone would apply to a state school from out of state, excluding the ones with extremely low in-state percentages like UMich.",
