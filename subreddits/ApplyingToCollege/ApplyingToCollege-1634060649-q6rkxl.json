  "text": "Will dropping all 12 units this fall semester but re-taking those same classes the following semester hurt my GPA?  Will retaking classes to get a better grade over-ride the grades you earned previously?  How will my GPA be affected if I had previously dropped the class?  Will it average out or keep the better and more resent grade on that same class?  Will dropping classes and having that on my record lower my chances of being accepted to a STATE OR UNIVERSITY even though I've made up for the grade ?",
