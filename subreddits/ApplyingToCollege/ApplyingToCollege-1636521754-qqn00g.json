  "text": "Hi, guys. This is my first post on Reddit and I literally just created an account after lurking on A2C for months. I never thought I'd be the type of person to post something like this, but there's no one in real life for me to spill this to (lol, getting deja vu from when I revealed to AOs stuff that not even my parents and friends know).\n\nHere goes nothing: I've worked my backside off for years, trying to catch up to my peers and hoping that something will come out of it. I'm now in the top 10% of my very competitive high school, but what happened today just kind of made me feel like I haven't accomplished anything. I entered a competition with several categories, and I felt pretty good about my application until I saw what other people had done. I'm pretty good at most things in general, but I'm not amazing in any one category. Worse, a video that was basically an overview of our application was shown to all the applicants and their parents. I don't really feel horrible for losing; everyone that won was super qualified and obviously deserved it. However, it makes me feel that all my hard work has gone unrecognized yet again. \n\nAs a first-generation student with very demanding parents, I have always done my best to earn the family academic prestige and pride. My parents, though probably well-meaning, have mostly been uninvolved in my studies (except when something bad happens, then they just get mad). I have also stayed ignorant of a lot of things like competitions, camps, prep courses, etc. that a lot of the other top kids have been doing since they were little. I only really learned about these things recently, and I have tried to become very involved. However, time was not on my side, as a lot of the other kids had already been doing them for years. It feels like whatever I do is not enough, and I am terrified that my EA colleges will pass me over just like the adjudicators of the competition. I'm not too sure what to think, and I just kind of want to let this out somewhere. If you've made it to the end, then thanks for listening and I hope you're doing better than I am :).",

I\u2019ve felt a lot better talking to my friends or exercising when I\u2019m super mad at my parents, maybe you can find some activity to release all the frustration that comes with not being understood.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a first-gen student as well! As much as your family cares about you, they likely don\u2019t have the similar experience with education to fully understand your path to college. And that\u2019s totally okay. You sound like an outstanding student who will be a strong candidate for admission and merit scholarships depending on which colleges you apply to. (I recommend everyone apply to at least some colleges which offer admission to 50%+ of their applicants.) \n\nBe sure to submit the FAFSA for financial aid purposes. Note that some private colleges also require the CSS Profile, too. \n\nGood luck with the college application process. You got this! \ud83d\udc4d",
