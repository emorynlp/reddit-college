  "text": "My whole life I've always been told to do my best, but where does it stop? You can always do more, you can always sacrifice your fucking life for a goal, but what's the price you end up paying?\n\nI threw everything valuable in life away by chasing the fucking first letter of the alphabet. I have no social skills. I have no hobbies. I am horribly neurotic. I'm irritable all the time. I have brain fog all the time. I've spent so much of my doing the shit that I \"should do\" that I've never pursued what I care about. When people ask me what I do for fun I make up some bullshit answer, because I don't do anything for fun. School is my life, and I can't slow down now or all this work would have been for nothing.\n\nMy dad is fucking 65 years old. I don't really have any meaningful interaction with him outside of the weekends, and even then I'm always pissed because of school. Was the SAT score worth it? Is the fucking number 4.0 worth it? How much time am I realistically going to have left with him?\n\nI'm probably going to apply ED to a T20 school, but part of me hopes that I just end up at my state school. I'm tired of this game, and will it ever end if I go to a T20?  I would get a whole lot more out of learning how to party and have a good time than i would to keep chasing this shit. I just want to be content in life with people I care about, but instead I sit around procrastinating all day because of how burned out and unfulfilled I am from this game, and it keeps me distracted from how far behind I've fallen in every part of my life.\n\nFuck this game. It's not worth it. I can't wait until second semester when I'll actually be able to embrace everything I've neglected in life for so long.",

Anyone with the work ethic to make a life in a career can do so in their own way.  We don't have to follow the \"elite school\" track that society sets up for us.",

Most states' Flagship schools have pretty good employment placement rates with high starting salaries. You don't need to go to a T20 to get a good education. Sure, if you get accepted somewhere better, then go for it, but some of the most successful people in their careers  went to state schools. Right now there's an excess of qualified professors, so quality education is in higher supply than one would think. \nTL;DR- I agree with your point, but going to a state school isn't \"wasting what you've accomplished\" necessarily. (Especially because private school is expensive as balls)",

      "text": "Hey, not sure if you\u2019re reading these, but I really hope you read this comment.\n\nThis post shows me something, it shows me that you\u2019re are willing to see that you are unhappy. Surprisingly, that\u2019s the hardest part. Hopefully you\u2019ll be looking back on this post in a few months and realizing this was the moment you made the change in your life that mattered.\n\nRegardless, now is the time for action. Do the things YOU want to do, and now. You might not realize it, but your unhappiness from your lifestyle so far may find its way onto your college essays and hurt your chances drastically. You need to deal with your feelings if you hope to better yourself.\n\nGo out there and meet some new people! I was in a similar spot as you at one point, but this basic first step is really what helped me the best. I found taking part in new extracurriculars can help too, fencing is a great option (biased lol). Your grades aren\u2019t going to change, but it they do a little it shouldn\u2019t matter, you\u2019rs having fun!\n\nIt sounds like you might have a one-sided relationship with your father. This sucks, and I really don\u2019t know what to say to help here. At least with toxic friends you can stop talking to them, but family is family always. If your dad is reasonable, you could try to directly talk to him about your feelings. In my opinion however, I would recommend hinting over direct. Maybe you could say casually that you want to start doing new extracurriculars to him, but be specific there. See how he feels about it, and if responds poorly, brush off the idea. This will let you guage how he will react to the rest of your feelings.\n\nOkay, well this is everything I\u2019ve got for now. Seriously though, message me if you want to talk further. I won\u2019t mind a bit, I love a distraction from school to help others :). I promise, you won\u2019t be a hassle or burden to me. \n\nAlright, goodluck on your endeavors, and thanks for reading!",

              "text": "I think you want to drop it, but are telling yourself otherwise. It is okay to relax a little senior year! Especially after putting in a lot of work in your past years. I\u2019m guessing you already took AP Calc BC, and that\u2019s already a hard class to take and do well in. Colleges will be more than happy with just BC. Sure, you might think it will help you even more to go above and beyond the colleges\u2019 expectations, but I\u2019m telling you, it really won\u2019t do much. You\u2019ll get the chance to take that class with more understanding in college if you really want to take it. You gotta remember that AP classes are just college class knockoffs.\n\nI strongely recommend going to your guidance conselor to attempt dropping. If you really cannot and are stuck in the class, you may just have to accept getting a lower grade than that of what you are comfortable with unless you are willing to put in a lot more work. Honestly though, one bad grade, even a C, should only drop your gpa by at most .15 (correct me if wrong). You will still be top 1% of your class, and most colleges consider gpas of that level equal. \n\nI\u2019m sure you are just worrying yourself a bit too much as well however, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll pull by alright. But if not, it\u2019s okay! By the sound of it, you\u2019ve done great, and you should be proud of yourself. I hope you have someone in your life to say this to you, but just in case you don\u2019t, I\u2019m proud of you!\n\nAlright, my phone\u2019s at 1%, so I\u2019ll leave it here. Goodluck on your endeavors! PM me if you need anything else!",

The worst part of trying to be the smartest kid around is that by the end of the trials, whether you're proven to be the smartest or not, you are extremely competent in your presumably unchosen field but extremely incompetent in everything else. Branch out and socialise, grow as an individual. That'll drive more in you than the A streak. You'll also probably get more creative, which is an important tool you can use, just like being smart.\n\nBeing smart doesn't define you, because heck there's plenty around.

I'll probably end up going to a school just about anyone can go to. Bc yeah i may be a good student, but I'm not a top 1%. Maybe I'm a top 2%, according to my act score. but top 2% isnt good enough to go to Harvard or Yale or Duke or Rice or wherever the fuck. So whats the point? Why did i do this to myself? My weighted gpa is a 3.9 as Im starting junior year. Yeah itll be a 4.1 by then end of this year but thats not gonna erase the Bs i got from being too stupid or too depressed to do well in some of my classes. Yeah a 4.1 will look okay but its not gonna get me anywhere special.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, i dont feel smart. I dont have skills. The only skill I have is making myself look smart-ish on paper (but not smart enough). Thats not gonna get me a successful career. I am useless. My brain is empty. I do my classes and forget all of the information. I dont have the ability to learn anything. I may look smart, but I am the dumbest person I know.\n\nI have spent these last couple months being consumed by the overwhelming fear of failure, now that I actually have to start thinking seriously about college. Ive spent hours looking at what school I can or can't get into. The scores I need, the gpa I need, the ECs I need. But why? Last year I was convinced Id kill myself by 30 because I knew id be failing life by then. I have been doing better and have been more hopeful, but Im falling back into my old mindset. \n\nIm currently writing this instead of doing my homework. I sat around all day feeling like shit. I flaked on my friends birthday party because I felt too depressed to leave my house. I dont even get enjoyment out of watching YouTube or TV because I have no attention span. I'm literally rotting away.\n\nWas is worth it?\n\nedit: oh dang thanks for silver lol i really don't deserve it bc this is just me being a whiny bitch ahaha but thanks <3",

After law school was when the hard work started....I had never worked so hard in my life as I did as a corporate lawyer.  So yeah, if you take the hard route, it doesn't get easier, but you might end up making more money.   In the end I realized that working your ass off in grueling hours for big money wasn't worth it and just ended up taking a normal, lower paying job. I don't regret going to good schools, but I do regret being so goal-oriented because it made me miss out on a lot of other things in my youth. If had a broader perspective, I might have taken more risks and done something more enjoyable in my youth.\n\nThe reality is, life is very short and then you die.  From a big picture perspective, unless you are at the extremes (a billionaire or homeless), your life will be more or less like most people's lives.  When you are a kid, you think everything is a big deal, but it's not.  Most people just end up with mediocre, middling lives and then they die. So I say you should go to a good school, but also keep perspective --- most things don't matter and unless you are at the extremes, your life will be more or less mediocre.  Accepting mediocrity is just a part of maturing as an adult.",

      "text": "Hey, I'm a college freshman still lurking on this sub, saw this post and wanted to offer some support. I understand your concerns, I was in a similar place last year. It can suck when everyone around you expects you to do well no matter what. Sometimes you just need to take a break. And honestly, I think a small break is what you need. What made my senior year so much better was just spacing out my time to hang out with friends and family more. Did some of my work or essays suffer? Sure. But it was nice to just strengthen those bonds.\n\nThat said, don't give up on this stuff. Those arbitrary letter grades may seem like pointless metrics you broke yourself over. But I think there's more to it than that. There's all the people you've been able to connect with over the struggles of classes, all the teachers you've gotten close to, and perhaps some subjects that you've become more interested in. Those classes and tests are unnecessarily stressful and anxiety-inducing yes, but they've also made you more worldly, able to connect with more people and perspectives. I encourage you to find those positive aspects of those moments, because that's probably the easiest start to reenergizing your support system.\n\nSo to end, I'd say, go talk to your dad and some friends. Try and set aside a time to hang out with them over the weekend and let yourself breathe. And try not to let this system discourage you from all achievement. There is still plenty you've got to offer for the world.",

But it's not too late to adjust your app strategy so you can a) enjoy your senior year/life and b) land somewhere where you can be happy. If that's your state school option that's fine! But it's more likely going to be a matter of fit and, indeed, expanding beyond T20 schools. \n\nI was also miserable with the rat race way back when, when it wasn't even half as bad as it is now, and I have no regrets jumping off the track and going my own way senior year and with college apps. I took the APs I wanted to take b/c I wanted to take them (including AP Art and Psych). I refused to apply to any schools that would attract psycho overachievers and make my four years of college miserable. I focused on schools that had a social culture I would enjoy, in places I wanted to live, that had great journalism programs (rather than looking at name brand schools that happened to also maybe have a journalism major). I LOVED college--I felt I could be creative and driven, but have fun. I developed massively as a person and got past all the \"gifted program\" bullshit and I'm a well-adjusted, successful (post quarter life crisis) adult. You'll be ok!\n\nSo think about what you DO like, and make adjustments where you can. Drop activities that are draining you, and try something new. Pull back on academics where you can (though I wouldn't bomb senior year) so you can engage in leisure activities. Marathon TV shows. Play video games. Whatever. \n\nThen look at a broader range of schools, focusing on things beyond academics that you think might bring you some joy. Clubs/ECs you might like to try (newspaper? crew? anime club?), a social scene you think might work for you so you can make friends and have some fun, a place you'd like to live for four years. And you know: maybe it is staying close to home so you can spend more time with your dad, if you want to? A location that makes it easy to come home for long weekends/every break. \n\nDon't think of any of the work as wasted, but as the groundwork you laid (and paid a price for) that will be the foundation of a better experience going forward. I actually found college way less stressful than high school, and if you concentrate on social fit, you'll find that the grind isn't endless/quite as bad (depending on school and major of course).",

      "text": "Hey, I think you just need to relax a bit with your effort. This doesn't mean to just stop trying and have your grades drop, but don't put so much effort in that it sacrifices your mental health. I was taking 2 AP this year, dropped 1 AP and replaced it with a daily study hall, and I just got accepted into a college yesterday. I was very concerned that could dick me over, but it didn't. If you have a 4.0 GPA, you're absolutely fine. You can get into plenty of good schools. I had a shitty 10th grade but recovered and was still ok in the end. Things will turn out fine. I felt the same, and still do actually. I question every day if my effort is worth it and if I should still be trying hard for my future, not knowing how it will turn out no matter how much effort I put in. But then I think \"well, I won't have any chance at all of success if I don't try!\" after looking at the shitty situation my parents are in, and I get the motivation to dream bigger. I struggle daily with my extremely bad attention skills and procrastination, but I just have to push through. That's life. It's shit, but one day you won't have to be in the education system anymore and will be able to live your life as you please. That's what makes the effort worth it. Work towards that day. It isnt as far away as you think. Time flies. Good luck, my friend.",

I moved to a small town from a huge city my senior year and it's impossible to have fun because everyone else has known each other since they came out of the womb and I'm just here working away trying to write my future. I wish my senior year could be more fun, but sometimes our life circumstances get in the way. However, don't throw everything you've worked for away. Instead, find a way to reform your work habits and allow yourself to meet new people and travel to new places if you get the chance. Just learn to have fun with your life no matter what your circumstances are, even if that is hard to see right now.",

I need you to know that you are valuable and worthwhile, not because of the numbers on your transcript, but because of who you are. You are inherently valuable and you matter. Your GPA and test scores can\u2019t touch that. \n\n2. Your hard work will pay off. Don\u2019t give up. \n\n3. This might not be a popular opinion, but you\u2019re right, your metrics are not the end-game. Pursuit of knowledge, of growth, and seeking experience are what make life rich and meaningful, and make individuals successful.\n\n4. As a human, you have a birthright to make your own meaning; to find success however you define it. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone will agree with you or support those definitions, but ultimately, at the end of the day, you have to answer to you. \n\n5. Things will get better. As you get older, you will have more control over how you spend your time, energy, and which areas of your life you want to grow. It is never too late to develop different parts of your life. The illusion of high school is that you are expected to leave it as a fully developed human with everything set in place for the rest of your life. That\u2019s just not the truth. Life is a constant work-in-progress; a series of seasons where growth looks different at different times. \n\n6. Be kind to yourself. Take care of yourself. You are worthwhile and you are enough. That\u2019s not just fuzzball, feel-good, new age nonsense. Self-care and self-respect actually matter. Do what you need to do to be healthy. \n\n\nAnyway, this might not be addressing your concerns entirely or even at all, but I need you to know those things. Too many students don\u2019t hear this, and really really need to.",
