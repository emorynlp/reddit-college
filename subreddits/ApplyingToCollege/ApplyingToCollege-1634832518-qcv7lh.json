  "text": "Hello!! I'm an international student and I applied for Michigan State University via Common App couple of days ago. I clearly saw that my first-year international application fee(75$) get paid successfully.\n\nAfter I received an email about my MSU account and logged in, I can see that my application is still awaiting for payment(75$ of application fee). I never heard about that I have to pay another application fee after I applied through Common App. So If there are students who apply to Michigan State University, I wonder if the original application process is like this.",
