  "text": "I got admitted to University of Minnesota TC a couple weeks back for Civil Engineering in their College of Science and Engineering. I\u2019m at risk of getting a C in AP Physics C. Do you guys think I could get my offer rescinded for that grade? I have a Unweighted GPA of 3.89 and have never gotten a C before.",

          "text": "Yea I\u2019m not worried of getting a D. The way my school does grades is we get a grade 1-4 on our tests which go in 3 specific standards- a 3 is Meets and is like an \u2018A\u2019 while a 2 is like a B/C and 1 is a D or F. To get a D or F, you have to have a mode of 1\u2019s in 1 or 2 standards, which means you fail like half the tests you take. Right now I have 2 standards where I have a mode of 2, which puts me at a C. But my grade can\u2019t go worse than that just because of how our school does it.",
