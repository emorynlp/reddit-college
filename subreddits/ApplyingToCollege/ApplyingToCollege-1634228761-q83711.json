  "text": "I'm not applying to be an art major but I have the opportunity to submit a portfolio, which is an opportunity I am going to take. So far I am planning to put some photos of the football team I took, club posters, merchandise designs I made for different clubs, fake advertisements I made for real companies (is that allowed?), a couple of drawings, and a couple of paintings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? There is no min/max that I can submit, so is 15 pieces a good number? Please let me know! TY!",

Because from your description, it sounds like you're throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks.\n\nAn art supplement is optional and a portfolio, even if not an art major, needs to be high quality. If it's not, you're just wasting everyone's time.",
