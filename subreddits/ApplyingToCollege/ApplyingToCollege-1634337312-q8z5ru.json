  "text": "Does anyone know if pre health sciences programs at college will allow me to apply to university for my bachelors of health sciences? My grades/course in high school won\u2019t allow me to go to university first, but I do meet all the requirements for pre health sciences for college. my question is will it give me a starting ground to apply to university for my bachelors of health sciences if I go to college first or will my high school grades still matter?",
