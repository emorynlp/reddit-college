  "title:": "How does graduating early from high school affect what colleges you can apply/get in to?",
  "text": "I went to 3 high schools in 4 years. I'm currently a senior from Illinois, and my mother thought it was a good idea to transfer to one of the worst high schools in my state. My mental health is falling apart and I'm not doing ok. Due to this, I talked with my counselor and I am eligible to graduate in December.\n\nHowever, they said that a condition of graduating early is that I must \"have a plan\" post graduation. I am literally unable to speak with my counselor because he's always really busy. I can spend 2 hours A DAY waiting for him. he also doesn't respond to emails. But from what I gathered, I need to go to community college after a December graduation. Here are my questions:\n\n1: Can I apply for fall 2022 colleges? If not, literally 90% of the colleges I want to apply to are immediately off the table\n\n2: They said I needed to apply with last year's FAFSA instead of the one that just opened this month. How will this affect my scholarship chances\n\n3: Is it possible to apply as a freshman for fall 2022, go to a CC for next semester, and then go to the 4 year college next fall?\n\n4: Will graduating a semester early put me at a disadvantage compared to normal HS graduates? I have a 4.9 GPA but a 1270 SAT and very few ECs. I'm already stressing out and I don't want to be even worse. But this high school is so bad that I can't fathom another 7 months there",

      "text": "1. yes\n2. Regarding last year's FAFSA, they must be referring to starting college in January 2022. Fall 2022 would involve the new FAFSA for this year.\n3. It depends. No, not if you graduate in December. *But YES, if you don't graduate in December, but take community college courses as dual enrollment for your spring semester and then graduate in May -*\\- this option may make the most sense, if you want to start at a four-year university in Fall 2022.\n4. That depends on the colleges you are aiming for. With a high GPA, you can apply test-optional. Keep in mind that universities are on a continuum from extremely selective to moderately selective to less selective to not selective. Extremely selective universities care about aspects like your course rigor and activities, which would be impacted by graduating early. Less selective ones may not care much.\n\nSee whether you are eligible for need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nThree things you will want to do immediately:\n\n(a) confirm with your high school counselor or school registar (and/or your high school course catalog/website) that you could take community college dual enrollment courses for spring semester, graduating at the normal time in the spring. (You would be spending your days at the CC, not at the high school.)\n\n(b) talk with your mom about an annual budget for college (what can you afford!) and have her help you run Net Price Calculators on some college websites to get an idea of affordability. If you have a noncustodial parent, that will complicate the financial picture, best to get started ASAP\n\n(c) begin to make a list of reaches, matches, and safeties, with their various deadline options. Early application deadlines are approaching rapidly. Regular decision deadlines are mostly in January.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for the detailed response. \n\nI'll try to get the dual enrollment set up ASAP. I have a list of a bunch of colleges that I'm trying to narrow down. I noticed a lot have their deadlines for November 1. OOF. As for the net price calculator, I just started using this, so thanks. I forgot all about it honestly.\n\nIf I do get dual credit, what exactly does that mean? Am I doing both college AND high school assignments? How will that affect college applications?\n\nMy mom will be helping me with the FAFSA, so we should get that sorted out. Speaking of which, is dual credit free? If I do that, I can graduate normally, avoid my toxic high school, AND go to a 4 year in the fall! Will dual credit look good for college, or will they look at it the same way they would if I just took a normal high school course for 2nd semester?",

              "text": "Dual enrollment courses do look good for college. Whether they are free or not depends on your high school and/or school district. You will need to talk to your high school.\n\nOne caveat to be aware of: down the road, certain graduate programs, such as law or med school, might count your community college grades as part of your college GPA.  In other words, don't mess it up.",

      "text": ">How does graduating early from high school affect what colleges you can apply/get in to?\n\nPuts you at somewhat of a disadvantage.  With an extra year you'd have more activities, more chance to demonstrate rigor, more time to improve your SAT, more chances to win awards, etc.\n\nThen again, if you can't stand high school, it lets you leave sooner.",

          "text": "That's the issue. As a senior, I only have one semester to show off, but my high school has only a handful of clubs, none of which I am interested in. Graduating early would help me mentally, but it would throw off going to a 4 year college, which is really concerning. I'm stuck between being happy for the next 7 months vs being miserable and having a more equal footing for college next year. It's not right in my opinion. I didn't deserve this",
