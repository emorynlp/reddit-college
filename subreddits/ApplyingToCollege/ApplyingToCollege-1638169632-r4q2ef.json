  "title:": "how i plan on telling my parents if i get into my rea school",
  "text": "this is all assuming i get in lmao so if i dont get in OOOOOOOOOFFFF ill just call and tell them i got deferred/rejected, but i wanted to share my idea in case someone might've wanted to do smth similar if they get into their top choice :)\n\nmy parents live overseas in our country of origin and one of my parent's health is deteriorating really fast, and this is smth i really wanna do if i get into my rea school.\n\nbasically, i plan on visiting them for winter break, and results are likely gonna come out like a week before i leave to hopefully see them. if i get in, like 10 mins later im gonna buy merch from the school for them and put it in a gift wrapping and then a hoodie for myself (i dont have any college merch lol and i only want to get merch from schools i get into). they dont check for when decisions release and decision dates, so ill just tell them i didnt get my results in yet if they ask. im gonna go flying to the country they are at wearing the hoodie and having the gifts in my backpack, and when i arrive, i want to walk up to them wearing the hoodie and hand them the gifts at the airport. i havent seen them in months, and it would be really nice to just surprise them without really saying anything, esp since they've been through so much in their lives to even make it to the USA and give me the opportunities that ive been able to have to be the person i am today. hoping for an acceptance so i can act on it and see them smile for the first time in a bit :D",

We live in the same house but I also want to surprise them, so I can't just order merch--maybe I'll just write the school in big letters on a paper and tape it to my shirt \ud83e\udd23 ez merch LMAO",
