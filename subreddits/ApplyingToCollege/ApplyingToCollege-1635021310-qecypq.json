      "text": "I'm not a good academic student. I screwed up my math classes for years (we're talking like averages in the 70s for almost all of HS), and I wanna go for CS. Granted I have a few CS classes I've done well in and some outside programming projects but I've been stressing the flip out forever. Both of my parents went to really impressive schools and my sister did really well with her applications. On top of all that I've been so preoccupied with colleges, that I feel like I've neglected my friends during the pandemic and now feel really distant from everyone. By neglected I mean that I only spoke with my best friend like once a week or so during some really bad stretches. So college apps have been my only life force for the past year. And it's not like some of the other people on this sub, I'm not applying to a million Ivy's. I just don't know what to do with myself, I'm just waiting. And I haven't had time to wait for two years, and I'm confused and I'm scared. Why do they make this so stressful?",
