  "text": "Hey y\u2019all I am so sorry for posting so late but my life has been just insane. I want to post the last of the scholarships I\u2019ve found but this post won\u2019t be as clean and informative as the others. I\u2019m really just giving the schools I believe to have these scholarships, not the niche score, whether they\u2019re international friendly, HBCU, exact money details, etc*.\n\nAgain I AM SO SORRY for the late reply, I\u2019m really going out with a whimper and not a bang. However, I really do want to try this December break to really clean up this post and also do some deep research for international full rides (which takes a lot lol). \n\nFor my senior internationals this year, I am so sorry but I don\u2019t think my list will come out in time for you guys to benefit from it. I\u2019ll still try to get it out in December regardless because it can help the Juniors. I really do wish you guys the best of luck and I know how hard y\u2019all work. I\u2019m really sorry I couldn\u2019t help sooner but it\u2019s just not possible for me right now.\n\nSo, with all that said here\u2019s the rest of the schools. With a little googling, I think the scholarships will pop up and y\u2019all can go from there.\n\nHere\u2019s what I have on my notes:\n\n\nUniversity of Louisville \n\nACT/SAT/GPA: 31, 1390, 3.5\n\n\nPrairie View A&M\n\n(Don\u2019t have the ACT or SAT, but I remember it being reasonable when I last searched it up)\n\nLATech\n\n(For this one I believe you have to be a nat. Merit  to get the full housing but there\u2019s another one that\u2019s all tuition and one year of housing if that interests you).\n\nLayola Marymount University \n\n(It\u2019s a tad bit more competitive than the usual but I think it\u2019s do-able. I couldn\u2019t find specific ACT/SAT, but just assume they\u2019re decent scores 30+).\n\n\nI lost half of my notes and so I know this seems so incomplete and I\u2019m sorry for that but hopefully once I have my break I can clean this post up and make one for internationals.\n\n\nThanks y\u2019all for your time and patience. I really want you guys to succeed and have the financial freedom to live your lives!",
