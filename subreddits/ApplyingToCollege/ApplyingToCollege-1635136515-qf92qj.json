  "text": "Current junior thinking of EDing to NU/UChicago but am living right here next to Berkeley. Why in my right mind choose any college outside of the top 6 over Berkeley, especially since i want to go into neuroengineering/CS --> Law/Business. I am in state CA as well.\n\nI feel like if I am getting into T15 it will be Vandy/NU/Rice. Not HYPSM at all. Given my bay area nature it is impossible and stupid for me to even think about HYPSM. ",
