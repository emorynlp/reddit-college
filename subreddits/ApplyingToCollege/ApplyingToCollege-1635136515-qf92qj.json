  "text": "Current junior thinking of EDing to NU/UChicago but am living right here next to Berkeley. Why in my right mind choose any college outside of the top 6 over Berkeley, especially since i want to go into neuroengineering/CS --> Law/Business. I am in state CA as well.\n\nI feel like if I am getting into T15 it will be Vandy/NU/Rice. Not HYPSM at all. Given my bay area nature it is impossible and stupid for me to even think about HYPSM. ",

      "text": "You are interested in startups and are looking at Northwestern and Chicago? Wow, no. That's not a strength at either school.\n\nFinance at those two schools is focused on markets and not at all on venture financing. Chicago got money for a startup incubator (the Polsky Center); ended up begging people to use the space; and, still it was grossly underused (before they closed it temporarily). The only VC I know who regularly goes to Chicago from the Bay Area works in digital advertising. Furthermore (as mentioned), you will have zero or near-zero interaction with finance faculty at either school. You're generally not even welcome to sit in on classes -- unlike at many other schools.\n\nMeanwhile, you are near Berkeley (in-state for CA!) so UCB and UCSD are both plausible? Those both have fantastic CS and bioengineering and solid undergrad business schools. Look at those, maybe even Davis, and CalPoly SLO. Even try for Stanford.",
