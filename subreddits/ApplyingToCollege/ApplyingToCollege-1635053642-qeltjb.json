  "text": "Many people in community college wish they went to a four-year research university. Many people from your average four-year research university wish they were a state flagship. Many people in state flagships wish they were one of the \u201celite privates\u201d such as Cornell/Brown/Dartmouth/Duke. Many people in Cornell/Brown/Dartmouth/Duke wish they were at Penn/Columbia/Stanford. Many people at Penn/Columbia/Stanford wish they were at HYP or MIT. Many people at Yale/Princeton wish they were at Harvard (or MIT if an engineering/CS nerd). Many people at Harvard wish they were in the Porcelain. Many people in the Porcelain wished they were multimillionaires\u2026 then billionaires\u2026 and so on.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry about it. If you have to go to UVA after being rejected from UPenn or have to go to Stanford after being rejected by Princeton, life will go on. Everyone feels a little disappointment\u2014its about whats next.",

      "text": "You just made a post about relative Ivy+ prestige the other day and now you're talking about the prestige rat race. And from your post history, you're continually posting about the rat race. Also, you're still in high school. Please don't speak for college students, don't authoritatively project your assumptions on others in trying to come to terms with your own feelings. \n\nYou're right that folks feel disappointment initially, and that what's next is what matters. But when I was in college and now in post-grad life, I haven't once wished I went to a \"better\" school. I felt lucky to go to Dartmouth and it turned out to be just the right place for my personality. And I can promise you none of my classmates were wishing they'd gone to Penn/Columbia/Stanford. Not everyone gets somewhere that's just right for them, but very few folks spend their whole college career wishing they went somewhere better because after one term you realize just how pointless that is. They find ways to be happy and they commit to being their best selves wherever they are",

Some may be unduly upset about the fact that it's \\*not\\* on the table, but most, I suspect, don't give it a second thought.\n\nI attended UT-Austin.  Suspect that for most of my classmates it was their 1st choice.  They may not even have applied to any schools \"more prestigious\" than UT.  It was reasonably well-regarded and dirt cheap.  I imagine the same is true for many well-regarded flagship schools, and especially those with a sports-related fan base.",

Some people talked about how they wanted HYP when they were applying, but all are pretty much convinced this place is better now that they're here (and it's now higher ranked and more selective than 4 of HYPSM, if that's what had them on edge?). So Idk if the prestige rat race really exists in that sense (also, Stanford wishing they were at YP? I don't even think that's a popular misconception lol)",
