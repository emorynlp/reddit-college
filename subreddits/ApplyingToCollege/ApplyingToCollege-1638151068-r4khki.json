  "text": "Ok so I\u2019m like kinda freaking out rn. I wrote my PIQ 5 about water polo. I mentioned a little bit about how it affected me academically, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re looking for. \n\nI\u2019ve looked at a few examples for the essay, but I feel like it\u2019s a bit hard to use references since the prompt is asking for something quite personal (biggest obstacle). \n\nAm I in the clear or should I gear the essay to focus more about my academic challenges. Tysm and have a lovely day/night :)",
