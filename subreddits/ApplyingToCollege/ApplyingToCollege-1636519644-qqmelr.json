      "text": "I usually suggest erring on the side of formality, but you don\u2019t want to assume their gender based upon their first name. (For instance, is someone named Kelly a Ms. or Mr.? There\u2019s no way to know just by the first name.) Unless they have pronouns included in their email signature which would indicate the appropriateness of Ms. or Mr. or Mx., I think it might be best to use their first name. Use \u201cDear\u201d as your greeting since it\u2019s more formal than \u201cHi.\u201d",
