  "title:": "Help, I've fallen in love...",
  "text": "It wasn't supposed to be like this...\n\nI applied ED to a specialized program at a top university and man, am I such a perfect fit. It lines up with a rather unique hobby of mine, and directly appeals to my interests. I am a competitive applicant to this school, but it's low admissions rate still makes it a reach. When I applied, I daren't hold out hope. Though I did stand a decent chance, an emotional relationship would make rejection unbelievably painful. At the time, I held the philosophy that the die was cast, and whatever happens, happens.\n\nSince then, I have discovered a Forbes article (albeit from a few years ago) in which the director of the program describes how, unlike the rest of the university, these specialized programs prioritized a genuine good fit, sometimes even over grades (my grades are fine tho), to the point of considering demonstrated interest and its extra program-specific supplemental essay as \"extremely important\" (based on the common data set ratings).\n\nI truly believe that I am better fit than the majority of program applicants, and that I showed this through my application. A vicious, malignant hope has arisen in me. For the first time, I've allowed myself to imagine what it'd be like if I were there. An obsession has taken possession of me, and I find myself scouring the internet for any and all extra information, all of which only reinforces this... this love. Rationally, I know that there are other programs in other universities that I can pursue, that will probably also lead to similar success, but I just can't control this heated desire, this emotional attachment...\n\nIs this love?\n\nMan, if I get rejected, I'll be so inconsolably sad, but if I get accepted, well, it'll be a dream come true.",
