If you want to really prepare then get a good idea of some of the most important experiences in your life, events, clubs, jobs, challenges, etc. Or even smaller things, hobbies, things that make you unique. Write them down as you think of them (you don\u2019t have to brainstorm) but if you have a list of important things to write about it can really help get the essays out of the way and make your writing more meaningful/impactful",

It\u2019s about presenting yourself not sticking to a prompt like an English class",
