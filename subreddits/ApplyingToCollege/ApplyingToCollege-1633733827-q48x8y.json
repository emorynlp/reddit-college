  "text": "I come from a big family: 6 total people. 4 students, which includes me. \n\nTo take this a step forward, 2 of my siblings are the in the same grade as me and, as a result, my family is sending a 3 kids to college at the same time. My other brother (the 4th student) is in the grade below is, so yeah\u2026\n\nTo take this a step even further, we all take a lot of APs. This year, combined, we have a total of 19 exams. Let\u2019s take a look at how much APs have/will cost us throughout high school (and to clarify, I\u2019m not saying APs are bad and I recognize some of this money will help long-term with college credits):\n\nSophomore Year: $432\n\nJunior: $981\n\nSenior: $1,824\n\nTotal: $3,237\n\nWhen you add my other brother\u2019s senior year, it could cost my family anywhere from $3.5k-$3.8k.\n\nRemember, $1,824 just THIS year for just APs. Tack on score sends, CSS profile fees, application fees. \n\nThat\u2019s a LOT of money. We don\u2019t qualify for like homelessness or like the free and reduced lunch and all that kind of stuff yet we still can\u2019t afford the aforementioned expenses.\n\nSo, how can you defray the astronomically high costs of high school and college admissions?\n\nWell, try NACAC, which stands for the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\nAs long as you can get a supporting statement from a financial aid officer, community leader, or a *school counselor*, a LOT of colleges will accept this fee waivers.\n\nMost of you guys, here on A2C, have a guidance/school counselor who can sign a NACAC form. Call each college on your list and ask how they want to receive the NACAC fee waiver form \n\nThe ones on my list want my counselor to email a digital version of the signed form. Yours might want the form mailed physically or faxed. You just need check each individual college\u2019s rules.\n\nMake sure to talk to your counselor if you\u2019re in situation like me and that could save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars!!",
