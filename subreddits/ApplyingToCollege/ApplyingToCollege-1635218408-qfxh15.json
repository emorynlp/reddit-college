I mean I understand where you are coming from but why target me?\nThis is generally good advice but we really should stop assuming the worst of people. This subreddit's purpose is to help each other and I genuinely wanted to help OP. I don't understand why someone would plagiarize an essay. But I guess there's people out there who would do it. That's why I usually don't answer to this kind of posts. But this one time I assumed that with it being an Why Major essay I could help without any worry for the OP as we probably aren't applying for the same major. I am applying for Sociology, so if OP would be applying as let's say a Computer Science major, I am sure their essay wouldn't even make sense in my application (not that I would ever plagiarize anything anyway). I OFFERED to help, I didn't force them, I literally said \"If you are comfortable\". \nIf OP asked for help on this website, they probably don't have someone else to ask to review their essay  or they want a different perspective from outside their inner circle.\nLet's maybe tone down the hate and the accusationd and the plagiarism if it's such a common thing on here and actually offer help to people when they ask for it.\nP.S. If I actually wanted to plagiarize their essay I could've said I am in graduate school or something so I become more credibile, I wouldn't have had to be honest about applying to college",

These are exactly the kinds of messages that students send their essays to and then they get plagiarised. The student itself could run into problems then.\n\n\u201cWe really should stop assuming the worst of people\u201d - what so I should trust a random stranger on the internet with my future? No, thanks. Also, there are so so many ways around verification. I don\u2019t even know who you are or if you\u2019re even a senior w sociology as a major. Just like you don\u2019t know me.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing against YOU, it\u2019s against the people who blatantly plagiarise. Also, if you can\u2019t understand that it\u2019s unsafe to send your essay which quite literally HOLDS YOUR FUTURE, then I\u2019m not sure what to say.",

It kind of sucks when you know you had good intentions and when you consider yourself to be maybe not a good person but a nice enough person that likes to help people and some random stranger on the Internet says you are a bad person and accuses you of something you would never do like putting someone else's future in jeopardy by stealing their essay. \nI don't want you or anyone else to think of me poorly, or as a plagiarizer just because I offered to help. I didn't know how things work around here, didn't know we are not supposed to help with essays and didn't realize people actually do plagiarize others' essays. I thought it's more of a conspiracy theory, not a fact but now I realize I was wrong. I am sorry if I offended you in any way. \nAs for OP, I don't want to have anything to do with your essay at this point (or any other) but as long as you let your passion shine through in your writing you should be fine. Good luck!",

They see hundreds if not thousands near the deadlines.",
