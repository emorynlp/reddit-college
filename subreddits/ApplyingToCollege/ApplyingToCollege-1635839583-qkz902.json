  "text": "I am a third-year CS student at a no-name university in my home (developing) country.\n\nDoes it even make sense right now for me to apply to colleges in the US?\n\nI am fine starting college as a freshman, sophomore, junior. It doesn't really matter, because I almost wasted two years of my life in my home country because of the f\\*d up educational system.\n\nI have a pretty solid 3.7 GPA, which I think I wouldn't have if I studied at one of the universities in the US.\n\nMy high school years were the worst years of my life, I don't want to talk about it right now.\n\nIs it possible to apply as a junior transfer while still being a junior at another university? I don't want to drop out right now just to have a chance to apply.\n\nWill the university I am applying to find out about my current university if I apply along with high school graduates (not as a transfer) and drop out later if I get in?\n\nWhat options are available for my situation?",

      "text": "Where ever you apply to will almost definitely know what school you\u2019re transferring from. What year you enter as will probably depend on what credits you have that will transfer (depending on the country and classes, that could be very few or a majority of your classes) and how many transfer credits the school you were applying to would accept.\n\nYou could really stress your experiences with your home country and it\u2019s educational system in your essays. Without knowing more about your stats I\u2019m not sure what schools you\u2019d have a good change at getting admitted into, but with a 3.7 you could definitely get into plenty of American schools\u2014 I don\u2019t know anything about what schools have good acceptance for international students, though, or if the cost of attendance would be a problem for you.\n\nGood luck and I hope you can get some good answers !",
