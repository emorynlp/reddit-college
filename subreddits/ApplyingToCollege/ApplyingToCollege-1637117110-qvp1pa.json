  "text": "I really struggled seeing all these top students doing way better things when I was simply enjoying life. Seeing where others were in life became an addiction sort of. You can see in my post history about my talks about looking at LinkedIn and r/chanceme. As a way to satiate my already low confidence, I began to go through these areas for hours per day only to realize as that it\u2019s effect was the contrary. It\u2019s way easier said than done but you can\u2019t compare yourself. It\u2019s not fair. This process is subjective. It for sure took me a while to adopt this into my life but it is life changing when you do.\n\nBack to the story, I began to ask other kids in my school about their extracurriculars and other stuff only to, once again, few better about myself because of my low confidence. Classmates began to ghost me, and I went through a period of feeling mentally lost - for what? No confidence.\n\nI learned the hard way. I know it seems all lost, and it seems that the light at the end of this dark tunnel can\u2019t be seen, but you HAVE to have confidence. It\u2019s at times the determining factor for most things (think dating).\n\nI hope I helped you all with this story of mine for some advice that can build us up to achieve what we want.\n\nWe got this!\n\nBest,\nInfernoBlaster8",
