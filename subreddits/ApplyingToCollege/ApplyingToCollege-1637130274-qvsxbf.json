  "text": "I am finalizing my UC essays right now and I really like the essay I wrote about my greatest skill which I showed why it was through an international event that happened in mid-2019. Its been overs 2 years since that happened but because of COVID, I am not sure if this is something that the UC's will look at as good because of how long ago it was. Do you think it would be fine to use this essay?",
