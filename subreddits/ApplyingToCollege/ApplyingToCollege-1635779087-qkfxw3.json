  "text": "I'm legitimately so grateful. If I had to submit the supplemental I have now, I wouldn't be pitted, but I would certainly be upset. My application would not have been its best. The school analyzed the situation and reevaluated based on it. Instead of today on November 1st, it's due on the 15th.   \nI'm beyond delighted that they decided to take into consideration that quite a lot of people didn't get power back until Saturday or Sunday, and some are still without it. Like, legitimately, I'm so glad they aren't deciding to screw kids who are doing their application last minute or need to make their edits. I really hope the extension benefits everybody as much as it can.  \nAlso, apologies if this isn't the right flair. I don't post a lot anywhere and this is the best one I could find.",
