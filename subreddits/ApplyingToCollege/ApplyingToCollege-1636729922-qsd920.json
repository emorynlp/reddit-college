I would like to learn more things that I can actually implement in my future career, and also some soft skills (negotiating, public speaking, etc)",

      "text": "I don't know the specific answer for these schools, though for any undergrad business program, places I'd look for developing skills include business school clubs/organizations/business \"fraternities\", the career center (sometimes there is even a one-credit course on the recruiting process), and of course internships.\n\nI imagine there is some information on business clubs and the career center offerings on the school websites. You could also check their subreddits.\n\nNegotiating - read Getting To Yes. Public speaking - surely there is a course, maybe outside the business school, that can help develop public speaking skills at any university.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a student at Ross, and my perception might be skewed (bc of my area of interest and courses/activities i do) but I think Ross does a decent job at incorporating practical skills into the coursework. There are decent chances to develop presenting and collaborating skills in courses, as well as case studies in many classes. \n\nActivities wise, this varies greatly based on what you want to do. I think most of them are pretty pre professional focused tho, with heavy emphasis on recruiting.\n\nNote that I don\u2019t have a frame of reference as I\u2019m not sure about UVA",
