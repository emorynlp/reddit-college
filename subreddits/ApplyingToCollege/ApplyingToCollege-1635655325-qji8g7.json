  "text": "I'm going to reapply to the same university that I did last year (I had to serve compulsory military service so I had the time). I noticed that the uni asked if I applied before so I presume they will look at my previous application as well?\n\nIs it okay if I add in further information that I neglected to add in the previous year's application (back then I did not think they were relevant things to mention)? For instance, I had a lot of palliative caretaking duties for my grandmother which really burnt me out back in school. Previously, I did not add this in cause I thought the universities would not care about such family information. However, I realise that it deserves at least some mention in the \"additional info\" box as it explains some of my circumstances in highschool. \n\nOf course, I'll also be adding on additional activities and qualification that I got in the extra year (e.g. some outside clubs, a nonprofit and finally, after so many test cancellations, an SAT score).\n\nThank you!",
