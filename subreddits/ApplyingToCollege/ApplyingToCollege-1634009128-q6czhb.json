  "text": "I want to be a government or journalism major and I absolutely hate science. I\u2019m in orchestra and planning on taking a language all four years and I\u2019m also taking AP research which takes up another spot. I just really don\u2019t want to take a science class since it\u2019s not interesting to me, I don\u2019t do well in it and the science teachers at my school are all mediocre. My freshman year I took Bio H, sophomore year Chem H and junior year APES. It\u2019s not like a had terrible grades (As and Bs) So I have higher level classes but I just don\u2019t want to take another one. Would this hurt me a lot in the application process? I have pretty good ECs for my interested major and good grades.",
