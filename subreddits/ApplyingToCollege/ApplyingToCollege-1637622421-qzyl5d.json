  "text": "I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s good to talk about why you are interested in that major, but also why you want to do that major at the specific school your applying to. What\u2019s a good ratio for this? If the word count is 300 should you spend 150 on why you generally are interested in the major and 150 on why that specific school would be a good fit for you and your major/career plans? Or am I dumb and all 300 can be for just why you want to do the major and you don\u2019t need to mention the specific school at all",
