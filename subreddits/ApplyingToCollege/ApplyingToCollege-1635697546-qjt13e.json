  "text": "Hey Y\u2019all! I submitted my Harvard REA application yesterday and got the portal login today. The portal shows that the Teacher Recommendation 1 and Teacher Recommendation 2 were submitted. On the Common App I also added an outside recommender, but there\u2019s so mention of that app on the portal. Do I just assume that Harvard received the outside rec letter or is there something that I need to do? Thank you so so much!",
