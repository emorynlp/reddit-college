  "title:": "is it too much to send 5 LORs?",
  "text": "the LORs i could potentially submit\n\n1. **required by my school: advisory teacher** (she has to write for like 30 kids and i'm pretty sure she uses a template, but i did my best to stand out and participate in advisory, had a few meaningful conversations with her)\n2. **my APUSH teacher** (probably my favorite teacher that i've ever had, he's used my test essays as the class exemplar like 3 times and he gave all his LOR students a detailed form to give him as much information as we wanted)\n3. **my honors physics teacher** (only really knew her over Zoom but i always put forward a strong effort in her class and came to office hours. apparently she turned down one of my classmates for a LOR around the same time she agreed to do mine, so i think that's a good sign)\n4. **supervisor at a nonprofit i've been heavily involved in.** (think 500+ volunteer hours level of involvement, he can really speak to my daily roles and what i've been able to do for the organization. he also wrote me a LOR that helped me get into a competitive internship.)\n5. **HYPSM research mentor from a summer internship.** (this wasn't a cash-cow program, they actually paid stipends to some interns. i was able to learn a lot over the summer but ultimately i only knew this mentor for \\~8 weeks.)\n\ni feel like 5 LORs is too many, but i don't know what i should get rid of here.",
