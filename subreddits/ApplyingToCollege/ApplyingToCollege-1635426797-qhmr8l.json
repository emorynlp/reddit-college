  "text": "Reposting something I wrote a year ago as a reminder...\n\nFor many colleges in the US, the deadline is for the applicant, not for counselors and teachers. Colleges want to get your application to complete status so they can read it. They will attempt to collect supporting documents for the next month or so. \n\nThe colleges that want ALL applications complete on the deadline make that **very** clear in the instructions on their websites. My friends in Ann Arbor, for example, need everything in-house on deadline day and have a note on their website about that.\n\nIf you are applying early, review the instructions on the websites and focus on putting the finishing touches in your applications. You got this.",

Yale said this same thing on their most recent podcast episode.\n\n2.  [Here's another old post by an AO at a highly selective college saying the same thing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a90w5k/a2c_faqs/)\n\n>Q: What has to be in by the deadline?\n\n>A: Only YOUR part of the application (Common/Coalition application, any supplements) has to be in by the deadline. If your transcripts/recommendations/scores/etc arrive a few days after when school is back in session, that's not a problem. We understand that our deadline falls right in the middle of your school's holiday break.",
