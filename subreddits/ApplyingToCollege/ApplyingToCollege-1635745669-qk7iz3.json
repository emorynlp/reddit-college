  "text": "Are the UDub essay and the Coalition essay same? I have written a coalition essay on the prompt: Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?\n\nIts pretty good, imo. So should I just copy paste that essay into the UDub Writing section? It doesnt exceed the word limit or anything, I just think that the personal statement and this common app essay prompt are sort of different",
