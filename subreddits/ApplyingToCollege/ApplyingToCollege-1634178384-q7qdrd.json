      "text": "In terms of prestige, other folks are covering them.\n\nIn terms of vibe, I'm not sure. Ironically Harvard was the only university I've visited that \"felt\" like Berkeley though I assume that's not the comparison you'd want to make. Just can't think of a public school that matches that atmosphere and campus.\n\nI'm not sure UCLA has an equivalent because it's so ingrained in West Coast culture, I'd almost say that you need some kind of wild card like UF to compare. (I'm thinking maybe University of Maryland or Georgia Tech as well?)\n\nFor Davis, you'd need some sort of inland small-ish college town. Penn State maybe? (Though it parties and sportses a lot harder than Davis). Georgia might be better.",

It just means they have other commitments, or care less about grades or something else. \n\nYes the classes are easier lol. I\u2019ve compared 1:1 our CS curriculum. UCLA CS exams look like a total joke when compared to the ones I went through. Hell Stanfords 106A/B are much easier than our 61A/B. The only schools comparable in difficulty at least in Engineering are CMU and MIT. \n\nIt\u2019s not 1:1\n\nThat\u2019s not to say ucla isn\u2019t difficult. But it\u2019s much easier than Berkeley. The culture at ucla is much more balanced. Less academics more well rounded.",
