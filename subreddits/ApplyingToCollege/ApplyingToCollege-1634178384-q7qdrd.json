      "text": "In terms of prestige, other folks are covering them.\n\nIn terms of vibe, I'm not sure. Ironically Harvard was the only university I've visited that \"felt\" like Berkeley though I assume that's not the comparison you'd want to make. Just can't think of a public school that matches that atmosphere and campus.\n\nI'm not sure UCLA has an equivalent because it's so ingrained in West Coast culture, I'd almost say that you need some kind of wild card like UF to compare. (I'm thinking maybe University of Maryland or Georgia Tech as well?)\n\nFor Davis, you'd need some sort of inland small-ish college town. Penn State maybe? (Though it parties and sportses a lot harder than Davis). Georgia might be better.",
