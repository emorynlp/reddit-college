  "text": "After reading numerous ivy essays, I\u2019m starting to have doubts about an essay I spent a ton of time on. Those essays usually consist of knowledge and lessons someone accumulated throughout their whole life, but mine is just about a small event and a small lesson I learned about teamwork through said event. Can they learn enough about me through my actions in that event? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing this right.",
