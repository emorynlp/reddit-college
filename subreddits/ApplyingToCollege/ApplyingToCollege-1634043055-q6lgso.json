  "text": "I am applying to a college that has a supplemental essay requirement. The college is TBH not that hard to get into \\[I'm very positive I'll get admitted there\\].\n\nThey ALSO have a scholarship that is VERY competitive. To apply for the scholarship, I'll have to create a separate account in their \"scholarship portal\" and respond to a few more prompts. \n\nMy question is, should I write a subpar admissions supplemental essay (so that I could save time and work on other applications)? I will obviously not cut time when writing the scholarship essay. \n\nWill having a subpar admissions supplemental essay hurt my scholarship chances?",
