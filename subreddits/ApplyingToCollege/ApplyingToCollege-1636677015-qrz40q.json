The competition is in 4 days and I literally am panicking because I've looked at practice problems for the last 4 days since they've told me and I can't even get to 50 points which is far from the 100 point cutoff.\n\nAny tips for cramming the amc 12?\n\nPlease I'm screaming inside rn \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "you can't really cram for tests like amc because you're most likely up against other students who have been doing competition math for as long as they've been in school. You should look over past AMC problems from AOPS.\n\nDuring the actual thing, just try to be strategic with how you answer the questions. If I remember correctly, you can still get 1.5 points for omitting an answer, so always leave hard questions blank.\n\nLastly, making AIME is obviously a plus on your resume, but in my humble opinion, it's also not the greatest thing in the world, either. So I wouldn't stress it too much. Just take it easy and good luck",

      "text": "The AMC isn\u2019t built to be crammed for, like others have said. Most people I know who qualified for AIME had been involved in the competitive math scene for 3-4 years or had already worked with similar problems independently. Even for someone quite good at the necessary math, preparation to qualify for the AIME when you\u2019ve never done it before would likely take at least a month. The best thing you can do is practice on AoPs with past packets and learn a couple math competition tricks/problem types that come up often. Strategize: if you can narrow down the answers to 2 options, it\u2019s usually worth guessing. Otherwise, leave it blank so at least you won\u2019t get a score reduction. \n\nBut if you can\u2019t qualify for AIME, it\u2019s not the end of the world. I know plenty of people who never even qualified for AIME and ended up at top STEM schools.",

Improving a score by 50+ points in 4 days is borderline impossible in a vacuum, but it's possible that grinding out a bunch of past exams could jumpstart someone without any experience pretty well?\n\nGood luck, in any case!",

      "text": "Practice. Lots of practice. And use the website aops since they have solutions and videos. However, if you don't have the mathematical foundation you will struggle a lot. I suggest studying (and proving) different geometrical theorems, combinatorial theorems, and learning a few factoring tricks. \n\nOn a lot of problems, you can be a lot quicker if you recognize these tricks and just use them so that you can save time for the more time consuming problems. However, if you want to score high, it's best to do only the ones you can solve first and check them before attempting any question that might take a lot of time (AKA how I flunked the 2021 Feb AMC). \n\nOf course just practicing mindlessly won't help much, but practicing and sitting mock papers is IMO the best way to get used to the test. If you have time, do all the papers from 2010-2021 and go through every answer + solution. If you feel like you're out of time, do the first 20 and any of the last 5 you think you can do and ignore the rest if you must. \n\nBefore I took mine I did \\~30 practice papers, 16 of which were AMC 12 and the rest were AIME papers. It's good to practice up (so AIME for AMC and USAMO for AIME) and you might find it helpful to do a few #1-#10 questions on the AIME (although don't be discouraged if you can't do them since some the of the #8s can be harder than the final few questions). \n\nI took the A paper this year (and probably will take the B paper, but I'm considering not taking it since I did reasonably well on the A paper). After the 24 hour thing is up, feel free to ask me about specifics regarding the A paper and I'll be happy to explain. \n\nI've also noticed that I tend to screw up on geometry/combo problems so make sure you brush up on the areas you are least confident in. \n\nTo make AIME on the AMC 12 you generally need to answer 14-15 questions or so. I would recommend going for at least 15 since you might make mistakes during the process. However, my opinion of this year's paper is that it was unusually easy and I'm guessing the boundaries will go up by quite a bit. \n\nAnd if you're asking about the B paper, you still have a decent amount of time. It depends on how busy you are, of course, but good luck! I probably have an AMC question compilation somewhere by topic - shoot me a message if you want it! \n\nAnd lastly, exam strategy. If you can't attack it directly, eliminate answers instead. Take a guess if you have 2 answers left and are reasonably confident that you'll make AIME either way. If you can't solve a problem within a minute, skip it on your first run and do all the ones you can finish first. Of course these are only last resorts and AMC is really supposed to be about problem solving, but if you're bent on making AIME you should engage in a bit of a strategy. \n\nDon't get too stressed though. You'll be fine even if you don't make AIME.",

I didn\u2019t make AIME cutoff due to not being able to read my own handwriting (:/), but I got an ~89, which was 1 question away from the qualifying score. I\u2019m not heavily involved in math Olympiad \u2014 I took the AMC 10 for fun, failed, and said I would study harder for 12, but didn\u2019t get the time. Was scoring around this range on practice tests too. I found a book that\u2019s really helpful, and also looked at the formulas online. But the 12A last year was pretty easy so that could have contributed.",

      "text": "Unfortunately to put it bluntly, not really possible. I managed to make AIME once as a sophomore through the AMC 10, and that\u2019s from years and years of general experience/skill/interest in competition math. It\u2019s not really something you can learn even in years unless you\u2019re at a certain starting level, and even if you are it takes dozens to hundreds of hours of practice to seriously improve in it. The tips in this thread are good, but they are for those who are in the general range of qualifying but may need some general AMC-taking knowledge to make the cut.",

Like lives and breathes math, makes math their personality.  \n\n\nNo offense, but even if your averaging 80 there's likely very little hope and in your case it's absolutely in your best interest to just study for other things :/",
