  "text": "Hey, I know it\u2019s pretty damn late asking for reviews and tips for polishing my essays for UNC, but if you\u2019re a strong essay writer and are willing to help me please comment or leave a reply. I absolutely need more suggestions and peer edits for my essays cause I feel like those are going to be a BIG part of being admitted. \n\nThank you to everyone <3",
