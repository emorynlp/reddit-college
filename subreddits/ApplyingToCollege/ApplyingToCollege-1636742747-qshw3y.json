  "text": "So, I've submitted my application to a college. Can my subject teacher still submit my recommendation letter to that college? Also, if he uploads it in the common app, will it automatically get transferred to my College's application portal? My college says that it will take around 3-5 days to process new application materials, so will it take the same time to process the recommendation letter as well?",
