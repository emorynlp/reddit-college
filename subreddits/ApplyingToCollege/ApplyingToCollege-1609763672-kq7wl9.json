My freshman year, tons of colleges visited my school, and being young and inexperienced, I visited pretty much every single damn one!\n\nNow then, I noticed that there were less people at the Barnard table than at any of the others, so I went to go talk to their representative. I was there chatting it up with her for like 10 minutes before she stopped, asked me if I had a sister, to which I replied yes, but she is like 6.\n\nShe then stopped, looked at me oddly, and said, \"You know Barnard is an all women's college right?\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, \"Why didn't you tell me this to begin with!?\"\n\nAnd that's how I wasted 10 minutes of my life. I had kinda forced this memory from my mind, and had forgotten the name until right now",

They weren't trying to be \"exclusive\" - just to give women a chance at a prestigious higher education. These colleges are private so they're not obligated to be open to everyone.\n\nThere are all men's colleges as well: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s\\_colleges\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_colleges_in_the_United_States)\n\nAnd no women (or anyone) really care because, again, they're private institutions and nowadays everyone is eligible to study at the vast majority of colleges.\n\nAnd I haven't checked but I would guarantee that most \"first world nations\" *also* have a few all men's and all women's schools.",
