  "title:": "How to go back after essentially failing out of school?",
  "text": "I should probably explain my circumstance:\n\nI was an honor student in high school and most of my first year of college. I went to school on a full scholarship, and was on the dean's list my first semester. Due to an escalating stalker situation that started intensifying in my second semester (and that I dealt with very poorly) I dropped to Bs, ended up switching a class, and then switching my entire major. \n\nMy second year, things only got worse with the stalker, and I was disowned by my father for unrelated LGBT reasons. I withdrew from most of my classes and failed the rest. Thanks to prior good grades my GPA only dropped to a 2.8, but my last term GPA was a 0.85. I never dealt with the stalker, and instead dropped out of school.\n\nSince then, I've been rejected year after year after year from any school I apply to. My primary major (neuroengineering/bioengineering) doesn't help things;  those programs aren't exactly looking for flunkies.\n\nI've thought about taking online or community college classes to show recent good grades, but I already have way too many credits for what most schools want from their transfers. Between my AP courses in HS and heavy courseload in college, I was technically classed as a *senior* when I dropped out. (Though, due to my schedule shuffle, I wasn't actually near close to finishing a degree)\n\nAny advice?\n\ntl;dr -- I left school with a 0.85 for my last semester, and enough credits to be considered a senior, and now no school wants me. halp.",

      "text": "Maybe your best bet is to talk to an academic counselor at your old school and ask for a semester on probation, and ask what would happen if you repeat the classes you failed. If they\u2019ll let you replace the Fs that might do the trick and let you either finish or transfer. Even if you have moved a lot of classes can be taken online right now due to covid. They may also have a suggestion like attending a specific related CC for a term and then being readmitted. \n\nCommunity college is another option, but you should have a plan for how any classes you take would count towards your next degree plan - you should take them at a CC affiliated with the university you want to transfer to and make sure that you won\u2019t go over the limits if they have any (I think your APs won\u2019t count against a maximum and you can take a lot of CC classes you just can only transfer a certain number of hours)\n\nYou can also look at some reasonably good colleges that are struggling to find students these days, with international students not coming due to covid and the number of college age Americans declining a lot of schools are scrambling to fill seats. They may take you now where they didn\u2019t in a previous year. I\u2019m thinking state schools like Western Michigan and Weber State, small liberal arts schools liner Rider. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t still focused on engineering I\u2019m pretty sure this program would accept you. They don\u2019t get funding from the state so normal admissions rules are relaxed. It\u2019s sort of a second chance option for successful people who struggled in school and now just want to get any degree to check that box. https://www.csudh.edu/applied-studies-bs/",

Many of the companies are pretty impressive and offer all kinds of benefits - like covering tuition for the rest of college. They like to help people who have been through a rough time but have potential",
