  "text": "So I'm about to apply to college and I've taken the SAT twice and the ACT once. I got a 1340 on both SATs and a 31 on my ACT. I've also taken a few AP tests and even managed to get 3s and 4s on a few. \n\nMy counselor has been telling me to submit all of my test scores on college apps, but I've heard it might be better to only submit my ACT and the 3s and 4s I made on AP Exams. I was hoping to get some advice on this. Thanks in advance for the help.",
