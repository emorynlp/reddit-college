On the website it just asks me to check a box ( \"I only have international exam results during this period OR I did not attend this school during years 9-11/grade 12.\") which prevents me from entering my 9th and 11th grade marks.\n\nI am able to fill my 10th and 12th marks on the other academic information section. Can anyone please help",
