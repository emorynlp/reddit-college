Excellence isn't important when it isn't for something the college is looking for. Just like for underwater basket weaving no one cares about it. It doesn't show skills that have merit or can show success in college.\n\n\\> As to wasting time, if they have done this along with tons of other accomplishments, it doesn\u2019t take away from their other accomplishments, if anything it makes them more impressive\n\nTo be a top player in that big of a game you'd probably have to spend almost every free hour playing the game.",
