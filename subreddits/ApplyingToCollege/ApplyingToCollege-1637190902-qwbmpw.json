  "text": "Hey everyone! Title basically sums it up. I'm a first time A2C-er and was wondering if you all had any tips on how to mentally break down your opponents. I have a lot of high-achiever friends who I'm competing for spots with, and I'm trying to think of ways I can get inside their mind and destroy them from the inside out. So far, I've tried opening my emails from the Harvard admissions offices in front of my friends so they can see that I'm considered hot stuff in the world of college admissions. It's like seeing a love letter from your crush in someone else's mailbox. I'm a particular fan of emotional destruction and I think this one is really going to hit home for them. My HYPSM dreams aren't unfounded- they've got rock-solid proof to back them up! I also alternate wearing two MIT sweatshirts. If I wore just one, it only kinda sends the message that I've got connections with the institute, but since I've got two, it's brings a sort of added dimension of interest.  I think it really messes with their heads that I have so much merch - at this point, they're going to assume the fight is lost and they'll withdraw their apps. I like to imagine them walking home and seeing themselves in the mirror without even one MIT sweatshirt, which reinforces any feelings of inferiority they might have. Once they get into this state, any comments I make about them will hit just a little bit deeper, and they'll be driven a little further into madness. I also made a list with all their names repeated five times and whenever I'm talking to someone, I'll cross out their name once with a big x so that they can see it. After five cross-outs, I cross out the entire line of names once more. I think that this strategy might help with the way they view me by adding some uncertainty and fear into the mix. Who know what's going to happen when they're all crossed out? Is it even worth applying to college if they're already dead? I really think this strategy is a winner. Let me know how I can either sharpen up these, or if you all know of any other weapons I can add to my arsenal!",
