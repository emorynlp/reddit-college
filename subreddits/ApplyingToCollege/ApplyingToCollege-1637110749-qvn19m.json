  "text": "From what I see, college admissions is super competitive if you are applying to T20s as a STEM type of student. You basically have to be a USAMO or INTEL Science Fair medalist to stand out in that pool.\n\nI'm thinking of crafting my application to be more humanities and social justice oriented, because there are less kids applying as humanities-focused students, and there's so many applying with a STEM focus. \n\nDo you think this is a wise strategy?",

Y\u2019all make me laugh lmao. \n\nBy the way, traditionally those who major in humanities at ivies are very accomplished too, having published papers, scholastic awards, etc depending on their fields. so you\u2019re not competing against idiots either. Finally, most schools require departmental approval to change majors, so let me ask you this\u2026 a freshman gender studies major picks CS as soon as the semester starts, what does this tell you as a department coordinator? You tell me.",

      "text": "1) As others have said, many top colleges do not account for major, that\u2019s usually more for large public schools that get way too many applicants for certain majors and don\u2019t have room (ex: UCLA engineering). Top colleges often assess whether or not you are a good fit for the school in general, rather than a specific major. So selling yourself as a humanities student wouldn\u2019t help. \n\n2) If you get in at a school as a humanities major where CS is very competitive, you might not even be able to transfer into CS until someone drops out, so you\u2019re taking a risk. \n\n3) At many top schools, there is a pretty big humanities focus (ex: Yale), so it might even be more competitive to go for humanities at those schools as opposed to STEM. \n\n4) You do not need to have a USAMO or Intel Science Fair medalist to stand out as a STEM major. I go to a top 20 school as an engineering student, and I\u2019ll tell you firsthand that I pretty much just did what other students did in high school, except my grades were higher and I was a little more involved in extracurriculars. For my essay, I wrote about a competition that I didn\u2019t even place in, but I thought the app I made was pretty cool, so I chose it as my topic. You don\u2019t need to be a superstar, you just need to demonstrate that you genuinely like building things and making an impact.",
