  "title:": "Princeton Late REA Submission (7 Seconds Late)",
  "text": "Hey A2C, \n\nWhen I submitted my Princeton writing supplement, it did not go through until two minutes later, so ended up submitting it three times in a hurry. The third time it went through, displaying 11:58 as my submission time, but when I checked the website a couple of minutes later, it now displays my submission as 7 seconds late. I have the confirmation email that shows that I submitted it at 11:58 \u2014 should I forward this to the Princeton AOs?\n\nThanks for the help!",
