  "text": "Im currently taking Multivariable Calc and i don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get an A (most likely end with a high B) because the class is really hard + hard to manage with school work.\n\nCollege apps are due by Jan 7 latest, so I won\u2019t be able to put my grade on the common app. Do I need to send my college transcript though, to colleges like Ivies + Stanford + MIT? I have a 4.0 GPA UW right now, don\u2019t want to mess that up.\n\nWill I need to report this B anywhere as well? Like, will colleges ask for it when trying to transfer credits? Do I need to even transfer credit for this course?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Don\u2019t worry about this B. It won\u2019t influence your admission.\n\nAlso- you would definitely want to transfer the credit because the grade doesn\u2019t transfer with it/ just the credit. On your new college transcript it will show \nMultivariable Calculus  Transfer P\n\nThe P is for Pass.",

      "text": "Yes. You will need to send your college transcript that includes grades from fall semester (just like the mid-year report that is sent with high school grades). Colleges understand that these will come a bit later than the RD deadlines.",

      "text": "I would not worry about a B in multivariable.\n\nYou will be required to have your high school send the mid-year report with your first semester grades, some time in January. I suspect the colleges would also want to see your dual enrollment transcript at that time.\n\nCredit is a separate question. Yes, you should try to get transfer credit at the college you decide to attend.",
