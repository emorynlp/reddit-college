  "title:": "Should I apply for ED or just wait? - International",
  "text": "I'm currently in a very tricky situation. I really like Brown, however, I was unable to take either one of the standardized tests on time before the early round. Even though  I do think I have an interesting story, hook, niche, and could be potentially a great fit; however, I still think that the testing part would be a crucial piece of my application.\n\nI'm able to take the test in December (finally!) but here's my question: \n\nShould I sacrifice the ED boost and apply elsewhere in the early round and come back to Brown stronger for RD? Or just go with showing my GPA which is in A to A- range without testing... \n\nIt's of my knowledge that the testing/GPA is most often the entry requirement of AOs to read your essays. Could anyone help me to tackle down this internal dilemma?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a bunch for any comments or tips! :)",
