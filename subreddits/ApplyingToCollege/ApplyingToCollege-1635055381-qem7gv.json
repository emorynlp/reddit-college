  "text": "I currently live in McKinney Texas, and I'm a junior with 3.8 GPA, and I am shooting for UT Austin with enough time. Because I was homeschooled in Asia for seven years, my credits were not accepting and I spent months retaking freshman, sophomore, and junior year, but they still put me a year behind, as a junior.  I was only given the chance AP class, and while I have a hundred in it, they must've screwed up my transcript because my weighted is lower than my unweighted :/. My current plan is to get a bachelors in nursing. From the information that I've gathered, I have a few options:\n\n 1. Apply to a non-competitive community college with high acceptance rates\n\n 1a. stay for 2 years, then apply for a more competitive college to finish my 4 year major \n\n 1b. stay for 4 years and complete my major\n\n 2. Bust my ass off in senior year with as many APs and dual-credits as I can possibly manage, and shoot for a very competitive college like U.T.\n\n2a question. will they care that I am a year behind and took senior year to apply?\n\nI am willing to work hard to achieve the best possible outcome, but right now I am so illiterate in the pros and cons of different colleges, so it would really be amazing to see if anyone could tell me what's the best effort-put-in to results-shown to my specific needs. Thanks so much!",
