  "text": "Since Naviance only let's you request teachers for letters or recommendations, how will I know if my counselor wrote a recommendation? I emailed her and she said she would but how would I know if she really did? If I reached the max number of requests on the teacher requests on Naviance for a specific school, do I need to remove a teacher so my counselor can add hers or what?",
