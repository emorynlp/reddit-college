  "text": "Hi all, \n\nI've been thinking about this for a hot minute, and I want to get to the bottom of it because I'm planning on submitting a lot of my applications this coming week and I can't find a concrete answer to this online (or at least I'm not looking hard enough...)\n\nThis year, I'm taking an elective where I basically do tech support for the school during a class block. I wanted to report this on the Common App as an activity, and my both my counselor and the leader of this elective said I could. However, this is the problem: Doing this counts for a grade, however the grade is solely based on attendance, where I'll get an A if I show up every day, and the actual tech support work isn't graded at all, and doesn't have any set curriculum. \n\nSince I was granted permission to list this as an activity, I obviously am I going to, but I've been wondering if I should explain this circumstance in Common App's additional info section. Is this necessary? Is it actually a waste of time to do this? Am I overthinking this? Advice would be appreciated!",
