  "text": "Background about me: \nI am international with US citizenship. My parents are not citizens but pay taxes in New Jersey, so they want me to apply to Rutgers, and likely go there. \n1440 SAT, 3.92 GPA currently a junior\n\nMy thoughts about Rutgers \n1. Bad food (had a college tour in 2019, and really hated their food) \n2. My Middle and HighSchool are connected (share some staff and the building). I was a problematic child in MS because I got bullied a lot of I never seem to grasp the social rules, so some of my actions caused the teachers some problems. The Middle school counselor I visited a lot (basically if you do things wrong you get sent to the counselor office, they will sort things out then report to the team leader which then decide the administrative punishment). I was problematic, but I really felt hurt by the way he tried to solve problems (he claimed that I have autism and just blamed everything on that while constantly asking my parents to bring me to the doctor while the doctor said I was perfectly fine) He graduated from Rutgers and constantly promoted it in front of us during our weekly guidance period. I feel like if I go there I am like \u201cfalling into the way he wants me to be\u201d and that thought makes me want to throw up because I hate him that much. \n3. I really don\u2019t know the school well and from the basic I know of it, it doesn\u2019t feel like schools I would want to go. \n(I want to study Chemical Engineering and Finance Management) \n\nJust to see if this problem can have a possible solution, maybe some of you who see Rutgers as a a good school can list some reasons why you think it is good and let me see the other side of the school.",
