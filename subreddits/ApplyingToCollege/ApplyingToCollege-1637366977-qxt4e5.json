  "text": "Basically, I had a huge upward trend in high school. In 9th grade, I got B's and C's in reg classes. In 10th grade, I got all A's, but in reg classes. In 11th grade, I got all A's in 3 honors and 2 AP classes. In 12th grade, I've actually started to take on a heavy courseload with 4 APs and honors courses on the side. I've been grinding so hard to keep my grades up, and at the end of the first quarter, I'm ending with all A's. Will this be used to evaluate my upward trend?",

      "text": "They weigh grades from first semester. Final transcripts are sent to the college that you choose to attend. They\u2019ll definitely look at the upward trend but depending on the college they like to see rigor and challenging classes taken. Colleges would rather see a B or even a C in an AP class over straight As in regular classes. Just make sure to write some good essays, have decent extracurriculars and a positive mindset through this stressful college app season.",

      "text": "when taking into consideration your personal story, recommendations/interview, and ecs, an upward trend can only benefit you. your transcript is typically looked at first and while it may be noted that you had a rough start (and honestly, it wasn't too bad) and have excelled ever since. it wouldn't necessarily put you out of the running. your senior grades definitely matter - when i was applying to schools and got waitlisted, like you i didn't have a stellar record, albeit due to extraneous circumstances in my life; however, showing consistency and reporting my grades beyond december probably helped me at the places i got waitlisted at :-)",
