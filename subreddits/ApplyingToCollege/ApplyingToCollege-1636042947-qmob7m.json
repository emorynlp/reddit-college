  "text": "so im a senior, and my cumulative gpa is 3.77. i just didn\u2019t so so well in ninth grade, and my gpa without it would probably be around 3.95. i\u2019ve taken 11 ap\u2019s to try and make up for this, and i\u2019m really panicking bc i\u2019m applying to schools like umich, boston college, smith, etc. Will colleges look at growth?? or am i totally fucked",
