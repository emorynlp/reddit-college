  "text": "I\u2019m testing out of Chinese 3 for scheduling reasons. I completed the first semester, but won\u2019t be continuing the second, hence the T/O. I\u2019m pretty good at it, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll pass, and I also plan on taking Chinese 4 next year. However, I\u2019m worried that colleges will look at this in a negative way. Any insight you can offer?",
