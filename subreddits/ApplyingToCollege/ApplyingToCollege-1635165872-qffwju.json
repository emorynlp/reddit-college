  "title:": "How Did UMiami Change So Quickly???",
  "text": "Please do not light the comment section on fire for this stupid question:\n\nI remember my freshman year the University of Miami was more of a \"party school\" where everyone who applied practically got in. However, how did the school drop the admit rate to an all time low of 27% and started to gain respect so quickly? Do you think in about 10 years the reputation will continue to increase? Does the school have any respect now? Or does it still have the reputation of a \"party school?\"",

      "text": "Miami has been respected for a long time - they have been around 50 on the US news list for 20 years. It's also a party school - those things aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nMaybe the perception of the school by you and your peers has changed, but I think in the broader public it's pretty much the same other than their football team having a couple of down years.",
