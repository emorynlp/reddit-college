  "text": "I understand that  Northeastern University and UMass Amherst  are both good choices for CS at undergrad and beyond.\n\nFor a UMASS resident student with an in-state fee option what would be the merits of choosing Northeastern vs UMass Amherst for undergrad. Wants to stay with in MA.\n\n1. No financial constraints.\n2. No particular preference for City vs Semi-Rural setting.\n3. CS being a popular major , Co-Op is nice to have,  but not a must criteria.\n\nWhich University would be a good potential for future career growth?\n\nWhat would one get for the extra premium they would be ready to pay to Northeastern?",

      "text": "If you're in-state, then UMass Amherst makes a lot more sense, unless you want to enjoy the urban life in Boston... NEU does have a great structured co-op program, but I don't think it deserves the extra premium (unless you get a nice scholarship from them)... And don't know if this factor is important for you, but UMass Amherst has hands down the best on-campus food in the nation!",

      "text": "i go to northeastern! i\u2019d say if nothing else, the co-op opportunities can really set you up for success after graduation. I know one student who did one CS coop at Facebook, another coop at NASA and are now going on to work full time at Facebook right after graduation. You may not have a preference on rural vs city, but there will generally be more opportunities in the city. plus CA co-ops can pay up to $40+ an hr",
