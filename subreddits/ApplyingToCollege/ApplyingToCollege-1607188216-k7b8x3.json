I see so many 'I got accepted to X college' and while I get why ppl may want to post that, there's literally a thread for it. And also so many rant and fluff posts that I haven't seen a genuine college related questions or advice since they temporarily banned those posts before the ED deadline. I suggest there should just be like a rant/fluff thursday to limit those posts and all college acceptance posts should be removed. That's just my opinion.",

                  "text": "Hi I make a lot of fluff posts :) and respectfully I disagree. The point of this sub is to provide support to kids applying to college. Often that comes in the form of rants/think pieces/moral support , and on Wednesday bonding over humor. I would argue that the core info that you believe the fluff is clogging (essays advice, LOR help, fin aid etc) is all linked on the mega thread. Most minor \u2018relevant\u2019 questions I see here are basic enough to just be googled or searched using the search function. Again, I respect your opinion but for one, I think that even with what I previously mentioned, people still are answering college related questions, they just aren\u2019t being massively upvoted bc at the end of the day, it\u2019s much more fun and cathartic to read a rant than a random question that may not apply to u (again since most of the main q are answered on the megathread). Also now that EA is over people are in there groove and have less general questions :)",

                      "text": "Thanks for your input! I respect your opinion too! However, I still disagree with some of your points. The description of this sub is \"This subreddit is for anyone looking for advice about undergraduate college admissions, including college essays, scholarships, SAT/ACT test prep, and anything related to college applications.\" I don't feel that ranting or fluffing fits under that category. Now you argue that this is a false description and doesn't apply anymore and that's fine. I just feel that to maintain the initial purpose of this sub, fluff and rant posts should be moderated. They don't necessarily have to be banned completely. in r/Fitness for example, I believe they have a rant Monday or something. If a similar approach is taken on this sub, it would help people on both sides of the spectrum. Also, some questions are too specific to be found on the internet. I've experienced this first-hand. Also, the fact that RD is coming should mean that there would be a lot more questions than EA due to more colleges and people who didn't apply early. I still like the posts that share experience or advice but in my personal opinion I'd rather see helpful posts than people sharing their frustrations every time they have one. Then again, if the vast majority of this sub prefers it that way(including the mods), there's not much I can do.",
