  "text": "For my 10th common app activity, I am a leader of a club and said there were 100 members because I filled this out earlier in the year when we had that many. I checked recently and it\u2019s closer to 70 since some members have decided not to continue and since I didn\u2019t realize I have submitted already to a couple schools. I also hosted an event with this club with nearby schools that had 120+ members so ig the number is fine. \n\nWill this be considered as lying? How should I fix it?",
