      "text": "If you\u2019re waiting for the last minute submission, just know that platforms have crashed. For instance, UC\u2019s system had problems last year. Just know how to manage this and what your last min options are. \n\nJust show them a plan on how you tackle the rest of your apps and check in and reassure them. That\u2019s honestly what they\u2019re looking for.  If you\u2019ve not done that, I\u2019m sure you can understand how they feel, which doesn\u2019t help your stress level. Net, manage up and solve the prob for them and for you. It\u2019s a good approach to use because when you\u2019re in the real world, that\u2019s how your manager would expect you to communicate.",

      "text": "My mom insists on it, but what's even worse is when my dad will occasionally come in and make a remark that is either totally useless or completely incorrect (my favorites so far - \"You can ED another school right?\" after November 1st, and after I'd already ED-ed Duke, and then \"You have to fill out more stuff for each school? That makes the Common App useless!\" as I was filling out the Case Western questions). He's the most frustrating because he likes to think he's super helpful but all he does is increase my anxiety. He told me I don't need to apply to safeties and shouldn't bother since they're not T20. He also frequently interrupts me while I'm chilling (after submitting an app usually, or if I'm really ahead of schedule) and comments that I should be working on the next application.",

So, she says I won\u2019t get into any of my RDs since they\u2019ll be filled in from the early rounds, so she wants me to apply to those ASAP, though it would\u2019ve violated my REA (I\u2019ve also applied to 4 public colleges, got into 3 so far).",
