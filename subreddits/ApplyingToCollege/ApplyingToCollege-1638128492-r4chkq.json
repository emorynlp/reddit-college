      "text": "a year ago i was extremely stressed about getting my EA apps in bc like all of you, I wanted to get into the \u201cschool of my dreams\u201d. Long story short, my EA/ED schools did not pull thru and I didn\u2019t get into my \u201cdream school\u201d. I was so close minded and honestly felt defeated when decisions rolled out early in the year.\n\nI am now at UCLA & even though my EA/ED schools did not pull through I am so happy and blessed to be here. Quite frankly, I think that UCLA turned out to suit me much better than I expected, almost exceeding my expectations of college life that I had expected from my \u201cdream school\u201d. I am about two months in and couldn\u2019t imagine going to another college; it\u2019s been really great and I am now just realizing that even though things didn\u2019t seem to be working out in the moment, it all happened for a reason.\n\nSeniors out there: I HOPE that things turn out the way you wanted, but if not that\u2019s OKAY! Something much better is probably in the works for you, it just takes time for you to realize.",
