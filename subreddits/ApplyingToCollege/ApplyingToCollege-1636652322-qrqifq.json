  "text": "I just reread over my Harvard EA supplemental and my dumbass left \u201c2\u201d in the essay and forgot to change it to \u201ctwo\u201d. I know this is the smallest thing ever but could this even have a tangible impact on my application? On my other essays I made sure to spell out all numbers, but this one totally didn\u2019t cross my mind I guess.",
