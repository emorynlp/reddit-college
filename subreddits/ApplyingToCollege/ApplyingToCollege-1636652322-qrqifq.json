  "text": "I just reread over my Harvard EA supplemental and my dumbass left \u201c2\u201d in the essay and forgot to change it to \u201ctwo\u201d. I know this is the smallest thing ever but could this even have a tangible impact on my application? On my other essays I made sure to spell out all numbers, but this one totally didn\u2019t cross my mind I guess.",

      "text": "I spelled my name wrong on my UVA application and still got accepted. It has no impact whatsoever ever. Colleges care more about 4 years of academics than 1 typo. If you don\u2019t get in, it won\u2019t be because of it. It also won\u2019t make or break the decision to accept you.",
