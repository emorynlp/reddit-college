  "title:": "Lowered my GPA accidentally because I stuffed my schedule so I could take some classes I like",
  "text": "So I have a 3.94 unweighted and a 4.4 weighted GPA. I took the highest courses I could for my academic courses (honors and APs), but I really wanted to take three courses being Spanish(because I was recommended to take 4 years of language), Band(I just like band), and Jazz Band(I also like jazz band). So I basically played Tetris with my schedule (taking early morning and late ending classes) to fill it with 9 classes (in a nine-period day, typically because of double period sciences and lunch it averages 5 or 6) starting sophomore year and kept doing that till senior year. Around the tail end of junior year, I realized that it caused my weighted GPA to be lower than it could be (If I didn't take those classes I could've had around 4.5 or 4.6). While I don't regret it because I really like band, there is still a bit of worry for me that it could've hurt me. Will it hurt my application, or would the colleges see that I just took more classes than usual? \n\nSorry if this is a dumb question, but I can't get the thought out of my head.",
