For all the good that used to and currently goes on, the T20 circlejerking, \u201cadvice\u201d and \u201ctough love\u201d from barely qualified adults, and general arrogance about what it allegedly means to be a \u201ctop student\u201d I have seen in the comments shows that it\u2019s obvious that this is not a place for everybody applying to college; instead it\u2019s a place for high stats individuals gunning for a T20 or T10 or HYPSM. And for literally anybody else, that\u2019s a super toxic environment to have to compare yourself with. So, to you all, I bid an adieu. Feel free to downvote but I wanted to get this off my chest before I go.",

                  "text": "Drama about user icerbergchick. She makes a post about how the essays have sucked especially much this year based off of what she\u2019s read so far. She gives advice framing how your essays are going to read by AO\u2019s and how the AO\u2019s advocate for you etc. It\u2019s so specific, I thought she was an AO. (In fact, I even remember reading the exact same scenario before, but I can\u2019t tell if she is the same OP.) In the scenario, she details as if she is an AO that reads two different applicants\u2019 essays.\n\nBut the problem is that she isn\u2019t an AO, she\u2019s just an interviewer. \n\nShe gives a lot of advice on the regular, but there\u2019s always elitism. She belittles everyone for being a teenager, meaning that they probably suck at writing (her words, not mine). She says not to get advice from your friends on essays, since they too are immature teenagers. \n\nAnother user points out this behavior, for being overly negative for no reason. Icebergchick writes this off as she\u2019s trying to get attention and it\u2019s all for A2C\u2019s sake. Another user says that iceberg chick said their essay was bad without even reading it and to rewrite it because he/she was a teenager. (Uhhh.....) \n\nNot sure if you remember this, but there was a period of time where people were shitting on college youtubers who gave advice, saying that these people don\u2019t know how they got in and are not a good source. What\u2019s to differentiate iceberg chick except the fact that she\u2019s older? I guess as an interviewer she _might_ be more connected to the admissions process, but who knows by how much? There needs to be more transparency.\n\nHonestly, I feel like she might be just doing this all just for karma. The fact that she recycled either her own post or someone else\u2019s is somewhat telling. Does she genuinely want to help people or is she just attention seeking? \n\nAt the end of the day, I think only AO\u2019s can really say what\u2019s going on behind the scenes and it probably varies per college. Her essay advice will probably help because I expect at least some essay writing skills in almost all Stanford alums, but I don\u2019t think she can give much more information than the average person.",

      "text": "I've been thinking about at the very least taking a break from here. I think getting too wrapped up in any one online community for too long can become frustrating and depressing. This goes for anywhere.\n\nI sincerely appreciate all of the people who have helped and continue to help me here, but especially in recent weeks seeing, as you said, \"tough love\" posts, has really turned me off from this community.\n\nI'm not saying tough love is a bad thing. My college counselors can really get on our (the class of 2021's) asses, and I appreciate them for that. Many times we  need to be told to stop slacking and stay on the ball.\n\nMy favorite teacher in highschool used to get onto my class and me all the time for subpar work, always pushing us to do better; but she did it in a way that was respectful to us as students, and more importantly, *human beings*. That's one of the reasons she's one of my favorite teachers, and I respect the hell out of her for that character trait to this day.\n\nBut when you become cynical, and you feel the need to start giving advice in a condescending, snobbish, and pessimistic manner, I really don't want it. I already have enough stress as it is, with covid going on, app seasons and school starting, and essays due. I don't also need to be told off from some dude on A2C. There's a way to be encouraging and tough, *without* being rude and demeaning. \n\nI'm still just a teen for heaven's sake. I need respectful yet firm direction when I'm making a mistake while trying to figure this college stuff out. I don't need to be told that all my work amounts to jackshit.",

Are you saying it to make yourself feel better or to genuinely help someone? Are you being constructive or destructive? If what you are saying is intended to insult or embarrass someone and your advice is vague or non existent then maybe reconsider. Constructive criticism, tough love, and brutal honesty are supposed to be helpful and the only intention is to help someone change something, therefore the advice is specific, detailed, actionable. Telling people that you are disturbed and disgusted by high schooler's essay topics isn't constructive. In that particular thread a lot of people asked for advice and were given vague answers (\"Assume your essays are trash\", \"You'll know when it's good\", \"Just keep writing until it's not trash\") and the OP admitted to being a dick on purpose to get people to read the post. Going for shock value is fine in a texting and driving PSA but not for college essay advice.",

Giving vague advice isn't helpful, and in many cases, is a flimsy excuse to just act rude.\n\nWith regards to IBC, I'll say this. I haven't interacted with her much, but her recent reactions to criticism and the tone of her recent posts are what I take issue with. I'm sure she's a pretty nice woman if you meet her in person, but the fact that she feels like it's appropriate for her, as an adult, to get on the internet and trash a bunch of teenagers because their essays were poor is distasteful at best, and bullying at worst.",

You can both have a childhood and be competitive for colleges\n\nStudents maybe founded a violin club and that was because they actually cared about violin.\n\nNow students are creating non profits to empower and educate the underprivileged youth of neighborhoods of color or 14 year olds bothering professors to get research experience and think colleges won't look through that bs\n\nI'm honestly scared for future applicants.\n\nI believe in just 10 years people wont give a fuck where you went for undergrad since it'll just become Highschool 2.0. \n\nWanting to go to a top college in the future will look like wanting to go to a top high school today.",

And an applicant who went to Harvard might stand out much more than someone who just went to their state school? In many ways the Harvard applicant has already proven themselves, so it's less of a gamble.\n\nAlso for some professions -- admittedly hard to attain, so maybe it's already akin to discussing a job as a pro athlete as in my above example -- doesn't it matter where you go? I've heard for finance top firms like Goldman Sachs will only hire out of Harvard, Yale, UPenn, maybe a few others.\n\nTo be clear, I really do hope it doesn't matter that much. There's a huge population of talented, hardworking students who unfortunately have not succeeded in the college admissions process. It would only be fair to them that one's undergraduate school were not of crucial importance. But, I have to be realistic. And i know for some excellent professions it may not matter, like being a doctor, you'll get that nice doctor salary no matter where you went as long as you got your MD and went thru residency and so on. (Although even then does it matter where you went to med school, if not undergrad?)",

      "text": "That why I hate the academic side of Reddit. T20? Like why? For true college advice look at community(Especially with poor grades in highschool) then go into a different university if that is the path for you. And if you have a parent who work in a college, look at their benefits. Often time that means free tuition(Not only for their college, but sometimes for other colleges with tuition exchange). Also, JUDGE the college based on what major you want, how far you want to go from home, etc etc. Don\u2019t go basing it off of what their rank on the poll is or how prestigious it is. That is just some of my own advice. One thing I hate about the AP subreddit were the memes are T20 and AP exam scores. I am going to one of the harder colleges to get into in my state(Drake university) and they do accept AP scores along with most non-T20 scores. If your school choice doesn\u2019t accept AP scores then maybe look somewhere else. It will be more financially better. Sorry for the rant",

Like I told my own kid that was fortunate to have great stats, and started to feel like she was obligated to reach a goal not set by herself, but some of her obsessively competitive peers......   Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   Find the school that is the best personal fit for YOU.  There are MANY great honors and other programs at non Top 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's ... that will provide a high caliber of education, generous scholarships and will make you just as competitive for graduate school, if not more so.   At the end of the day, you could be paying off your house when some of the most toxic people are still paying off student loans.  Good Luck!",

They\u2019re trying so hard to please someone else, and they try to convince themselves that they\u2019re pleasing themselves when everyone knows it a lie. It\u2019s an act. It\u2019s pathetic, it\u2019s sad, & it\u2019s not something you should be proud of. What\u2019s even worse? Those same people will literally shit on someone for being a B average student. Literally.",
