I\u2019d always put way too much time into studying and reading and teaching myself extra on the side. But now, I think it\u2019s alright to take a day and laugh about nonsense with friends. To drive home from work a little slower to listen to my favorite song. To let myself draw, albeit horribly. To binge a series on Netflix cause u absolutely NEED to know if Jess and Nick get back together. For me it\u2019s the small things. Just be true to yourself. \n\nIdk. If you\u2019re ever bored check out Yes Theory on YouTube. They have a great podcast too. Their message is what made the difference for me",
