  "text": "As a senior, I have slowly come to the realization that I am getting old. When I sleep, I think about my childhood. The time spent in my grandparents house eating the food they would make by hands while I sat watching cartoons. I think about the times I would jump around the couches in my house like I was Indians Jones.\n\nAs we age, we will gradually get more responsibilities. In college, we will be part of organizations where we have responsibilities; we may have relationships with people. Eventually we will have jobs and families and more responsibilities. It is just the natural part of life.\n\nBut recently i received some advice from my grandpa, that I thought was wonderful. He told me that while I may look like an adult on the outside, I should still remain a child at heart. If I want to jump around the couches in my house I should be able to. If I want to go explore abandoned warehouses with my friends I should be still able to do so ok then future. And why? Because at heart I will still be a child. So keep the child in you alive until the minute you die.",

Right now as a queer person in a highly religious household, I'm fine with the responsibility that comes with college and adulthood. Even more so I don't know if I ever associated those other stuff as childhood traits. But regardless, I still think it's a good sentiment. I still love my childhood shows. I still love that curiosity and some of that carefree innocence in life regardless of outward appearance or hardships or responsibility. There's a part of me that sometimes wishes i could go back, but I think as you grow its a good sentiment to keep the things you can throughout you can inside throughout your life",

Ill watch Disney movies, I\u2019ll build lego sets, I\u2019ll climb and go down a slide if I fit in it every once in a while. Its not about being a literal undeveloped man child, its about not letting the fact that you\u2019re an adult keep you from enjoying simple things you loved doing as a kid. Its pretty happy advice. What op meant by \u201cidentity\u201d surely alludes to how lots of people change as adults, feeling pressured to fit in to what society considers a stable adult.",

I\u2019ll take it literally if I feel like it. Good for you, but to most people, being childish is frowned upon, because there\u2019s a reason you stop being a child. It\u2019s not about stability, it\u2019s about acting your age. When I was a child, all I wanted was to stop being a child and to be able to make my own decisions, it\u2019s so stupid to tell me to be that way forever. Further, anyone who says to \u201cstay a child\u201d clearly never had to struggle with anything as a kid in order to see it as a positive time. It\u2019s not a positive time, don\u2019t be delusional.",

And for you and anyone else who had a bad childhood, you should ofc forgot what you experienced and focus on your future. But the statement I was making here was a generalized statement and one I made from advice given to me. As children everyone wanted to make their own decision but those decisions would never be good. There\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t let the child in us be the person controlling what we buy or we would be fiscally irresponsible. My only goal of this little post was to tel people that as children we loved some of the best times of our lives, times without worry, without having problems, times when (MOST) of us could enjoy our childhood. I just wanted to say in my post that keep your little child alive in you because that\u2019s what my grandpa said. I had no malice and if you feel hurt by my post or anything I said I\u2019m sorry",

I mean when I was a kid I wanted to stop talking to my emotionally abusive dad, move somewhere where I wouldn\u2019t be bullied relentlessly, be able to be socially accepted, have purpose in my life, not be dependent on people, be able to express myself, etc. None of those things you can do as a child, which is why being a child is so terrible. You cannot decide to stop dealing with other people treating you poorly, all you can do is suffer through it and imagine one day you\u2019ll be 18 and you won\u2019t have to put up with it anymore. And anyway, weren\u2019t you literally just arguing for us to be more childlike? Why is it suddenly negative when you apply that philosophy to finances? It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s a stupid concept to begin with. Anyway, the best time in my life is right now because I\u2019m the closest I\u2019ve ever been to being free. I have significantly fewer problems now than when I was a child, and my problems are so much better. This is not an uncommon sentiment. Like I stated, most people have childhood trauma. Good for you that you don\u2019t I guess but it\u2019s still close-minded of you to think childhood is so positive.",
