Most colleges have a couple of rooms just for LGBTQIA+ students. \n\nOthers get single dorms like my trans sister. \n\nOthers get housing with their specified gender (so mtf with cis females). But that also depends on the rooms available and the people there. Last thing that needs to happen is to room a trans person with a transphobe. Or have a parent sue the school because \u201cthe college is forcing my daughter to sleep with men\u201d and other transphobic bullshit. \n\nColleges try to avoid lawsuits. \n\nMy trans sister was originally going to dorm with another girl (separate rooms, shared bathroom and kitchen), but the girl\u2019s parents threw a fit. My family and the school decided single room housing would be better and safer for my sister.",

My daughter did this very thing.  \n\nIf you want gender neutral housing, or want help being matched for housing, you can contact your college Res Life or LGBT Support Organization for guidance after acceptance.\n\nFYI:  f you wish to have your preferred name and gender on your college applications, that's acceptable.  I don't know that that information is available to your high school, but the schools you applied to may contact your parents using your preferred name.  When my youngest recently suited applications, I got emails saying, \"We're so happy Youngest's Preferred Name applied!\"\n\nSome schools may consider whether you're LGBTQ+ during admissions, so it may, or may not be, something you wish to add to your application.  It's definitely a personal choice.\n\nIf you're looking for a good recommendation, my eldest is at UMass Amherst and we've found the school, students, and surrounding community to be warm and welcoming.",
