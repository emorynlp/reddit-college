  "text": "Hopefully this won\u2019t get taken down for mentioning race lol. I\u2019m just trying to talk about my friend\u2019s personal admissions story.\n\nSo my friend is black and got into Harvard REA. He was extremely excited about it obviously since getting into Harvard is like the pinnacle of success. He later started researching more about Harvard\u2019s admissions policies since he\u2019s an admissions geek, and he got really bad imposter syndrome when he found out from the Harvard lawsuit that race was the tipping point for 45% of their black students. My friend was still thrilled about Harvard obviously, but he\u2019s been kind of paranoid for the past few months about whether he could have gotten in if he was a different race. He\u2019s been feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t actually that accomplished since he read the lawsuit statistics, and he told me once that he wishes he had checked the \u201cother\u201d race box for a few RD schools to see if he could still get in.\n\nAnyway, he got into Berkeley recently, and he was pretty happy. But he realized after getting accepted that Berkeley does not take race or any other hooks into account. He was so overjoyed because now he\u2019s finally getting over his imposter syndrome and realizing that his accomplishments are actually impressive. Just these past few days, he says his confidence in himself has increased a whole lot. He\u2019s probably my only friend now that doesn\u2019t have crippling self-doubt. It\u2019s great to see that at least one of my friends is finally developing a healthy self-esteem lol.",

      "text": "My daughter feels similarly. We aren't from California but part of her motivation for applying to UC schools (Berkeley, UCSD, and UCI are on her list) is to prove to herself that she can get in. She said at a UC no one will wonder if she deserves to be there. She got some Harvard mail but I didn't get to see it because she tossed it in the recycling bin and said, \"It was just a letter congratulating me for being a minority with a high PSAT score and to keep them in mind if I want to get a rejection letter.\" She is a very high achieving student but struggles a lot with the perception that she'll only get into a good school because of her race. \n\nMeanwhile my son tells his white friends that he'll lend them his black card for college admissions as long as they lend him their white card when he drives a car.",

              "text": "Yes, we are very aware of that study. It's why my daughter made the comment she did when she saw the Harvard letter in the mail. The essentially send recruitment letters to black students who score lower on the PSAT than any other racial group but still rely on the higher test scores for admission. It's like telling people that they only need $5 to enter the amusement park but to play any games or go on any rides is an additional $500. You let the poor people in the door but they can't actually enjoy themselves. \n\nFWIW, she actually scored very well on both the PSAT and SAT. She just hates the \"please apply so we can reject you but still say we tried to reach out to underrepresented minorities\" recruitment style. Her dream school is CalTech (IIRC they are also race blind) but she says an acceptance to a UC would mean more than an acceptance to the more prestigious schools on her list due to the race factor.",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point speculating when there\u2019s no way to really determine. We have subs, forums, and tons of students debating and inquiring about whether a certain student will get in with certain conditions, and most of the time they\u2019re not super accurate.If your friend suffers from imposter syndrome again, I think the best thing to tell them would be to not get hung up upon things which will have no answer. Instead, they should just focus on succeeding at Harvard, both academically and socially. If you can leverage Harvard\u2019s resources to succeed among your peers, you 100% ought to be there. Sometimes, whether a student or not gets in can come down to if their AO is having a bad day, really likes a specific event they\u2019ve participated in, shares a sense of humor with the student, etc. It is subjective, but we don\u2019t wonder about all those instances.",

      "text": "Hey OP! I really love hearing this(the end part)!!! Every unhooked student who gets an acceptance letter got their letter for a reason. Imposter syndrome can hit hard, especially when we are surprised by our own achievements and feats from time to time. Sometimes we listen to the demons of doubt in our own minds. Worse yet, sometimes we listen to jealous or spiteful people confirm our most critical mindsets. I want your friend to know that he earned all of his successes legitimately, REGARDLESS of his race or his background. There\u2019s a reason why he got into Harvard and Berkeley, and the sad thing is that he like most of us can only speculate on what that specific reason was. One thing is certain, that an admission officer, multiple probably, had to draw his name and profile out of reading committees multiple times and present him to other AOs in the final committee. Through all pf those filters and all of those obstacles, he was chosen and deemed Harvard/ Berkeley material. At that point, it doesn\u2019t matter why he was chosen specifically, and what ifs matter even less, other than that the AOs considered him ultimately exemplary and worthy of his acceptances. Through all of the strife, he was chosen. Don\u2019t let any fools tell him otherwise. Don\u2019t let others blame their misfortunes and failures on the color of his skin, and certainly don\u2019t let those naysayers have a rent free apartment in his mind.
