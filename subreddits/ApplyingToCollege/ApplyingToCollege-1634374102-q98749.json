I know all the tests say you won\u2019t be disadvantaged but we all know that\u2019s not true. How much do you think my already scarce chances will go down? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m an international\n\nTL; DR: should an international apply to T20s without the SAT",

              "text": "Yo some more nuance here: Generally, test-optional doesn't mean test-blind. Not submitting WOULD hurt your application, compared to a candidate of the exactly same EC's as you who submits a SAT score that's, say, around 1500. It's just that these would influence HOW much it hurts\n\n* A level makes it better\n* Feeder school makes it better\n* People from your school submitting rly bad SATs makes it worse\n* Evidence of non-school academic accomplishments (olympiad) makes it better.\n\nFor example.",
