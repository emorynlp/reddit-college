I had the chance to add one mentor\u2019s letter of rec in MITs research portfolio. That leaves 1 project, where I have no space to have a letter of rec\n\nThe letter can\u2019t replace my science recommendation, my major is literally comp sci and besides MIT has detailed that they don\u2019t want to read the same information twice, so having 2 research letters in the same place seems hella redundant.",
