  "text": "wasn't sure if this was a rant or emotional support, its a rant tbh but i feel like i need some emotional aid\n\n  \ntitle basically. i don't really know if ill get into any of the schools im applying to, and i'm worrying that my college apps will be missing so much of who i am. i feel like i'm not qualified to apply to all the schools im applying to, or i have nothing that stands out or that admin officers haven't seen, and that i'll just end up disappointed because I have such high expectations of myself. I'm starting to be unable to see myself past high school, and its super annoying, esp with my first deadline coming up in a week",

      "text": "First of all, this happens to everybody so its completely normal so don't panic. The college essays should reflect your true side and not a fake one, so you should definitely improvising and putting your sweat into your essay. A college essay cannot show the full 100 percent of your liking and personality although we shall always aim to reach 100 percent which would help to improvise our essays and highlight our personality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond of all, no one can make a statement saying, \" You can't get accepted by this uni\". The person who says this is the biggest idiot you would ever meet. Till you do not get an rejection letter for the uni you are still in the game. To increase your chances of getting in, just put in the sweat and blood required and ignore all the negative people around you. You are now in the battlefield and it is too late to go back so just give it your best shot.\n\n(With that said students always apply to a safety school so that if they get rejection from everywhere they could still be safe so always apply to atleast 2 safety schools so that you do not fail)",

If so, then you have nothing to worry about.  If not, then why didn't you apply to some legitimate safeties?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>i feel like i'm not qualified to apply to all the schools im applying to\n\nAre you applying to any schools where your scores/grades are above the 75th percentile?  If so, then doesn't that somewhat objectively imply you're more qualified than roughly 75% of students at those schools?  If you aren't, then you probably should be; this may imply your safeties aren't actually safeties.",
