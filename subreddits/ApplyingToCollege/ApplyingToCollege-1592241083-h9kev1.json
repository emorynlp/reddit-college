Well Dual Credit means that you are taking college classes taught by Professors. Also, for that reason Dual Credit is better because it taught by Professors and not teachers. Well, with that said a lot of high schoolers who took AP\u2019s their senior year end up in top schools, such as BC, BU, JHU, Dartmouth, UCB. However, Dual Credit means that the person is taking college classes so getting a B or an A in that class will let Colleges know that they can handle the college pressure and accept them.",

They count them as 3 AP\u2019s with that said if my schedule this year was Chemistry, US History, Al2, English 3, Honors Microbiology, and I have taken Biology and Psychology as a Dual Credit over the summer. Then, they will know that I took AP Bio, AP Psych and the other classes. Also, Dual Credit classes tends have more work than AP because it doubles up the information that the AP classes teaches in one day. AP Biology (1 year) = College Biology (1 semester)",
