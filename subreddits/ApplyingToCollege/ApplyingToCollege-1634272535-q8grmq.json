  "text": "Sorry using a throwaway bc I forgot the password to my main. I am filling out my fafsa form and I don\u2019t know whether to indicate that I want to live on campus or at home. The college I\u2019m applying to is 40 mins away and I really want to live on campus but I\u2019m afraid that if financial aid doesn\u2019t cover all of the cost then I won\u2019t have money to pay. What should I do? Say if I change my mind after I submit the form, can I change the housing plan on the form?",
