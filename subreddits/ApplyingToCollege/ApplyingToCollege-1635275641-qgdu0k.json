  "text": "I have a friend who's biracial (black and white) and isn't sure what to mark her race as on the common app. She doesn't really identify as white and thus doesn't really want to check off white, but on the other hand she is part white. Is it fine to not check it off? Would there be any admissions related benefit derived from doing so?",

You\u2019re identifying yourself as both, which is the whole point of being BI-racial. If she wants to select solely black, that is fine, but I don\u2019t understand why America identifies biracial people as just \u201cblack\u201d. If she actually has a problem choosing one, she should choose both\u2026",
