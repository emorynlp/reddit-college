  "text": "I own a tumblr blog with 8.4K followers. I mostly repost \u201cacademia\u201d aesthetic images and text posts, especially relating to history, art, and literature. I\u2019d like to say I encourage people to have a greater appreciation for those topics. I\u2019ve posted a couple original text posts (some of which have 50k-80k notes (notes = likes + reblogs)) but none of them are particularly educational (mostly just relatable content about being a student/being a hopeless romantic LOL). Would this be a good EC? I think the numbers are impressive and it\u2019s something I find a lot of enjoyment in but I\u2019m a little hesitant because while I do put work into curating the collection of posts on  my blog, most of my blog is not original content. If I shouldn\u2019t put it that\u2019s fine, I have more than enough EC\u2019s for the Common App.",
