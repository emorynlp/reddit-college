  "text": "I graduated high school in may and was supposed to start college back in august but I hesitated because of my poor decision making skills. Life has been a lot lately and I believe for now I will need to do online community college. As of right now, I plan to transfer to a university to finish a bachelors, masters, maybe doctorate depending on the path I choose. How does that work? Do I have to do a pre major designed for this? And if not, do I have to complete the bachelors in the same major i picked for community college? Or can I complete an associates and transfer my generals to a university to complete courses for a different major, leaving me with a bachelors and an associates in a similar but different subject? And can I tranfer to a university out of state doing any of that?",

      "text": "If you attend CC you will be applying to the 4Y school as a transfer student, IIRC.  The most important things you want to do are:\n\n1. Get strong grades in your CC classes.  The stronger the better.\n2. Pick classes that you \\*know\\* will transfer to whichever set of 4Y schools you eventually want to transfer to.\n\nYou \\*can\\* complete an associate's degree, but it isn't necessary in order to transfer to a 4Y school.\n\nIf you  \\*know\\* you will transfer to a 4Y then you mostly want to knock out general education classes, since schools are generally less willing to let you satisfy major requirements with transfer credit.  That carries some risk, though- if you take a bunch of random gen. ed. classes at CC and then don't actually transfer to a 4Y school and get a degree, then your efforts at CC were largely wasted.\n\nAlso be aware that most 4Y schools have a requirement that some minimum # of courses must be taken \"in residence\" before they'll grant you a degree.  Usually it's 4 full semesters.  However, some majors have a prerequisite structure (A requires B, B requires C, C requires D, etc.) that makes it so you can't actually finish the degree in 4 semesters.",

              "text": ">So I should be checking out the required courses for my major options and see where they align?\n\nMostly you want to make sure that any class you take at CC will convert to credit at the 4Y school you want to eventually get your degree from.  Sometimes they will have a list you can consult; sometimes you have to petition them and it's not straightforward.  Like if you're attending some small CC in Wyoming and try to transfer that credit to the University of Florida, they're not going to have a ready-made one-to-one mapping of that CC's courses to their courses.\n\nIn terms of your eventual major, you may actually want to \\*avoid\\* taking classes at CC in your eventual major area (beyond maybe the intro class), since the 4Y school may not let you apply those credits to your 4Y degree requirements.  It all depends on what the 4Y school will accept and allow in terms of transfer credit.\n\n>And when you were talking about resident courses, will that affect my plan to do a year round schedule?\n\nIt shouldn't.  The 4Y school usually doesn't care whether you meet its \"in residence\" requirement by taking courses in the Spring/Fall or during the summer.  The main thing is that you take them at that particular school.\n\nAt the school I attended there were two summer terms and you could take up to two courses per term.  So, if you took both, you could knock out 4 credits over the summer.  A normal load during Fall (or Spring) was 5 credits  (15 credit hours).",
