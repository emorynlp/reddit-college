Like any other school you\u2019ll find different types of people if that\u2019s not your vibe, but it definitely is pretty prevalent. I think you actively have to seek out people at the other 5cs to make friends outside of your college. If you don\u2019t look for it you most likely won\u2019t find it. That being said most people have one class per semester at another campus so if you want to find friends at other colleges it\u2019s definitely possible and I know a lot of people who\u2019s friend groups are at other schools.",

Pretty much every class youre in the people will be actively listening and taking notes (some intro classes and some bigger classes are the exception) \nI\u2019ve gotten into talks with people about parties about their random academic passions a lot. It\u2019s really cool.\nThe only thing is that people are really interested in specific topics (usually gov law or Econ) but if you go over to other schools they\u2019ll be interested in other things (like Harvey mudd is math and cs)",

We all go to each other\u2019s events and it\u2019s generally pretty easy to get classes on other campuses (although Harvey mudd generally requires a bit more effort to get into classes.) during Covid we can\u2019t eat at the other campuses but usually we\u2019re pretty much given access to whatever Is happening (events food activities) at the other colleges. It pretty much feels like one big campus because sometimes you can\u2019t even tell where one campus is and the other begins. That being said most of the students tend to keep friend groups within their own colleges and some scholarships or talks are only for the students that attend that college.",

This means that people won\u2019t leave their friends or do anything to avoid getting in trouble which makes everything feel safer. We also have a party budget because of some of our frat bro donors. Because of this we have really weird fun parties every now and then like Mckenna Pallooza where they bring a bunch of those huge jumpy slides and bounce houses to the field for a huge day party.\n\nThat being said You won\u2019t get crazy ragers like in a big school, and sometimes the party vibe can feel a bit repetitive. But there\u2019s consistently something going on on thurs. and Saturday\u2019s  and usually its a whole school thing. I\u2019d say its super fun as an underclassman and then less fun as an upperclassman.",
