I have a lot of interest in hard sciences still, but when it came down to it, problem sets are not my preferred way of learning. I didn't enjoy the labs much, either. They took me a lot of time and effort and I enjoyed only around 10% of the work I did in physics-related classes. In comparison, the work I do for psych classes (reading/taking notes, designing labs, writing papers, group projects) is a lot more fun.\n\nSomething a lot of high-achievers don't realize is that being \"the best\" at something is not that meaningful a goal in itself. You can contribute to highly meaningful work without literally being the fastest, taking the most classes, or graduating the earliest. Heck, people who have unusual backgrounds in fields tend to be pretty interesting.\n\nAnyway, it took me about a year and a half of college to figure out what I wanted to major in, and there's still plenty of time to graduate with my degree, so don't overthink it too much. If you enjoy STEM, liking the subject will give you much more motivation and matter more in the future than your \"talent\" for it. Sure, there are some subjects that people are REALLY not oriented toward majoring in regardless of how much they like them, but this is uncommon. STEM is hard! Everyone struggles in it from time to time. Remember your goal is to learn and enjoy yourself, not to avoid struggling.\n\nBut if deep down you're like me and thinking of majoring in STEM because you're worried you won't be respected otherwise, don't worry about it. Major in that thing you genuinely enjoy, because you're likely to do better at it.\n\nYou may also enjoy the writing of Amy Nguyen, who writes about attitudes toward women in STEM (tech, specifically,) in a way I found comforting: \n\n1.
