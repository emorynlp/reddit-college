  "text": "for some reason i take a lot pride in the title women in stem but i\u2019m also not that good at stem classes?? i\u2019m planning on majoring in something stem related right now, but it\u2019s just a little discouraging because it doesn\u2019t seem worth if i\u2019m not good at it?? maybe i\u2019m overthinking it but it feels like i\u2019m trying to prove something and right now it feels like nothing matters but also the world is about to end and i\u2019m really behind on my essays and it\u2019s stressing me out. i guess the biggest thing frustrating me right now is how nothing really matters and how nothing is that fun anymore??? i\u2019m also a little disappointed in the way my senior year is going and my friends haven\u2019t been the most supportive regarding my worries and i just feel like there\u2019s tv static going off in my brain all the time. anyways, i know a lot of people are also very stressed right now so peace and love to all of you<3",
