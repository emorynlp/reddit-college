  "text": "Two schools I\u2019m applying to require manual input of \u201ccourse & grades\u201d on the Common App\n\nI\u2019m inputting my classes and all is fine, but it won\u2019t let me log in a college class I took last year? There\u2019s literally no college class option even there.\n\nIn 11th grade I couldn\u2019t take AP Calc at my school because of scheduling conflicts, so I took an identical class at community college but it wasn\u2019t \u201cdual enrollment\u201d because the course wasn\u2019t affiliated with my high school at all. \n\nDoes this mean AOs won\u2019t see my math class? How can I report it??",
