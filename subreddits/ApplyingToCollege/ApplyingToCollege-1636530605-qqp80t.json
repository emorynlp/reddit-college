  "text": "Hey A2C!\n\nThis post is ideally going to be first in a series where I'll shout-out some schools that get a lot of attention. If you haven't heard of me yet, I'm bigferns, someone you'd recognize if you were on the ApplyingtoCollege discord server (I really recommend it, the people there are great). To start, lets take a look at seven colleges, six research institutions and one liberal arts college.\n\n# Methodology\n\nThis is a bit important, being an introductory post and all, so let's get some things out of the way. To qualify for these lists, the school has to be both (1) **Realistic for people with 3.0-3.6 GPAs,** and (2) **Generally overlooked by the subreddit.** I focus more heavily on the first criteria than the second, because this subreddit has over 500,000 members. If I'm the second person to bring up a certain school, I won't be too upset ;). Without further ado, let's get started!\n\n**University at Buffalo***Buffalo-Niagara, Buffalo, New York, acceptance rate of 61%*\n\nKnown by a few different names, most notably SUNY Buffalo and the University at Buffalo, this school's probably one of the best option if you're a New York, Ohio, or New Jersey student looking for a school that's affordable, close to home, and well-known. Being the only school in the SUNY system to offer architecture and law degrees, the school is great for people looking for a less competitive environment to get into major careers. Buffalo-Niagara is a great area to live in, and is inclusive to people of a wide range of backgrounds.  For domestic students with higher GPAs (the 3.8+ range), admission to the Honors College and receiving a scholarship equivalent to the cost of attendance may be good reason to add these to your list.\n\n**Missouri State University**\n\n*Springfield, Missouri, acceptance rate of 71.1%*\n\nMissouri State is a school I see get some love on this subreddit, but I think it's still worth mentioning for the sake of pointing out how some of their merit-based scholarships can make them a really good option for domestic students who need financial aid that need-based options don't cover. Their merit-based scholarship options should definitely be researched further on your own, but notable ones include $1,000 - $5,500 for high GPA and standardized test scores, and having out-of-state tuition covered if you have a 3.25 GPA *or* 1160 SAT score, and are not already a Missouri resident. These scholarships can also be combined, meaning there's potential to have your full cost of attendance covered. MSU is a pretty good choice if you're already used to Southern America and wouldn't mind some of the cultural differences that come from it being in a relatively rural area of the US.\n\n**University of Illinois at Chicago**\n\n*Near West Side, Chicago, Illinois, acceptance rate of 73%*\n\nPerhaps the school that gets the toughest go here, UIC is less popular than it's sister school at Urbana-Champaign, and the famous University of Chicago. However, if neither of these schools are appealing to you, UIC is a great choice. Located in the Near West Side, it offers a diverse campus that shows the spectrum of American history, though some of this history, especially Little Italy, has been consumed by the construction and expansion of the college. Unlike the previous two options, scholarships aren't incredibly impressive, though they still do a lot to lower the cost of attendance, their names aren't very eye-catching. The UIC Honors College is also a bit competitive, so I wouldn't take it as a given. All in all, it's not a school to be overlooked, especially if Chicago is somewhere you can see yourself living in even if UChicago doesn't work out.\n\n**San Francisco State University**\n\n*San Francisco, California, acceptance rate of 67.3%*\n\nIn the lesser-known of two California State systems, San Francisco State University is an appealing option for students in the bay who want to commute to school, pursue an education close to home, or just anyone who plans on living in the area for their post-college life. Scholarship opportunities are largely self-help, with their own application portal instead of the automatic consideration system used by some other schools. I probably don't have to sell the city of San Francisco to you, which means we can focus on some of their alumni, most notably Yvonne Cagle, a retired NASA astronaut who completed her pre-medical education at SFSU.\n\n**University of Texas at Dallas**\n\n*Dallas, Texas, acceptance rate of 78.6%*\n\nAnother school that's overlooked because it has more notable sister schools, UT Dallas offers some of the world's best value in terms of cost of attendance. Whether you are in-state or out of state, their National Merit Finalist offer, which gives full cost of attendance for a four year degree, is incredible. For students pursuing pre-medical, pre-law, or similar fields, this can be a major boost, allowing you to complete your bachelor degree at no cost to you. Dallas is a culturally robust city, and Texas is a massive state, meaning that no matter where you're from, there's a way to feel at home.\n\n**University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa**\n\n*M\u0101noa, Honolulu, Hawai'i, acceptance rate of 58%*\n\nThis one might be a bit controversial, as the pandemic has exposed issues surrounding Hawaii's presence in America's culture as a \"tourism colony\", where mainland Americans flood the local infrastructure during vacation season, damaging local wildlife, culture, and history, so for the sake of respecting the heaviness of the situation, I will focus on Hawaiian residents for this section.  The University of Hawai'i handles it's financial aid system differently than other state universities. You will handle your aid, and apply for scholarships, through the [University of Hawaii system](https://hawaii.edu) portal, instead of through the campus you wish to attend. Notable scholarships include the competitive Kua\u02bbana scholarship, which covers full tuition for native Hawai'ians.\n\n**Morehouse College**\n\n*Ashview Heights, Atlanta, Georgia, acceptance rate of 100%*\n\n*Morehouse is a Historically Black College, serving an African American student base.*\n\nMorehouse is an unique school, being a liberal arts college, accepting only assigned male at birth and transgender men, and being an HBCU, the school has a unique place in American culture. It's inclusion on this list has a lot to do with what it's students go on to achieve. Martin Luther King Jr. graduated from Morehouse, and the school is considered a feeder for black men who wish to pursue a graduate degree at Harvard's Law and Business Schools. The school is best for black men who wish to pursue a graduate education at a different institution, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, which is affiliated with, but no longer part of, Morehouse.",
