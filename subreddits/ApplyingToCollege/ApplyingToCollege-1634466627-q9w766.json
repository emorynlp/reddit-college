  "text": "So, our school doesn't have any official ranking or GPA. I had taken the most rigorous course load possible in our school for the past four years and got the highest attainable grade every time. I would have had a perfect UW GPA and my class rank most probably would have been 1 too (I'm saying this as we compare school transcripts during results day but then again, there's no official ranking). \n\nMy guidance counselor will probably mention that I had taken the maximum courses possible, but I have no idea if she's going to state that I would have been 1st in class if there was a ranking, though I'm sure she'll mention that I was ONE of the top students.\n\nSo as I cannot officially report class rank and GPA, will this put me at a disadvantage?",
