  "title:": "Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of a merit scholarship after I've applied?",
  "text": "Hey guys, I don't usually post on here and I don't know if I'm desperate for asking this. My grades in high school weren't particularly impressive: 3.73 GPA taking all of the hardest classes available in my school and a 1410 SAT. With that being said I feel my extracurriculars are pretty unique and quite strong, and that most of my essays are very well written, especially the supplemental for one school. I've demonstrated a lot of interest in the schools (especially the one with a strong supplemental) I'm applying to, and am visiting some of them next week. Is there anything more I can do to increase my chances of winning a merit scholarship or am I just screwed because of my GPA and stats? Please be brutally honest and thanks in advance.\n\nSIDE NOTE: Two of the schools are private catholic and rank top 30s and top 60s respectively if that matters (you can probably guess what colleges they are from that).",

      "text": "For merit, BC only has the Gabelli presidential full tuition scholarship, to around 15 students or so. That is very very tough to get. They use that to lure students who are bound for Ivies, etc. Check their need-based aid with the Net Price Calculator. It'll be a reach for admission for you.\n\nTop 60s (SCU/LMU-ish) will have more merit options - see if you can get a *merit* estimate from their Net Price Calculators even if you already know you won't be eligible for need-based aid. Though it may not be accurate, it's worth at least checking out - they have included a merit estimate in the past.",
