For applying to med school, you want to graduate with as little debt as possible, have some research and/or hospital based experiences, make high grades, get strong letters of recommendation, and get a \u00a0high MCAT score. \n\nBe sure to check into the school\u2019s med school acceptance rates. Ask whether they support all med applications or not. Some will just support their top students making their rates higher, so you need to be able to do comparisons about rates. \n\nAsk about opportunities to do research with professors and not just wash bottles. And think about and ask about ease of access for shadowing doctors. \n\nLook for colleges where students can build good relationships with their professors so that you can get strong letters of recommendation. Often, liberal arts colleges will work best for what you\u2019re looking for if you can make them work financially for you. \n\nNotes about major from UT Houston McGovern Medical School:\n\n\u201cThe study of medicine is based upon science, so the medical student must be a capable student of science. Therefore, majors in the scientific disciplines such as, but not limited to, chemistry, biology, and physics are satisfactory.\n\nA liberal arts education is an excellent basis for a medical career. Accordingly, applicants may have majored in such areas as classics, languages, history, English literature, belles letters, music, or philosophy, provided the specific scientific requirements listed below are fulfilled. All applicants are expected to be well educated and able to demonstrate the intellectual interests associated with entry into a learned profession.\u201d",

      "text": "Avoid Georgia Tech if you are planning to apply to Med School. Yes, there is a pre-med program there but being a Tech focused school, GT has a tendency to be on the harder side when compared to other schools. There are students who do it. But in my opinion, it would be better to save your efforts to do something more relevant (research, volunteering etc.)",
