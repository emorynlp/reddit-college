  "text": "I have a lot of thoughts about this movie. Not sure what they are, but give it a watch. It\u2019s on Netflix \n\nIt\u2019s a very *interesting* movie about cheating on the STIC which I think is just the movie\u2019s version of the SAT. The lengths people will go\u2026\n\nAnd it\u2019s apparently based on a true story I guess *spooky*\n\nI thought this sub would get a kick out of the movie so please watch and discuss",
