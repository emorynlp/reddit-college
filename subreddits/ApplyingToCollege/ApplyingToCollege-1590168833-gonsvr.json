  "title:": "[Opinion] The SAT is the most fair part of admissions besides LOR",
  "text": "So as soon as the UCs decided to phase out the SAT I saw a lot of posts pop up complaining about how GPA or ECs are more unfair than taking a standardized test.\n\nIn today's era there are so many free resources you can take advantage of, I've seen people recommend Khan Academy over all other forms of test prep. The CB also offer fee waivers to low income families for the SAT.\n\nA lot of people who mention SAT tutors seem to forget that actual tutors are a thing as well. Beyond that, while a grade is able to be changed months after a class was taken, an SAT score is tamper proof.\n\nAlso, while SAT or ACT testing centers are held pretty much everywhere, the same can't be said for great ECs. Many are dependant on location, connections, or being able to pay for the expensive activities. It's hard to win a national competition if you can't afford to attend.\n\nEven LORs benefit wealthy students. Many of my first gen friends didn't know about their importance until they started on the common app, so they were unable to lay the groundwork with a teacher in the spring.\n\nOverall, the college admissions system is heavily in favor of the wealthy, so it feels odd to vilify the test that you could walk in and ace in one shot, instead of the activities that require constant deposits of both time and money that low income students just don't have.",

Campuses adjust for socioeconomic differences and admit disadvantaged students with lower test scores compared with more advantaged peers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That report was backed by the Senate assembly, made up of faculty leaders and campus representatives, on a 51-0 vote.\n\nThe same report found that the SAT has strong predictive validity and is not biased. The task force recommended against going test-optional as it may have \"significant, unanticipated, and undesirable effects on the profile of matriculating classes.\"\n\nLess than 3 months later, the Board of Regents announces they are phasing out the SAT/ACT against the advice of their own task force.",

That\u2019s because students can boost their GPA with extra points from Advanced Placement courses, which are more readily available at affluent schools, said the campus diversity and equity committee.\n\nWealthy kids continue to outscore lower income students. That is why school should/will consider outside factors. You don't compare the SAT score of a student with parents making $200,000 a year to a student with parents making under $20,000 a year. You use it as one part in comparing students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. That way Low Income Freddie's SAT score of a 1260 isn't compared to High Income Troy's SAT score of a 1590. \n\nThe wealthy have tons of advantages all throughout the college process. Better neighborhoods as opposed to dangerous neighborhoods means not being woken up in the middle of the night to police sirens and helicopters. Better schools mean more opportunities for extracurriculars, so High Income Troy can play basketball for his school and fence for his local club, compete in Model UN and go to nationals, and hold leadership positions on the debate team, robotics club, and National Honor Society while Low Income Freddie has to go to work after school. High Income Troy's good school also provides numerous AP classes, while Low Income Freddie's school doesn't have enough student interest to justify more AP courses and the ones that they do have are taught by unqualified teachers. If High Income Troy realizes that he's in danger of getting a B he can go see his teacher after school for some extra help, but Low Income Freddie can't stay after school every time he does bad on a quiz because he has to go to work. \n\nIt's not a fair process and the SATs have their own issues, but those can be mitigated when you consider them as part of a larger picture. GPAs, APs, and ECs are just more acronyms that benefit wealthy students.",

I am a low-income student in a rural town and believe me, Khan Academy isn't any good when you have a bad education in the first place. When you're low income, you don't have the correct foundations to ace the test. Yes, you can practice all you want but without good foundations, you will never score 1600. You say SAT can be an advantage to low-income students, I don't see how when they don't have good quality teachers.\n\nAbout the extracurriculars, most admission offices understand that you obviously won't have fancy and expensive extracurriculars but still, you can have a job AND extracurriculars if you put the effort. Students by law are required to work a max of 20 hr per week, which leaves plenty of time for one or two clubs. You can also volunteer 3-4 hours per week at your local hospital. As a low income, you won't have national recognition but it doesn't;t mean you can't impact your community (and that's what most colleges are looking for)",

And that's assuming their school even has the resources to offer valuable extracurriculars. Sure your part-time job at McDonalds and Photography Club after school looks nice (if you could even manage that), but is that really going to stack up against someone with internships, lab work, and tons of clubs?\n\nLike I said, the SAT does favor wealthier kids, but there are free resources available that can give low income kids a chance. There's no equivalent for extracurriculars and academics that could potentially put you on the same playing field as a wealthier student. I like to believe most students at least have basic literacy and math skills to manage at least an 1100 with practice. But chances are if your education was so bad that you don't even have the foundations for the SAT, then your GPA and extracurriculars are going to be shot too.",

But we can\u2019t guess at the experiences of rich people vs poor people, as that is inherently unfair.  You don\u2019t judge someone\u2019s achievement based on assumptions you make about their life.  A child of a single dad who is rich may have experienced much more difficulty in getting support than an ordinary or poorer person with both parents there.  there are so many little details that we can never make sure everything is \u201cfair.\u201d it\u2019s impossible. but the SAT is about as damn close as we can get, as it\u2019s all objective questions of basic english and mathematical skills that can easily be practiced.  \n\nAssuming that a wealthy person didn\u2019t work as hard for their achievement is stupid. Yes, maybe they had more resources, but it still takes a lot of effort to achieve greatly.  It\u2019s insulting to view high achieving rich people as less hardworking just because they had some advantages. the same way it\u2019s insulting to view poorer people as less hardworking just because they are poor. \n\nthe SAT is expensive for what it is, but it\u2019s not ridiculous by any stretch. 1 minimum wage shift would pay for the SAT. if finances are really that tight, there are few waivers and i know people who said they aren\u2019t that hard to access.",

Not having to work part-time)\n\n\u2022 Money to retake the test\n\nWhich are principally wealth-related factors. The same goes to when you measure another inequality problems, such as ECs (you didn't go to a good school with good clubs, etc). And even those personal problems you mentioned are more prevalent in low-income communities (single-parenting, crime, etc).\nLike, we can get behind the idea that in a case-to-case basis, y'all can agree that everyone has a different experience regarding personal disadvantages, but ignoring the effect that the SAT/ACT may have in the low-income communities as a whole is straight-up irresponsible. We cannot ignore these effects just because there is a minority in the upper classes that experienced difficulty; the inequality is still there, and is still unjust. Hard-working low-income/middle class students with the same capacity as their upper class counterparts are still more likely to get lower SAT scores due to all these wealth related factors.\n\nAnd look, I would get behind the idea of SAT being the principal tool to solve this inequality (after all, I think tests are the most accessible method to measure knowledge), however, this cannot come without a full holistic evaluation of one's context as a student, and a redesign of the test to be as accessible as possible. In other words, the Universities must make sure that the students' socioeconomic conditions are taken into account such that fair comparisons are being made.\nBut, this is not always the case...",

I honestly say (though it's a subjective statement) that the SAT does not measure academic preparation in the context of the student education. Studying for the SAT always seemed to be about learning tricks for the test than actually demonstrating knowledge. While the United States has this system, most countries do something different, measuring through tests (be it Abitur, A-Levels, Gaokao, Suneung, etc) advanced student knowledge in multiple subjects, which combined with a holistic evaluation of the student context, may serve as a more accurate system. Of course, this may create more problems: (1) there is a  different standard of learning in different schools in the US (some schools have AP, some don't), and (2) it may result in the creation of test culture.\nThere has to be some change in the system, and for me, as far as it goes, the use of the SAT may not be the problem itself but a symptom of a much bigger problem in High School education in the US.",

Cambridge STEM interviews, for example, have applicants attempt math problems in front of interviewers. by specializing earlier, admissions offices can feel comfortable in asking applicants to do this and get firsthand academic impressions.  as for problem (1), i think this highlights a problem in the mindset of americans: in other countries, many schools are worse than others, and yet everyone is okay with their test systems despite the inequality. for some reason, americans can\u2019t get over the fact that not everything can be perfectly equal.  the other issue in america is that our country is so large that it\u2019s impossible to tighten up academic standards as consistently as other countries, which are 10-20% or less of our size.  no system is perfect.",

At least in my school (where the Math and Science-related clubs are really bad), most people that get into T20 generally stack hundreds of leadership positions and create community projects; I've never heard if anyone that got because of proficiency in the subject per se, and that's understandable, basically 5 schools win everything in my state.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really get the point that you're making here about EC's. You are saying that a good student in a bad school would probably not be selected in a more competitive high school, however, that is not the point.  The point is, if you have a student that has the ability to get into the team given the proper education and opportunities, but that student goes to a worse, less funded school, he will be in an unfair disadvantage as his preparation would not let him compete. I can give you the example of my state, where the best private school has tutors for Math competitions and one of the strongest teams has a specialized class dedicated only for competitions. There are plenty of smart people in the whole state, but only a few get such good resources to prepare. And it does make a difference. Those smart people who go to low-income High Schools are in a disadvantage; were you to give them the same education and resources and they would get as far as their privileged counterparts. And you may argue that being the best from a low-income school may be good as they evaluate your context. But the difference is, there are hundreds of students in leadership positions with community projects. And the same happens with every EC you can find, where mostly a few schools win everything.\n\nSo, add up everything. The poor student who could have gotten a 1550 got a 1450; the student that could have been Top 10 regional now barely enters in the Top 50; the simplest thing he may have going for him is his 4.0 GPA, and even then it could still add none as the grades are inflated everywhere and his classes may have been not as rigorous. It does make a difference.",

Now what do we use to establish a filtration criteria for merit scholarships? GPA means wildly different things at different schools; any school could intentionally inflate GPA, and poorer ordinary schools are also easier to earn an A at compared to a competitive public magnet school or just other public schools that are more academically rigorous, which would defeat the purpose of going to a good school.  Like someone else already said, extracurriculars are much less available at poorer schools, and they also don\u2019t relate to academic achievement. Rec letters can be fluffed up and rich schools have better teachers to be rec writers. So then we circle back to the root problem of inequality, except now we don\u2019t have the SAT as the single objective academic measure that everyone has to take.\n\nbut at the same time, the SAT isn\u2019t some unconquerable beast. Many people i know are middle class or below and easily crack 1400 on their first try. anyone could spend time studying to get a good score. in my opinion, the SAT gives poorer people the best opportunity to show off their academic superiority.  i hate the idea of the SAT and the monopoly that College Board has on educational opportunity through the administration of a 2-dimensional test, but i can\u2019t think of an alternative that is better for disadvantaged students.",

Not to mention that often times higher income kids can basically buy a 4.0 by paying to enroll at a an easy private school, or by having powerful parents within a school or district to ensure teachers grade them more easily. With the SAT, the advantages that wealty kids have is still a problem, but I'd argue still much less than that of measuring academic excellence thru GPA.",

We started talking about college last summer (we\u2019re about to graduate) and she brought up the fact that a TON of her classmates use any advantage they can. They will get their doctors to sign notes so they can take the SAT/ACT over two days instead of one, when they have never had any previous need to have extended time. They can obviously afford much better tutoring - while Khan Academy is great (I think they made it personalize to your needs!), it can\u2019t be as specialized as an in-person tutor who caters to your every need. My friend mentioned that these people can do fine in their regular classes and get good grades, but look at these exams as the last thing they need to check off to go to an elite school (most of them end up at T20s). So they take any advantage they can.\n\nMost of my friends at my high school can\u2019t afford tutoring, let alone bribing their doctors into giving them extended time. The best free resources our school can offer is the PSAT, fee waivers (only for kids on free/reduced lunch and only up to four waivers), Khan Academy, and old torn up SAT/ACT books that people donate to the library. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these can drastically improve a persons chances of improving their score, but I think it pales in comparison to what my friends classmates can afford. \n\nI don\u2019t even go to a school in the middle of nowhere - it\u2019s a top (public) school in nyc. But at public schools, almost no one can afford to pull this stuff off. Before my friend told me all of this, I thoroughly believed the college blues scandal was an outlier. It is not, this type of gaming the system is much more rampant than I expected.",

The purpose of the test is to give a general ballpark estimate of a student's aptitude, and taking it once is enough.\n\nI did take the SAT twice, the first time after no studying and the second time after 6 months of 2 hours a week super expensive prep. My score increased by 20 points. In retrospect, I really regret wasting my efforts and my parents' money on that, I was just slightly neurotic and overly sensitive about not having made the cutoff to be a National Merit Semifinalist. \n\nMy expensive prep did nothing for me, and neither did taking the test twice. On the other hand, I know people who came from low-income backgrounds, who were able to demonstrate their aptitude on the tests, and get into some really good schools.",

But as an SAT tutor for rich kids, here are some ways their wealth benefits them on standardized testing:\n-Academic support: private school kids can take the SAT in/after school, so they get time off homework and other stresses to take it. All of their focus goes toward the test, and many teachers and classes lead up to the SAT throughout the year. One school in Cumberland, RI (near me, I tutor for them) has all juniors sign up to take the same SAT so they can prepare for it. It is an extremely costly school.\n-Personalized tutoring: the company I tutor for has tiers. There\u2019s group tutoring and classes, which are cheapest but still expensive. Then, there\u2019s personalized tutoring, which is priced for only rich kids to buy. We spend months going over each section of the test in detail, doing countless practice exams and tailoring the questions/feedback they get to enhance their performance. This, I can promise, is 100x better preparation than any book.\n-Extra time: Many rich kids I know have bought 504 exceptions, so they get extra time for having ADHD, when few of them actually have it. It\u2019s so hard to expose as fake when it\u2019s a literal medical diagnosis, but so many more kids at private schools have ADHD than at public schools, and there\u2019s a reason for it: extra time on tests.\nThere are some other ways, too; check out https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/03/rich-students-get-better-sat-scores-heres-why.html .",

I always appreciate those on heated and controversial topics.\n\nI will give you my experience to say why I disagree with what you've said. Obviously, I am not saying that my experience is reflective of everyone, just that, in my case, those additional factors barely made a difference in my score.\n\nI took the SAT twice, once with almost no preparation and no extra time. I took it again, after 6 months of super expensive weekly prep tutoring and with extra time (due to a partial blindness). My score increased by 20 points. I think the factors you listed barely make a difference in SAT score. And the purpose of the SAT is not to distinguish between a 1520 and a 1530, but to give a general ballpark estimate of a student's aptitude. From the people I know, I think it does this very well. In my opinion, standardized testing is super important in allowing lower-income students, and all students in general, to demonstrate their brightness. If it weren't for standardized testing, there would be absolutely no metric for admission offices to compare students across different schools, and that would be disastrous.",

From them, I learned about how SAT score inflation happened in their high schools so that they had regional averages in the 1400s.  \n  \nIn many ways, I think you exactly show how SATs are biased. You spend 6 months and could only increase your score by 20 points. If you had the best SAT tutors, I would like to bet that you could have increased your score significantly more than that. The SAT is a tricky test in a way and I think everyone who didn\u2019t already score in the 1500s can do significantly better after more practice and prep.  \n  \nTo be honest though, college admissions are such a crapshoot because there is NO way to tell college preparedness from SAT or GPA. I cannot count the number of 1500+ 4.0 GPA people at my state school who are not doing super well right now. I think that essay can often be the best way to tell who a person is.  \n  \nI didn\u2019t have a lot of money when I was in high school and I can tell you that my GPA was the thing that was easiest to get higher. SAT prep did not even cross my mind at the time because I didn\u2019t even know it was a thing. I just knew, \u201cwell I think I need to get as high of a GPA as I can\u201d and I did that. My essay was horrible, my SATs were fairly, and my GPA was excellent. Still, I was not ready for college when I sent my application in.  \n  \nI ended up getting into a top CS program one year later and the biggest difference was my essay. You couldn\u2019t tell any maturity  change if you just looked at my grades, but the essays were night and day.",

It does not test for time management or work ethic, the components I believe make the biggest difference in college success. Really smart students who did amazing in high school and move on to college can get intimidated or have struggle on their own, and have trouble focusing and succeeding. But I do think the SAT does test fairly well for logical thinking, ability to understand writing, and aptitude. \n\nAlso, I am a little confused about what you mean when you say \"SAT score inflation\"? The SAT is graded the same, no matter what region you are from. Could it just be that the students in those regions are, on average, really smart students? \n\nI don't have much of an opinion on the essays. They were a PAIN to write (for me at least), but I understand why college admissions officers would want to read something written by the student. Personally, I always thought that the influence of income level was bigger in essay quality than SAT score. Wealthy people can hire college admissions counselors who help them brainstorm, write, and refine their essays, and have enough experience to know what an admissions committee likes to see. On the other hand, my example was meant to show that even my super expensive (\"elite\") SAT prep didn't do much for my score. But your anecdote seems to prove otherwise, and I see your perspective. \n\nAnyways, I'm really happy to hear that you got into a top CS program, congrats!!",

In my local \"inner city,\" up to 50% of families (based on somewhat recent surveys) don't actually have internet or reliable internet access at their house, which makes studying with resources such as Khan academy somewhat difficult. While there are books available for purchase, that typically isn't high on someone's priority list if they have to live meal to meal. (Many take on multiple part-time jobs on top of studying and ECs.) Furthermore, it's not enough just to say there are resources available. A lot of kids need guidance on preparing, so just having a practice test and answer key isn't enough.\n\nNot to mention that preparing for the SAT starts way earlier than in high school. Students who were not taught well enough early on might have passed their classes, but still struggle with reading comprehension or mathematical skills that while you might seem easy, is something that they have simply never seen before because the school systems they grew up in never expected them to be able to do. Some minorities don't even speak English as their native tongue, making it unfair for them to be expected to perform as well on reading comp. and grammar as other kids (and it's just harder for them to keep up in class in general)\n\nThese are just some of the reasons why you can't just say \"there is Khan academy,\" therefore SAT is very fair.

Not only that, but I have an extremely hard time concentrating on homework and busy work. I've always been smart (PSAT 8/9 missed 3 questions and a few more on PSAT 10 after an all nighter to finish an essay), but maintaining the repetitive act of doing busy homework that doesn't serve me in the slightest is harder than the vast majority of things. \n\nI got tested for ADHD/ADD and all my teachers love me as a person but im not the greatest at doing easy work with a time commitment (procrastination, lack of motivation, and being able to barely spend 5 minutes on something unless my mind is being somewhat stimulated). My doctors just gave a sheet of paper for teachers to check off certain aspects of how I work, but teachers don't see the struggle I have doing easy things. It all feels so meaningless. If I were to die tomorrow, for example, none of that would matter. All the homework I did in my life and all the tests I took wouldn't matter, only the impact I had on people and relationships with them would. \n\nAnyways that aside, all my teachers put in a really good word for me on the checklists despite me failing almost every class (except 1 without any busy homework, which I passed with a 98%), so I wasn't able to get the diagnosis I definitely needed.\n\nMy cumulative GPA is ruined, but as a standardized test taker, I know I could get perfect scores on the SAT and ACT if I just practiced for a few days. Those two exams were what I was heavily relying on to makeup for my falling grades from past years along with the grades I get this year on my 6 AP classes and 1 college level advanced course taken on a different campus this year.",

Having time to study hard requires a significant out of free time that a low income student might not have. Khan Academy requires significant internet access which not every American has, and many low income families share a computer between the kids and the adults or can\u2019t afford personal computers at all. The public transportation system in America is horribly ineffective so getting to the library to get prep books can be out of reach for busy low income teens whose parents don\u2019t have a car. Schools aren\u2019t funded the same so assuming very low income has up to date SAT prep books just isn\u2019t realistic. If getting a good score was as simple as you say there wouldn\u2019t be such a huge disparity in scores for the wealthy and low income students.",

I couldn't afford to take the SAT again. I had friends without Internet or computers at home. Khan Academy wasn't a viable option for them, they could barely get online to do their homework. I also had friends who couldn't drive 2 hours away to a testing center on a Saturday - their parents were working, they were working, they were taking care of family members, they didn't have a car, etc.\n\nStandardized testing is far from the only unfair metric used in applications, but it's absolute bullshit to call it \"the most fair.\" Nope.",

After I worked for 8 hours every weekend day, I always had to do a lot of work at home and go to check on my grandma. Doing all of my schoolwork at home was difficult sometimes. Doing extracurriculars were difficult sometimes, my mom doesn't have the time or the money to drive me everywhere, I didn't have the best ECs or the best GPA as a result.\n\nBut, the SAT, I breezed through it, got a 1570. I barely studied for the test at all. I think the test allows smarter poor students from worse schools to differentiate themselves, given the context of their high scores in a way that GPA, course rigor, and Extracurriculars can't. Someone can be a grade grubber and fake/exaggerate their extracurriculars, but they can't fake the SAT short of someone taking it for them like Rick Singer. I think getting rid of the SAT is a slap in the face for white and Asian students, especially poor Asian students.",

You don't need anything to just walk in to the test and get 1500+ if you're capable of that (basically what I did). Grades are another matter. Most poor public schools do not hold rigorous academic standards, but the same is true for many wealthy private schools full of advantaged students that just want to get their kids into places. Also there are so many inconsistencies between teachers that even within the same school it may not be objective. This disadvantages kids at top, tuition-free public and magnet schools who generally face the most rigorous grading.\n\nGetting \"good\" extracurriculars requires some combination (the more the better) of wealth, family connections and school/community resources. It can be effectively impossible to succeed in this way for many people who grow up in disadvantaged environments, while theoretically anyone can walk in and score a 1600/36. \n\nIn my opinion, there is no form of evaluating applications that does not greatly advantage wealthy people from private and top public schools. Rather than taking misguided attempts to \"make it fair,\" I think we should just adopt a socioeconomic-based form of affirmative action within the existing system.",

No one explained grad school to me until my 7th year of college (4 years junior, 3 military, 3 back for a 4 year degree), and at that point I had not considered anything about what school I would want to go to or what I would want to study, because every aspect of my field interests me.\n\nThey also told me I should go into Radiology, despite being a born programmer.\n\nThe system fundamentally failed me.  You'd think someone qualifying to take the ACTs at 12 would have been someone you'd want to make sure was on a good track but nope.",

      "text": "Yeah I have to say I'm inclined to agree. The SAT and ACT are not perfect, and it's probably true that they unfairly benefit upper class students. That said, the same can be said about any other part of the college admissions process. \n\nThe thing that sets the SAT and ACT apart is that they're standardized. I'm not saying that they're perfect, nor am I saying that they should be the sole judge of a student, but the field of candidates is already oversaturated.\n\nAt the end of the day, as you pointed out, there are plenty of free resources for students to get test prep. In my experience, the test is not necessarily a test of intelligence as much as drive to prepare. \n\nAt the end of the day, I suppose it's up to colleges to interpret their applications as they see fit.\n\nETA: Fuck Collegeboard though",

If that is then given the most credit in your application, maybe the unfair advantage that richer kids have in getting high GPA and nationals level EC\u2019s will have less value. \nBut, once again, the richer kids will still be able to prepare for those admission tests better.

      "text": "So a few points here:\n\nI need to bring up some points for why some still will struggle with preparing for the SAT. It isn't always easy to access the internet even if it's pretty commonly available. Not everyone has internet at home and they may not live walking distance from the library and have parents too busy or negligent to drive them if a car is available during the day. Better hope they have time between the time they get to school before first bell / hope they can stay after school to study. Some might have to go and work to support their families or need to babysit young kids then do the huge amounts of HW from AP classes / regular classes . Just because there are stories of kids who ultimately overcame these time restraints doesn't mean everyone should be expected to rise to that standard just to have a chance at succeeding.   Not all families can afford those big SAT practice books and I'm not sure how many of them are available at a school library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did an EC that wasn't related to my major and just put my heart and soul into it when I could. Your EC doesn't need to be spectacular, you just have to play a significant part in whatever.  So saying that the availability of amazing Ecstatics is an argument for SAT being more important doesn't hold up. I never went to any national competition because there was none, and it was totally free to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly the LOR point is total BS. None of the points I listed above compromise a student's ability to make a good impression on a teacher in order to get a LOC from them. I didn't take time out to eat lunch with them or anything, I just was enthusiastic when I was in their class, cracked jokes when appropriate, and just showed I cared. Costs you nothing and you should just be showing honest effort anyway. With first gens especially, if the teacher knows they're first gen, it's easy to show you care just by giving an honest effort. As long as they weren't slacking off, they were perfectly in the right to ask for an LOC from a teacher in their Junior year. Did they even try to ask? Or did they just throw their hands up and loose all hope. You need to not be afraid to try in college, that's just, a foundational, important skill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI overall agree that SAT might, in theory be the best \"equal\" way to judge someone's college readiness, but there's a reason most colleges have a holistic element to their application process snd I just attempted to poke holes / play Devil's Advocate in your points here to explain why things might not be the way you'd hope them to be / they probably should not be.",
