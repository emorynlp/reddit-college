  "text": "I have a prompt for my supplement about how do I owkr in groups so I made up these questions  \n\n**What have your peers told you about the ways you contribute to working in groups?\"**\n\n**Do you bring fresh perspective to your peers? Are you a leader and do you inspire everyone to stay after practice a do a few extra reps so you guys can work towards that ultimate championship goal?**\n\n**\"How do you approach problem solving in groups?\"**\n\n**This is the perfect opportunity to spend a few sentences relating an anecdote in which you helped another team members in a specific way.**\n\n**\"What would your peers tell us about how you collaborate and work together with them?**\n\nSo HOw would bIe o able to make us bs for all these questions if anyone knows what bs to say bespecially about softball and how I helped a team member out bs I would really appreciate that.",
