  "text": "Pretty much what the title says. Is 100+ downloads on the Play Store impressive? 1k? What would be a number realistically garnished by a high school student that would genuinely, atleast somewhat impress an AO.\n\nAnd similarly, how many streams on a song can be deemed as \"impressive\"?",

It's still something meaningful and important for me, and I learnt a lot of skills while programming the app so I still want to mention it somewhere. Will the additional information section be the right place to briefly touch upon it?\nThanks for the input, I really appreciate it!",
