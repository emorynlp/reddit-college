  "text": "Title basically sums it up, I'f ive made a decent bit of money, over $1000 but under $10,000, in a year by crypto mining.. Can I put this as work on my college applications? will it be beneficial in any way?\n\nI shouldn't have any problem filling the description field, given the work I put in to create a linux miner that has good uptime.. but I'm wondering if this  doesn't really qualify as work? or would hurt my app instead of help? (since its relatively new and not really approved by the mainstream)",

It's great to be an entrepreneur, but when it starts to cost the college, then it might not be such a net positive to have you there.",
