  "text": "I saw someone on the subreddit say this and I feel like more people need to know more about it. If you go into google and type in \"Common Data Set\".  \n\n(Ex: The George Washington University Common Data Set\")\n\n\\- You'll find the 25th and 75th percentile scores from the SAT/ACT\n\n\\- You'll find the percentage of accepted students who scored in what range on both sections\n\n\\- You'll see how admissions officers classify every part on your application (Very Important, Important, Considered, Not Required)\n\n\\- You can see the percentage on how many of the accepted students got in with what GPA (4.0 scale, not every college will report this like GWU)\n\n\\- Waitlist Stats (how many waitlisted, how many accepted, how many ended up enrolled)\n\n\\- And more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I learned some very interesting things just by taking a look at the sets for each college I'm applying to. I highly suggest you all to take a look and see the data for yourself. And most importantly, know it's not all about the numbers. I hope you all get into your dream schools! :D",
