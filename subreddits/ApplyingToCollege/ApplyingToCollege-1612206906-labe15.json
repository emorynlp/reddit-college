  "title:": "A Crash Course in Living Away From Home",
  "text": "This is my guide on how to succeed at living away from home, coming from someone who has attended boarding school and lived in a dorm since 14. As we get closer to the fall and the actual \"holy hell, I'm actually gonna be in college soon,\" here's my advice on dorm essentials, roommates, bathrooms, life skills, and homesickness.\n\n**Dorm essentials:**\n\n* **A mattress pad.** I have never slept on a bed in an institution that was actually comfortable. Invest in a good one. It will save your back and also make coming home to sleep a lot nicer.\n* **Shower shoes and a shower caddy.** Do I even need to explain this one?\n* **Room decor.** It\u2019s a lot less depressing to be in a shoebox of a room if you have decor. There isn\u2019t a ton of space for things like throw pillows or beanbags, but having printed pictures and fairy lights can make your room a lot more cozy. A little rug is nice too.\n* **Wireless headphones/earbuds**. Your roommate does not want to listen to your TV show or music as you putter about your room. Wireless headphones allow you to listen to whatever you want without disturbing your roommate. As a general rule of thumb, unless you are watching/listening to something socially or are alone, you should be using headphones.\n* **Extension cords with power strips are a must.** I shit you not, I had a single outlet in my dorm room that I had to figure out how to run a fridge off of while also charging all my devices and running a diffuser, a fan, and a tea kettle.\n* **Living essentials**. I\u2019m talking about cleaning supplies, bedding, dishes, towels, first aid supplies, a water bottle, laundry stuff, etc. Your dorm room largely functions as a miniature house and as such, you will need the supplies to cook, clean, and generally take care of yourself.\n* **Appliances** are tricky. I would look at dorm rules and what you can afford before investing. Also, coordinate with your roommate about who will buy what. As it stands, the essential dorm appliances are a fridge, microwave, and hot water pot. You can make all the essentials (tea and ramen) with those supplies. A Brita filter is nice if you can fit it in your fridge. If your dorm doesn\u2019t have AC, get a standing fan. It will keep you alive during the hot and humid months.\n* **Hangers**! Do not forget the hangers.\n* **Lock.** You\u2019ll want a locked drawer for \\~reasons\\~, whether that be money, medication, important documents, whatever. There is some stuff you just can\u2019t risk getting stolen.\n* **Storage bins** will save you. Store food, school books, etc in them. Make sure they fit in the places you want them to before buying!\n* **Other stuff:** clothes, shoes, jackets, toiletries, school supplies, bags, sports equipment. Basically anything you use on a day to day basis.\n\n**Side note: less is more.** I made the mistake of bringing way too much stuff. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to haul around during move-in and move-out and is generally just not worth it. People often overestimate the number of clothes and number of nostalgic items they need. I promise you, it\u2019s so much nicer to just have the essentials of living with a few comfort/nostalgic/fancy things. You don\u2019t need to bring your entire shoe or book collection.\n\n**Practical Skills & Important Things**\n\n* **Laundry.** Please know how to do laundry. Do not leave your items in a washer/dryer overnight or longer than the wash cycle. Someone might throw it on the ground, or worse, throw it out.\n* **Dishes.** Moldy food is not only gross, but it will make your room smell like shit and your roommate want to defenestrate you. Nobody cleans up for you in a dorm.\n* **General tidiness.** Most dorms are shoeboxes. What flies as \u201cclean\u201d in a larger room does not fly as \u201cclean\u201d in a dorm room because the space is so small. Have a place for everything and keep spaces like your desk surface clear. Hang up and fold your clothes. Take out the damn trash and make your bed! I promise you, making your bed each day makes a world of difference not only in your physical environment but also your mental headspace. \n* **Basic cooking.** You don\u2019t need to be able to whip up a Michelin star meal, but learn how to make simple meals in case you can\u2019t get food from the college dining halls or order online. As a rule of thumb, it\u2019s always good to have a couple packets of instant ramen and instant oatmeal lying around.\n* **Know who to call.** If something goes wrong, you\u2019re going to want to have the contact information of relevant people like your RA or security services. I recommend inputting those contacts once you have them into your phone.\n* **Medical issues.** If you have a chronic illness, disability, or any type of condition mental or physical that needs to be managed by a doctor, you're going to need to get a practitioner set up near your college. Have your current doctor help find you one or use the college's resources (many keep a list of providers). Figure out your health insurance, the hospital you'll primarily seek care from, and pharmacies. Keep all the paperwork and documentation you'll need accessible. Get your school accommodations set up preemptively!\n* **Money management.** The basic principles of financial health such as having a bank account, keeping a relative budget, and not living outside your means are crucial. Personally, I would recommend getting a credit/debit card set up before you leave home. Cash is not king, and it sometimes can be hard to find ATMs on campus. Having an emergency credit card attached to my parent's bank account is something that I have had all four years and is a contingency for me for medical or transportation emergencies. Have your own bank account and understand how to access it and not go into debt.\n* **Critical items.** Having important documentation is really important. If you don't have a drivers license, you'll need a state ID or a passport. Memorize your SSN! It's likely you'll need it at some point. You should have your health insurance cards to use in case you need to seek emergency medical treatment. If you have chronic illnesses or disabilities, know where and how to access your diagnostic paperwork, along with things like vaccine records and medication lists. If you have a car, you'll need your car's registration and insurance. Once you have your student ID and key to your dorm, don't lose it. Keep all of this type of stuff either with you, digitally, or in a locked drawer in your dorm.\n* **Time management.** Nobody will police you when you\u2019re away from home. You need to figure out how to make a schedule and stick to it. Routine can be very beneficial during times of stress.\n* **Coping skills.** Living away from home can be stressful in itself. There are lots of supports built in to an undergrad college, but knowing how to take care of yourself and your emotions is key. I have a list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbFrgetUD9t2Qt7Eda8fAScPnIpwep21OBQ6zYAvtl4/edit?usp=sharing).\n* **Self-care.** A lot of people have the misconception that self-care is a fancy bubble bath or an expensive meal. Self-care is really about practicality and helping yourself succeed. Think of it as investing in your future self, whether that be legitimate self-improvement or just lessening the burdens your future self will have to carry. Whether that be going to the gym on a regular basis, setting boundaries with toxic friends, keeping a strict morning routine, or doing work when you don\u2019t want to because you know it will bite you in the ass, self-care is key to keeping yourself not only functional, but happy. Of course there\u2019s always room to treat yourself, but that should not be the focus. It\u2019s hard to build up self-discipline which is key to self-care, but it\u2019s really worth it.\n* **Seeking help.** Living away from home is hard. Feeling like an adult for the first time is hard. Use the resources you are provided with to your best advantage. Student health services, counseling, disability accommodations, writing centers, career centers, etc. All these resources at your disposal can help you succeed. There\u2019s no shame in asking for help. College is a time of transition between the teen years and the \"real\" adult years. The rug won't be pulled out from under you completely. There are still a lot of safeguards and people who can help.\n* **Responsibility.** For some people, the first time they are away from home is the first time they face accountability. There is no parent to step in or soften the blow. Your actions, either positive or negative, have consequences. It\u2019s okay to have fun, but don\u2019t compromise your integrity or future.\n\n**Bathrooms:**\n\nI can\u2019t believe I am dedicating a whole section to this, but I know communal bathrooms are a large source of fear for y\u2019all. Side note, I only have the experience of living in a single-gender dorm, so I don\u2019t know how coed bathrooms would work.\n\n* I promise you, you are thinking a LOT more about yourself than others are thinking about you. Everyone minds their business in the bathroom.\n* If you are uncomfortable changing in a bathroom (even behind a curtain), change in your room instead. Wear a robe to the bathroom along with shower shoes. Bring a shower caddy with all your toiletries and a towel. Then walk to the bathroom, pop in the shower, put on your robe again, and go back into your room to change into real clothes.\n* Please clean up after yourself. Don\u2019t spit on the mirror, leave puddles on the floors, or otherwise make the bathroom gross. It's disgusting and disrespectful.\n\n**Roommates:**\n\n* For many people, this will be the first time living with someone and sharing the same space. Dorm rooms are small, and you will become intimately acquainted with your roommate in many ways. Having a roommate can be an absolutely wonderful experience and how you make a best friend or it can be very challenging.\n* **Setting boundaries.** The biggest source of bad roommate experiences is bad boundaries or total lack of them. When you first get a roommate and establish a rapport, make it clear what is acceptable to you and what isn\u2019t. Then come up with a list that you both agree with or can make compromises on. Most colleges pair roommates up by living style questionnaires, but it can\u2019t help to make clarifications. Some examples of questions to ask:\n   * How can you be best contacted in an emergency?\n   * What time do you go to bed on weeknights? Weekends?\n   * Are people okay to sleep over in your room?\n   * Are you okay with sharing food? If so, what?\n   * Are guests allowed at any time or only with advance notice?\n   * Can you share things like cleaning supplies, clothes, etc? If so, what items?\n   * What alarm times/how many alarms in the morning is okay?\n   * What time do you get up in the morning on weekdays? Weekends?\n   * What time do you want to turn the lights off and on during the day?\n   * Are you clean or messy?\n   * What level of noise (phone calls, TV, etc) is acceptable?\n* If you are in an unbearable or even highly uncomfortable living situation, it is okay to try and change roommates. For a lot of people, their dorm is their \u201csafe space\u201d and so it\u2019s worth it to make an effort to get your experience to be as good as possible. Talk to your RA to resolve imminent conflicts and don\u2019t be afraid to go to student life if something big needs to be changed.\n\n**Homesickness:**\n\n* This is not something I personally experienced to a large degree, mainly because of how I was raised. However, I know a lot of people who struggled with homesickness.\n* As much as it is uncomfortable, the college experience is unique and valuable. When you go home, it may feel like you\u2019ve outgrown your childhood home or life. Although wanting to go home may feel safer, you\u2019ll grow a lot if you stick it out.\n* Maintaining relationships with your family and close friends from home is essential. Maintaining long-distance relationships with friendships can be difficult, so I recommend regularly making time to FaceTime or text, or even meet up if your paths somehow intersect. Your parents will probably want to hear from you, so make sure you call them every so often, provided you want to and have a good relationship. They\u2019ve likely been one of the biggest sources of comfort and support for you for your whole life, and now that you\u2019ve moved out, that won\u2019t go away. You're not going to lose your home life entirely.\n* Build connections at school. Although it\u2019s scary, the first few months of college are when people really start to build friendships and friendship groups. Joining clubs, participating in orientation stuff, getting involved with sport teams, talking to people in classes, and generally making an effort to be social will help you build your own community.\n* If your homesickness is becoming overwhelming, or severely detrimental to your mental health, seek support through the student mental health office or the equivalent. It will eventually pass, or at least become more bearable, and seeking support can help make the burden easier.\n\nI think that is about everything! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Moving away from home was simultaneously the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever done but also the best. I learned so much about independence, responsibility, self-reliance, and self-advocacy. Really, I just learned how to make my way through life.\n\nPer popular request, [a full list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgH2zFw3T62KOfIjFd6eGUy-esSnDGdsZWSq6ds1L6A/edit?usp=sharing) of pretty much anything you could ever need to bring to college in no particular order and [the Google Docs (ergo printable) version of this post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPZqxl6BuxhUPikXtEzG4GSGbloIVtl4j_0kASzSSgM/edit?usp=sharing).",

          "text": "Have the forethought to research the campus library hours, private classrooms, and study rooms prior to accepting your college placement. For example too many students camp out at the local coffee shop when they can reserve a private classroom or study room for free on campus. Make friends with the library staff and you can reserve that room with your study group on a regular schedule. Ideally join the library staff so you can get access to loaner textbooks, request books from other libraries, and get access to rare books. Some dorms come with floor kitchens and lounge rooms that can come in handy. Noise canceling Headphones and individual heaters are life savers because dorms are often old with thin walls and poor heating options. Bring practical shoes, water proof clothing, and hats for campus that are in extreme weather zones. Plus flashlights your never know what you might bump into on your way back to the dorms at 2am (mountain lion or deer at UCSC).",

A separate HIPAA release allows the child to nominate individuals who can give and receive medical information.\n\n**Advance Medical Directive:**  This document permits the child to name his or her parents to make medical decisions.  If a child is at a medical center on campus or off campus, the parents have no right to find out what is going on and to help make decisions unless their child has given them access and authority to do so.",

When you live away from home, you\u2019re the one in control. If you want something done or something to change, you\u2019re the one who has to do it. You can seek out help and support of course, but it ultimately comes down to you. \n\nUse your best judgement when it comes to dealing with complicated situations and people. The only person you have both control over and responsibility for is yourself. Even if you have to make changes or step out of your comfort zone, staying true to who you are and your moral compass will never fault you, even if you have to leave certain spaces or people. \n\nGood luck!",

After a month or so of living together, you\u2019ll start to figure out each other\u2019s routines intuitively.\n\nWhen it comes to bothering, it\u2019s basically a cardinal sin of being roommates to interrupt them while they are deep in a study session, on the phone with parents, or dead asleep unless it\u2019s an emergency. For most people, everything else is negligible and about reading social cues (headphones vs not headphones, facing the wall, etc). \n\nAs for special occasions, like them leaving for a weekend, make it a habit to give each other some notice. If you\u2019re going to be gone for several days, a week\u2019s notice is great so they can make plans to invite people over if they want. \n\nIf you set good ground rules from the beginning that you are comfortable with, you can always modify on a case by case basis. \n\nFor example, normally my roommate and I turn off the lights at 11pm. If one of us wants to make a change, we ask each other if that\u2019s okay, which has led to some great deep cleaning at 2am sessions. \n\nIt\u2019s all about being respectful of each other and the space you share.",

It will help you establish credit history in your own name so when you try to get an auto loan, home loan, etc, you will actually have a chance of getting approved.  Just make sure you pay it off every month because ain't nobody got 29.99% APR to throw around.  \n\nALSO - having credit can help you get a job because most employers (for good jobs anyway) will pull a credit report.  It can help you get lower insurance rates for whatever kind of insurance you buy (auto, homeowners, renters, motorcycle, life, etc).  A good credit score is a huge asset and will save you a ton of money over the course of your life.  So get a credit card and start working on it.",

Get a credit card that has no annual fee and use it very sparingly to build credit as soon as you turn 18. Never buy more than you can pay off. Debt will trash your credit score and you will also have to pay interest on whatever you have outstanding. \n\nAdditionally, if you plan on working through college, setting up a Roth IRA to contribute to will be an amazing gift to yourself later in life, as the earlier you start contributing the more capital you can build.",

If you try and spend more money than what\u2019s in your checking account, it will automatically decline. That will keep you from overspending by force until it becomes a habit.\n\nLike ScholarGrade said, having a credit card open that you use minimally will help establish a good credit score which is very important later in life. The thing about credit cards is that you should never ever charge to it more than what you actually have the capability to pay upfront. The only exception to this in my mind is a emergency. Debt is something you want to avoid at all costs, and having a credit card open that you use minimally is perfect.",

Finding the phone is one thing, but once the phone is found, it will be reunited with the owner pretty quickly. Also pretty sure there\u2019s a feature where once you set your phone on lost mode, the designated contact number will appear on the screen.",

Show up to dorm activities.  Show up to socials/meetings/events.  I am hopeful that the incoming class of first years this fall will actually have orientation and in-person classes.  \n\n\\#2 - You always have options.  Never feel so overwhelmed or stressed that you feel hopeless and self-isolate.  RAs, academic counselors, religious counselors, and family/friends can help you define your options.\n\n\\#3 - (which relates to #2) - Know your resources.  College campuses are chock-full of resources that exist to help you - academically, psychologically, emotionally, physically, spiritually.  Reach out way before a crisis.  Establish good relationships and communication with advisors, teaching assistants, professors, residential advisors, chaplains, etc.  \n\nBest of luck to all on their college journeys!  You are all amazing!",

Is your college in a city with good public transit? Can you easily call an Uber? Is there a well-run campus shuttle? If you have any of these opportunities, it may be easier just to utilize them.\n\nIf your campus is more spread out or you want the flexibility to get around on your own, a bike could be a good idea. Just consider the level of traffic, distance, time, difficulty of terrain, etc. Also an important factor is weather. If it\u2019s super snowy and icy, riding a bike during the winter months isn\u2019t exactly advisable. Look into the climate of your college and use Google Maps to figure out distances, elevation gains, etc.  \n\nIf you are going to college in the relative middle of nowhere and have to drive like 20 minutes to get groceries, you\u2019re gonna want a car instead of a bike.",

Depending on the school, many student apartments (even off campus) come with furniture and a few other things (like appliances) that you don't need to buy. There are also many articles online ofc (freshmen vs upperclassmen doesn't matter too much). If you really want to be prepared, go around your house to each room and markdown everything you typically use, go through all of the drawers in the kitchen, cords for the tv, etc. Don't forget decor and if you have roomies/apartment-mates (idk what to call them) make sure to communicate with that so you don't have an excess amount of something.",

I don\u2019t know how to sneak someone of a different gender in since I have never had to do that (I imagine it\u2019s quite possible since it\u2019s a college staple), but you should strategically plan your \u201cvisit.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t bring someone to your dorm when your roommate is going to be there. Don\u2019t sexile your roommate without advance notice. This could be upfront, or through a signal like a sock on a door. I feel like this goes without saying, but do not have sex while your roommate is inside the room. Also, walls are usually quite thin, so being excessively vocal is not advised.",

I shit you not, I had a single outlet in my dorm room that I had to figure out how to run a fridge off of while also charging all my devices and running a diffuser, a fan, and a tea kettle.\n\nThat's a power strip.\n\n> Wireless headphones/earbuds. Your roommate does not want to listen to your TV show or music as you putter about your room. Wireless headphones allow you to listen to whatever you want without disturbing your roommate. As a general rule of thumb, unless you are watching/listening to something socially or are alone, you should be using headphones.\n\nDo wires not exist?",

Do you have a habit of moving around your room while carrying your laptop with wired headphones plugged in? No? Because it\u2019s impractical. If you\u2019re just gonna be sitting in your bed with a limited range of motion, that\u2019s fine, but if you want to move around while you\u2019re doing things in your room or cleaning and listen to music at the same time, wires are not going to be easy.",
