      "text": "In general, it's better to apply with the nationality of the destination country. You can typically get more financial aid this way, and you might even dodge some quotas that could make it harder for you to get in. \n\nI work with a lot of dual citizens here in Peru. Many have Italian passports, for example, and can pay less in Europe as a result. When they apply to Italy, they can avoid the limits on foreigners that apply to some programs in public universities. \n\nSimilarly, we've helped Peruvian-Americans apply to the US, and we always use their US passport. They can use the FAFSA that way and since their family earns a Peruvian wage, they tend to get a lot more in the way of financial aid.",
