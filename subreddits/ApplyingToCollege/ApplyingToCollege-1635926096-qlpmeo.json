  "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nI was self reporting my grades for my UIUC application. I have given the IGCSE. I was wondering if I should only report my final IGCSE grades or also the results of school's internal exams? On the website for GCSE, UIUC says do not report internal school exam scores however I am not sure if this applied for IGCSE as well. \n\nIf any of you have faced a similar situation, please let me know what did you guys do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your help in advance.",
