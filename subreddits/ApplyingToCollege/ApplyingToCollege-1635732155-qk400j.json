  "title:": "\u201cWhy Brown\u201d supplement advice",
  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve finished my supplement but I am starting to get a bit apprehensive. My intended major is biophysics, a cross road between physics and biology. I think brown is a perfect school for me bc of the open curriculum not restricting me to either field. However, a lot of the essay examples online show that people often cite a love for history and science, or psychology and math. They have completely different interests where as mines are similar. Also, could it be argued that my intention to explore biology and physics in an open curriculum is already encapsulated in the \u201cbiophysics\u201d major. If true then I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a strong argument for the open curriculum.",
