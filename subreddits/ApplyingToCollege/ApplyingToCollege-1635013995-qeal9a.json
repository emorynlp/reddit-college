  "text": "My parents are divorced and my personal essay mentions that bit, plus my running away to live with my mom. However, since the last few months, my dad is staying with us due to personal reasons.\n\nNow my essay has a paragraph dedicated to how I left my home and went to live with my mom, but on the other hand, in my general family info, I wrote I live with both my parents (my essay takes place before my dad moved in, but I don't provide any time frame in it).\n\nDo I really have to address this change in my additional info section? Will AOs doubt the authenticity of my story?",

          "text": "Even if I don't mention him, I still have to answer that question asking who I make my permanent living with. I'll have to answer 'both my parents' and that automatically creates this inconsistency. Besides, he pays for all my educational costs, so I can't cut him off entirely.\n\nUgh maybe the additional info section is the only way....",
