  "text": "Hey!\n\nSo I am in a bit of a predicament here. I am looking to start working places, and have 2 options. For context, I am an Asian CS major (yes I know stereotypical, but I do enjoy CS a lot \ud83d\ude05).\n\nOption 1: Work at a place where I teach young kids how to code (12 bucks per hour)\n\nOption 2: Work a normal teenager job such as at Target (12-17 bucks per hour)\n\nAmount of money earned isn\u2019t a huge concern, as I\u2019m mostly doing this for experience purposes. So out of these two options, which would most benefit me in admissions? Having experience sort of working at a CS job, or earning experience with developing personality+soft skills by connecting with customers? Thanks!",

      "text": "definitely go with opinion 1! however, if you do have the opportunity to work in computer-related retail, that\u2019s also great. i\u2019ve worked at best buy and it was pretty nice to develop soft skills + talk about CS. check out a micro center or bestbuy/geek squad near you, or if you\u2019re already 18, check out apple!",
