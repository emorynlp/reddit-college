  "text": "basically i was class of 2021, got into some good schools, currently attending northwestern, and I hate it, I think I should've gone to another school that I was previously admitted to. I'm considering not going back (leave of absence, mental health reasons, would be able to return if things don't work out how I want them to) for the next 2 quarters and would like to reapply to a school I was previously admitted to. i won't have completed enough credits to apply as a transfer so I would have to use the first-year application. should I reuse my commonapp essay or supplements or rewrite them? also if anyone else has gone through the process of reapplying to colleges after a year for a similar reason or different reason please let me know, I have some questions on the general process.\n\nTLDR: do I reuse last year's essays that got me into a school when applying for first-year admission again?",

I've had untreated mental health issues for a very long time and a number of things have exacerbated it in the past few months (far from home, difficult major, lack of direction, lack of passion for major, etc.). most people I know love it here and are having a great time from what I can tell. i don't think my experience has been that of the typical NU student's so please don't let it make or break your daughter's decision. i think any top school will be very intense it's just a matter of whether or not someone is cut out for it (which has nothing to do with intelligence). best of luck to your daughter throughout this process!",

Maybe call transfer office and explain that you want to be closer to home and what is process. Important to take care of self. So many kids at top schools have mental health issues. Self care very important.  Ask them if you apply as transfer or first year. Good luck to you.",
