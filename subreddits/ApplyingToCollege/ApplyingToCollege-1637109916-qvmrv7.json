  "text": " Hello,\n\nFor my high school, I took Spanish courses which counted as Spanish 1,2,3, etc. However, in the middle of my high school year, I switched to taking Spanish outside of my school. They reported Spanish as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, etc. Spanish 1-2 at my high school is equivalent to Spanish 1A-1B at the other school, Spanish 2-3 is equivalent to Spanish IIA-IIB, etc. I forgot to explain this discrepancy in additional information for my early action/early decision schools. Therefore, I am worried that the AOs will see I took Spanish 2 in my original high school, and Spanish IIB in the other school, making it look like I \"repeated\" the class. I passed all of my classes, so there is no reason for AOs to think that way, but I am still paranoid. Is this something that I should email AOs about?",
