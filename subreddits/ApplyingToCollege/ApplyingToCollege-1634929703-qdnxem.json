  "title:": "Low GPA freshman year",
  "text": "I'm a International student and I had a terrible GPA my freshman year a 55% out of 100 due to mental health issues and an injury from soccer due to witch I  missed many exams and scored terribly. On top of that some teachers had a personal grudge against me and simply reduced marks in my projects and internals etc which counted towards my grade. I have now improved to a 83% in my 10th grade national exams and a 90% in my 11th grade mid terms. Do I still have a chance at a T50 if I score well on my SAT and I also have couple of 5's on AP exams for which I self studied and also need no aid whatsoever.",
