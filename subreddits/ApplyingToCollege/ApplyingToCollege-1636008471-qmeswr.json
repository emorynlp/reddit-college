  "text": "So I asked a teacher from a previous school for a rec letter, and he sent it directly to me, so I was able to read it, even though I know i'm not suppose to. At the time I was intending to major in industrial design, but now i'm applying for architecture. He wrote in the letter something along the lines of \"I hope \\*my name\\* can further his career in industrial design at the university of his choice\". I can't really ask him to write a new letter, and I obviously can't edit their letter of rec. Does it matter that the major that the teacher wrote about isn't the one I would be applying for?",
