  "text": "I'm a highschool student and I'll be going to college as an undergrad next year. I'm interested in Architecture and I'm specifically looking for a B.Arch program in Canada or UK (more interested in Canada). But I have a question as to why the duration of a B.Arch course is different in Canada and the UK. When I go onto college websites, B.Arch courses in Canada seem to last 4-5 years while the same thing in the UK lasts for 3 years. So wouldn't anyone choose the program that lasts the least amount of years as you get to work faster? Also talking money wise, as it'll mean less money to spend. It has always been a dream for me to be able to study in Canada and the extra year or two I have to spend is holding me back.",

      "text": "Probably depends on the licensure requirements for the country you want to work in, I would assume. Can you get a job/license in Canada with a three-year degree from the UK?\n\nIn the US, a B.Arch program needs 150 credit hours to be accredited\u2026 and you need a degree from an accredited program to get licensed.",
