  "text": "I do a lot of community service for my school but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be enough to count as like extracurriculars? I tutor math for kids in my district, I\u2019m a board member of a non-profit, I\u2019m in UNICEF club, a club that donates fixed computers to shelters, TRI-M honor society, and I teach swimming lessons. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s good enough to go to many places though because it\u2019s not really focused on a single subject like STEM (I want to go to MIT).",

      "text": "Those are great activities - and really, anything can be an extracurricular! Anything you like doing and have dedicated a lot of time to is a good EC.\n\nWhile I can't say for certain if having a breadth of ECs is going to negatively or positively affect your application, one tip I can give is this: even though you have different activities, you can connect them to your app's overall theme. If you do art but you're applying for STEM, maybe you can talk about how you made science-related infographics. Your math tutoring is another example - it's a volunteering activity but it's also math-related, which helps strengthen your overall app if you're thinking of doing a STEM/math-related major",
