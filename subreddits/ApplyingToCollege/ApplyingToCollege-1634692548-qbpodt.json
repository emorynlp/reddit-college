  "text": "I have always doubted myself, like any other kid on a2c. My gpa is low, my sat is average, and I have always relied on some uniquely good extracurriculars to balance my low stats for me. I would always mention it, or feel a little proud whenever I\u2019d post a chanceme, but I always felt like I was making myself feel better by claiming my application might not be so bad. I never took the real time to write off my extracurriculars, I\u2019d barely sum it whenever it was brought up, but as i\u2019m filling out the commonapp I am starting to realize how legitimate it is: how legitimate the work that drained me for years is. It\u2019s like that bittersweet moment when you realize you worked too hard, thinking you didn\u2019t work hard enough. Feeling like such a \u201cfake\u201d, it was a really interesting experience to look back and think \u201cmaybe I did too much, not too little\u201d. Just a thought",
