  "text": "I have travelled to over 9 countries to play chess tournaments and have achieved a respectable rating (top 200 in Asia for my age group). Should I mention that I have travelled to 9 countries or does that make me sound privileged? ive been told that I should mention it because it\u2019s impressive, so idk what to do.",

They\u2019ll know the extent to which you\u2019re privileged based on your financial aid forms, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about that as an issue. Additionally, they might assume you had a scholarship, it was paid for, etc. You definitely won\u2019t come off as privileged. Hope I helped!\n\nTL;DR: Include that fact! It\u2019s really neat!",
