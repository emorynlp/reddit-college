  "title:": "club president got mad at me for highlighting my role on linkedin instead of calling myself a \"general member\"",
  "text": "I'm apart of the events department at a club at my uni. our job is literally to plan and execute events, so when I was updating my LinkedIn I wrote my title as \"Event Coordinator\". the next day, the club president messages me on Slack AND LinkedIn, telling me that my title isn't event coordinator, it's 'general member' and to change it.\n\nI was kinda annoyed but I changed it. I casually mentioned it to my dad and he said that she's trying to minimize everyone else's contribution so she can look which better, which I think makes a lot of sense. she literally messaged me in 2 places to change it and didn't even like my job update \ud83d\ude2d its like she's threatened by other ppl doing good or something??\n\nI really want to change it back, \"general member\" makes it sound like I just go to meetings and sit there, when in reality I reach out to potential speakers, plan the logistics of events, promote the event online... which is literally coordinating an event, making me an event coordinator.\n\nwhat do u guys think? SHOULD I CHANGE IT BACK or should I talk to her? im posting here cuz I plan on applying as a transfer student and if I write this activity as an EC, I honestly plan on using \"events coordinator\" and not \"general member\", I don't think it's exaggerating cuz its literally what I do.",
