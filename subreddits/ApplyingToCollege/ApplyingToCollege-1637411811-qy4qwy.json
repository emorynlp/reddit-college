  "text": "Help Me Choose: Marketing or Advertising Management?\n\nI\u2019m an incoming college freshmen currently applying and I need to choose a course that is best for me, I was thinking of these two since I have an interest in copywriting, but I\u2019m not sure if it is true passion enough for me to invest on a whole course. I think marketing is more broad and practical since it\u2019s also going to tackle advertising as well, and will have more job opportunities since it is not just advertising but the advertising course has actual copywriting classes and has more subjects I feel I will enjoy more (like art direction and creative managemen) but may just be an infatuation/phase, as this has happened before like I liked architecture till I found out the course is too hard for what it offers, or fashion design. Which should I choose, should I just choose marketing since it seems to pay more and we might still learn about copywriting in advertising classes and then just teach myself copywriting online, or take the risk and go specialized in advertising management (the subjects are lil bit more interesting to see), but I\u2019m worried that this interest might just be a phase. Is there a way to study the copywriting classes and other interested subjects as electives with a marketing management degree? And yes, I know about experience and am currently finding a way for internship soon, which of the two should I choose? Big help thx.",
