  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo I'm applying to MH, but I was wondering if for the second essay, which is the topic of your choice, I could submit an essay I did for English class analyzing a passage? Or do you think they prefer a more personal essay? \n\nThey mentioned you could submit an \"academic assignment,\" but I'm not sure if they meant analyzing a passage type of essay.",

      "text": "I would submit an analyzing type of essay. A writing sample that shows not only can you understand what you read but also analyze it and relate it to a bigger concept. In Macaulay, you will have to do the same thing in the seminar classes. \n\nFor reference, I'm a 2021 graduate of Macaulay. You can always message me if you have any more questions. Good luck!",
