  "text": "Since I submitted my applications for 4 colleges a few days ago, I can't stop thinking about them. All I do is check my emails constantly for any updates and check reddit for other people who got their decision early. I want to go to IU and they release their decisions within weeks of submitting the application and I can't stop thinking about it. Other students who applied to IU in October are getting their decisions now. And when I do try to distract myself it never works. I can't even focus on school and if I try to watch a show, I don't enjoy it. Also, I can't even focus on my next few applications. Along with that, I have the sat this weekend and I can't study or focus. Does anyone know what I can do? I'm literally so lost and getting more frustrated by the day.",
