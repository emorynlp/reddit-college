On Google, type in \"\\[name of school\\] Common Data Set\" and use the link to scroll down to the page where there's a chart of what each colleges declare important in their admissions process, and how much weight is placed on each factor.\n\nNote that some schools (Cornell, Columbia, for example) have stopped releasing Common Data Sets.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

So too with essays.\n\nGenerally speaking, course rigor and GPA are always at or near the top of the importance list, but other stuff can wiggle around a ton from school to school.\n\nOne thing that's much more important than most students know is how much aid you'll need, even for domestic students. Unless a school is explicitly need-BLIND in admissions, budgets can matter a lot.\n\nCommon Data Set reports will help you figure out which things are important to various schools, though (schedule C)!",
