They want to read your app again in RD, so they move your decision to when the RD decisions come out\n\nWaitlist = In RD. They like your app, but there are not enough seats, so they put you on the waitlist. If someone declines their admission, you have a chance to take their spot\n\nHope that clarifies your q!",
