  "title:": "is class rank more important than actual course rigor?",
  "text": "my school has really scuffed class rank/GPA calculation systems - for example, if you take 6 APs plus electives/world languages versus someone who just takes 6 APs, then the second person would have a much higher GPA than you. i\u2019m not sure if this is universal, but it\u2019s really tanking my class rank and stressing me out.\n\ni\u2019ve taken the most rigorous courses i possibly could, but i never thought that taking electives and world languages would tank my GPA by THIS much. i would be in the top 5% if i didn\u2019t take as many electives/language classes and it really sucks that i\u2019m sitting here outside of the top 10% despite having straight As and rigorous courses. i cross-checked with the stats of a classmate in the top 5% to be sure, so i\u2019m not just throwing out speculations. we took the same number of APs and have very similar grades, but i just took more electives and languages than he did, so i\u2019m way below him in class rank.\n\ni wanted to ask if anyone knew if GPA/class rank was more important than course load at T20 colleges? my school is also very competitive so i know that ivies will be comparing me to my classmates who likely have a better rank than me despite having lighter/similar course loads \u2014 will this hurt my chances significantly, or will AOs actually look at the classes i took instead of just ranking?",
