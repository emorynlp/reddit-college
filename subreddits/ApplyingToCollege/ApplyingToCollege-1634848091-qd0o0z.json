  "text": "Hello, my friend lives in Alabama and goes to a school that does not provide a lot of opportunities/extracurriculars to do. He's interested in graphic design, and will most likely major in it in college. Does anyone have any suggestions of what he can do as extracurriculars? It does not have to be graphic design related, but that would be nice.\n\nThank you in advance for the help.",
