  "text": "Hello, my friend lives in Alabama and goes to a school that does not provide a lot of opportunities/extracurriculars to do. He's interested in graphic design, and will most likely major in it in college. Does anyone have any suggestions of what he can do as extracurriculars? It does not have to be graphic design related, but that would be nice.\n\nThank you in advance for the help.",

      "text": "As an extracurricular, you could look into getting a job at a local restaurant or something. Colleges value work experience.\n\nAlso, maybe look into volunteer opportunities- maybe a local church or local community center would have some sort of service opportunity.\n\nAnd as for graphic design- you could create a YouTube channel with graphic design tutorials or something like that. Or maybe you could reach out to local businesses and ask if they'd want your help volunteering to design posters/brochures for them.\n\nAnd join whatever clubs/sports at your school that sound mildly interesting to you. You might be surprised by how much you enjoy a club/sport that you didn't expect to enjoy. :)\n\nBest of luck.",
