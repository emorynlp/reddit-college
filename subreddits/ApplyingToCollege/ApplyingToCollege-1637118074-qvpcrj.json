  "text": "Hi everyone here are my stats:\n\nGpa: 3.06 uw 3.38 weighted\n\nSat: 1410\n\nExtra curriculars: varsity tennis 3 years, temple university urban planning course, business classes at drexel, volunteer at local tennis camp, 2 years of choir, 2 years vote registration team, urban technology project (fixed and coded computers for my school district) volunteering at farmers market, second hand clothing reselling\n\nAp\u2019s: microecon and comp sci A. Also did pre calc honors\n\nI got a bad gpa freshman and sophomore year (~2.6-2.7uw) but I really picked it up junior year (3.7uw, 3.9 weighted) and I\u2019m doing really well my senior year. My freshman and sophomore years of high school I was on a medication that had some pretty bad effects on my diet and mood which is a bit of an explanation for my poor gpa. \n\nAs of rn, Pitt is my favorite school (in state tuition, has a bunch of majors I\u2019m interested in, really like the city)\n\nI\u2019m interested in software engineering/comp sci, management information systems, business and marketing and econ. I enjoy data and statistics but I\u2019m not sure if I want to make an entire major out of it.\n\nI can go up to 40k w/o room and board\n\nLike laid-back somewhat stoner vibe with at least some parties, but I still really wanna take college seriously.\n\nTargets: Drexel (expect merit aid), Temple, Penn state (Ik it\u2019s a good school and prob a good match for me but I don\u2019t love the idea of being in the middle of nowhere), Ud, Pitt (sorta reach), Cu Boulder (would prob only go if I got merit aid)\n\nSafeties: UOregon (I\u2019d expect to get merit aid), penn state abington\n\nReaches: Penn (only reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my dad works there), Udub, Fordham (if they give me aid, they prob wouldn\u2019t even if I did make it in), Umd",

          "text": "Hard agree on UMN-TC, it's a highly prolific research university with excellent undergrad programs in business and computer science.\n\nHowever, OP should be aware that the liberal arts college is very large, and masks the selectivity of the professional schools (especially Carson, CSE, and CBS). The specific admit rates for engineering and business aren't listed anywhere, but they're considerably less generous than 57%. I had some friends get rejected last year that I was really surprised about. Admissions chat on r/uofmn supports this, too.\n\nOP's extreme upward trend may be enough to tip the scales in their favor, but I would definitely recommend applying to the CS and econ majors in the Liberal Arts college as well as majors in the professional schools. It's still a great education, but the bar to entry is a bit lower.",
