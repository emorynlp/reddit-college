  "text": "I\u2019m planning on pursuing a stem degree, most likely Computer science. I thought about writing an essay about playing Minecraft as a child. My brother and I used to build all sorts of crazy contraptions so I would like to relate it back to the idea of problem solving (starting off with a big idea and working backwards to figure out how to build it) to explain why I chose my major. Is this a good idea or does it seem risky?",
