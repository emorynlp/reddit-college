  "text": "Constantly on this sub, I see students talking about starting NPO's and other programs to help underrepresented minorities or those who are low income. Now, this isn't bad if you're actually passionate about helping these people and making a difference. However, to those who are starting these organizations and programs solely for resumes or college admissions, I want you to hear me. \n\nAs a low-income minority myself, it's so uncomfortable to see mostly White and Asian upper-class students on this sub talk about us as if we're just another activity that can be added to a resume. It's so heartbreaking to see most of you talk about us as if we're just another trophy that can be added to your trophy case. It's like most of you don't even see us as human. It's also incredibly uncomfortable to see us be suggestions for extracurriculars in the EC flair or on r/ECAdvice. \"Why don't you start an organization for \\*insert marginalized community\\*\". It's so dehumanizing to see us used as tokens you guys can use to boost your resume or better your chances of getting into a good school.\n\nIt's so disgusting to see all of you start these phony organizations, claiming that you want to help a marginalized community, but instead you're only using us to make yourself look better on a resume. The worst part is the issues that most of you claim to want to resolve through your organization are REAL issues that are affecting REAL people. Instead of seeing these issues as serious issues that need to be resolved, most of you see them as opportunities. While real people are being affected by these issues, you guys exploit their suffering and oppression and use it to your own benefit.\n\nWhat's so sad is that some of you actually get in contact with these marginalized communities and \"work\" with them. They think that you're actually trying to help them when in actuality, they're nothing but an opportunity for you.\n\nAnd it sucks that there are people like me who are inside these communities and actually want to help their community but lack the resources to do so. \n\n**Minorities and those who are low-income are NOT your puppets. We are NOT your extracurriculars!**\n\nIf you know anyone doing something like this, please talk to them and advise them to stop. If you are the owner of an NPO or program, please re-evaluate your intentions and ask yourself: \"Am I doing this for the right reasons?\" or \"Do I actually really want to do this?\"\n\n(Again, if you have started or want to start an NPO or program that would help underrepresented minorities/those who are low-income and you're actually doing it with good intentions, please do. I am in no way discouraging you from doing this!)",

      "text": "This is a huge problem even on \"college admissions tiktok/IG\" where people suggest starting a nonprofit for your college apps as if it's something casual to do instead of something people work their entire professional career towards because they have to understand the root causes of the issues marginalized communities are facing and then analyze how to best help them! I really believe that these types of fake ECs are going to become analogous to doing a service mission trip: virtue signaling to demonstrate character when in actuality if you truly cared about the community you would just donate the money to a local organization that is better equipped to solve the problem instead of doing a crappy job yourself. \n\nSimilarly, I really advise all the people still in high school to join an existing community service org or nonprofit that is doing work you actually care about. It's fine if you want to help marginalized communities and you didn't grow up in one, but you better understand them as people and not a project that is for your betterment/an opportunity. Get your leadership somewhere else like starting a club at your school or just joining one and working your way up through commitment. Not to say that all nonprofits are bad if started by high schoolers, but I'd hope you at least have some personal experiences with the issues you are trying to solve and care about it, not just decide one day that it's a cause that suits your needs.",

          "text": "Adding on to this to say that it's hella expensive to start a non-profit. There are fees you have to pay to the IRS and if you don't know how to file the paperwork, then you'll have to hire someone that does. Tbh, a high schooler with a brand new non-profit is basically a sign of wealth and resources (note that I said \"brand new,\" I'm talking about the people that make non-profits out of nowhere\u2014 501c3 status and all. I'm talking about the people that wait to become a non-profit before doing any real and impactful work). With that being said, you do not need to make a non-profit. If you have a goal you want to achieve, gather a group of people that are also passionate about it then work towards it; there's truly no need to file as a 501c3 if you're just starting out. In fact, it would be more sustainable if you formed an organization without any fancy legal titles and then once the org has been working for some time, see if becoming a 501c3 would be valuable for the org and see if the org can exist longterm. There are people that have careers in managing non-profits/serving on npo boards and that's because you have to be extremely conscientious of your actions and critically think about your intended and unintended impacts. Filing for non-profit status is something that should always be carefully thought about/laid out AND you should plan to continue it for several years down the road. To all high schoolers out there: I know the word NPO is thrown around so much, but actually managing and creating a non-profit is extremely serious which is why most successful non-profits that exist today are run by people who have had years and years of experience, training, and education in this sector. Please understand that engaging with social issues isn't an opportunity you can use to claim more accolades and clout for college apps. There are *real* people with *real* problems in our world and if you want to help make the world a better place, please do so because you truly want to do it, not JUST because you want to get into a good college.",

I see a lot of NPOs claim that they're working to solve a certain social issue but fail to listen to the communities and people with lived experiences tied to that certain issue. Some white savior NPOs will be like, \"omg what's the solution to this issue and why haven't we been talking about it!?!11\" while the people impacted will literally be like \"uhm we KNOW the solution and y'all haven't and STILL won't listen to us.\" For a lot of social issues in the status quo, we don't need more privileged people intervening. Instead, we need privileged people to *support and listen* to us and become our *allies*.",

                  "text": "Also, people who want to start an NPO have to realise that *helping someone achieve X may harm them*.\n\nIt **sounds** noble to want to improve college admission success for disabled applicants, but what help is it really if the system you slingshot them into isn't accessible? Is it a good thing to help a vulnerable black student enter into a highly discriminatory, even racist, system? Is it right to push students towards a research career if you *know* they won't ever get a research job or even earn significantly more than their peers?\n\nNPOs need to look at what will happen to people *beyond* their program. If there aren't any supports to take over once your clients \"age out\" then you're not helping those people, you're setting them up to fail in the most cruel way. But too many NPOs have a toxically positive mindset and don't want to convey the hardships because then many of their clients will *choose* to walk away.\n\nIt can take a long time and a lot of research/consultation with actual experts to find these unexpected consequences. But if you put in that effort it'll highlight areas where you really can help, it'll help you to frame your motives and keep your organisation on track, and it'll mean that you seek out partnerships with other groups that will actually help your clients in the long run. Additionally, your organisation should have systems in place to measure the true impact it has on people who go through it.",

They know when you're just name-dropping a shiny new organization that doesn't actually do anything impactful. Especially when your essays and supplements hardly mention it or it isn't integrated into your personal story as a high school student. \n\nThat's not to say that including non-profit or volunteer work will hurt your chances. But there's a big difference between talking about (and acting on) your passion for alleviating poverty in your community vs. just working at a soup kitchen every so often or tutoring some low-income kids every so often. It's great that you're doing that - but don't do it for some sort of grand recognition, do it because you want to help others.",

Since the owners aren't truly passionate about these issues, their efforts are often half-assed and ineffective. And since most of them only do it for college admissions, the organization starts to falter after the owner goes to college.",

Actually running an NPO requires significant amounts of understanding the issue your trying to combat as well as the economics surrounding it. So your doctor example is a little bit of a false analogy. It would be more akin to if a bunch of high schoolers decided to start providing back-alley surgeries and managed to convince the local community that they were real doctors. It doesn't matter if they're \"just trying to help\" their patients, they should allow someone who knows what they're doing to help instead.",

I acknowledge I could be wrong that she wants systemic change though.\n\nRegarding the rest of your comment: Why do you think a privileged, disconnected outsider who is only in high school can more efficiently help an underprivileged community than the community itself can? Do you have evidence of this working?",

As for mine, I would turn to levels of political engagement/civil protest by income levels: why is it that middle class people\u2014who have less to complain about\u2014vote more than working class and poor people? I would contend that welfare is what helps the poor \u201cjust get by\u201d but not have any energy or time left over to spend trying to actually improve their condition or reform/dismantle the systems that are perpetuating that condition.",

I'm criticizing the applicants who start half-baked initiatives mainly because they want to look good to unis with charity being the afterthought. If charity was truly the main reason, why not join an existing, long-term organization that gives consistent efforts to improving and building trust with local disadvantaged communities? Because it *doesn't stand out*. \n\nOP mentions being part of those low income minorities. Here's some advice: when the people you are trying to help criticize you even if you are being genuine, you *need* to listen. There's a fine line between generosity and disrespect.",

I'm off to college!\n\nSure, it helped some people, it's just that lower class knows their problems are bigger and one coding class won't necessarily fix it especially if it disappears. Some people might get saved if they stay on the straight narrow path. Tjat's really hard when everything around them still sucks. I don't know if you've lived in a place like that, but if not, you probably would not understand. Please understand this is not a great solution since most of these NPOs don't stay.",

Actually running an NPO requires significant amounts of understanding the issue your trying to combat as well as the economics surrounding it. So your doctor example is a little bit of a false analogy. It would be more akin to if a bunch of high schoolers decided to start providing back-alley surgeries and managed to convince the local community that they were real doctors. It doesn't matter if they're \"just trying to help\" their patients, they should allow someone who knows what they're doing to help instead.",

In fact, a lot of it came off as \"I'm very wealthy and want to somewhat help a group of people because it means I can get into Yale or Stanford, and then forget about them.\" Even worse is that realistically none of these NPO's are actually self-sustainable, they have little to no actual donors, and have no long term plans set up; ie: give clothing away once a semester to kids as they grow, have a monthly food drive for struggling families, work with a local school to create a dedicated day for tutoring access for struggling students via consistently recruiting juniors or seniors to assist, eventually growing to work alongside a local college or with the local town system. It comes off more as a merchant passing through town.",

If you start a nonprofit within your own community for an issue you really care about, regardless of the resume booster, you're more likely to invest in creating long-lasting relationships and infrastructure. If you start a nonprofit just to say you started one, you're less likely to actually create long-lasting, meaningful change. Not always the case, but often. \n\n I don't know where it says the Stanford kid made a sustainable NPO, I'm pretty sure he said that most of the kids he knew immediately stopped running the NPO the second they got their college decisions, which to me seems like it would hurt the communities they claim to be serving because they're essentially just randomly severing this relationship they formed over the course of a few years. All the time and money that was invested in an NPO that only lasted a few years could have gone to an NPO thats been around for decades, where it would have been a better investment.",

Since everyone else here is also pretty supportive of this post and you're getting downvoted, I'll play devil's advocate.\n\n___\nSelfish altruism, even if transparent, is still altruism. If the end result is the same, why does the intent matter so much? It is unfortunate that many people volunteer or start nonprofits due to some ulterior motive, and it's true that many of these nonprofits are abandoned shortly after their creators get into college. But if even a tiny sliver of progress is made because of that, does it really matter? The average person is inherently selfish, and you can't change human nature overnight, so progress motivated by extrinsic rewards, however slight it may be, should be better than no progress. It would be great if we could somehow convince everyone to volunteer out of the goodness of their hearts, but that simply isn't realistic.\n\nYou could even argue that there is no such thing as truly selfless altruism; even if you volunteered because it genuinely made you feel good, then you would still be doing it to receive some sort of benefit in return (it's merely an emotional reward instead of something tangible). How come using people as a puppet for your emotional gain is morally better than using them for something tangible like a resume?\n\nAlso, for anyone on this sub who regularly volunteers\u2014did you list it on your application? If so, would you truly be willing to keep doing it to the same extent you are now if you couldn't put it on your application at all? If your answer to that is no, then you probably are also at least partially motivated by college apps to volunteer.\n\n___\nAgain, I also think it's ridiculous to start things you have no passion for just to look good to colleges; it's always been my ethos to do things because I want to do them (this is why I do things like write chem study guides for my classmates in my free time without telling colleges). I also think \"virtue signaling\" is just patronizing. But I'm interested to discuss this.",

Imagine if a rich corporation built a factory in a poor nation to refine diamonds or something. The factory employs some of the population of this poor nation. However, after all the diamonds are refined, the corporation abandons its factory and takes all the value they hold out of the poor nation. So while the people may have gotten compensation for their work, they are left with nothing lasting. While this isn\u2019t a 1:1 comparison, I think it describes how some of these NPOs are not that helpful and are perceived in a negative light (rightfully IMO). You may be right that some of these NPOs can do objective good, the lack of real interest in providing value to the communities they serve in the long term (which is more effective in actually impacting these places) makes them unnecessary since most times they do much more for the student than for the community which doesn\u2019t sound like what it\u2019s advertised as.",

Sure that job may have helped someone feed their family for a few months, but it did nothing to improve the overall conditions beyond that and ends up being exploitative since the company gets much more from it (just like kid goes to elite school, community stays the same overall). Also try to have empathy for the people in these communities and how it might feel for an elite kid to come in start a nonprofit but then just abandon it for their own gain after they don\u2019t need to do anything with it, I think it\u2019s dehumanizing to these communities since they can definitely tell that the NPO is just for the gain of others and that they\u2019re just seen as a means to an end.\n\nEdit: I can tell you genuinely want to understand so if any of this comes off as rude I apologize I just think that the perspective of this post is important to at least understand even if you don\u2019t 100% agree.",

I\u2019m not saying no people gain empathy but for most people it\u2019s pity because at the end of the day they get to go back to their neighborhood and school where they don\u2019t interact with the law kids and have to understand what they experience beyond the parts that are of use to them. Of course there are NPOs created by students that do good things even if they aren\u2019t sustainable, but that does not make them honorable and the ethics are not clearly favoring them.",

      "text": "Ultimately, I think it's a sad consequence of the gamification of our admissions system. A friend of mine told me about how his private admissions consultant set up a 501c3 nonprofit for all of their students to teach STEM in \"low-income minority communities.\"  Sure, they did do genuinely impactful things like run a tutoring program for two weeks in the inner city. But get this... to fund the program, the consultant set up a charity fundraiser dinner at one of the student's house (a $10 MILLION mansion in the hillside) and charged all the  students' rich parents to participate in the charity auction (tax-deductible of course). And so after every graduating class puts \"fundraised $$$$ to help low-income minority students in (insert inner city here)\" in their Common App activity description, they forget about the nonprofit and pass the leadership positions to the Juniors. The cycle continues.\nI hope the private college consultants on here can back me up but I think things like this are not too uncommon.\n\n\nBut while it's easy to blame the students starting the nonprofits, remember that there's parents, private counselors, and admissions counselors motivating this bullshit virtue-signaling. Furthermore, I personally believe that it's a cultural phenomenon. The same people starting and running these vessels of virtue-signaling are the ones running BLM ad campaigns for Coca-Cola (a company that targets obese/diabetic minority communities). The same people who land jobs at innocuous-looking consulting companies that help pharmaceutical companies entrap low-income communities into never-ending spirals of addiction. No matter what the altruistic-sounding vessel looks like (be it nonprofits, trips to Africa, etc.), those in power know how to play the game because they created the game. Sorry if this comment sounds very cynical.\n\nAlso to OP, thank you for bringing this topic up in this sub!",

Once they get into those schools the majority of them won't continue sustaining their nonprofits. The level of assistance one is willing to provide would also depend on how devoted they are to the cause. You can do lots of good with your resume-padding NPO for those one or two years that it is active but the fact that it won't last and you dropped it when you didn't need it to make yourself look good anymore is the true problem of this whole situation. So yes, it does matter why\u2014the why is literally what people on this post are stressing is important to remember: do you really want to help out these communities or are you exploiting them for your own selfish interests?",

Cool, that doesn\u2019t stop the entire myth being perpetuated that minorities are children who need to be monitored and coddled, worth nothing more than what you can gain out of their exploitation.

Why argue about one hyperspecific example when the vast majority of examples defy this? Sure, it\u2019s great if Timmy can actually make a useful nonprofit, but the overall point still stands when Chloe, Becca, Morgan, and Sarah are screwing things up. It\u2019s rather arbitrary to specify \u201cbad nonprofits\u201d just like it is to specify \u201cbad cops\u201d because if you\u2019re not a bad nonprofit then these things clearly don\u2019t address you. Not to mention, you freely admit the correlation between actually caring and the outcome, so again, your arguing down people who shame this kind of behavior is just outright odd. Just because there\u2019s an outlier doesn\u2019t mean that people shouldn\u2019t shame the practice when most outcomes aren\u2019t wholesome.\n\n And boiling things down \u201cgovernment and political issues\u201d is honestly baffling. All of these things are affected by socio-cultural attitudes, and I\u2019m assuming you understand this. These nonprofits play a role in continuing those attitudes, and just because a government changes something doesn\u2019t mean it goes away (eg the end of slavery or legalizing marijuana or banning female infanticide and child marriage). When something is ingrained in a culture, it\u2019s no longer a \u201cgovernment\u201d problem; it\u2019s a people problem, and when every high schooler ascribes to the mindset that *their contributions* couldnt *possibly* affect anything, the mindset spreads. Anyone living with the day to day effects of these should be aware (or become aware) of how this is way more than just a \u201cpolitical\u201d issue. And though one high school kid \u201ctrying to help out\u201d isn\u2019t going to change these standards, one high school kid becomes a dozen and a dozen becomes a hundred which becomes nationwide and nationwide perpetuation of these standards is why we\u2019re in this mess in the first place because re: no action exists in a vacuum. \n\nIf you truly believe in separating \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d nonprofits then there\u2019s no real need for you to disagree with these commenters who acknowledge their harmfulness anyway because clearly if they\u2019re being harmful, they\u2019re the bad ones, not the good ones. If you\u2019re serious about arguing in favor of \u201cthe good ones\u201d then you\u2019re not arguing anything at all because no one with a sound mind (and pretty much no one in this thread) would argue that a genuinely helpful nonprofit is a bad thing.",

          "text": ">ethically speaking the idea that achieving a greater good (or 'maximizing pleasure') as an endpoint doesn't justify the action itself. what those people are saying here is essentially that the ends justify the intentions or the principles behind the action. however, the consequences/results of an action are infinite so it's pretty much impossible to judge an action solely by its consequences. \n\nThis is very curious. If I understand this correctly, we cannot judge/justify an action by its result because we cannot measure them or understand them fully due to some reason. According to that logic, is anything judgable or justifiable?\n\nTake a blue boat, for instance. Can you really know its blue? Its grey for a dog, so isn't it grey? What about its temperature? A normal person might say its cold, a person whose hand was in a freezer would call it hot. Does that mean we cannot judge the boat and say its blue? No, we think about it and rule out biases. Then we judge it.\n\nDoesn't the same logic apply to actions? Yes, they're objectively unjudgeable, just like the boat. We still shouldn't say the color of the boat can't be known, because its practically blue.\n\nI feel that this ethical argument only makes sense in an objective philosophical vacuum, but I don't think one can apply that to reality. That's like describing the laws of physics in a different dimension and then applying them to this one.\n\nI'd like some clarification.\n\nI guess I'm arguing that since nothing is judgeable, everything is.",

      "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I took the advice I gave below, over the course of 3 years, and co-founded an organization that fit my community, for my strengths and interests, and fit the scale I could accomplish with the time I was willing to input, and it got me into my dream college and two different full ride scholarships. Maybe this wasn\u2019t the deciding factor, but I gotta say, there\u2019s a little ethos on my side here :)\n\nTo add on to some points above it\u2019s not like this is the ONLY way to give back to your community, which I\u2019ve seen some people use as an excuse as to why they\u2019re exploiting this. There\u2019s deficit somewhere in almost every facet of a community. Have old folks around? Maybe they need tech help, or free cyber security lessons. Have lots of kiddos? Create a system of used books, games, and toys for people to contribute and borrow from (although maybe not now, haha), which also helps out struggling families who may not have the funds for new nonessential fun things. Near the outdoors? Gather some friends, talk to your county recreation department and build a trail! In the city? Coordinate a group that meets on a schedule to tidy up parks and streets, make it a tradition. Lots of commuters? Design a carpool service, or work with your local government to fund something, if you want to go big. \n\nLocal governments, especially small ones, are usually always super willing to talk or provide resources for research, and sometimes even funding. \n\nLocal businesses are an AMAZING resource all around, from donations(funding, physical items, etc) to advertising to support, etc. \n\nPeople who are in your community will want to be a part of positive change within the community, and will be more receptive bof you can show that. Don\u2019t keep it broad (\u201cbettering the lives of minorities\u201d might not cut it if you really aren\u2019t sure how you want to do that, or if that\u2019s your passion. Now, \u201cimproving the understanding of cyber security and virtual awareness in the digital age for those at a technological disadvantage, namely the elderly\u201d pinpoints everything you need)\n\nThis has already been touched on, but is this YOUR thing? Do you JIVE with it? Can you get into the FLOW and do the hours just fly by when you work on it? Does it make you TICK? Does it make you EXCITED, ENERGETIC, and HYPED? You should be excited to talk about your process, your plan, your progress, not just your ideal. \n\nFind something that is niche to your community, something that has a demand, that\u2019s accomplishable, and that you are passionate about. Could not encourage this more.",

Also, I've changed my position on them refusing help. I feel like it's my morals speaking when I say that I'd rather not take help from selfish high schoolers, but that's just me. It's not productive for me to tell a disadvantaged community to refuse their help. HOWEVER, don't tell me refusing or not wanting help from selfish and inconsiderate high schoolers is \"selfish\". How can you consider ME selfish and not them? They're not even doing a good deed because they want to. They're doing it because they only care about themselves.",

Although helping others is a part of it, ngl I mostly did it cuz I thought it would be fun to have some responsibility while driving an ambulance lights and sirens. Same goes for my other ec's. I also got alot of shit from people before that said they can't afford emt school and I got the advantage cuz my daddy payed for it. Thats a load of shit (pardon ze French). I have an ant keeping hobby. May be weird to some but over the years I have built a good reputation in the community and started selling colonies. I had people all around my state contacting me. I made 1.5k this summer off of ANTS. There is no excuse. I did this while taking care of my lil bro. If someone wants a good ec or a job,  they can get it if they try enough. My dad came to this country with no English and 75 bucks for the whole family to share. He got a job   with broken English and became someone. Yea I got it much easier then him but still. The point I'm trying to make is, people shouldn't be making excuses.  And for the people with a call to action and drive to save the universe like superman or something, no one is impressed. No one cares if you feed an entire orphanage in Cambodia timmy. Just do what you think is fun and thats it. \n\n(Ps) sry for the rant and bad grammar, I'm abit stupid.",

I agree that the \"token\" approach or mindset is quite inappropriate, but there is a reason why students who actually make an impact in marginalized communities usually go far in college/MD/whatever admissions.\n\nThis is also usually limited by location. When I see someone from a rich private school in a rich area of town trying to act like they are actually doing something with their \"diversifying education\" organization, I cringe.\n\nAlso by nature altruism is usually a two-way street, at least in the eyes of the giver; e.g. see costly signaling theory. You can't just say \"they are taking advantage of X population to boost their resume.\" Of course that's probably true in some way, but if they are actually doing meaningful work/impact it shouldn't matter, in the end that is.",

They're also real uppity like some people on this sub are where they act like they're so much better than every one else because they do this certain EC. It sucks because my school doesn't have that many opportunities for good ECs besides that.",

And even if the students aren\u2019t passionate, these NPOs often end up being helpful anyway because the students have to actually do something if they want to be able to talk about it on their resume. It\u2019s no different than when students start fundraisers because it looks good for college or accumulate leadership positions to impress colleges or volunteer at animal shelters because it looks good to colleges. Colleges expect students to do these things because volunteering is now considered a standard part of the application, even though most students wouldn\u2019t do so otherwise. If students raise $4000 for a disease to look good for college, it\u2019s still money raised. And at worst, it harmed nobody. Some high schools even force students to have a certain amount of volunteer hours, even though most students obviously just do it to graduate.",
