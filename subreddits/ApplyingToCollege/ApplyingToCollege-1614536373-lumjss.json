  "title:": "My friend\u2019s obsession with doing everything for college admissions led him to publish his own book",
  "text": "Since I met him freshman year, he\u2019s been singularly focused on getting into a top college. Everything he does, even though he enjoys it I think, is for his admissions chances. He is single-mindedly focused on HYPSM. \n\nOver the summer, he read something on CC about how impressive it is to admissions officers to be a published author. He\u2019s a good writer, so he decided to write his own book and get it published by the admissions season. He began writing it solely for admissions and was grinding to get it finished and published by admissions time. But then he ended up falling in love with the book and would call me to talk about it for hours. \n\nAnyway, he got it published right before the RD deadline\ud83d\udc80",

But she then fell in love with everything that went into it, and she was hiring consultants and reworking the book. It's an amazing book with a great message. She didn't end up getting in, but she's at another amazing university right now, which she deserves.",

I one case, the kid seems to have lied completely: out of curiosity, I looked for his supposedly two-volume book on cultural anthropology that he claimed was on Amazon \u2014 zero, zip, nada.   \n\nThat said, who cares? Plenty of people start non-profits (backdate your blogs, it\u2019s obvious when your posts start just before admissions season), join clubs they don\u2019t care about (or start clubs so they can address the leadership questions some colleges ask), or claim to champion causes by joining organizations so they can say that they \u201craised awareness\u201d of this cause or that.  In an age of self-publishing, a book isn\u2019t much harder to whip up than a blog, provided you have the discipline to write it.  \n\nI don\u2019t envy any of you going through this process and a part of me really hates the fact that HS students are expected to navigate essays, ECs, and applications without ever having been prepared for it in HS. Hell, at least you can study for the SAT. \n\nGood luck.",
