  "title:": "Drop AP Stats?",
  "text": "Hi! Currently, I\u2019m struggling in AP Stats with a solid 80% and not confident in bringing it up to an A by the end of the quarter. (I know an 80 is not bad but my test scores always average never above an 80% and trying to raise it to an A seems like a stretch). It\u2019s also my senior year first semester so I\u2019m contemplating if I should drop AP Stats and change it to a TA period. I\u2019ve been able to maintain straight A\u2019s (with 1 b) throughout high school and want to maintain that, but am not confident in doing so with AP Stats.\n\nOne thing about dropping AP Stats is that it will likely drop my school rank in the top five because I won\u2019t get that additional weight in my GPA. I don\u2019t have much to show to colleges so I wanted to at least maintain my grades and high GPA to stand out just a bit.\n\nIf I drop AP Stats, I\u2019m thinking of possibly still taking the AP test for it as the main reason I first took AP Stats was to pass the exam so I wouldn\u2019t have to take it in the future. It also takes a lot of my time so I\u2019ll have more time to focus on COLLEGE APPS and my other AP classes",
