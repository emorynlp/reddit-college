  "text": "\\[title\\]\n\nAm applying to UT Austin and UTD, both with ApplyTexas. The application portal for UTD seems a bit lacking, there's is no LOR request system (unlike UT Austin's system, and Common App). I might have not search enough but the website is buggy.\n\nHow to I send LOR? Ask teacher to physically mail it to UTD? upload the pdf myself? (isn't there a waiver to not see the L0R)\n\nThank you for your help in advance",
