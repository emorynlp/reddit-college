  "text": "I'll get to the points so as not to waste time.\n\nI didnt do as well as I could in highschool because of many reasons. Got a sat score definitely not good for competitive colleges, but im very certain I can do very well if I study and take it in the future.\nMy HS transcript shows me struggling but then an upward trend in grades and difficulty of classes (i ended up with 5-6 AP classes senior year with 3.8 weighed gpa senior year). My total high school GPA was around a 3 though because of my previous years.\nMy sat was around 1300.\n\nAfter HS I joined the army and now have a better grip on my life. I'm taking college classes online and have a 4.0 GPA, straight As and around 30-50 credits (it varies depending on if military schooling gets credit or not).\n\nHow well of a chance do I have in getting into a top level competitive school. Given that I continue to have a very good college GPA, have shown a very high upward trend of improvement throughout highschool. And had a very significant military experience with things like leadership, teamwork, stress management, etc.\n\nAnother question I had is, what kind of classes should I take to later transfer. What classes would increase my chances and make me look better. So far I've taken math classes, English/writing, and language classes. I have schools like the ivy leagues in mind.",
