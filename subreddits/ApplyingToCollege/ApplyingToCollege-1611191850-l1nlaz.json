  "text": "I'm a Yale interviewer (25 f) who is smoking hot and I was interviewing some dude today (17 m). I was clearly giving him \"the look,\" as is a tradition in Yale interviews. I laughed at everything he said as to not make things awkward. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours about everything except Yale as I prefer putting my hand into a blender rather than talking about Yale for 3 hours. Towards the end of the interview, he leaned in for a kiss. I was caught off guard and shouted \"what are you doing?\" He looked really guilty and instantly apologized. Things awkwardly ended there. This happens a lot to me as I am smoking hot, so I am used to it. Shouldn't ruin his chances, hope he doesn't think that.\n\nTL;DR: My interviewee tried to kiss me at the end of our conversation. Happens a lot, hope he doesn't think his chances are ruined.",
