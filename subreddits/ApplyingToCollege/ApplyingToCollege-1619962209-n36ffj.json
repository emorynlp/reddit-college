              "text": "Eh, the sentiment is nice and all but it isn't so black and white as people try to make it out to be because they either agree when there's a small compromise between two good schools or flat out reject this statement when going to an average one.\n\nAny school you go to shapes your future in same way, shape or form - imo going to a more prestigious school just makes this definition of your future more feasible.\n\nIt's kinda like those coin multipliers in games like Subway Surfers. If you go to a local community college, your coin multiplier is 1x. Go to a slightly better school, maybe a state school, 1.2x-1.3x. Ivy League? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'll put it at \\~1.8x-2x. A school in the middle of the two? \\~1.5x multiplier.\n\nThe higher you go, the less the difference in multiplier matters, in that the outcome of work ethic is typically valued more. Work ethic defines your future, ofc, but a better college tends to rewards that work ethic in a way that defining your future becomes easier, i.e. through networking with with other 1.8x peeps, internship opportunities, job guarantees upon graduation, etc.\n\nSo if OP were to compromise and go with a 1.4x or 1.5x school over a 1.8x Princeton, then all things considered, it could be seen as a better choice, especially taxing in costs, moving, social life, etc.\n\nWhereas, for someone to turn down a 1.4x for a 1x - 1.1x for similar reasons, then work ethic still defines their future as much. It's just that it's a longer/rockier path to a similar post-grad set-up a 1.5x+ school can provide. Then again, this is coming from someone still in HS and purely anecdotal, so maybe I could be overvaluing the multiplier in some regard. Even so, I believe the premise holds.",

Prestige may help you get your foot in a few doors, but (in my opinion) if you can avoid debt without a massive drop in quality, seriously consider the no debt option. Read a bit about the effects of student debt if you haven\u2019t, or look up how credit card debt compounds, etc. Debt can be empirically measured, it\u2019s a little harder with prestige, but personally I would weigh the potential impact of debt very seriously against the prospects opened by a somewhat more prestigious school.",

But I also don't see what's wrong with my comment as I'd specifically said:\n\n>So if OP were to compromise and go with a 1.4x or 1.5x school over a 1.8x Princeton, then all things considered, it could be seen as a better choice, especially taxing in costs, moving, social life, etc.\n\nWeighing the financials and the life/satisfaction are integral parts for making a decision as such. It's being realistic and in this case, it was a positive for OP: which was why I wrote the entire comment to begin with. If it were to shit on OP's choices and see the compromise as a meh one, I'd have posted it somewhere else.\n\nOP knows they're compromising, so I figured I might as well lay out what the compromises are with regards to the feel-good 'work ethic defines your future!' It does, but have that .5x more holds that work ethic in higher regard. Imo sprinkling a bit of realism in what I find to be a too positive sentiment that speaks more as a feel-good consolation than a practical one isn't the same as not being positive, hence negative.\n\nAnyway, I don't really frequent this sub often, so I figured I'd post this here. To me, at least, making someone feel better entails a bit more of how the compromise is a better net choice rather than relaying how the compromise doesn't affect your life in the grand scheme of things. Especially for other fellow lurkers and commentors; the work-ethic sentiment is far too black and white and this is a context where relaying its subjective value is important.",

And it gives number for agencies other than congress where most repayments seem to be to attract engineers...but it was something like $76m and the law says only $10K in one year, and up to $60K per employee...and then it does NOT directly say how much has been given to members of congress. But they threw all that stuff in at the beginning to make it seem like this isn\u2019t \u201ca benefit for ALL family members of Congress \u201c and then just sort of ends by saying \u201coh and there was another $9MM paid out to \u2018other agencies\u2019.

Those will be transferable to wherever you go. Even just simple things like juggling multiple projects and extracurriculars pays huge dividends in being able to manage time in college -- and that's true anywhere, not just in the most competitive schools. And that's not to mention leadership, group projects, study skills, getting a leg up in intro classes from APs, etc.\n\nPrinceton accepting you means they think you pretty much have everything you need already -- they can afford to be that picky with admissions.",
