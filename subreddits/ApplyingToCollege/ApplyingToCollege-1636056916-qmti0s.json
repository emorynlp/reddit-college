      "text": "Is it asking for a deposit to hold your spot? If so maybe wait a while. \n\nHonestly even if you pay the deposit and sign up for housing you can always back out at any point for any reason (you\u2019ll forfeit deposits but that\u2019s the only consequence) \n\nThey are trying to see how serious you are and assess how many spots are actually full so they know how many other people to admit. So if you really think you\u2019ll go, say yes. If you aren\u2019t sure, you have until May 1 to decide. If at any point between now and then you realize you just won\u2019t be going there, for sure, then say no and let them offer the seat to someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed some schools extend really early admissions offers and the best housing fills up way before May, so keep an eye on it. But no need to claim your spot in November if you aren\u2019t sure.",
