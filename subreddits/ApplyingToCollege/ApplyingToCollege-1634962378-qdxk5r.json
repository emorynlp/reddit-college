  "text": "Disclaimer: this is just my 2 cents and I\u2019m NOT trying to be negative Nancy, however I do feel that it is important to keep in mind that the whole moving far and having the \u201ccollege experience\u201d is lowkey just a scam to get you and your parents to pay more money for college. I mean yes if there\u2019s some reason you really want to go to x college then by all means do so. I\u2019m just saying that at the end of the day, no matter where you go, even if it\u2019s at a college near home your still going to get different experiences, friends and a degree. So just don\u2019t feel pressured to get out there and do things just for the \u201ccollege experience\u201d - freshman in college",

But for what? 250k in debt for undergrad? You will have cc classmates, state school classmates, transfer classmates, all those in med school. Please. Dont waste money for prestige if you are premed",

Dont go 50k+ if possible. You dont want to be paying off student debt while your peers are buying a house and starting their lives",
