  "text": "For some reference I\u2019m applying to 6 UCs and 5 CSUs. \n\nI cannot believe how many people are applying for CS this year especially to my top schools\n\nI got into cs following my interest in game design my freshman year and found I had a lot more fun programming games rather than designing them. I had no clue this many people would be applying for cs majors and i had no clue it was this competitive. \n\nHonestly, even with it expanding, how will the tech industry even compensate for this many people with the same degree? Are this many people genuinely infatuated with computer science or are they just applying because of the salary outlook?\n\nPeople on this sub have been super helpful with advice for me so far but jesus there\u2019s literally no chance I get into a cs program at even a <35% acceptance rate college especially after reading about a kid who didn\u2019t get into my top colleges that was so incredibly qualified.\n\nI like to think that i don\u2019t care that much about prestige and since i really do love computer science then id be happy to study it anywhere, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, in the inevitable event that I get rejected from the UCs and the top CSUs, I won\u2019t get the same opportunities then I would at higher rated universities.\n\nFor my own good i\u2019m going to leave this sub until i apply and consider different engineering majors like electrical or aerospace or biomedical but I\u2019m open to criticism/advice. Thank you for reading yet another stressed seniors rant.",

      "text": "CS is an enormous career field  -- there are more software developer jobs than electrical, civil, and mechanical engineers combined in the US.  That's current jobs - not accounting for it growing faster.  Looking at [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) can give you some good perspective. \n\nThere are definitely a lot of people who apply just for the salary as well which definitely makes it tougher for college admissions - especially in California where you run into a lot of capacity issues in the public universities.  You see some related issues if you look at subs like r/cscareerquestions for first starting out -- once you are working in the field finding the next job is much easier.\n\nDepending on what things you like about CS you can certainly consider other fields - both engineering ones like mechanical or electrical  (which have much bigger job markets than aerospace or BME), or more math heavy ones like statistics or data science.",

      "text": "\"I cannot believe how many people are applying for CS this year especially to my top schools\"\n\nthis is every year for the past decade or so. I wouldn't worry about it too much. If you are truly passionate about CS, I would still apply CS. For me, someone who loves CS, I rather get a CS degree from any T100 university rather than something else (unrelated to CS) from schools like MIT/Harvard.\n\nLike, your Harvard degree is useless if you can't get a job from it (or not interested in the jobs in that field).",

People who just aren't gifted or interested in CS will slowly drop out as it gets too difficult. \n\nShotgun to all of the CS T20s, with a few safeties, and work your damn hardest for the next few years. I believe that with that you can still be successful.",
