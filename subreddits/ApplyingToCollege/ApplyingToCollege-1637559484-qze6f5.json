  "text": "Hi A2C, recently I qualified for AIME (pretty sure I did after checking the released answers) but had to take it online due to some issues with the administration process at my school. I noticed some schools, when reporting AMC scores, have a check box for you to indicate whether you took it online. Will it affect the validity of my score, since everybody knows that there are many issues with cheating if it's administered online? Really hoping it doesn't have too much of an effect since it's one of my more important awards.",
