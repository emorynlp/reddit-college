  "text": "I\u2019m 16 and had to drop out of high school due to my father dying and me being left an orphan. I now have my GED and was wondering how going to university will work. I plan to go to the local community college for two years, but I really want to go to an actual 4 year college even though I can\u2019t afford it. Say I were to do perfect in all my classes at community college, would that substitute my hs grades when applying to schools? I had a 4.0 gpa before I dropped out, does that matter? What would the likelihood of getting into an ivy school or something be if I did amazing at cc? I don\u2019t actually intend on applying to an ivy school cause that\u2019s a child\u2019s dream lol, but just wondering how grades will work. So yeah, when I finish cc how will applying to an actual university work? And would my financial aid be more or less for having two dead parents? I\u2019m very confused about college, sorry.",

      "text": "Sorry for your loss.\n\nFinancial aid will generally be good for you - you are an independent student so only your own income matters for those purposes.  Both public in-state schools and private colleges and universities might be affordable. You should fill out a FAFSA soon - aid isn't just for four year schools.\n\nYou are also eligible for larger federal student loans as an independent student - obviously you want to minimize debt, but direct federal loans are a normal thing to have to borrow to pay for college. Try to avoid private loans.\n\nGetting into an Ivy school or similar is incredibly hard, even if you do great at a CC.  It's fine to dream big and shoot your shot at those schools, but your state public universities are probably more realistic. Good CC grades absolutely make up for any poor high school ones.\n\nIf you know what field you want to pursue, look at the four year degree that best fits that at your in-state options. They should have a degree map that will help you pick the CC classes that meet those requirements so you can graduate in less time (the classes that meet the in-state school requirements are also the ones most likely to work at other options too).",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply. I was mainly talking about ivy schools out of hypotheticals because of their financial aid awards lol; I\u2019ll most likely just aim for some random state college near me. If I do well at cc do I have to transfer to a university or could I start from the beginning at a university? I read online that a lot of people do 2 years of cc and then 2 years at uni, but is that the only way to do it, or could I do 2 in cc and 4 in university?",

              "text": "You can do two and then four - usually students just want to not spend that much on college.  I think it's best to aim to finish in four years total at the start - that way if you end up changing majors, or do a co-op experience, or anything like that and your schedule stretches out you are still in a good spot. For many majors five years ends up being typical, or you could end up in a spot where you can add a master's degree.\n\nAlso some aid is limited in time - you can only get Pell grants for up to six years for example.\n\nFor financial aid, the main thing to keep in mind is that it's not just those most selective schools that can meet your need.  Plenty of liberal arts colleges and other universities have big endowments and could meet your need.",

I\u2019ve been looking around online, and the state colleges near me didn\u2019t really have much info on their websites about financial aid and scholarships and stuff, and I have literally no one to ask about the information.",

                      "text": "[https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources](https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources)\n\nSecond chart here is pretty useful - look at schools where the average percent of need met is very high.  It doesn't always work for out of state public options, but it's still helpful. Occidental and St. Olaf are good examples of schools that do a good job of meeting full need without being crazy selective. Berea College is one where pretty much every student has significant need.\n\nThe net price calculator is going to be the best way to look at specific options -- you can just google \"<school name> net price calculator\" to find it. Every school that takes federal money is required to have one - it will show you what kind of aid students in similar financial situations to yours received in the previous year.",

And yes, your situation is horrible I\u2019m so sorry, but that would grant you more aid I believe. You could qualify for a pell grant at CC.",
