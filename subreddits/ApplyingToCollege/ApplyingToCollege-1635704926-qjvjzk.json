  "text": "Hey! I was really just wondering if the additional information essay is necessary. I am applying to Ivy's, and some websites say that I must write at every single opportunity to show that I am making an effort and really invest in the application, but others say that this section should simply be used to explain a decline in grades or other negatively impacting circumstances. What do you think?",
