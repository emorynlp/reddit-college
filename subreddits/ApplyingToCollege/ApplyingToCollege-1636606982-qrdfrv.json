  "title:": "I'm a minority student / lower class who attends a T25. If you are in a similar boat, I implore you to read through this and consider it when choosing a college. AMA",
  "text": "I go to the University of Michigan, a T25 school. I am a Junior. I was proud of that achievement going in . . .A lot happened and now, that's harder to say. So I am making a post to share my experience about how difficult it can be to be a minority at a T25 . .. I'd do my research and really consider who you are and what you might be walking into. So first off, my school ends up getting lots of rich kids.\n\nProb will be the case for any school with high cost. While the differences in money alone may be something you can look past, the difference in perspective these kids carry from having come from a different background can leave you feeling isolated in a sense. You may not feel this at all, but I've tried to share my perspective in multiple places at my school, from the school Discord server to student government. Most of the time, what I say whooshes over people's heads, and any hope that your voice will be heard and change the school for the better? diminishes before your very eyes. What do you hope to change within the school you may ask?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, at my school, the disability office is very understaffed and the therapy service is too, and is kind of a joke. Do you know for sure that these services at your T20 are available? I'd look into it. I got by well in school, but deeply struggled in college, due to undiagnosed at the time ADHD. Getting proper therapy and medication to treat it has been a nightmare frankly, and I've had to do that while handling the large coursework load expected at a T20 school, but they totallyyyy care about your mental health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I feel surrounded by people who won't listen or do much to help minority students, school has bad disability / mental health services, it isn't surprising I ended up walking around filled with bitterness as I felt I didn't really belong. My age difference didn't help. Many peoplle manage to enjoy their experience at a T20 and that is great. You can easily fall into a pit of feeling misunderstood, strugglingto make friends as there are so few people like you, and jsut be struggling with an academic rigour and other stresses you didn't have beforre . . .I'd consider / look into how these things are at your school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThought I'd have more to write, but that's the general idea I wanted to get out. Feel free to ask me questions about my own experience to help you in your journey!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Oh, something I wanted to add: if you find you have a disability, don't talk too much about it, thanks to the TikTok trend and people just naturally thinking this way about disabilities, they'll think you're looking for pity points if you talk too much about it, even though it impacts every aspect of your life. Just in general, people here in many cases aren't super kind / patient about understanding people going through a different experience, and will jsut make you feel bad for strugling. Def not all of them, but this is DEFINITELY something I struggled with. This was ESPECIALLY true in the popular CS major crowd.",

          "text": "So, basically, it's called CAPS, and it's known for being short term therapy. You can only have a goal that will take 4 weeks or so to achieve, or they will tell you to go to therapy. If you are in therapy, they jsut flat out won't help you unless there is a workshop they can register you for. So look out for that in UMich and other schools you apply for.",

      "text": "I\u2019m very sorry this has been your experience. Mine at Cornell has been very similar. Something that is never discussed is the level of elitism most people at these schools feel. The other day I counted 6 G-Wagons on campus. The level of entitlement is also astonishing. A couple years ago, I had a guy ask me if my parents would buy me a BMW for college \u201cif I asked them for one.\u201d When I said no, he was shocked. \n\nThey try to espouse their mental health services, but it is seriously lacking. Therapy appointments are 25 minutes, and the psychiatrists are on like a 2 month waitlist. You also can\u2019t transfer medication in or out of the pharmacy without losing your remaining refills. \n\nAlso, while I am a part of minority groups, I cannot relate to the race part. However, I also have found it very difficult to connect with people. Administration is also abysmal, and will not listen to any of our concerns. I honestly think it\u2019s just the school. A lot (obviously, not all) of people here are only concerned with themselves. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t attend a highly selective school, but you also shouldn\u2019t let prestige blind your decision.",

For me, I'm not asked about material stuff like that, I just get people downplaying my achievements in the CS vein or emphasizing I won't do well if I'm struggling with this \"simple\" class. Like, no shit, thanks for emphasizing that, though.\n\nEDIT: Ohhh and can't forget the people fretting about getting a 100 vs a 95 because \"Otherwise I'd be worried about passing like you, no offense\" I GOT THAT ANSWER FROM TWO PEOPLE, ONE CS ONE PSYCH MAJOR!\n\nAlso, my race itself isn't a huge issue but the neighborhood I grew up in and the attitudes I grew up around and how very different the mentalities are here. Hahaha, All I have to say to them is, minorities aren't a monolift, you don't speak for all of us. You're right on some things, GROSSLY oversimplifying others\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Fixed my poor wording",
