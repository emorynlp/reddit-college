  "text": "My house is a hot-hell... Brother is a cranky kid mother has no control of temper dad has control but when he looses it he looses it big... School is almost over and I have everything I need... all I need now  is study and do well in remaining exams I'm good but I just can't \ud83d\ude22\nIv been studying grinding for many many hours a day but I'm confused and anxious I keep thinking about how it can be once I'm in college or how bad it will be if I don't... Be it while eating or biking or even studying wkuahwhsyw can't meet people cause covid means no grp study or study with friends but I flourish well in that envt and studying alone confuses me so much more plus covid has been haunting for 1.5 yrs Iv still not gotten over it like I was something else b4 covid and I just don't feel that good anymore... I just need a fresh start quick and can't wait for college it's only 6 months of grind more but I can't get myself to do it AAAAAAAA \nI always imagine when I get out I won't have to worry about shouting family members or have to deal with studying alone so much instead get a grp study or smth and it sounds really great \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 thing is I won't get it if I loosen the grind now but it's happening",

      "text": "I\u2019m feeling the exact same way you are, especially with my family, since we have a bit of a complicated relationship at times. Something that\u2019s been motivating me is the idea that soon, I won\u2019t have to see them every day. I\u2019ve been following that mindset and overall, I\u2019m found it pretty helpful. That may just be me, though.\n\n>>can\u2019t meet new people cause of covid means no grp study or study with friends\n\n\nDoes your school have a peer tutoring center, or do you have access to a free tutoring program? I would highly suggest checking either of those options out if you do! It gives you a mode of communication during Covid, which at times, isn\u2019t easy to find. I\u2019ve gotten tutored in different subjects, including having people read over college essays and help with SAT studying and it\u2019s been SUPER helpful! \n\n>>I\u2019m confused and anxious and I keep thinking about how it can be once I\u2019m in college or how bad it will be if I don\u2019t...\n\n\nI don\u2019t know the semantics of how your process is going, but don\u2019t forget to add safety colleges! I have a few and I\u2019ve made sure that they\u2019re far away from home as well. \n\nIf you need any extra support, feel free to reach out. The application process is hard for everyone, but we\u2019re all struggling together. Good luck on your application process, I believe in you!\n\nedit: Formatting",
