The Vast majority of high school students can't cure cancer, run a 6 figure company and juggle school work and hormones.

Students I know personally that haven't taken AP CHEM and or AP BIO (Basic Undergrad Bio and Chem) classes are doing PHD fucking research. Bullshit the majority of PHD research requires an excellent level of four years of difficult classes and good grades plus countless graduate school classes.",

As for resources such as requiring a supercomputer cluster to run your code, you should try your hand at the multiple free places. A good starting place will be Google Colab. You don't need to pay anything but you need good, stable internet. As for getting scientific papers, use SciHub. \n\nAgain: yes, it's a lot of work but it's not entirely impossible. You can get your work published at the Journal of Emerging Investigators (where my work is under peer review). You could end up also participating in some science fair but I didn't do it (It's nearly impossible to participate in such things where I live).",

Take Jack Andraka for example, his pancreatic sensor research has been heavily scrutinized. \n\nA 2011 article published by Sharon et al. refutes many of Andraka's claims about the specificity of using mesothelin as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the group showed that mesothelin serum levels in healthy donors were not statistically different from serum levels in pancreatic cancer patients.\\[16\\] Dr. Ira Pastan, who discovered mesothelin, said that Andraka's method \"makes no scientific sense. I don't know anybody in the scientific community who believes his findings.\"\\[17\\] George M. Church, professor of genetics at Harvard University, also raised concerns about the cost, speed, and sensitivity claims.\\[1\\] The novelty of Andraka's work has also been questioned. In 2005, seven years before Andraka won the Intel ISEF, a group of researchers at Jefferson Medical College and the University of Delaware reported a carbon-nanotube based sensor for use in breast cancer diagnostics that uses a methodology nearly identical to Andraka's purportedly novel methodology.\\[18\\] In addition, a carbon-nanotube based sensor similar to Andraka's was reported in 2009 by Wang et al., a group of researchers at Jiangnan University and the University of Michigan,\\[19\\] and a carbon-nanotube based sensor for applications in cancer diagnosis was reported in a 2008 paper by Shao et al. that used a methodology similar to Andraka's.\\[20\\] \n\nSource [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack\\_Andraka#Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka#Criticism)",

          "text": "Hi! So I just want to add my insight as a first year college student who ended up choosing the cheaper of two options. Option 1: Was my dream school for a while and is very cheap with financial aid and school scholarships Option 2 was NYU lol very expensive, but became the school I saw myself going to. \n\nNow I resent this argument that you can go anywhere and you will get a job. While that might be the case for some job professions its not for all and the school you go definitely starts to matter. Specifically in my case, I want to go to law school, do your research on getting a job as a lawyer. If you want to get a good job, the one that everyone pictures when they picture a lawyer you have to go to one of the T14 schools aka top 14, these are your ivies, your NYU, your Georgetown. These are very expensive and selective and usually only pick from the top schools as well. THIS MEANS IT MATTERS VERY MUCH WHERE YOU GO FOR UNDERGRAD. Same goes for doctors and med school, same goes for people who want to get into a graduate program. All I am saying is that this argument that it is viable for everybody to go to the cheapest option isn't fair considering that everyone has a different path, no it is not just about the societal prestige. Trust me no one pays 100k for societal prestige its for the opportunities, education, and leg-up it gives you. \nThere is a difference in the education you receive AND the student body that you learn with. I have been regretting my decision a lot because come to find that this school has a big party culture and exploring academic interests is really frowned upon by the student body. This should and does have an effect on a students decision. College is an investment and how much you put into (aka $$) is how much you will get out of it. SO yes it sucks when you don't have money to make your big college investment.\n\nNot saying community college or technical schools are bad either. It's your path, but just like I won't judge you for going to your choice, you don't need to be judging people who choose Harvard over a state school.",

              "text": "I am fine with people going to top20 schools. The problem comes when they start complaining about the cost when they know what they got themselves into and the negative stigma they think of other people who attend schools that they think are lower than them.\n\nI understand how you think going to a top20 school matters for some occupations, but that does not mean an individual cannot strive for that occupation they desire. Many people dont go to top20 and are great doctors, lawyers, etc.\n\nI am doing pre-med track right now and recently got into Chapel Hill and still waiting for my other decisions. I did community college first but will that affect my chances of medical school? No of course not as long as I am still successful when I transfer and do well on the MCAT. I know many friends that got into top medical schools and took the community college route.\n\nThe point of my argument is saying that not going to a top college doesnt mean you cannot get the job of your dream. The amount of resilience, determination, and perseverance one goes through and is successful even though they started from a community college speaks a lot from that alone.\n\nIt is truly sad that you think medical schools care if you started at a community college and will negatively affect your chances of becoming a doctor. There are other factors to consider when applying to medical school. \n\nIf one is poor, goes to a community college, transfer, still does well, does well on the mcat, has research expierence and volunteer expierence and campus involvement, it actually is beneficial because people who went to community colleges are underrepresented in med school admissions and brings diversity when deciding applicants.\n\nYou can even look online right now on pathway to science where they list many research programs and when I was applying to many biomedical research programs, they said, \"Community college applicants are encouraged to apply\". \n\nNo patient gives a shit if you went to Harvard or some other Top20, they care if you are doing your job as a doctor and providing quality care. A top 20 college certificate doesnt excuse you for being trash at your occupation. Nor does attending a top 20 means you will excell in your occupation. \n\nAs I said, **it is about what you do, not necessarily what you attend**",

They can't control how many applications they receive and they can't spend millions of dollars (even billions) to extend their facilities and keep an admission rate above 10%. There is no blame to be put to someone, but if you could hold anyone accountable for it, that would be the students themselves. Universities don't force you to create non-profits, run 6-figure companies and participate in cancer cure research, you do it in order to gain an edge over someone else. That being said, the amount of resources some people have that allow them to do such stuff is absurd and probably puts regular folk in disadvantage. Idk why but I feel like you don't need to do all that stuff to get in an elite college, just show that you are passionate about something and that you want to be a leader in it. The fact you have already been a leader in some way just serves as an example and a talking point, but not having such experience could also be a talking point.\n\nInstead of talking about doing cancer research, talk about how hard it is to get to doing cancer research; talk about how you made the most out of your current situation because that's what colleges are about and if you didn't make the most of what you have available, then probably you are not gonna make the most out of what this college will offer you and thus someone else who will is probably more fit to be there than you.\n\nDon't take the \"you\" as a personal attack, I understand how much competitive it is, I stress about them all day and night, I am just trying to make a general point here.",

I know a handful of people in my class who were more than smart enough (and personality fits) to succeed at schools they applied to. One friend applied to Northwestern and another to Stanford. Best school first guy got into was Purdue and second guy got into Penn. First guy is absolutely brilliant and could honestly probably hang with people at any top school, and second guy works harder than any student I've ever met. But because the first guy didn't have crazy academic EC's and the second guy had ONLY a 33 on his ACT as his weakpoint. Bleh. Both guys deserved to get into the schools they wanted IMO, but there are just so many applicants its no longer about deserving, its about only living to get into those schools.",

I can\u2019t really find anyone saying this point, so here goes.\n\nThere are many different colleges in this country, and many are considered more prestigious than others. However, this has little impact on the quality of the education that you get. It\u2019s not about what the school brings to you, it\u2019s about what you bring to the school that will determine your success. You don\u2019t need to go to an Ivy League school or Stanford or MIT or something like that, when other universities are just as high quality, at least as far as undergraduate degrees are concerned. Basically, just be open-minded and don\u2019t let the prestige or renown of the school be your only reason that you apply there.",
