  "text": "Hi! I am applying to a summer program for which I am asked to talk about 3 activities. I am planning to include \"community work\" since I work in 3 organisations. But the boxes where I would write them down look like I can add only one as an activity. Need your opinion, should I write down about all the organisations and my position there? Or do I write about only one.\nP.S.  I have two other very important activities which I CANNOT exclude.\nTIA. \n[Sample ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18KTxYHVq9D-gBM0SyJ6b5yBnO1DhpzpQ/view?usp=drivesdk)",

Hence, I'm planning to add 1 in the voluntary section, merge another with writing section bc I write content for that org. and exculde another :( (sounds ok?)\nActually the one I'm planning to exculde was kinda important to me but I'm taking a LOR from the 1st one, hence the only option remained is to exclude this org :( This is why I asked here wtd. Thanks a bunch for your time ^_^",
