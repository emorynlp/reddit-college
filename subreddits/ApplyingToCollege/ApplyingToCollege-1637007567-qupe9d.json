  "text": "Basically I'm an international but with US citizenship and the FAFSA said my EFC is around 5k which is quite low compared to what we thought we would have to pay (NPC's suggested otherwise as well). I'm wondering what colleges will say about this. Also I would like to ask when I will know when I would know how much I have to pay, when decisions come out on the 15th (if I even get accepted lol).\n\nThe form is filled out correctly, the IRS did it. Thanks in advance! :DD",

The college will recalculate. The NPC for the college is the better indicator.\n\n>would like to ask when I will know when I would know how much I have to pay, when decisions come out on the 15th\n\nAssuming you submitted your FA paperwork on time, you will get an FA offer with your decision or shortly after.",
