  "text": "Hi, I\u2019ve been doing a pretty big research project with a local professor. It\u2019s to be submitted to a conference, but the conference result won\u2019t be here till Feb. The impact of that conference is pretty large (>15) so just wondering what I should do to show my work here.\n\n1) link the GitHub repo I\u2019ve been contributing on.\n\n2) link the pdf of the paper that had been submitted?\n\n3) just say that it is pending submission to X conference.\n\nAny advice on which one is best? Thanks!",
