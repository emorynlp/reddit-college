  "text": "im a sophomore. i self-studied calc bc in freshman year and wasn't able to take the ap exam due to scheduling conflicts with other finals/covid. im taking multivar calc and linear algebra now through stanford pre-collegiate online. will probably continue on to abstract algebra/differential equations next year. i will receive stanford continuing studies credit for all of these classes on a transcript.\n\nim wondering if i still should take the calc bc exam this year after finishing calc 3/if its necessary? im really just thinking about how AOs will perceive this, not about me needing the credit for uni since i already have it.\n\nthanks! anything would be helpful :)",

However, depending on which university you end up, you may want it for credit. Just because you got credit for any of these courses, does not mean that any of that credit will transfer.",
