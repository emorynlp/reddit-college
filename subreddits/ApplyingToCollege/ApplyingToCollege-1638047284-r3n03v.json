      "text": "I didn't do CS so I can't say *exactly*, but I believe Waterloo specifically asks you if you intend on doing the Euclid. It's their contest and they know it's a grade 12 level contest in April, so I doubt they expect you to have a Euclid score before that.  Canadian schools typically do rolling admissions so it's perfectly possible they'll wait until you get a score if they feel it would be a major determining factor in your decision. But I'm not 100% sure. That being said, considering how competitive Waterloo CS is I'd say you definitely missed out on not doing the CSMC, but I wouldn't say that that alone is a dealbreaker. \n\nDon't have experience with UofT (my program didn't require anything supplemental), but I assume the process would be somewhat similar.\n\nHope that helps",

      "text": "You don't need to do the Euclid or CSMC for UofT. They get international students all the time who haven't done them. If you've done American contests like the AMC that's enough, but not mandatory either.\n\nYou should def do the Euclid if you intend to apply to UWaterloo, however.\n\nFYI in North America Waterloo seems to be the latest school to send decision letters. They might send a small handful of early acceptances, but if you don't get one, you might not get it til after May 1. So don't panic, but you might have to commit somewhere else just in case.",
