If I apply to MET I\u2019m considering either Bioengineering or EECS. \n\nOr maybe I\u2019ll just apply to CS within the College of L&S and apply to Haas my junior year, and pursue scuffed MET. It depends on if the declaration policy is changed before 2023 applications.\n\n~~Also unrelated but I joined the waitlist for Tau~~\n\nThanks!",
