      "text": "I had an interview with them a month and a half ago. Funny thing is, I decided not to apply so I interviewed with a college I'm not even trying to get into lmao. The questions were all standard interview ones (strengths, weaknesses, teamwork skills, examples of teamwork scenarios, etc). The only one that threw me off was \"what's one thing you'd change about your school?\"",

      "text": "they were pretty basic questions and a lot of them were geared towards my interests and extracurriculars/activities so i kind of rambled lol :,) but i somehow ended up getting paired with a student interviewer with the same major as i'd been wanting to go into so i got to ask them a few questions about what they like abt the program and what research opportunities are available through that major. it was honestly pretty chill tbh ! it felt more like a convo rather than an interview the more it progressed, which definitely calmed my nerves a bit. overall a cool experience and i learned a lot abt cwru that i probably couldn't find on their website :)",
