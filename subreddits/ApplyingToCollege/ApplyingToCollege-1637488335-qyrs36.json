Not to excuse liberal/leftist kids (which includes me lol) from their own sets of elitism/classist/biases, but I think it\u2019s reasonable to say schools with strong leftist activism cultures will generally have more accepting student bodies",

As for its competitiveness, it goes hand in hand with the competitiveness at the bay area high schools, but this is often unmanageable for others.",
