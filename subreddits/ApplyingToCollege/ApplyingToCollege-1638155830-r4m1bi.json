I\u2019d focus a lot on strengthening the EC/award section too\u2014you have a whole semester left ahead and it\u2019s actually a LOT of time to significantly strengthen extracurricular involvement and impact. My ECs went from basic club membership in sophomore year to having leadership, multiple awards, and my biggest ECs just in junior year. You can make this period of time super impactful if you seize the right opportunities. \n\nMaybe during winter break or when the year starts winding down around May/June, start researching colleges and scholarships (if necessary). I was making my college list up as I applied in senior year and can confirm from experience that it\u2019s not ideal. Even if essays don\u2019t need to all be finished over summer break, a college list and a couple essay ideas ideally should be.",

              "text": "My awards were mostly in the speech and debate category. I got myself involved with a wider community and went to a bunch of tournaments in first semester, then used my expanded experience to apply for adjudicator positions in second semester for local tournaments (even though they\u2019re typically not open to students) and organize a novice debate tournament. For me it was just a getting more involved and not being afraid to put my name out there and trying out for opportunities. If you\u2019ve done organizing/leading type stuff, you\u2019re ahead of where I was at the end of sophomore year. \n\nI\u2019m not as familiar with what tangential opportunities are available related to what you\u2019ve already done, but a general piece of advice I\u2019d give is to just throw yourself at opportunities that interest you even if it seems unlikely you\u2019d get them, based on your age/experience/anything. I thought I had 0 shot at adjudicator positions only grad student debaters got, but I got them. I thought I had 0 shot at getting an internship in my first year, but I have an internship lined up for the rest of my school year. You really don\u2019t know unless you try, and I want to encourage people in general to just shoot their shot, because I let my lack of confidence keep myself from doing it and it only hurt me. Sorry I couldn\u2019t offer advice more specific to your situation, but if you\u2019re already on this sub, you got this!",
