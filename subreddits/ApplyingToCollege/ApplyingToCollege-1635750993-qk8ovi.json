  "text": "Currently crying because I\u2019m not satisfied with any of my essays (common app+3 supplementals). And the deadline is in 8 hours. \nI feel shitty about myself because of my terrible time management. \nI have a clear first choice school, but I don\u2019t think my application is good enough yet\u2026\n\nIs it *really* true that ED applicants don\u2019t have a higher chance of getting in? Everyone else seems to be applying ED\u2026\n\nI\u2019m also an international student who needs financial aid. Will I have better chances EDing??\n\nI just need someone to convince me RDing will be okay\u2026",

Up until this point I\u2019m still not satisfied with any of them yet. This is so frustrating that I have to take a break from it.\n\nI suck at waiting; I can\u2019t handle 1-2 months of waiting when my friends already received their decisions from ED. I\u2019m not sure about the chances of getting in applying for RD either. Guess that I\u2019ll keep on pushing myself then",

Sometimes, a second opinion helps.\n\nBut if they are truly not ready to be submitted, I'd suggest waiting until RD. You want to put your best foot forward, which may mean a bit more work to get there. Good luck!",
