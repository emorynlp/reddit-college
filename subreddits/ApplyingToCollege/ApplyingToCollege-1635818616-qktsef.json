  "title:": "Application decision made without looking at my application (and they won't tell me what the decision is???) UTD",
  "text": "I applied to UT Dallas in August. My counselor moved slowly so my transcript and all my other materials were posted to my UTD account on September 15. The admission decision was supposed to come between 4-6 weeks (my friend got his the very first day of the 4 weeks) but mine hasn't come yet after almost 7 weeks.\n\nI emailed my admissions counselor about the issue, and he said that a decision was made and it would update and show on my account the next day. Friday came, still nothing. I emailed him Friday afternoon and he got back to me today, saying the results would be in \"soon.\"\n\nHere's where it gets... weird.\n\nI applied with Commonapp, which shows when an application is viewed by the college. Mine still says downloaded instead of viewed. \n\nHow could a decision be made without looking at my application?? Did they deny me automatically?? Is common app just being weird?? Any help or advice will be much appreciated. ':)",
