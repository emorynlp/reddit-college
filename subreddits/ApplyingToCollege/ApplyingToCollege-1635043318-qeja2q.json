  "text": "we all know last year was crazy bc of the increase in applicants due to test-optional + gap year students. but now that these gap year students have applied, will this year\u2019s cycle be less selective than last year\u2019s? or is the number of applicants going to continue rising? what are your thoughts?",

      "text": "I feel like Class of 2022 will show the true impact that Covid had on students. Think about it, Covid-19 didn\u2019t hit when Class of 2020 were undergoing the application process so the affect the pandemic had didn\u2019t show in their high school grades. Class of 2021 got affected by Covid-19 in the last quarter of their junior year and only got like the first half of their senior year affected in terms of grades for applications. Class of 2022 got their final part of their sophomore year fucked up and their whole junior year fucked up. Whether this means applications will be more or less competitive for us is something I don\u2019t know though.",
