  "title:": "How long do I have to be at a virtual info session?",
  "text": "I feel stupid to be asking this, but: should I stay all the way through a virtual info session, or is it all right if I leave in the middle? They all recycle the same information I already know through scouring their website, and I am always just so bored in these webinars. I'm going purely for reasons of demonstrated interest. But to demonstrate that interest, do I have to stay through the whole thing? Can I leave sooner and still get the brownie points? I truly just don't know how admissions officers use the info sessions to gauge interest.",
