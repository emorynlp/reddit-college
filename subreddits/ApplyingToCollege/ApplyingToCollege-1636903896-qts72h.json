I think that The Ivy League (also known as The Ancient Eight) is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising eight private research universities in the Northeastern United States. The term Ivy League is typically used beyond the sports context to refer to the eight schools as a group of elite colleges with connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism. Its members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University.",

If you look at fortune 500 CEOs, Harvard and Cornell have the most alumni on the list out of any other college. If you want to do finance, going to an ivy basically guarantee you 6 figures out of college. \n\nAlmost all The students are incredibly driven and intelligent. There are students that have literally been featured on time or forbes that are in your discussions and clubs. \n\nAnd finally the funding for student organizations is unparalleled. At cornell for example you have the opportunity to build actual rockets and submarines as an undergraduate college student. That\u2019s not something many colleges can offer.\n\nSo i genuinely ask - why are they overrated? Every metric i just brought up (roi, networks, job placement, opportunities) all suggest the ivies are on top or at least close to the top. So by what metric are Ivies overrated? \n\nObviously it\u2019s never worth going in debt for an ivy, but let\u2019s be honest - almost everyone on this sub would go to an ivy if they got in. Yet people are seriously trying to say that they are overrated in this post yet provide little to no logic/facts to support that assertion",

      "text": "Hi, I don't go to Ivy but I spent last summer in NYC and The Hamptons. I made a lot of friends who went to Ivy, both currently and graduated. I made friends with 50+ of them and met hundreds. They're great kids however, can be very stuck up.\n\nOne of my best friends is an Investment Banker in NYC, went to Michigan. He's now 31 and high up in the business. He said he hires many kids from Ivy who come in and get a reality check within a year or so that they aren't all that and nobody cares they went to Harvard. He also has said they hire these kids because of nepotism, not because they are necessarily the most perfect person for the job.\n\nMost the people I met who went to Ivy went to either UPenn, Princeton, or Harvard. I would say most of them got in because of Legacy, \"generous\" donations, or knowing an administrator way up in the school. There were a few kids who I met who did amazing in school and came from normal families. But a lot of them I later found out came from billionaire families, families in politics, or something of the sorts.\n\nYes, you need good grades. But nepotism is bigger than ever in this world.\n\nThe most important. People go to these schools for the name. They don't go because they think they'll learn the most there or that they love the opportunities they bring. They go so they can be at a house party in the Hamptons and say \"Oh... yeah when I went to school in Cambridge I enjoyed it so much\" with a little smirk on their face.\n\nCan Ivy be a great place to learn? Yes. Great place to be exposed to new ideas and opportunity? Definitely. Worth the price? Maybe, depending on the degree. Is going to Harvard going to help you as much as it did in 1980? Most definitely not. New people of power don't really care where you went to school, sometimes they don't even care if you went period. The world is and has changed.\n\n\\*EDIT: Not trying to make blanket statements. These were just the observations I made amongst the people I met and got to know. My ideology of these people are likely skewed given the type of crowd NYC and The Hamptons draws i.e. stuck up white kids\\*",

The endowment money also is incredibly helpful in terms of opportunities and research grant funding (i.e., the cornell project teams design and make actual rockets that they enter in competitions). \n\nFinally, the quality of the student population is insane. Almost every one is top in the nation at *something*. There are some students who are already rich off of start-ups or have been featured on forbes/wsj. \n\nSo in summary, the ROI for almost every field (except maybe some classical majors) are higher than for most other schools. The networking and average student intelligence is insane as well. And to top things off the amount of funding and opportunities offered to student organizations is unparalleled. \n\nSo how are they overrated? I mean sure don\u2019t go in debt for harvard if you have a full ride at ucla, but if you have the opportunity to go to harvard I see zero reason why you would choose a school like ucla. \n\nSo again- why are they overhyped?",

Lots of toxic competition because almost everyone is at the top of their class. If you use your resources, then you could get just as good as an education and experience at a public university than at an Ivy. Students at Stanford are at the same level as those at Harvard, so it feels kind of dumb to create a whole separate section for these schools when they are plenty of other ones that are just as prestigious.

      "text": "I have many thoughts. Let me preface by saying that they\u2019re excellent schools, which is no debate. But they aren\u2019t a golden ticket. \n\n1. Their socioeconomic diversity is piss-poor. I grew up in a rich area and I would hate to be surrounded by wealthy kids all the time. Low income students who have gone have struggled with the expenses of everything and the price of a lot of social stuff. \n\n2. They aren\u2019t worth going into immense debt for. I don\u2019t think anyone should EVER take out more than 50k in loans for college, and the ivies are no exception. Debt is killer and it\u2019s just not worth it. \n\n3. Some schools have huge culture issues. Cornell has a huge mental health crisis and Dartmouth has a massive rape issue. Ivies aren\u2019t immune to these issues nor are they better at dealing with them. \n\n4. Sticking a bunch of kids who were always top of the class together is a setup for toxic competition. Also not an Ivy exclusive issues (looking at you, UCB) but it\u2019s easy to get sucked in. \n\n5. The expectation that students will be perfect across subject areas creates a less interesting student body. They\u2019re missing out on a lot of diversity and vibrancy by not forgiving slip-ups in certain subjects. \n\nOverall, I think they\u2019re great schools for some people, but they\u2019re in no way perfect and they don\u2019t promise happiness, success, or wealth in the way some people think they do.",

Some people probably love this and see it as a motivator. But I think I'd be burnt out one month in if my school was nearly as competitive as Harvard. \n\nAnd personally, I'm not sure you're actually learning more at an Ivy. You're surrounded by professors who truly are the leaders in their field, but they're ultimately more focused on their own research than educating you. At my state school, opportunities to research with professors are there to pretty much anyone who just *asks*. I'm not sure, but I'd doubt that just walking into a professors office and asking to work on a project won't get you very far at Cornell. That being said, I think the average Harvard student probably cares much more about that professor being a big, famous name in their field than I do.\n\nAlso, they're absurdly expensive.\n\nI'll admit most of this post is based off stereotypes of the ivies, but these are still just my general feelings.",
