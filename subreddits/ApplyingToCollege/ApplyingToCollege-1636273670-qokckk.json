  "text": "Hi y'all. I'm Canadian and was only thinking of applying to Canadian school but because of job opportunities and the forgoing of the SAT/ACT by quite a few unis this year, I am thinking of also applying to the US. Problem is, I have never researched schools outside the T20's and given my not-so-great ECs, probably won't make it there.\n\nLocation: I\u2019d like a campus near a big tech-hub. Basically, schools that become feeders for internships and jobs at tech companies.\nRegion: Wherever.\nMajor: CS, maybe engineering.\nSize: On the bigger end of the spectrum\nCosts: Doesn't matter\n\nOther information: I enjoyed Cornell when I visited, but as mentioned above I hated NYU when I visited NYC. I want a connected campus.\n\nSchools I\u2019m applying to: lol\n\nStats:\n~ 3.6 UW (is this for my entire high school grades or just grade 12?)\nSouth asian\nMale\nDoing a few IB and AP courses\nDo a few math/coding competitions. Did pretty good in a grade 11 one.\nTwo clubs for ~3 hours per week. Started in grade 12.\nCompetitive code on personal time.\nSports in grade 10.",

      "text": "Most schools look at all four years of high school, and your GPA reflects that. \n\nI mostly know NYS schools:\n\nLook at Stony Brook University (hella competitive for CS, reach) and University of Buffalo (match), RPI (dunno), RIT (has coop, 70% acceptance rate)",
