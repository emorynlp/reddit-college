      "text": "You\u2019re going to need to be more clear to get specific help or resources. \n\nDoctorate as in a PhD is way, way, *way* down the road if you\u2019re in high school right now. A lot of people in high school think they\u2019ll go to med/law or get a PhD. Fewer end up actually taking that path after 4 years of undergrad. Focus on the more immediate next step right now, which is undergrad. You can\u2019t just skip from being in high school to focusing on getting a PhD from Harvard. \n\nOnce you\u2019re in undergrad, spend more time exploring the field and seeing whether a PhD is truly the best path for you. Academia can be a stressful and grueling path that constantly narrows down the field to the best of the best, while leaving many feeling like they\u2019re not getting enough out of it compared to what it takes from them. Getting into Harvard specifically is a whole other issue even once you decide you want to pursue a PhD. \n\nFYI, PhD students receive a stipend from their university, so finances shouldn\u2019t be a big concern if you\u2019re good enough to get accepted into a reputable PhD program. If you are a US citizen, working part-time is always an option. But that\u2019s all far in the future. Undergrad first.",

Say I somehow get a full ride to Harvard. That\u2019s great! But\u2026 how can I work a job and go to college and be efficient at both? I live half the country away, where minimum wage is $7.25. $7.25 can\u2019t do much in Cambridge.",

              "text": "Check out what elkrange wrote about paying for undergrad. If need-based aid will cover everything for your family, that will often include living expenses such as housing, textbooks, etc. Costs for travel and such you will still need to cover on your own. If you work a part-time job during college, you will be paid according to what\u2019s standard in that town, since that is where you\u2019ll be living. Even better, get an on-campus job, which usually pays $15/hr. \n\nAs for being efficient at both college and a job, many college students already do that, whether it be a work-study job, an on-campus job, or an academic-year internship. If you are truly targeting something as rigorous as a Harvard PhD, quite honestly not being able to balance undergrad studies with <20 hours of work a week might not be the best sign, especially given that PhD students also often balance their academic work (far more intense than undergrad) with TA-ing, teaching a lower level class, etc. \n\n(And on a final note, I would not speak as you do as if you\u2019re already assuming you will be accepted into Harvard. Unless there\u2019s a building there with your family name on it, of course)",

      "text": "For the first step, paying for undergrad:\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\r  \nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.\n\n(Grad school is a bridge you will cross when you come to it. Often, PhD programs pay for their students to attend.)",
