Prestige becomes more important when you move to something less technical like business\u2014 it\u2019s an initial screener for candidates. And it becomes ultra important when you are completely liberal arts and moving into something like international affairs.

From your extracurriculars, your financial situation, your course rigor, your essays, your recommendations, etc, there are other important parts of the application than just your gpa + sat score. All of those other things could significantly help your or hurt you. nonetheless, it never hurts to apply. if you want to apply early, just compile a list of good (by your definition) engineering schools and create an excel sheet. Then just use google to look up the deadlines. To apply, create a Common App or Coalition App account.",
