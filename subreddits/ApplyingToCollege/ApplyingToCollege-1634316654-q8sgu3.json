I am also looking for financial aid, and was thinking if I should look for safety school to get myself aid, or apply to colleges similar to yale who have high acceptance rate when one applies early.",

      "text": "of course, you can get into good schools with those stats. if by \u201cgood\u201d you mean T50 schools, then it highly depends on many other factors. From your extracurriculars, your financial situation, your course rigor, your essays, your recommendations, etc, there are other important parts of the application than just your gpa + sat score. All of those other things could significantly help your or hurt you. nonetheless, it never hurts to apply. if you want to apply early, just compile a list of good (by your definition) engineering schools and create an excel sheet. Then just use google to look up the deadlines. To apply, create a Common App or Coalition App account.",
