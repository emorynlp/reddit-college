  "text": "so basically my dream school is WashU and i'm applying early for computer science. I think i had a pretty good shot to get in before (perfect ACT pretty decent gpa and i'm really confident in my essays and ecs), but they look at senior grades and I think it might be doomed. I have all A's and A-'s in my classes except multivar calc which I have a D in. If my 1st quarter grade for that comes out as like a C or D or  something will that impact my chances a lot. Idk im so stressed out rn and it doesnt help that i'm pretty sure i failed the last test we took.",

      "text": "When does your quarter end? For example, my school runs a semester system so the university won't consider my senior year at all. If your quarter ends before you submit your early application, they don't even count it.\n\nIf it does, there still is no need for you to stress out. WashU isn't particularly that selective (idk about its comsci department though). Realize that most applicants do NOT take multivar calc, and a D in multivar calc is really as bd (or good, depends on how you look at it) as a C.",
