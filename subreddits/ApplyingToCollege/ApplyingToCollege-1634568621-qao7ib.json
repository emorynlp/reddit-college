  "text": "I see so many posts or comments where people mention that they won't get into their top college because they have bad ecs. How can an ec be bad? Does it mean that they have no leadership in it or it's not related to their major or something?",

      "text": "When most people say that, they mean an EC that doesn't add much to the strength of their application.  For instance, you were a member of a club, didn't do anything worth talking about, and weren't in any sort of leadership position.\n\nI'd say those are more accurately termed \"meaningless\" ECs.  There's probably another set, much more rare, that actively \\*damage\\* your chances.  Stuff that most reasonable people wouldn't even think to include, but that some nutty people think is appropriate.",

      "text": "Sometimes you hear about people talking about some form of EC \u201ctiering\u201d. There are different versions. I\u2019m going to exclude competition performance and curing cancer stuff. Tiers for us normal people: \n\nTier I: creating an organization/original contribution with some weight outside of school. Started an organization that fundraised and supplied 5,000 sleep nets to fight malaria in country X. \n\nTier II: same as T1 but limited to in school. Like a new club that actually does something. Started a robotics team that did pretty well at the state level. \n\nTier III: senior leadership in an important school activity (debate, orchestra, large team, student council, etc). No major advancements in that club/activity under your leadership, but you were the leader. \n\nTier IV: participant/lower level officer of established club. German club treasurer. Member of the science club. That sort of thing.\n\nTier IV is pretty much just app filler at the most selective schools.  Tier I can be difficult to achieve. Hence the phony Instagram non-profits. But applicants should focus on Tiers II and III and trying to turn Tier IV into something bigger. Maybe as a member of a club, you can organize and execute something. If you\u2019ve got a classmate who really wants to go to a Chinese language program in the summer but who is broke. Advocate for that kid with the school, set up a fundraising effort to raise 5,000 for that kid to go to that program, etc. Be an agent of change and Tier IV becomes Tier II.",

              "text": "Definitely not Tier IV because there are hours requirements. But it really varies. Most internships are kinda jokes. They aren\u2019t that well structured and most of the work is pretty mundane...create this spreadsheet. If there\u2019s a formal mentorship/training, a formalized competitive application process, and/or your time culminates in an actual deliverable, that\u2019s better. But I think 9 times out of 10 a kid (17-19yo anyway) landing something like this just looks like mom/dad has a connection. It\u2019s more about the story that is told with the internship than who it is for. You could have an internship with Jack Dorsey, but if all you\u2019re doing is getting coffee and carrying luggage, what\u2019s the value?  \n\nSimilarly you could get an internship with Joe Plumber looking to build his business with a second regional location. You did market and site research that told him this suburb of Charlotte is a better second office than this suburb of Atlanta and created a rubric and pitch around that..that\u2019s a better internship.\n\nFor an economics/polisci major:,research assistant for a prof, non-profit in policy internship with formalized training, something where you\u2019re working with an quasi-governmental economic development agency. It\u2019s more about what you\u2019re actually asked to do and how you\u2019re taught/mentored.",

Being a varsity athlete isn\u2019t Tier IV. Working a regular part time job or volunteering a decent number of hours to something isn\u2019t Tier IV. Time commitment, dedication and developing a talent to get those activities matters. The app filler ECs are things you basically show up for every month or so for an hour or two with almost no responsibility outside of showing up.",
