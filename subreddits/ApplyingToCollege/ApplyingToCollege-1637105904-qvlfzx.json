  "text": "I have 4 absences for Q1, I'm pretty sure I only missed 2 so I'll take it up with the school, but in case I end up being wrong or they can't change it, will this affect my chances? IK 4 seems like little but it adds up to 16 days a year and 18 is considered 10% of the school year. I always see things about how you should be present for more than 90%. Maybe I'm overthinking.\n\nEdit: How about tardies? It says I had 5 tardies when I remember 100% I only had 1 and I have a teacher witness",
