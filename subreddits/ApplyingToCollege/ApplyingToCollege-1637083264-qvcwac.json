  "title:": "Question about transferring and retaking classes",
  "text": "Hello everyone.\n\nI was hoping to get an answer about a question I had regarding retaking classes before applying to transfer. I am currently a sophomore at a local community college and plan to transfer to UMich, possibly Ross, in my junior year. My GPA at the moment isn't bad, 3.67, but it could be much better if I re-took two classes I got B's in. \n\nMy question is whether retaking these classes would help with admissions or not. From looking at online GPA calculators, if I were to retake these classes I would be near a 3.9-3.95, and I feel like it would be worth paying for them again in order to get this boost. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",
