  "text": "Based off of the USnews rankings (yes, I know these are not definitive but they give a pretty good sense generally) northeastern is ranked at 49, but I feel like it\u2019s WAY better than that. Is this just me?",

      "text": "well you have to look at the methodology. US News puts like 40% weight (i think correct me if i\u2019m wrong) on the perception of the institution by OTHER institutions/professors, which obviously doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the school itself or the quality of the education, and because northeastern has just come up in the ranks within the last decade, that has a big impact. \nUS news also places a good amount of importance on graduation time (when northeastern has many students doing 5 years and 3 co-ops but still taking just 4 yrs of classes), and loans after college.\n\ni go to northeastern and am definitely getting a great education and experiences!",

Northeastern is notable for being the most notable employer of modern marketing techniques in this space (far from the only) versus those schools who primarily lean on their name. Truly a wild world :)",

In general rankings are better considered as tiers, not literal spots. Northeastern is in the 30-50 tier for US news is how I would think of it.",
