  "text": "I currently have a 3.89 UW, but if my grades continue how they are it could go down to 3.8 (usually straight As and currently have a B- (80) in Physics and Analysis). I\u2019ve always taken full Honors and IB when available, so my weighted is fine. \n\nAlso, sorry if this is a dumb question but my anxiety won\u2019t let me stop stressing about it. Thanks in advance :)",

      "text": "Frankly, GPA, or what you know as you GPA, doesn't mean shit. I do not mean that your grades do not matter, but some proprietary number calculated from those grades does not matter in the scope of college admissions. Colleges have completely different systems as to how they calculate GPA, so they most likely wont even consider the one you provide. The only context where your GPA might matter is in class rank, if your school even does that. But focus on getting good grades in hard classes, because that matters a lot more than a singular number that is supposed to show your academic prowess.",
