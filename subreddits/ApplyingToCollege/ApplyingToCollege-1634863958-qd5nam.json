  "text": "This question is for anyone who did do the Posse scholarship or is well informed. I made it to the finalist interview, but I am worried about applying ED to the college they offer me.   \nQuestions I have:  \nIf I fail the finalist interview, do I still have to go to the college where they made me apply for ED? Their finalist interview is around December, and they want me to submit it to their school for ED by Nov 1st, even though their interview is on Dec. I would go to their school if I get the scholarship, but if I fail the interview, I won't get the scholarship, and then I wouldn't go.  \n\n\nFYI: The only people I have access to ask are people who pass the finalist interview, so they don't know how to answer my question. Also, the people that worked in Posse responded to my question very vaguely and said the school is good already, so I should go.",
