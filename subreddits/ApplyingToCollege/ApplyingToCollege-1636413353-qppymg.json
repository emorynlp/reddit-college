  "text": "Hi I have so many questions about the application process:\n\n1) I am an American citizen that went to school in the UK and my parents live in the US so will that make me a domestic or international student and how will it affect my application process?\n\n2)Since I schooled internationally- what do I put in the course and grades part of the common app as I emailed the schools and they said I should just report my GCSE and a level predicted but how?\n\n3)In the testing section where it says secondary school leaving exams- do I put my GCSE grades or A level predicted in that section?\n\n4)Do I have to report all my grades from year 10 onwards because I do not have those documents?\n\n5) Does anyone know how the year is scheduled in the uk because I just put yearly?\n\n6) Do I have to report my end of year 12 grades if I did not do AS levels?\n\nThanks a lot for the help.",
