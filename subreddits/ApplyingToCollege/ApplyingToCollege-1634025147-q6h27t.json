      "text": "My general advice because we have a question that is similar: do not write about why this book is important to call people who have read it. White about why it is important to you. Focus on it's effect on you. You can skip the plot summary...if an admission officer feels the need to be familiar with the book, they'll look it up.\n\nGood luck!",
