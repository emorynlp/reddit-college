  "text": "seems like we don't have one for this application season's decision release dates (if not pls share the link asap thanks). as much as I love spreadsheets, I don't have the drive to hunt down dates for every single school. last year's calendar was so gorgeous and well organized that I fangirled over it as a junior.\n\nedit: ok, I'm willing to help out but I can't do all the fancy formatting stuff",

Due to the fact that the next sequential bit.ly url was taken by someone else months ago and that sequential bit.ly urls are generally a pain considering if I claim them all in advance and then decide to step down from doing this I can\u2019t transfer ownership of them without paying money, we may be switching over from a spreadsheet format to a different format.",
