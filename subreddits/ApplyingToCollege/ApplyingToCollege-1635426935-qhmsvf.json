  "text": "Title. Because of health problems, I wasn't able to participate in any contests through 9th and 10th grade, and in 11th grade covid started so naturally most of the national events got canceled. I have only 3 honors: \n\n* Honor Roll (ranked 1st out of 300, but there's no such thing as class valeditorian in my school)\n* \"Outstanding academic achievements\" from the end of middle school (9th grade)\n* And a national laureate of the Social Insurance Olympiad (..... yes. It was the only contest I could still apply for when I was finally in a better state since all other deadlines were like 2 months earlier. I met the Chairman of a national banking institution and was supposed to intern there for a month - cancelled due to covid - though!)\n\nShould I even bother mentioning any of those? I'm sorry if this sounds stupid but I genuinely don't know. Also, keep in mind that I'm an international applicant so there are barely any contests to start with!",

Even though none of them are truly distinctive, they still demonstrate that you're among the best of your peers, which is all the awards section is intended to do anyway.",
