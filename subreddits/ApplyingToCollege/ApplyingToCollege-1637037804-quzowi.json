  "title:": "Stanford Interview and how it went",
  "text": "Recently just had my Stanford interview yesterday and it went well for the most part. \n\nMy experience\n\n\\- Emailed me on Monday 6 days in advance of the intended interview date\n\n\\- I did have to send a follow up email on Thursday to specify a specify time to host the call (remember the alumni are volunteers and are busy with their own life so be patient with their responses but don't be scared to send a follow up email if they're not responding) \n\n\\- the interviewer asked pretty generic questions \n\n\\- I tried to make the most out of my answers and constantly engage the interviewer with my responses\n\n\\- Made jokes and made it casual and conversational (don't forget they're trying to get a grasp of who you are so show some personality) \n\n\\- Towards the end he asked if I had any questions for him, I asked:\n\n1. What was your experience at Stanford like?\n2. The dreams you had for yourself before going to Stanford, did you accomplish them after graduating? \n\n\\*His face brightened reminiscing about his time there. His roommate was also the founder of YouTube?!!?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then concluded by basically saying I'm what Stanford is looking for, that I'll love it there, and that he thinks I have a good chance and he'll be rooting for me :)\n\nI take his remarks with a grain of salt of course, as the interview does not make up the whole admission process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease respond with thoughts and any questions, I don't mind elaborating or talking more about my experience!",
