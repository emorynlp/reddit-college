  "text": "I'm in highschool right now and I'm not sure what art college I should go to. Obviously I know how to apply; draw a couple of pretty pictures that go together paired with interesting commentary. The real problem for me is getting a job after completing a degree in art. For example, what if I go to a college I hate and didn't make any friends or network at all? I just want to have a plan for the professional world now so that I can feel at ease for a few more years and have a smoother transition between school and work life.\n\nIf you can help me out with any experience or advice about art colleges, I'd really appreciate it!",

      "text": "Art school may not be a great value. Consider four year universities that offer a studio art degree, as that route is a lot more flexibility for adding or switching majors/minors, often with lower cost and/or more options for financial aid. Consider that most people change majors and career paths, often more than once, between the age you are now and young adulthood.",

      "text": "I have heard decent things from the College of Creative studies for being quite good at connecting students with the industry for its industrial and auto design programs. Wayne state seems to be a less selective and more general version of it with less prestige. The Art Center College of Design seems to be a decent choice as well though it is in California. \n\nAs someone else said universities tend to offer more options if you decide art is not quite your thing. If you are interested in getting a job with an art degree consider majoring in graphic design or industrial design(applied art). \n\nHere is some data: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare/?toggle%3Dfos%26s%3D147767%26s%3D145637%26s%3D152080%26s%3D164988%26s%3D131496%26fos%3D211440.5004.3%26fos%3D110653.5004.3%26fos%3D134130.5004.3%26fos%3D109651.5004.3%26fos%3D122755.5004.3%26fos%3D196176.5004.3%26fos%3D111948.5004.3%26fos%3D228778.5004.3%26fos%3D236948.5004.3%26fos%3D167358.5004.3",
