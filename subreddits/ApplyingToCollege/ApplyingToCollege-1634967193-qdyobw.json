  "title:": "Question about fee waivers for top schools: I'm 2K over fee limit but can't afford to apply",
  "text": "Hi! I live in a family of 7 (five kids including me, two with developmental disabilities), and my high-school counselor said my family makes 2K over the income limit to qualify for fee waivers. \n\nIs there any way around this? Would schools be able to make an exception for me? We can barely put food on the table (and that's with me working 20 hours a week... basically I pay for the groceries and occupational therapy for my two siblings).........  \n\nI don't want to only apply to two or three schools just because I can't afford the application fee?",
