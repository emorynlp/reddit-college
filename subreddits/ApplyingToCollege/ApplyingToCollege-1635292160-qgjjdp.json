  "text": "Hi everyone! I am an international applicant who is keen on applying to Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.\nMy current portfolio is essentially 95% tech (i.e. internship, research projects, courses etc.) and 5% finance.\n\nWhen I reached out to students who got into Harvard and Stanford, some shared that I may have a better chance at MIT compared to Harvard and Stanford because of how my portfolio is so tech heavy and lack any humanities.\n\nMay I ask if Harvard & Stanford prefers more well rounded applicant who also respects humanities? I am keen on exploring humanities but didn't have a chance to. Now that it may (arguably) my biggest gap in my profile, do anyone have any suggestion for me to build my humanities portfolio in a short period of time? \nP.S. Humanities is very board but the one that caught my eye is Philosophy!\n\nThanks in advance!",
