  "text": "Hey everyone, I have been lurking in the sub for a period of time and have been fascinated at the process whereby students have to go through to apply to colleges in the states! Currently I'm taking a 2 year long gap year serving national liabilities (iykyk) with deferment for matriculation so I'm pretty bored while waiting for school to start. Even though I have settled and gotten a placing at a local university which is pretty prestigious, I'm still curious as to how I stand as an international candidate applying to the college in the states. As such, I have decide to apply to some schools for fun (mainly as a business/Econs major) and who knows maybe I'll change my mind after these 2 years are over. \n\nHowever I really can't be bothered to ask my teaches' recommendations because I don't want to trouble them for something so trivial and of minimal importance to me. Anyone has suggestions for decent universities that don't require teachers' recommendations? Thanks in advance!(the only university I know of at this point of time is UIUC)",
