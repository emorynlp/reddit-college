  "text": "I'm applying to different colleges as different majors. When filling out my counselor recommendation form, I wrote down my intended major as Computer Science. However, I applied to certain schools with this recommendation as Neuroscience. I am pretty sure my counselor included Computer Science as my intended major in my letter. Will this have a negative effect on admissions outcomes?",
