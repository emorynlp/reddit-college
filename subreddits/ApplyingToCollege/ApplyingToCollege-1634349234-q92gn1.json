  "title:": "Financial Aid for an International who won't be an International in college",
  "text": "I've been asking a bunch of universities about this but none of them have given a clear answer so I'm asking Reddit now.\n\nBasically, I'm a senior who's done all 4 years of high school in the U.S, but I'm not a U.S citizen, so when I apply to colleges I'm an international. But, my family started the green card process, so I'm pretty sure once I'm in college I'll be a green card holder which means I qualify for aid that's not given to internationals. So on the CommonApp, I want to say that I'm pursuing financial aid, but I know that makes me an international seeking financial aid, which will definitely decrease my chances. \n\nSo idk what to do --- I emailed UVA  and explained my situation and they said to put 'Yes' for aid anyways, but it clearly says on their website they don't give aid to international students. Anyone know what to do?",
