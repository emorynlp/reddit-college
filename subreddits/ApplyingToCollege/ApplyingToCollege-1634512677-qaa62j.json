  "text": "My SAT is 1520 (730 E, 790 M)\n\nI took 2 ACT tests: the first was a 33 (35M, 30S, 35E, 33R, 11W), the second was a 32 (36M, 28S, 35E, 27R, 10W). I have a superscore of 34. \n\nWhich should I send to colleges?\n\nSidenote: I took 2 SATs, the first being a 1480 (710 E, 770 M) but it also had a 21/24 for the essay. The second test had no essay. Should I send both scores?",
