      "text": "Ivies look at your course rigor. If your school offers 20+ and you only took 2 AP classes thru your junior year, it won\u2019t look good to the admissions officials, in general. Prior to your senior year, if you took a bunch of AP classes but you didn\u2019t take any AP exam, you could give them the impression you only took the classes to pad your grade. These are puts and calls you will have to make. \n\nFor likely all the Ivies, they use your AP scores to place you in certain class level. I don\u2019t think any of the Ivies give you actual course credit to allow you to graduate early. Just placement. If let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to place out of any class, don\u2019t submit your AP exam scores. That\u2019s ok, too. If you don\u2019t want to take any AP exam (my student) senior year because you don\u2019t want to be placed out, just let your admissions official know (once you\u2019re admitted), you don\u2019t plan to take the exams.",

You can\u2019t take what isn\u2019t offered.\n\nAnd while course rigor is very important, it\u2019s only one component that goes into a decision.\n\nFor a competitive high school that offers 20+ APs, AOs have generally said that anything over 8 isn\u2019t really differentiated. But this number isn\u2019t a requirement either.\n\nYes, this includes Senior year courses.",

If it offers a ton of them and you opted \\*not\\* to take them  (when you otherwise could have) then that's not great.  Every article I've read stresses that there is no \"magic number\" given the huge variability in what's offered at different high schools, but they usually recommend a minimum of between 5 and 8 for students applying to T20.",
