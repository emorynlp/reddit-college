  "text": "What do you think how easy it will be to change the course and school while selected for a program. Say I applied for physics in the college of art and science (mostly natural science comes under the school of art) but since then I want to pursue my degree in engineering (mostly school of engineering). \n\nHow hard it will be in changing my course and school after getting accepted with a certain scholarship? Will that bring change to my scholarship? Do I need to pay some extra amount for changing my major from natural science to engineering?",

High demand majors at some schools can be difficult to transfer.\n\nExample - UW basically says that it you\u2019re not accepted into CS, you won\u2019t be studying CS.\n\nEngineering and CS are typical high-demand majors.\n\nOthers are easier.\n\n(I assume by \u201cscholarship\u201d you mean an area of study. If you have a specific financial scholarship award with specific requirements, you\u2019d need to check the specifics).",
