  "text": "Sometimes I read \u201cEssays that worked for the Ivy League\u201d and get frustrated. They are all so complex to understand, with high-tier vocabulary and sometimes even weirdly written (from what is considered correct). \n\nMy essay was well-written but too rough. I went straight to the point and wrote about the illness that fucked up my entire High School ride. Nevertheless, kids on the Ivy League essays never do that. It\u2019s always a random cryptic metaphore that takes you years to understand.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m too dumb and my essay is purely shit. #help",

Mine is very straightforward in that there are no weird metaphors and the language is fairly easy to understand (I wrote it in a way that\u2019s similar to the way I talk), but it does tell a cohesive plot. I literally wrote my personal statement in an hour by accident in April lmao. it does not need to be (and probably shouldn\u2019t be) super artistic, but it should say something about you and it should be authentic. If you sound like yourself you\u2019re in great shape :)",

Most actual application essays are not poetic and are just like how you described yours- straight to the point, clear- not something that sounds like it could win a Pulitzer. Content matters infinitely more than style.\n\nImagine if you got into a top school and were given the opportunity to publish your essays. You don't actually know which ones got you into the school- if they were even the deciding factor. You'd beeline for your fanciest sounding one. That's exactly how these essays were selected.",

I don't think it's really meant to be a magnum opus of writing, it's just something that colleges do to get a general understanding of who they're working with.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it being 'rough' - they might even appreciate a straightforward approach depending on the program. Colleges are growing more and more egaltarian as time goes on. I think Ivy League is sort of an elitist relic of the past in terms of the way they choose to present themselves and their students.",

I go to one of those college prep schools that teaches you to write that way, and you can tell who is mechanically cranking out metaphors to try to seem deep and who actually puts thought into these things.\n\nThe main thing for a college essay is -- What did you learn from this experience? And what does it say about who you are as a person? (And what do those personal qualities say about how you'll fit in at this college?) As long as you were able to convey those things, you'll be alright. :)",
