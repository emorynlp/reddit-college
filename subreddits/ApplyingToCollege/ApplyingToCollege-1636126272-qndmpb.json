  "text": "Sometimes I read \u201cEssays that worked for the Ivy League\u201d and get frustrated. They are all so complex to understand, with high-tier vocabulary and sometimes even weirdly written (from what is considered correct). \n\nMy essay was well-written but too rough. I went straight to the point and wrote about the illness that fucked up my entire High School ride. Nevertheless, kids on the Ivy League essays never do that. It\u2019s always a random cryptic metaphore that takes you years to understand.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m too dumb and my essay is purely shit. #help",
