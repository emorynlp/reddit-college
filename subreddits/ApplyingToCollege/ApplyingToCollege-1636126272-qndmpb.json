  "text": "Sometimes I read \u201cEssays that worked for the Ivy League\u201d and get frustrated. They are all so complex to understand, with high-tier vocabulary and sometimes even weirdly written (from what is considered correct). \n\nMy essay was well-written but too rough. I went straight to the point and wrote about the illness that fucked up my entire High School ride. Nevertheless, kids on the Ivy League essays never do that. It\u2019s always a random cryptic metaphore that takes you years to understand.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m too dumb and my essay is purely shit. #help",

      "text": "imo the best essays are the ones that say something about strong about you in a concise and effective manner, since you only have 650 words. Mine is very straightforward in that there are no weird metaphors and the language is fairly easy to understand (I wrote it in a way that\u2019s similar to the way I talk), but it does tell a cohesive plot. I literally wrote my personal statement in an hour by accident in April lmao. it does not need to be (and probably shouldn\u2019t be) super artistic, but it should say something about you and it should be authentic. If you sound like yourself you\u2019re in great shape :)",

Most actual application essays are not poetic and are just like how you described yours- straight to the point, clear- not something that sounds like it could win a Pulitzer. Content matters infinitely more than style.\n\nImagine if you got into a top school and were given the opportunity to publish your essays. You don't actually know which ones got you into the school- if they were even the deciding factor. You'd beeline for your fanciest sounding one. That's exactly how these essays were selected.",
