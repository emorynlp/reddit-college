  "text": " for the second prompt im planning to do \u201creflect on a personal experience where you intentionally expanded your cultural awareness\u201d and talk abt a mission trip (cliche i know \ud83d\ude14) where i went to a poor area of chicago and was able to see the experience of inner city black americans and contrast it to my experience as a british-born nigerian girl who lives in the suburbs. i feel like it sounds kinda basic tho but it\u2019s the only thing i can think of \ud83d\ude14 hopefully comparing the two diff black experiences will give me a leg up. idk what do y\u2019all think\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso I kinda need this soon cuz I want to submit today",

              "text": "for example, if after this experience you chose to volunteer in an intercity tutoring group to help close the achievement gap, or advocated for legislation that would help inter city people find employment with a livable wage. it doesn't have to be world-changing, but i think approaching it from the angle of \"I observed this and actually did something about it\" is probably going to be better than just \"these are the differences between me and these people\"",
