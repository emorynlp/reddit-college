  "title:": "Can't decide on my ED college.",
  "text": "It might not be the best time to ask, 4 days before the ED deadline, but I still can't decide on my ED college. Being an international student, with very low EFC, I have little to no chance of getting into my dream school, which has a 96% rejection rate. So a rational decision would be applying somewhere safe, with a higher acceptance. \n\nBut when I think about it, I feel like I will always regret not applying to my dream school if I get in to the \"safer\" school. \n\nDoes anyone else have this feeling? Or did anyone go through this? \n\nMy Profile is somewhat above average from my country, but still, chances are really low.",
