      "text": "Usually, there is one AO who will read all the apps from your State/county, depending on how many applications typically come from your area. (In most cases, you can look it up on the admissions page) They will definitely be aware of all the apps coming from your school. Whether this is a major disadvantage is hard to say. You definitely don\u2019t want to be at the bottom of the heap. Selingo\u2019s book has an extensive discussion of the extra scrutiny for legacies/employee kids. Worth a read.",
