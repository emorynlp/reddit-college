If you submit financial aid documents after the deadline, your FA package may come out days/weeks after your decision (if you\u2019re accepted).\n\nEdit: how much time it takes to fill out will depend on how organized your family has been with the documents they will need in order to fill it out, but I would budget at least a few hours for it",
