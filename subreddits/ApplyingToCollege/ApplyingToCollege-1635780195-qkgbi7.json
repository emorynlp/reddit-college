  "text": "So I submitted my Common App to FSU and I realized I made a mistake. In common app, for my senior year schedule I forgot to include an elective dual enrollment class I\u2019m taking right now. It\u2019s on my SSAR that I\u2019ve also submitted to FSU and it\u2019s in my official transcript. How much will this mistake affect my chances?",
