  "title:": "I literally love the college process",
  "text": "I started my supplemental essays over the summer and by August 6, I had already applied to all 9 of my schools. I made spreadsheets, updated naviance, requested letters, emailed counselors, and really just wanted the process to go on for longer. I decided it couldn't hurt to apply to more schools and fast forward a few months, I've applied to 32 schools. I help all of my friends with their essays, dealing with CommonApp, literally anything I can. Every time I hear people talk about the college process, it's unbelievably negative. I've definitely been anxious about where I will and won't get in, but the process of applying hasn't been the least bit stressful and I'm honestly kind of sad that it's over. Does anyone else feel this way?",
