  "text": "Basically the title, long story short this class is ruining my life. But I\u2019m a CS major applying to very selective schools so I feel like I have to take it. I\u2019ve taken the most rigorous course load I could otherwise and gotten good grades, but this class is just too much. \n\nHow bad would it be if I dropped it? Would I have to email all my schools and tell them? Would that look really bad?",

If you could scrape by a low B with less studying I'd say do that since a B is better than a withdrawal on your transcript, but assuming you've mostly had As for the last 3 years, a C would definitely not look good. If it's having that much of an effect on your mental health to maintain a decent grade then I would say drop it, but know that it wouldn't look good.",
