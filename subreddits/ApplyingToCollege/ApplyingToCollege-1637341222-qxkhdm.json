  "text": "I have a 1570, a near perfect GPA, several strong ECs, and essays I think are decent. \n\nI'm not applying to any ivies, or private schools (except for USC, which offers merit based aid) simply because I know that even if I get into a few, I won't be able to go to them because expensive. \n I don't qualify for much need based aid, but can't pay how much they'll cost either. Just applying to a lot \nof state schools and hoping to get a scholarship. \n\nI'm also planning to major in CS, which plays a role.",
