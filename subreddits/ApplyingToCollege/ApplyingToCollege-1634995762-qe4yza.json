  "text": "I can't believe I'm asking this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nLook, I got 90+ all 3 years, with a 91% in 10th 97% (CBSE board exams) in 10th and 94% (11th) and I have a predicted of 97.\n\nBut our school gives tough preboards (which is not explained by the counselor) and so my grades might drop to 85% in my mid terms (not to mention they are literally being held in October 13-29 so I'm doubly fucked bcoz of applications).\n\nIs this gonna affect my ED apps? Is this gonna affect my RD apps?",
