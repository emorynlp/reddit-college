The same impact can be had by not attempting to take the shot in the first place.\n\nIt's like if you were playing baseball, and the pitches were being thrown no matter what. You cannot stop the pitches from being thrown, they will continue to pass over that home plate whether you swing at them or not. If you do try to swing at them, it's possible that they'll just pass right over the plate anyway (miss), but they could also be sent soaring (hit). The default outcome, with no interference from you, is that every ball passes over that home plate. This is the same outcome as a miss.\n\nTherefore, by the commutative property, you do miss 100% of the shots you don't take. To claim otherwise is to ignore that opportunities show themselves all the time. We don't create opportunities by attempting to \"take a shot\" at them.\n\nEDIT: tldr; missing your opportunity is the same thing as missing your shot",

It\u2019s not that the nonexistent apple is neither red nor blue, but it\u2019s that this apple is in a superposition of being both at the same time (in addition to being brown, green, yellow, moldy, etc.). You don\u2019t find out what the apple actually is until you see it with your eyes, which, unfortunately for us, is impossible given it\u2019s fictitious nature. This is why the truth tables that u/gargar070402 work out the way they do, and why the statement would be considered true if p (it\u2019s existence) was false. \n\nIn the basketball scenario, whether one makes the shot or not is in a state of having both made it and not, but you don\u2019t find out until quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other (triggered by someone attempting to make the shot). That being said, this makes the saying \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take\u201d sort of misleading... but not, at the same time. The only way to find out is by taking the shot regardless, which is the whole idea behind the saying anyway. Someone joked about it earlier in the thread but this is very similar to Schrodinger\u2019s thought experiment. The cat, in this case, would be the shot. Opening the box and seeing the state of the cat is attempting to make the shot.",

Poor people are still poor, no matter how nice their schools are. So you can't use the fact that NJ funded schools equitably and test scores didn't improve for low income students as evidence that higher income doesn't cause higher test scores.",

Which I thought was interesting and thats mostly because wealth is passed on and plenty of reasons why that has nothing to do with IQ.  Mostly because early landowners own such an advantage as far as building wealth is concerned.  I grew up in a town right outside NYC with lots of bankers.  One of the richest guys in the town was some knuckle dragger whose family were pepper farmers there 150 years ago and he just happened to own land that skyrocketed in price.  His daughter was a complete moron as well.  \n\nI think another example there about why smart people don't build wealth is because we don't resource guard and are confident in our ability to generate more income.  I view money as something that should be spent, I don't give a shit about building wealth because I won't be the one around to benefit from it.  IMO we only get our life and thats it, no afterlife, no anything.   So essentially I'd be saving for what?  The only reason I save at all is so I'm not destitute in my old age.\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wealth-of-smarts-does-not-guarantee-actual-wealth/",
