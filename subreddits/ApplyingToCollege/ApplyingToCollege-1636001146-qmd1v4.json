  "text": "I\u2019m a Questbridge applicant to three different schools: UChicago, MIT, and Yale. UChicago is my number one choice, and my admissions officer (whose linkedin is on UChicago\u2019s website) has only had the job for 5 months, thus, this will be their first time reading undergraduate applications. On top of this, Questbridge applications are the very first read; and on top of that, my last name starts with a B. My application will likely be one of the very first they ever make a decision on, is this good? Bad? Hard to tell?",
