  "text": "I sent my ssar to Florida state on 10/30 and it said on the ssar website that they received it 10/31, then I applied to FAU and had to unlock my ssar and add in test scores on 11/01. On my ssar page, it says that the ssar was sent to FSU on 11/02, but the deadline is 11/01. I didn't change anything besides adding test scores, which FSU doesn't need, so do you any of you know if they would have got the copy on 10/31 or if I missed the deadline?",
