  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to find volunteer opportunities near me that fit in with my swim practice schedule and every single one I can find requires me to be vaccinated. My mom, however, is super anti vax and won\u2019t even consider letting me get the vaccine. I don\u2019t know what to do. Ik service is really important for college applications but if my parents won\u2019t let me have the opportunity, what should I do???",

If you discuss with her, maybe she'll relent. The J&J vaccine is only 1 shot and NOT an mRNA one, so it's more acceptable to many people.  Either way, Good Luck!",
