  "text": "I submitted my Questbridge Questionnaire to Columbia a couple days ago, and just this morning realized there was a small typo. Instead of saying \u201ca spectrum\u2026\u201d I had \u201can spectrum\u2026\u201d, due to a last minute edit. Is this a big deal or something that they will overlook/understand? I\u2019m trying to convince myself that they won\u2019t care given that it\u2019s one small error out of several essays but I\u2019m still worried it\u2019ll reflect poorly on me. Anything that I should do or will I be okay?",
