      "text": "It has a pretty good reputation for cyber security.  \n\nTulsa has had some financial issues though - they cut a bunch of programs a couple years ago, and you can find a lot of editorials worried about them becoming too pre-professional overall.  Lots of concerns not only with their plan, but the administration of the school as a whole.\n\nMy kid considered it and got a decent scholarship offer, but ended up preferring one of our in-state public options.",
