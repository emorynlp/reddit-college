And I shall tell the story of woe \n\nThat befell user collegemas two-three\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe noble student worked with valiance \n\nOn their grades, essays, and SAT score \n\nApplied early: this was no dalliance \n\nAnd Lady Luck they did oft implore \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Stanford, our hero\u2019s hopes were placed \n\nThey waited for acceptance with pleasure \n\nIn vain! Admissions rejected them in haste\n\nAlas! May Stanford repent at leisure!",
