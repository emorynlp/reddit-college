      "text": "Yes, but they might think that you received 3's, depending on the rest of your academic resume, and honestly, they probably won't spend more than 2 seconds glancing over that part of the application, and if they just see a string of 5's, that's still a much more favorable impression than 5's mixed with 2's.  Many would say AOs don't care at all about AP scores, but honestly, none of us here know for sure.",
