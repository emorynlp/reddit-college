  "title:": "The STARR method: How I went from crying during interviews to acing them",
  "text": "With prime interview season around the corner, I wanted to share the strategy that got me from a hot mess to a successful interviewee. \n\nFirst off, the title isn\u2019t exaggerated. I really did cry during an interview in my sophomore year. I prepped a lot but absolutely bombed it. The interviewer could hear me crying and kept reminding me to take deep breaths. It was bad.\n\nTwo years later, I\u2019m confident in my interviews and have the results to show. Here\u2019s how I did it.\n\n**THE STARR METHOD**\n\nThe STAR method is a response-organizing system commonly used for job interviews. Surprisingly, I haven\u2019t heard a lot of people talk about it in relation to college applications. \n\nSTAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. I added a second R for Reflection because college applications are heavy on introspection, so you don\u2019t want to forget it.\n\nThe keystone of the STARR method is the belief that interviews are rooted in stories. In order for you to seem compelling, stand out from the crowd, and connect with your interviewer on a deeper level, you have to tell stories about your own experiences.\n\nThat being said, the idea of telling stories can seem intimidating. Telling a story is less direct than simply explaining an answer. It\u2019s easy to ramble, jump around, or otherwise tell an incoherent story. The STARR method is here to help by giving you a defined outline for interviews.\n\n**WHEN TO APPLY THE STARR METHOD**\n\nYou can adapt it to any question, but I find it works most naturally for the questions that explicitly tell you to share an experience, like \u201cwhat\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced?\u201d or \u201ctell me about a time you failed.\u201d \n\nFor questions that are more direct in nature, the STARR method can be a helpful way to elaborate. For example, \u201cwhat was your favorite class in high school?\u201d can be answered by first giving a direct answer and general explanation of why you liked the class, then following up with the STARR method to share a specific moment in the class that reveals why you loved it so much.\n\nTo make the STARR method more concrete, let\u2019s break down each letter and walk through the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest leadership challenge you\u2019ve had?\u201d For this, I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m debate president at my school and have to organize an online tournament.\n\n**S - SITUATION**\n\nThis is the background your interviewer needs to know before the story starts. You might have to describe a club, your leadership position, the class you took, etc. \n\nHere\u2019s the situation for our debate example: I\u2019m president of the debate club at our school, and every year, we run a very large tournament. As the president, I\u2019m responsible for organizing this, registering competitors, and managing my own team. \n\n**T - TASK**\n\nThis is the challenge you faced, the job you had to do, or the situation you faced.\n\nHere\u2019s the task for our debate example: Our team usually hosts our tournament in April, so last year, we had to quickly transition it to be online. That required registering our school with the online debate system, finding a software that would work, and training and recruiting online judges. Overall, we all felt very intimidated and worried about how we would pull it together.\n\n**A - ACTION**\n\nThis is the way that you addressed the task. This could be the steps you took, the approach you developed, etc.\n\nHere\u2019s the action for our debate example: I called a team meeting and broke our team into committees led by senior members. One group was in charge of figuring out the online system, and one was tasked with recruiting and training judges. I managed communication between these two groups as well as communications between our team and other competing groups.\n\n**R - RESULTS**\n\nThis is the conclusion to your story. What came of the actions you took? \n\nHere are the results for our debate example: Though it was a tight turnaround, we managed to train 25 judges for virtual training, set up standards for online debate, and ensure that everything flowed smoothly. We were even complimented by several schools for how successful the tournament had been!\n\n**R - REFLECTION**\n\nThis is what you learned from the experience, and it\u2019s the most important part of the story because it shows how you grew. How did your mindset change? How did the experience change your worldview, relationships, activities, etc?\n\nHere\u2019s the reflection for our debate example: This was the first time in my leadership experience where I truly had to trust the rest of my team and step back. Even though I handled a lot of the communication, a lot of crucial decisions were made that I wasn\u2019t able to participate in given the timeframe, so it led me to become more trusting of the people I work with. I think that lesson has really opened up our practices since they\u2019re virtual this year. Trusting the rest of my team to train new members has made our work go much more smoothly than it would if I felt that I had to hold the entire burden of the team. \n\n**I\u2019ll definitely make some more interview-related posts as we head into that part of the RD season. What else would you all like to see?**",

          "text": "Thanks for the compliment!\n\nThe structure that I picked up is past, present, future. For past, I cover my general background and community, but this section isn\u2019t very long. For present, I give an overview of my interests, ECs, and hobbies. For future, I share the major and career I\u2019m interested in. You can also start with a more catchphrase-like sentence to tie it all together, but it is tough to make it sound natural.\n\nAs for reading body language virtually, I think it\u2019s very tricky because people interact with their computers very differently, have different camera set-ups, etc. It may be more stress than it\u2019s worth to try and analyze how your interview is going while you do it. \n\nI would focus more on the tone of the interviewer\u2019s speech and the flow of the conversation as a gauge of the discussion.\n\nHope that helps!",
