  "text": "Why do colleges expect 17 year olds to have done research, interned at a well known Fortune 500, played an instrument in Carnegie Hall, and received a medal from the president all while still getting a 4.0 GPA and a 1600 SAT? Not everyone has access to all these opportunities and students will be left feeling inadequate. Yeah some people have done these but it\u2019s unfair to use this as a benchmark. When even one student does it, it becomes sort of a standard you have to fulfill. Although colleges don\u2019t say it, they expect you to do it as there are so many students out here seeing it as a requirement for admission. It\u2019s just too much. We\u2019re children. When did the process get so high stakes? EDIT: ok yeah guys colleges don\u2019t expect that, but pressure is rising. Also I\u2019m not talking about me, I\u2019m talking about others on this sub under pressure.",

You could have shit extracurriculars but write a banger essay and get in. To me, putting in 10+ hours on a single essay is worth it to possibly change the rest of my life trajectory.",

Reality is much different from what's discussed online.\n\nSince you mentioned med school, I'll give you a free tip and then I'm done with this thread:\n\nOne of the traps that many ambitious high-schoolers fall into (especially those who want to go into Medicine) is that they focus so much on the long-term that they make planning mistakes in the short-term.\n\nThe biggest planning mistake they make is that they just \\*\\*assume\\*\\* that they will succeed in undergrad and that they will \"get in\" to med school (or law school or whatever) when in reality the odds of this happening is much much lower. STEM is hard. Full stop. You will have a hard time just keeping up with your coursework that you'll forget that you ever wanted to spend your minuscule amount of free time helping a professor with research.\n\nI would put the estimate at somewhere around 2 out of every 10 randomly selected high school students who want to become medical doctors actually become medical doctors.\n\nThe smart play is to focus on being employable with your undergraduate degree rather than just assuming that your undergrad degree will just be a stepping-stone to something better. \n\nMajoring in biology, for instance, is a bad move for most people because the major is notoriously difficult to get a job with at the Bachelor's level. Chemical engineering, for instance, will better prepare you in terms of academic rigor that more closely approximates the med school experience and has the benefit of being highly employable if you choose not to be a medical doctor.",

Chances of me, an international student, getting into a US med school is 0.01% \n2. Pre-med is hard for EVERYONE \n\nI don\u2019t know why people go into college, taking up a biology major, pre-med and expect to get into medical school. It\u2019s just that biology major is very vague now and not many job prospects now. I, personally, plan to take up petroleum engineering or the like. Complete all pre reqs, maybe I get into med school, maybe I don\u2019t, I still have a career to fall back on. This is all just way into the future though. \n\nEDT: also, I\u2019m not trying to \u2018spin my comments.\u2019 At all. Just literally forgot what I was talking about.",

If their research passes peer review, why is it any less valid than research done by an expert in the field?",

Its really not that hard to first author you just need to come up with the initial idea which sometimes can be as simple as a precalculus level matrix decomposition. You then can collab with the pHD students to implement your idea where they will help you code and stuff. This is how I first authored in a high impact factor peer reviewed journal.\n\nYou don't have to be a genius.

First, the absolute majority of these high school results will never be cited, or read by anyone else. Second, if any researcher comes along and actually need to use their results, the researcher is supposed to read through the literature and work out the logic behind it (if it has been peer reviewed the logic holds). Researchers aren't supposed to go straight to the conclusion and copy whatever there is in that paragraph down. If their results are going to be used by a company the company's technical staffs are going to think very hard about it before trying to implement said results. Again, all of the above are all considering a very very rare case of a high schooler producing nontrivial results.\n\nResearch isn't like someone adding new pages to a \"Book of Facts\" by coming up and doing something on their own. Research is getting a result, finding \"professors and scientists\" to look over these results and then when people agree on the validity of these results they add that to the \"Book of Facts\".

None of their research results in medicine will be significant enough to even be considered by cutting-edge researchers. If their results are significant enough (in a very very very rare case), their results will be pondered over by peer review committees to be published in a more reputable journal, and by other researchers who wish to make use of their results.",

My dad was also a judge in another category (he did it for the free shit lol) and a major point of emphasis is how much work you actually think the participant did on their project. Unless you fall through the cracks (or you are international or a board point of emphasis, which I think is BS) you don't win grand awards.\n\nEven then, I don't want to come off as flexy. I'm applying to RSI this year and it is 5 times harder than anything I have ever accomplished. All the people there are insanely smart and talented at research and outside (I know 3 or 4 people who went from a group chat and they are the smartest people I have met in my life), and for this dude to shit on them and compare their projects to potato batteries is disrespectful and pathetic.",

Redoing the high school student's work took valuable time that probably could've been spent on writing grants or doing research. That said, they shouldn't have given the high school student such important work. My mentor was careful to properly teach me lab techniques before letting me do them on my own, although I still messed up a polyacrylamide gel once (wasn't too big of a deal, thank goodness).\n\nI highly respect my mentor (postdoc when I left) and all the researchers in the lab I interned at. They can spend months on a single experiment that ends up not working out or have weeks of work wiped out because they lost a PCR tube. Even with all that stress, my mentor and the other researchers are some of the nicest people I've met.\n\nBTW, good luck on finding a lab! If you're cold emailing, be super polite and emphasize your passion (sounds clich\u00e9d, but it's really the only thing you have since I'm guessing you haven't learned lab techniques). It's gonna take some work, since high school students can be more of a liability than an asset haha.",

I am going to clarify what my point was, and then I am going to end this conversation. \n\nIn my original comment, I said that reaserch is the job of the PHD, not the job of a child. Expecting children to do reaserch is unethical because it puts them in the position where they can easily be scammed, and because it gives them a job that they are simply unqualified to do. While students are not frequently self publishing, there becomes more and more of a push every year. My point is that **the increasing pressure for students to be extraordinary and perform academiclly at a level way above of what is possible is beginning to dive into dangerous and unethical territory**\n\nStudents and their parents will do anything to get them into a top school, and if you look at details about t10 admissions you will see that self lead reaserch does in fact help you. A lot. Most top schools have a ranking system, where 1 is the highest. To achieve a 1 in academics, you need to be extraordinary. Applicants ranked 1 are accepted at a significantly higher rate than students ranked 2 or lower. Reaserch assistantships are no longer extraordinary, so students need to push to the next level. This is what I meant when I said that assistantships are the \"bare minimum\". They are one of many activities that are no longer viewed as extraordinary. Just as club leadership were once outstanding and faded into oblivion. \n\nWhat is probably inevitable at this point is unethical. That is all I am saying.",

Please don't complain about everything you see on a more competitive applicant (particularly because research is actually something that is harder to \"fake\"), those people worked hard for it and you are tearing them down because... well I don't know why.\n\nMost \"research experience\" for high schoolers really means \"worked for a professor\". This is usually the case when you see their name as the 5000th author or something on a paper. Professors are willing to take in free labor to help them automate parts of their studies. That is a mutually beneficial relationship, and the high schoolers do real work with their skills in those environments.\n\nFor papers people research a wide variety of topics. There are actually a lot of low hanging fruits in pretty much every subject (although not across all fields. It will be much easier to produce original results in graph theory than say set theory), and those high schoolers get a mentor, do the work, put together a paper then send it to a publisher/competition. The paper is then reviewed for quality and legitimacy before being published/awarded any honors. \n\nI know high schoolers who produce original enough results in physics, mathematics, biology, computer science and more. You can read their papers at [http://www.yau-awards.science/?page\\_id=51&lang=en](http://www.yau-awards.science/?page_id=51&lang=en) if you are interested. The papers are reviewed rigorously by a team of experts. Please respect their results.",

I am insulted by the fact that you think research is absolutely *exclusive* to PhDs, and by your genuine lack of understanding of exactly what research is. You think high school students are too young with too little experience to do research. I am telling you that research isn't like surgery, research is about producing original enough results, or improving/generalizing upon results of other researchers. If a high school student can produce good enough result to be published by a journal with some form of a review policy (you can't expect them to make good results to compete for pages on Science or Nature, but that doesn't mean their results are meaningless), or get accepted by prestigious competitions, then their results are good enough. Their work isn't proven by their degree or years of experience, at the end of the day their work should *prove* themselves.   \n\n\nBy the way read up on MIT-primes, Yau-awards etc. They are all high quality high school research opportunity/competition.",

Colleges aren't mentally deficient. Colleges know what are scams and what aren't. Publishing in pay-to-publish scam journals might be a good way to game your own wallet, but it won't game any reputable universities (seriously they are on the frontline of research, you think they won't know?). Also, just because there are scams doesn't mean high school students should be barred from this activity. College consultants have scammers among them too, doesn't mean that we should get rid of all college consultants.\n\nAlso personally I think the worry that academia will be used to \"game the undergrad admission system\" should be quite minor. Between the nepotism, professor rivalry, slaving non-tenure researchers and creative ways it is used to pad credentials for grad school admissions, some high school students dipping their toes in with their results (no matter the quality) is a very very very insignificant problem.",

Literally everything except olympiads. Research is a place where they will still have to do some work, and learn some things. If they pay a middleman to get hooked up with a better mentor then sure, doesn't make high school research bad.\n\nIn art they can literally pay for professionals to do touch-ups on their children's works. In photography... Well you can guess the background of a kid who does underwater scuba diving photography of coral reefs in Hawaii. History? Where do you think the majority of those who attend oversea programs in Spain and archaeology programs in Rome stand on the social status pyramid? English? Easy, hire a tutor. \n\nSee? One can make the \"rich people pay for better services\" argument for almost everything. Welcome to human civilization, that's how it has been for about the entire duration of recorded history. Are history, english and art ECs inferior? Are they supposed to be thrown away? *Have we thrown them away?* No. Because rich people can pay for better opportunities across all of the playing fields, but that doesn't make the field any less valid of a field to play on. For every one percenter of the society playing on a field, there are 99 other non-one percenters playing as well.",

You constantly stress *experience*. I am going to tell you a horror story. Undergrad research is a lot a lot more common than high school research, and at good schools there are plenty of independent projects each year.

On top of that, if you're lucky enough to have the chance to publish/write a manuscript, you will have many people working on it and the hardest point is explaining results which a 17-year-old won't be doing alone. \n\nIn summary, a 17 year old can't just fuck around and do whatever they want and there are many checks done along the way by higher-ups to ensure that shit makes sense and is actually worth doing.\n\nOn top of that, the process of actually publishing will weed out any pointless results or papers. You'll only get published if the work is useful to experts in the field, which is determined by experts in the field.\n\nLong story short, what you said makes literally no sense and is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how research works.",

I\u2019ve learned insane amounts of stuff in a very small amount of time, more than high school has ever taught me, and I\u2019d do it all over again even if it meant no college credit. I\u2019m not going to lie and say this wasn\u2019t for my college app, but i genuinely enjoy the experience and it will help me way beyond just being a line on a college app.",

As the bar for academic and extracurricular excellence raises each year, students have to maintain competitiveness, and they do so by performing the activities you listed above. Colleges don't expect you to do those things, it's just that your high-achieving peers do so in order to impress admissions officers, and you follow suit. If you think that these activities are too much for a 17-year old, try talking to the millions of kids who are ferociously competing for limited spots at top schools and convince them to step down their game.\n\nYou can't just expect to get in to a *prestigious* T20 if you don't have the work ethic and talent of your competitors. Yeah I realize that the bar has been set extremely high for a bunch of kids, but as admissions data has shown, kids can be extremely competitive and fixated on those top schools.",

I'm guessing the fact that their mom ran the lab at the local university might have had something to do with it...\n\nWith SAT scores, being able to afford private tutors helps quite a bit. Not to mention all the programs that seem to send American high school kids off to ostensibly help orphans so they can write about it on their application essays.\n\nThe good news is that the admissions officers must develop a decent nose for sniffing out such padded applications. I would bet that many of them would be as impressed with the kid who works at Burger King after school as they would be with the one who mapped the genome at his dad's laboratory.\n\nAlso, if you're an international student, your story is probably going to be more interesting for admissions officers because it is different than what they normally see. I would really figure out what is different about your experience than the typical American applicant's, and sell that. Think about how much you'll enrich the university you attend with your different perspective.",

The top American high schools will inevitably tell the universities that they \"do not rank students,\" which is absolute BS--how do you think they choose their valedictorian, calculate honor roll, etc.? The issue is that if you're not the top student, the best American universities seem to lose a lot of interest--there aren't enough spots at Harvard for every valedictorian in the US. By not ranking students, a school has a much better chance of getting their good students into top colleges.  \n\n\nAlso, American recommendations tend to be glowing in general. The stereotype that we Americans are overly positive isn't completely without merit. A lot of my colleagues abroad would probably include shortcomings of students, seeing the recommendation as honest evaluations.

Regardless of whether the student was genuinely capable or not or worked to get the position, doing true academic research **at face value** takes a lot more intelligence and skill and proficiency in a field than working at fast food. you can argue all you want but we all know its true. This holds true in the cases where most kids dont reveal that they got the position through nepotism. However, like you said, if the AOs can draw a familial connection between research location/mentor and student, the student's research efforts will most likely be devalued. Colleges are research institutions so naturally they want researchers (either proven or with potential). Again keep in mind, I write this if we consider academic research done by a high schooler purely at face value.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the amount of students who independently reach out to colleges and do research is definetly far more than the amount that get the research position through nepotism.",

At many universities abroad, you actually have to show promise in your specific field. So Professor X from the Cognitive Science department would be asking about your experience with neuroscience; it wouldn't be Robbie the former Theta Chi bro saying, \"Let's choose this one, his name is on an article that sounds impressive--even though I cannot evaluate his role in it or whether the article holds up.\"   \n\n\nThe one field within American universities where a specialist is gauging a student's abilities is athletics. (Of course, at most top universities outside the US, being great at tennis isn't going to help you get in.)  \n\n\nAlso, most foreign colleges probably don't take things like race into account in admissions.

These over the top things aren\u2019t the benchmark, but if someone has them then colleges will rightfully consider that in the process. Colleges also factor in the context of the student and compare you to others of the same socioeconomic status, so I think it\u2019s more than fair.\n\nAlso, I think when you describe colleges, you\u2019re only thinking about T20s. Here\u2019s the thing: T20s want students who are overachievers because their campus is a good fit for overachievers. Once you go to a T20, there\u2019s still gonna be pressure to do research, etc. \n\nBut you don\u2019t have to go to a T20. There are other colleges which are just as good, just not highly ranked. Yes, T20s expect a lot, but you\u2019re also expecting a lot out of colleges because you want to be accepted to the top 0.1% of colleges in the country.",

      "text": "I really think selection size is skewing our results here though. We have A2C, reversechanceme, chanceme (dumpster fire), collegeresults, ACT/SAT making up the main body of our Reddit college bubble. Even if we ignore overlap (which you definitely shouldn\u2019t in a practical sense), the amount of subscribers works out to be ~590,000. [This PEW study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/09/a-majority-of-u-s-colleges-admit-most-students-who-apply/%3famp=1) suggests that this is ~6% of the pool. Again, *this ignores people subscribed to multiple subs and only reaffirms how minor the amount of truly god-tier applicants there are.* \n\nWe see people who post about their cancer research, their 1600/4.0, and their Google internships, but these are the people who feel compelled to do so. These subs are full of high-achieving individuals, and mixed with the subtle (and not so subtle) competitiveness of college applications, some feel inclined to share with people. Sometimes it\u2019s just sharing to share, other times it might not be. My point is, I think the worries that we need XYZ to be truly competitive is overblown. The amount of people who really are doing mind-boggling things is small, and isn\u2019t a true benchmark.",

Reality is much different from what's discussed online.\n\nSince you mentioned med school, I'll give you a free tip and then I'm done with this thread:\n\nOne  of the traps that many ambitious high-schoolers fall into (especially  those who want to go into Medicine) is that they focus so much on the  long-term that they make planning mistakes in the short-term.\n\nThe  biggest planning mistake they make is that they just \\*\\*assume\\*\\* that  they will succeed in undergrad and that they will \"get in\" to med school  (or law school or whatever) when in reality the odds of this happening  is much much lower. STEM is hard. Full stop. You will have a hard time  just keeping up with your coursework that you'll forget that you ever  wanted to spend your minuscule amount of free time helping a professor  with research.\n\nI would put the  estimate at somewhere around 2 out of every 10 randomly selected high  school students who want to become medical doctors actually become  medical doctors.\n\nThe smart play is  to focus on being employable with your undergraduate degree rather than  just assuming that your undergrad degree will just be a stepping-stone  to something better.\n\nMajoring in  biology, for instance, is a bad move for most people because the major  is notoriously difficult to get a job with at the Bachelor's level.  Chemical engineering, for instance, will better prepare you in terms of  academic rigor that more closely approximates the med school experience  and has the benefit of being highly employable if you choose not to be a  medical doctor.",

      "text": "First of all, colleges definitely do not expect it. It\u2019s just become more and more prominent as an idea among college applicants\u2019 minds. \n\nHowever, I\u2019d think a major reason for this because as there were never official benchmarks or \u201cchecklist style\u201d requirements for applying to college, other than the bare minimum GPA, the only way most parents (that don\u2019t have direct access to college admission officers and such directly reliable sources) of younger students could get information would be from parents of students who are graduating/have graduated/have been admitted to college. \n\nAs a result of this, the parents of one such kid that had been admitted to college *partially by means of* having something like \u201cresearch with _____ professor at ____ university\u201d under their belt, may carry this message over to eager parents of younger students, leading these parents to then tell their child to \u201cdo research\u201d or something as prestigious as that, which *they* expect to be a good thing to do for college. \n\nAs it goes, this message can be (and is indeed) further conveyed as *increasingly crucial or essential* for colleges, altering the mindset of a large portion of college applicants and/or their parents, all the while colleges never pushing this themselves. Sure they\u2019re aware of this mindset becoming more common among the applicants, but they ultimately just want the best of the best that apply there, and that\u2019s determined literally only by the application, resume, and essay (and maybe a Zoom interview to finalize decisions) that each person submits to them. \n\nSo regardless of how stacked those of a graduating class of batch of applicants are with these insane statistics like test scores and grades, along with insane extracurriculars, the college just wants the top people in that batch. If it\u2019s a relatively dumb or  weak batch of applicants, the people with the highest among this batch are the ones that are accepted at _____ university. If it\u2019s a relatively high scoring, high ranking, and high achieving batch of applicants, the people with the highest among this batch are the ones that are accepted at _____ university. \n\nBottom line: colleges themselves most certainly *do not* expect this of applicants. It\u2019s completely 100% the applicants\u2019 choice what they do with their four years of high school, and while yes, it\u2019s unfair because all students don\u2019t have the same opportunities, it\u2019s just how it works. That\u2019s why the holistic admission process is becoming increasingly popular and ideal among highly selective colleges, allowing each applicant to be completely examined (and their background, access to opportunities, income, etc. can be considered as well as the typical grades, ECs, scores, etc.).",

When I went to San Francisco, there were many homeless, same in some areas of LA and NYC. I am not saying this problems do not exist, I say that compared to the rest of the world, the financial aspect is clearly superior in the US. Pre-pandemic, the US had an unemployment rate of 3%. That is insane. \n\nI have family living in the US. They are considered low-income, literally LOW-INCOME, because they work as Uber drivers and waiters so they earn minimum wage. They have a beautiful apartment in San Diego, 2 cars, television, food, and they go on vacations every year. Here in Argentina, you can become a Doctor (minimum 7 years of college) and earn 4000 dollars a year and barely subsist. \n\nIn my opinion, although income inequality is a big issue in first world countries, the main difference with us is that most of the considered \u201cpoor\u201d have a decent quality of life. Standards in America are obviously higher, but when thought worldwide, it is incredible. And that is why many people want to live there despite the many other social issues you have.",
