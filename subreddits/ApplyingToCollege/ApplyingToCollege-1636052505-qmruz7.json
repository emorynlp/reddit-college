  "text": "I recently submitted my application to Stanford REA and was contacted today for an alumni interview. On the application portal, it states that additional documentation received after the deadline may not be evaluated by the admissions committee as they make decisions once an applicants file is considered complete. Since interviews are considered in the admissions process even though they are optional, would Stanford review my file again after they receive the interviewers notes even if they\u2019ve already made a decision? Thanks for any help!",
