  "text": "i know this sounds snobby, but every conversation i have with adults these days is about college. teachers ask (i do value their opinions more than others), all my mom and i talk about is the FASFA and scholarships etc (ofc i love that she wants to help) BUT i HATE when unrelated adults want to give me advice. today i came into my mom\u2019s work and one of her coworkers (a man) decided to lecture me for 30 mins about how i have to attend a school in state. i got accepted into the honors college at said school, so i understand, but seriously?? i really don\u2019t want everyone\u2019s opinion all the time. and i know the same thing will happen at thanksgiving dinner next week. i\u2019m just so tired of talking about college admissions, the SAT, my gpa, everything. i cant breathe. \n\nnot to mention, he informed me that i have to find a man in college because there\u2019s a shortage of college-educated men and women are having a hard time finding husbands. are you kidding me?? we\u2019re talking about my future (albeit reluctantly on my part) and he just had to bring up men.",

You can listen, or tell them that you have your own plans and you know what you're doing, and be firm and polite - or not. There's nothing wrong with saying \"I've thought this through and I'm pretty sure of my own needs - I'm good, thanks.\" Or you can say you don't want to talk about it. Or that you want to make your own mistakes. Or you can listen if you value that person and her/his opinion.\n\nWe certainly don't need older people telling young women to go to school to find husbands. Christ on a stick. What is this, 1962?",

As soon as I turned 18 they all hit me with the \"What colleges are you going to? Got accepted yet? What majors? What career?\" Like please just draw my blood and let me breathe (joking a bit here, it's a conversation starter but because I'm there so often it's exhausting).  \n\n\nAlso it's awkward for me because I'm going to art school. So the reactions... vary a lot. I have \"family friends\" who I've seen maybe 4 times in my life and who are really wealthy, and they were telling me things like \"Art schools are crappy junk, you should just go to \\[insert private college that is somehow more expensive than art school\\].\" One even said that traveling the world is better than going to college... As if anyone but rich people can choose to do that? Even the person in that family who was an artist told me not to, and that I should give up on going to uni and (big surprise here) marry a rich man. Who's going to tell them that... nevermind.",
