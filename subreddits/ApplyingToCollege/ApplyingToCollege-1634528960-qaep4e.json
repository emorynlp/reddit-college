      "text": "Yes and no.\n\nI did badly at my 1st uni because of a chronic illness. \n\nI transferred to a nearby community college that had a \u201ctranscript waiver\u201d. This means I didn\u2019t have to submit my transcripts, and therefore I could start with a fresh GPA. This also means for admission and registration purposes: I am a freshman again. \n\nI\u2019m listed as a freshman. \n\nSo if you transfer under those or similar circumstances, then yes, you would be a freshman. \n\nAcademic fresh start, I believe, is a Texas initiative. I don\u2019t know much about it. \n\nMy state doesn\u2019t offer Fresh Start. It\u2019s just my CC.",
