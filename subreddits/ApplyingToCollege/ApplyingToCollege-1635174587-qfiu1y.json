  "text": "I applied to MSU under the early action plan yesterday and today I received an email to activate my MSU account. I activate the account and it asks me to pay the 75$ application fee, however I have already done so while submitting my application through the common app. I have emailed the university about this. Has anyone else faced the same issue? If yes, how have u resolved it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",
