  "text": "Does anyone know what the deadline for all materials is for Northeastern EA? I'm currently waiting on an additional letter of rec and the person is out of town on a business trip, so I imagine they're pretty busy. They probably won't get it in today, so is it worth including them on my application still? Thanks :)",

      "text": "If the admissions website does not indicate a separate deadline for materials, then there is no separate deadline (most colleges do not have a separate deadline).\n\nMost colleges have an unstated grace period for school documents like recommendations.\n\nIf this is an extra, \"other recommender,\" not a teacher rec, it is not necessary to have. If you haven't already asked this person, it's kinda late. That said, if they submit the rec in the next few days, it will most likely be  reviewed with your app.",
