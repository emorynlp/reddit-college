  "text": "As a class of 2021 kid who got fucked\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 this year, we really should stop complaining. Juniors, seniors, all of us. The class of 1453 had a way worse admissions cycle. First of all, only the rich got to go to college\ud83e\udd23. Like poor people couldn't even apply. Also, there weren't any majors like pre-med/pre-law, east asian studies, or even gender studies\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc09! And the majors that did exist like math and economics were crude as fuck!  Also, imagine graduating high school while your WHOLE CITY gets conquered \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80Like imagine growing up, knowing that Constantinople was once the greatest city in the greatest empire, but by the time you were born Byzantium was just the crumbling city and a couple of despots! So \ud83d\udc7d\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc7bunlucky! Then the Ottomans destroy what's left of your city and house, and your graduation ceremony was being sold to slavery. So I really think we should all stop complaining\u2753\ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd1e.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s for you dense mfs out here",
