  "title:": "Might have fucked up badly with teacher recommendations, need advice",
  "text": "My school uses MaiaLearning (a third-party college admissions/etc platform that my school's website integrates with) to manage teacher recommendations. I submitted my request for a teacher recommendation to my HS late, and as a consequence, the teacher was only able to finish writing the recommendation today.\n\nBefore this, I made the very stupid decision of **submitting the CommonApp**. The consequence of this was that all other documents were visible on each school's portal, except the teacher recommendation. The teacher recommendation is finished on the CommonApp, but not in the individual school portals. The colleges can't see it. They usually allow you to upload documents to their portal after you submit the CommonApp, but I have no way of accessing it myself, so I don't think I can submit it manually.\n\nI just realized this about half an hour ago. As you may have noticed, the EA deadline for East Coast colleges was about twenty minutes ago. I spent the last few minutes desperately trying to send out emails to whatever schools I could manage, trying to at least offer some proof that the teacher recommendation had been submitted. But I don't expect this to succeed. So the most likely outcome of this is that **I just blew my ability to apply EA for basically any schools**. I'm going to spend the next hour seeing if I can get my application into whatever schools might have a later EA deadline, but again, I'm not optimistic.\n\nSo I have to proceed with regular decision. I still need to find some way to get those recommendations to the relevant schools. Is it possible to re-submit the CommonApp somehow?\n\nI'm so worried right now. Surely someone has had this problem before.",

      "text": "We did the exact same thing, my son applied way early on common app (September to mid October) without the official transcript or letter of rec. So for a period of time, the portal have all documents except letters of rec or school transcript. The counselor and teachers finally finished up and submit through naviance in mid October. Then the schools will go ahead and download them from the common app. Within a few days after their submission, they all appeared in the portal. So don\u2019t worry about it",
