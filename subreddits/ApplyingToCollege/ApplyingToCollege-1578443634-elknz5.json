  "text": "So I asked my AP Calc teacher for a college application more than a month ago and he still has not done it yet.\n\nI have reminded him countless times that they were supposed to be due on the 1st but nope still nothing.\n\nAlso keep in mind that:\n\n1. He only teaches maybe 3-4 classes, meaning he has 4-5 free periods\n2. Every time I've asked him, he tells me \"he'll do it by the end of the day\"\n\nSo instead, I email my microbiology teacher from last year who:\n\n1. Is in another country currently (the country doesn't have the best wifi either)\n2. I emailed through a school email (WHY IS THIS MAN CHECKING HIS SCHOOL EMAIL ON VACATION!!)\n\nand he completes it in three days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHAT THE HECK!",

                          "text": "It\u2019s actually required of teachers in my district \u2014 fully and unequivocally upheld by administration. Do they have to write every single one that is asked of them? No. But if they were to pull something like this physics teacher, they would be reprimanded. We had a teacher (physics, actually) get reprimanded my junior year for rejecting 10/11 rec letter requests, writing only for people who scored a certain threshold or more on the ACT. It was something ridiculous like 34 or 35, and considering I went to a low-income public school, that was not very common at all. He wasn\u2019t forced to write those 10 rec letters he rejected, but he received a warning and was told not to do that again.\n\nWhen you work as a teacher, especially one who teaches juniors and seniors, you should expect to be asked for a letter of recommendation, if not multiple letters of rec. Perhaps it\u2019s not literally in the job description, but half of a teacher\u2019s job isn\u2019t in their literal, actual job description. If you can\u2019t write a solid letter of rec for a student, tell them no. But to uphold these incredibly high standards is a selfish move. Most teachers I know have \u201ctemplate\u201d letters of rec where they could complete a letter of rec in a couple minutes max, and then for students they took a particular liking to, they write letters from scratch.",

I imagine it was speaking mostly to the effort I put in even though I struggled and whatnot. I have another letter in a class I thrived in which should speak more to my intellectual curiosity and capabilities. I think they should complement each other since they show very different sides to me. I was honestly pretty scared of her, but she truly cares about her students at the end of the day and it shows. Some teachers just kind of suck, but others can be fantastic and even if they're intimidating.",
