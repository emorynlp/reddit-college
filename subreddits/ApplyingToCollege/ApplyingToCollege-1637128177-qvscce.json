  "text": "First, wishing you all admission at your 1st choice schools.\n\nI'm a parent of a senior who is looking at a few schools and out of curiosity, I looked up most of the full time faculty in my son's major of choice in his top 2 college choices. I realize that the comments on that website are to be taken for what they're worth, being anonymous and without the benefit of any background info pertaining to motive, truthfulness, etc.  However, when several hundred comments are similar, it is interesting.\n\nSo I'm curious if you've looked at reviews like rate my professor (and similar), unigo, and any others, and if these have influenced your preferences at all.",

      "text": "I haven't! However, I have looked up schools and seen professors come up as involved in scandals and that has made me a little more hesitant to apply. I think it all depends. What was said? If it seemed like a common bad thread was formed I would take pause. But ultimately I don't think it would cause me not to apply or attend unless I thought it was truly egregious (because tbf you never know). I'd try getting in contact with current students and trying to gather more info. Or, if the college is popular, looking at the subreddit or tweets.",

          "text": "Thank you! Good wisdom. \n\nWhat I found was that many of the faculty did not welcome questions and especially one, who is the only prof teaching a 4th yr required course, only offered once a year, taunted students to drop the course and had difficult exams they didn't curve, and when the class average for the exam was 59 with no one over a C, the prof said something like \"I told you to drop\" but knowing well the result would be a an extra year to re-take the class, same professor.\nOver 50 students petitioned the major department about this professor and the reply was to study harder.\nThis isn't exactly a scandal nor is it headline material like the Yale lawsuit. However, the impact to students is significant.\n\nI am looking for subreddits as you suggested. If we get to the point of considering the uni, we'll plan to ask current students during an on-campus visit. I'm tempted to see if there's a way to visit the \"evil gatekeeper\" class while it's still in session this semester.",

              "text": "Ah, yeah, that would certainly give me significant pause. In that instance, I would genuinely rethink my application. For a petition to be filed but nothing gets done certainly makes it seem like the students feeling aren't cared about. I would hate to go to a school where I'm spending a ton of money, time and effort only for it to seem like teachers are purposefully making things harder. Those kinds of weed out classes or it's been this way for years so it must be okay classes are awful. I hope you learn that things have changed during your on campus visit! Or, at the very least, that there are alternative pathways to go down in regards to that class.",
