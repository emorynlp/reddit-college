      "text": "Accept it. It is a highly ranked school and zero tuition. Even if you were to be accepted to a Top20 in the U.S., the cost is likely to be much higher.\n\nIf you think having a degree from a U.S. or Canadian school will be more helpful to your career, I suggest applying to a Master\u2019s program after you get your degree at Monash. Then you would pay for only two years at most in the U.S./Canada and may have more options for aid.",

For both career advancement or post-grad, getting hands on opportunities and projects to work on will make you stand out.",
