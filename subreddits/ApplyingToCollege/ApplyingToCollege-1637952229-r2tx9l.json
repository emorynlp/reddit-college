      "text": "i would recommend going with a roommate! it\u2019s so nice to have someone there to navigate your first semester with, and it\u2019s way easier to meet other people when you\u2019re with someone already. you have a built in buddy to explore with, learn things about your campus, etc. which is invaluable when you\u2019re so new to the place. plus i think it\u2019s important to learn how to live with other people in that way, yk the whole college experience :)\n\npros of having a single include privacy, more space, and maybe a little more freedom with your room. cons are that since most people have roommates it may feel like everyone else has more friends, you may get some fomo, it\u2019ll be harder to meet people if you\u2019re not already a social butterfly",

      "text": "IMO, if you can afford a single and need some space to yourself, but are worried about meeting people, look into quad singles.  Some colleges have single bedrooms but a living and bathroom shared w 2 or 4 people.  This is great to meet different people but still have own space if you can afford it.  A single that isn't part of a quad can get lonely if you are a social person.",

      "text": "i literally don\u2019t know what i would do without my single. like, the thought of not being able to walk freely and naked in my room, or allow myself to make a mess in the room and clean up when i\u2019m ready, or to play music, videos, etc out loud at any hour of the night? insane. i have plenty of friends, you don\u2019t have to be in your dorm all day so if you go outside you will meet people. I value being able to go out and socialize and then have this private space i can come back to to wind down. it all comes down to what\u2019s more important to you, having the crutch of someone to hang with the first few weeks while you find friends, or privacy all year. maybe a roommate your first year is a good idea to make friends and then transition to a single as you get older.",
