  "title:": "Worried about transferring to Georgia Tech",
  "text": "I\u2019m technically a first year at the current institution I attend, but I have about ~74 college credits acquired prior because i did dual enrollment during high school, where I earned my AS. Because of this Ive met all of my prerequisites aside Calculus.\n\nI\u2019m looking to apply to the Applied Language and Intercultural Studies BS. \n\nAn additional requirement for my intended major is that I have a 3.0 STEM GPA prior to transferring. I\u2019m sitting at 3.0 STEM GPA exactly, due to Cs made in a lecture/lab. \n\nI\u2019m taking calculus next semester. My current school does letter grades as B-, B, B+, A-, A. If I made a B- in Calculus I would put myself below the STEM GPA requirement.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I took intermediate inorganic chemistry lecture/lab, it would act as a safety, and would somewhat \u201cmake up\u201d for the Cs made in a previous lecture/lab.",
