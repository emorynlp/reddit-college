  "title:": "UC Application: Which courses go under G instead of A-F?",
  "text": "I am an out of state student. Which courses would go under the G elective category instead of the regular A-F? Is it just any courses that exceed the requirement for that category? \n\nWhat if more courses are recommended than required? For example, on the [website](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html) it says that three years of math are required but four are recommended, so would I put my fourth year of math under C or G? Category D also says computer science, engineering, and applied science can be used as additional science for a third year, so would I put computer science under D or G?\n\nAlso, where would accounting go? It doesn't really fit in A-F or any of the G elective options.",
