  "text": "so i flunked my DE BIO 181 course last year (wrote why in my additional comments lol) and i retook the course in the closest equivalent my school offers and got an A rlly quick so i\u2019m not concerned with that. the thing is that since i failed that first semester, i was supposed to be taken out of that class second semester and placed into a different science, but lo and behold, i was in the DE BIO 182 class second semester and it shows up like that class on my HS transcript, but on my CC transcript it\u2019s non-existent.\n\ni got a C that semester (might retake anyway soon) but it\u2019s still a passing grade especially for the UC\u2019s. i\u2019m just confused on how to report this because i technically wasn\u2019t supposed to be in that class, wasn\u2019t enrolled in BIO 182 at my CC, got no CC credit, but it still had the rigor of a CC course. would i list this under courses taken in college or just a regular high school course?? i already took honors bio the year before so i couldn\u2019t switch into that (and i\u2019m assuming nothing fit with my schedule).",
