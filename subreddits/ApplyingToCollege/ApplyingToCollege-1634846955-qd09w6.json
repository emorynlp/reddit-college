          "text": "Someone reclaimed it, but doesn't actually moderate it.  I've talked with them about joining the mod team to help, but it hasn't gotten anywhere.  I think it could really benefit from a mod-based verification system where people who want to read essays for others have to be verified by the mods, just like AOs and other professionals here on A2C.  Obviously introducing that hurdle would significantly cut down on the number of reviewers, but it may be the only way to add credibility.",

Totally what this person said \u2013 don\u2019t send your essays to random strangers who haven\u2019t confirmed their identity, and especially not to other high school seniors! If anyone is interested in working with me, I can send you messages through Instagram/twitter and/or links to some of my published writing as proof of identity. Best of luck to everyone on your applications!!",
