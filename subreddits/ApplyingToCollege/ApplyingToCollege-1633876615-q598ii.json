  "text": "There exists a political issue which I greatly care about. I'm incredibly passionate about it and would fight people over it... yet I've never done anything regarding it. It's just always been something that made me angry when I saw it on the news. It definitely gets my blood boiling, my tension high, my adrenaline pumping, and my mouth ready to spout a conglomeration of angry words, but that's just it. No action, no end result, nothing comes out of what I am doing (which is sadly nothing).\n\nI want to turn my passion for this issue into something tangible and actionable, but I am at a loss here. I live in a bumfuck town so it's not like I know anyone that could help me advocate for the issue in real life, and it's not a progressive circlejerk cause either so I can't make low-effort Canva Instagram posts and spam follower requests - there just isn't traction for it.\n\nHow else can I advocate for this issue? I was thinking of scouring the web to find like-minded teens and writing letters to my state and Congressional representatives. I'm asking this in r/a2c because I've seen a lot of \"political advocacy\" ECs being mentioned, so I'm hoping that someone knows how to start one. I'm not even in it for college apps - it probably won't come to fruition until a year or two anyways - but for contributing to a cause I strongly support.",

Action conveys importance because your risking community perceptions and personal exposure, where you may or may not have support.\n\nConsider questions: Sharing with others why this issue is important to you? should be important to them? what you want done- change in outcome?\nHow can you achieve that change? Community involved or solo? How to draw attention?\n\nGood luck!",
