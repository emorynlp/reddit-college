  "text": "The posted acceptance rate is not yours. Let me clarify what I mean by this.\n\nThat acceptance rate that universities post merely indicates how competitive it was. That doesn't mean that's your chances of getting in. \n\nThere is going to be someone applying who has a 0 percent chance of getting in, betting on that 30 percent acceptance rate.\n\nBut then again, there is going to be someone discouraged by that 5 percent acceptance rate, when in actuality, the chance of that specific person getting in could be 95%. \n\nBottom line: apply to Harvard. Yale. Duke. Your dream. Because you never know if your essay your parents hate will elicit tears from an AO. \n\nGood luck!",

College applications uncertainty is comprised largely of the latter, initially we don\u2019t really know how AOs will view us but as we get more observations we understand this better. That\u2019s why if you get into a T10, you feel more confident about getting into another one - now you have more information about how AOs view your application and uncertainty decreases.",

A 60k a year school offering 30k in scholarships costs the same as a 30k a year school. Many times the cost of a school is just a gmimick to make them more appealing in the market when they offer scholarships. So please dont fall for it.",

              "text": "That is true that small factors like that are present, but those factors are only justified by the circumstances that precede them. A certain population of people are going to apply, that population will be arranged for review in accordance to university methods, and each application will be assigned for review by a specific person/people. And those people (AO's) are going to, up to that point, have lived enough life to where their biases, beliefs, and outlook are shaped and solid. That person's reaction, ultimately, will be justified by the myriad circumstances that have come before, and that final decision is already in motion. \n\nAcceptance rate, whether in relation to the basic results of prior years, or one's own, educated guess with regard to a complete resume, is invalid and only useful to receive some kind of piece of mind. That's why economists and pollsters are unreliable in achieving a clear-cut result, because the mathematical formulas they use don't take into account EVERY factor involved, and as of right now, they can't. \n\nLastly, me saying that your result is basically set is like me saying that calculating the Earth's acceleration due to gravity as 9.81 m/s\\^2 is inaccurate. That's true, but what's rounded off is so small and insignificant that it's useless to gripe over. In the same way that it's useless for us (in this current day and age) to worry about considering EVERY factor on the table. It's just too much work that we can't even do.",
