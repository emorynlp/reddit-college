  "text": "I applied to college in the previous admissions cycle, and ultimately decided to go to a school that didn\u2019t take rec letters during their application process.\n\nI know I sorta waived my right to see the rec letters but I want to know what my teachers wrote. Just out of sheer curiosity. \n\nDoes anyone know how I could go about doing this? also is there a way to ask what a college rated your admissions profile after you started going to college somewhere else?",
