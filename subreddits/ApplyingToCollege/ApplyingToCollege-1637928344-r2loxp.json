  "text": "I'm an international student from Latin America, here the schools does not give you the possibility to create a club. We don't know what interships are, companies or organizations do not give that chance unless you have 18. Research\u00bf? What's that \u00bf college student or professors dont do that here. \n\nThere are a few options for extracurricular activities, I mean I have done many of them during my high school but I think that they are meaningful to me. I didn't know anything about US colleges 6 months ago, so I didn't know how important are extracurriculars.\n\nBut, in every chance me post you can see students with so many activities, creating organizations, founding clubs or getting amazing interships. So, here is my questions...\n\nHow many of those activities are really authentic. How many extracurriculars would you have if you wasn't planning to apply to a T20 or a T10?\n\nIs it worth it? I think yes, in my country admissions are only based on an exam, so its pretty easy to get in so student don't do further than study for the exam. BUT in the US you can see students looking for their passions, getting proffesional experience, trying to get the best grades and much more.\n\nI understand that it may be extremely difficult, time consuming and overwhelming. But hard times create strong people so... \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this guys?",
