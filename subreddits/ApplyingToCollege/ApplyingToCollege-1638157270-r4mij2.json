  "text": "Can I apply to Cornell, which is my top choice, early decision and if I get rejected, then apply to Emory ED 2, which is my other top choice college. Cornell decisions for early decision come out mid December and Emory ED 2 deadline is January 1st, so incase I get rejected by Cornell can I still apply to Emory ED 2?",

      "text": "Yes you can apply both ED1 and ED2.\n\nYou will have to wait for the ED1 decision to be released, and either get in and not apply to your ED2 choice, or get rejected or deferred ED1 and then you can immediately have your parent sign the ED2 financial responsibility form and turn in your ED2 application.\n\nWhat you cannot do is submit your ED 2 application along with its financial responsibility form before your ED1 decision is released.",
