  "text": "In high school, I was an excellent student. 9 AP classes, a 4.3 GPA, and a top 1 percent SAT. I visited a state school with a 1400 average SAT and loved the campus. I felt great. I picked a major, Business/Finance, because I felt that\u2019s what I felt was the best fit for me and my ECs.\n\nI come here and start reading. And reading. And reading. I see both my school and major get shit on with no opportunity to succeed to life. I understand that this is an elitist subreddit but jesus christ it makes me feel like I have no hope for the future and no path that will ever make me successful. \n\nI should probably stop reading but I keep on coming back here to validate myself and my major but I realize how dumb that is and how it is futile. I keep on second guessing my school and my major even though I should be thrilled to have the opportunity to study and develop there.\n\nI am sure that some of y\u2019all share the same sentiment and occasionally some of the judgement may be true but damn does it hurt.",

      "text": "The thing with this subreddit is that a lot of people have high aspirations and they assume everyone else does too. They're shooting for T20+ and they'll trash any school outside that because for them it would be a failure so they assume the same for others. Same with business/finance majors. They're shooting for Wall Street, investment banking, Goldman Sachs, etc. And yeah for those things you might need a T20 education. But you can get a business degree from a state school and have a great career and a great life. I just ignore any opinion expressed on here unless it's a current student talking about school culture or from someone flared as a professional. Do your own research, make your own decisions, and find your own value.",

Firstly, there are tons of employment and graduate school options that you can pursue with almost any major if you have a good skillset and GPA to back it up, buddy. Law school, Consulting, Academia, Foreign service, etc., all sorts of things I'm interested in. Secondly, economics is actually a common pathway to a lot of those careers. Thirdly, imagine having the AUDACITY to tell someone to their face that they're pursuing a useless major when you don't know what goals or motivations they have and what contingency plans they might have. My friend who said this is somewhat influenced by another friend I have who is very assertive in all things, including his conception of academic fields roughly as follows: Applied Sciences > Pure/Abstract sciences > Social Sciences & Humanities. On a related note, I don't know how realistic this is for most students but some people give advice that you can always double major in your passion and a more \"practical\" field that you might have some interest in or aptitude for. What are your thoughts on this suggestion, A2C?",

If I didn\u2019t get out of the south for college I would\u2019ve committed not-alive so I\u2019ve just accepted a mountain of debt as an inevitability lol. Quick tip: living in a dorm is a great way to make friends and establish yourself as part of a community, but if debt is a concern and living off campus is an option, look into it. I\u2019ll be saving about $6,000 (a little less once you factor in groceries, but there\u2019s tons of subs dedicated to grocery budgeting) per year by living like two minutes away in a university-sponsored apartment as opposed to dorming. Takes about $20k off my total estimated debt once I graduate. Just a suggestion.",

I was like you, a great high school student (valedictorian, NMS) who accepted a full-ride at a state flagship university. I did great there, won a national scholarship, and used those funds to pay my tuition at a T10 law school.  Worked as an attorney at a very highly regarded DC firm with Fortune 100 clients.  And guess what?  The great majority of my colleagues and highly-successful clients went to state schools.  You can succeed from absolutely anywhere.  And just as some individuals see an Ivy League degree and say \u201cwow,\u201d other hiring partners and state school alumni seek out the stellar students from Penn State, Virginia Tech, Clemson, Arizona or The University of Washington, finding them to be more relatable, well-rounded, client-friendly and ambitious.  And then there\u2019s the fact that once you are working in your field, employers and colleagues care only about the quality of your work; no one cares one whit about where you did your undergraduate work.\n\nAnd depending on your interests and the school you selected, you may have a far more amazing undergraduate experience at the state school you selected than some private T20.  My undergraduate university had amazing D1 sports and I had season tickets to everything.  Spent many great weekends traveling with friends to away games and tournaments.  I also loved to hike and I was within a few hours drive to several national parks and spent many hours with our outdoors club hiking, climbing and tubing.  And as for academics, I had terrific professors who hooked me up with research in my field, won the aforementioned scholarship, and got into five T12 law schools.  \n\nAs for business, there are many state schools with amazing programs that are highly recruited both nationally (Michigan, UVA, Indiana) and regionally (ASU, OSU, Minnesota).  \n\nReally, it\u2019s the student, not the school.  If your state school was a great fit for you, don\u2019t look back.  Have an amazing time, make some spectacular memories, get to know your professors, try some new things (clubs, intramurals, organizations), and achieve.  It\u2019s what makes you happy, not some random A2C kids who think life begins and ends at Harvard.  (And I like Harvard.  My husband went there.  But I wouldn\u2019t trade my state college experiences for his.).",

I remember waking up the morning of my first home football game as a freshman and seeing the lawns and parking lots just completely covered by happy tailgaters \u2014 families, grandparents, recent graduate, just all ages. And everyone kept offering me food from their grills, complete strangers sharing breakfast burritos just because they were so excited about the game that they wanted to share with fellow Wildcats.  And, yep, I had basketball tickets all four years and was beyond thrilled when they won the championship.  Also loved the hiking, the Southwest culture, the arts district, the food, the clubs \u2014 just a terrific time.\n\nAnd just as you said, as a very strong student I received tons of attention from my professors, who were just a generally wonderful crew, and had no trouble transitioning to an \u201celite\u201d law school and making law review there. But there are \u201celite\u201d opportunities at every state flagship university.  You just have to do well, attend office hours, and get to know the professors in your area(s) of interest.  (Which in my case meant joining a few professors and similarly-inclined students for wings on Friday afternoons.).  I was also in the Honors Program and made some strong connections in honors seminars (though most of my classes at Arizona had fewer than 40 students).  \n\nGood luck!  I hope there\u2019s sufficient progress on the Covid-19 front that you can all start safely on campus in the fall.   Go, \u2018Cats!",

But if \u201cThe Philosophy of Breaking Bad\u201d or \u201cEnvironmental Politics and The Avengers\u201d speaks to you, feel free to enjoy. \n\nGet to know the professors you find interesting.  Go to office hours if you have a question or want suggestions for other good courses in the major. Find other students who enjoy the class and take the instructor out for coffee or lunch (many schools have \u201ctake your professor to lunch\u201d programs that will even reimburse you, though most instructors won\u2019t let you pay).  Getting to know your professors is important for research and internship opportunities and recommendations, and also is just hugely rewarding in terms of learning about the field and perhaps acquiring a mentor and friend. \n\nFinally, get involved in any club or activity that you enjoy or have always wanted to try.  Now\u2019s the time before you get caught up in a career, relationship, kids, carpools and lawn care.  Golf?  Improv?  Writing for the school paper?  Knitting?  Intramural dodgeball?  Do it now.

You can define that for yourself and there are many ways to get there.\n\nA couple of cases to consider:\n\n1.  I have a friend to *barely* managed a 3.0 GPA at a state college.  He got fired or laid off from his first three jobs out of college, one of which was as a truck driver because he couldn't find anything else.  There's literally no one on this sub who would call that success.  Failure, right?  When he lost his third job he decided to start his own business and after a really rough first three years, it really took off.  My friend just retired a couple years ago with a beach house and a lake house.  He put all of his kids through college with cash and hasn't had a mortgage in years. \n\n2.  I have another friend who was in remedial math classes in 7th grade.  He attended one of the worst public high schools in his state.  His college choices included mostly schools no one on this sub has ever heard of that aren't in anyone's rankings.  He managed a ~3.8 GPA in college and applied to 9 of the top 11 grad schools for mechanical engineering.  He got into all 9.  He attended #2, got a really prestigious post-doc, and is now a professor at an Ivy.  **If this sub looked at his life at any point before grad school results came out, they would have laughed at him.  Now you're all tripping over yourselves for the chance to have him teach you.**\n\nMy point is that life is really long and there are many ways to get what you want out of it.  A few setbacks or failures don't define you.  You don't need to follow anyone else's paths or definitions for success.",

I was a transfer student the summer before my sophomore year from another country and did basically nothing for two years and carried around a low gpa . My junior year currently is ahah...we don\u2019t talk about that. I only got my internships by cold emailing 40+ people and they all started during quarantine. I didn\u2019t apply to any prestigious programs, I legit begged for organizations to make a position for me. And none of my \u201cinternships\u201d relate to my major so is it even helping?\n\nAlso although I was looking at Ivy leagues I was really just hoping to find one Hail Mary school to ED to but now I realize I\u2019m too broke for that ahah.\n\nI really love my state school, but my state school is fricking UVA who hasn\u2019t accepted a student below a 3.85 WGPA at my school (Naviance scattergrams). I\u2019d love to get in but I understand my chance are slim.\n\nI appreciate your confidence in me and I hope it does work out. But I don\u2019t think it will \ud83d\ude14",

Individuals make comments to the contrary, but they almost always get downvoted. If a post gets a lot of upvotes then even if you don't like what it says it is probably true, and not necessarily part of the elitism you describe.\n\nAt the end of the day this is an information sub. If you want information on colleges this sub will tell you, for better or worse. If you can't place your goals in a relative context of achievement and success (however you may define it) then yeah, this sub sucks because it was never meant to help validate peoples feelings and choices. But by that logic any place where highly driven people gather and discuss will irk you. \n\nHave confidence in your decision making and stay focused on your goals, because most of what you describe seems to stem from a lack of self esteem.",

      "text": "Honestly, OP, I just use this sub to see what kind of person I could have been. I'm happy with my school and my major and I'm happy as a person. So many people here are bitter and angry that they aren't going to SYMPH or T20 or whatever the next level above their top school is. Someone makes it into Georgia Tech but wanted MIT, or something along those lines. \n\nThe secret is that they're not going to get any further than me because of their school. We'll wind up in the same places because I'm just as driven as they are, and I'll be able to meet just as many people in my field from my school as the will from theirs. The difference, and the thing that I will benefit from, is that I'll ultimately be a happy person and nice to be around, instead of bitter because I didn't get accepted to the absolute top school for my major.\n\nThis comment sounds kind of elitist, but... I dunno. I feel like so many people here are going to flounder in life because they're not looking at the bigger picture. Our lives are longer than the next four years, so why are we so concerned about those next four years? There's another sixty to go.",

      "text": "[TL;DR at the bottom] I was reading through the comments on this post and I agree completely with all that I read. Whenever someone posts something just to find out about general information about college, I as a Freshman,  about to be a Rising Sophomore, I am more than happy to answer if I know about what they're asking. Otherwise, my fellow college students and former/current Admissions Officers and Interviewers will answer. Whenever someone posts something that is along the lines of the Elitist Culture in which you are referring to, I don't even acknowledge them. Sometimes you could just tell from the title alone. For some jobs and some situations, yes the prestige will be taken into account when in the competitive job market, BUT most of the time it will not matter, what WILL matter is your skills are and work ethic and what you can show the recruiters that will put you into consideration for the job.\nLet's take my major for example, but I will not name the school just for my own privacy. I study Computer Engineering which is paired with Electrical Engineering until a certain point in the 4 years. If you sit me down with an Electrical Engineering student from Yale, for example, and ask us both about circuits. Chances are we will be able to answer most of your questions depending on the courses we have taken at this point and what we will take in the future. We are learning the same exact things its just that we are in different schools.\nAnother thing is the math. Okay this is probably an obvious one, but just to get the point further across. Most schools, if not all of them including Ivys, will use Pearson for their course materials which include textbooks. The curriculum for a class is based on the specific textbook.With that being said, yes schools will tweak it, yes schools will go more in depth than others, but at their core each curriculum is the same, because the textbook is 9/10 the same across multiple schools, again including Ivys. I just looked up a Calculus 2 syllabus from MIT. Literally they are using the same textbook my school is for Calc 1, 2, and 3. Again, learning the same things, just in different schools.\nIf people want to go to Ivys and other prestigious schools go for it, but the issue is people wanting to go to these prestigious schools thinking that they will automatically be fine in the job market just because of where they get their degree which cannot be any more unrealistic. Yea sure coworkers might have went to reputable schools for maybe their masters, but ask them where they did their undergrad. You may get a Harvard, or maybe a UC, or  even UT, but you'll most likely get a slew of different schools across the country. Professors in your very college may have even taught in less reputable colleges before their current one.\n\nTL;DR: It matters where you go to college only to a certain extent. What matters more is the skills you learn and reinforce while you're in college and how you and others regard yourself as a person.",
