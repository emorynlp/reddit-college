However, I Cornell is my first choice, and I would definitely join Cornell if accepted..... So and so.  \nFrame the mail well.. Doing this wouldn't highlight your 16 day gap and misunderstanding of the blog. It would just be that you missed ed deadline. Thus, the intensity would be decreased, and it won't get complicated. You will have fresh start/chance doing so and you would be avoiding awkward explanation and other mails you would have to send now in case you choose to.",
