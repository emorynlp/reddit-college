  "title:": "Cornell Regular Decision vs ED",
  "text": "\nThe Cornell ED deadline is today and for a couple months I was planning on doing it and I had finished the application as well. But now I am reconsidering, as I live in Michigan and the U of M CS program is good as well. Although everybody I know usually goes to Michigan and I\u2019d like to branch out, it\u2019s difficult to pass it up and I\u2019m really stressing out about it right now. I have a 3.94 UW GPA, captain of a couple sports and have board positions on a few clubs, as well as am a member in some others, but nothing too special as far as ECs go. Cornell ED is my best and most likely chance of going to a school more prestigious and better than Michigan, so I\u2019m tempted to go for it, and if I don\u2019t get into Michigan then it would be great if I had that option. But I\u2019d be committed if I did get in and pass up the cheaper cost of U of M.",
