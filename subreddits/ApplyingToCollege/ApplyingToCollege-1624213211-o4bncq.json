  "text": "Hi guys, I'm a college professor. I've noticed a little wave of discussion on this sub concerning the idea of cold-emailing professors to ask them to take on high schoolers as research assistants. I just wanted to talk about that for a second.\n\nI've been where many of you are: anxious about college applications, uncertain of how to put forward the best version of myself to prospective colleges. That's why I started posting here in the first place. I want to reassure you, insofar as you will allow yourself to be reassured, that most colleges are very, very similar to each other and that you have so, so much to look forward to wherever your road takes you.\n\nI saw a post here a while ago - I'm going to change some details so that the poster remains anonymous - that basically said, \"I've been emailing a set of Yale professors to ask them to take me on as a research assistant. They're not replying. What can I write to get them to reply?\" (I didn't comment on the post, so you won't find it in my comment history.) After thinking about that post for a while, I decided to write this one to remind you guys that college professors are just like you: they're fully rounded, fully realized human beings who are trying to survive in the world they find themselves in. They're not NPCs you can unlock to help you on your journey.\n\nLike everybody else, professors have a lot going on. Even if they work at teaching-oriented colleges, most of the hours they spend working are not hours in the classroom. They do research, they write up their research, they put together course content, they do service work, they do peer review, they may direct labs - the list goes on and on. They focus their mentoring on their undergraduate and (if their department has graduate students) their graduate students. That's their job, and most of them bring a ton of personal dedication and commitment to that job. And outside of work, they have families and hobbies and D&D campaigns and other things to overwhelm their time.\n\nSpeaking only personally, I don't think that doing research with a professor, as a high schooler, is much of a flex. My response to hearing about it - and again, this is only my personal knee-jerk, completely unfair, reaction - \"Okay, so that person had a professor as a family friend. They did something simple and harmless, like populating Excel spreadsheets or collecting literature on a certain topic, and even then the professor had to double-check the spreadsheets and do a literature review of her own, because the high schooler is new enough to the field that they might miss things a more experienced person would not.\"\n\nI think there are many more fulfilling ways to spend a summer. Scoop ice cream, learn how to repair clocks, volunteer in your community. For those of you who are doing research with professors, please don't take what I've said as a criticism - I'm sure it's different for you, and the person you're working with is going to explain in their letter of recommendation what's distinctive about you and your work. You're doing a great job. I mean it!\n\nI think there's a risk that some of the people here may have a villain arc while they're working to get into a specific college - that they may fall into the trap of treating human beings as a means to an end. Don't do that - stay true to your humanity and recognize the humanity of others. Be a hero!",

And even if there are no obvious dangers, the law is so much stricter on safety for children and some academics will not want to take on any amount of that risk, nor will they want to potentially deal with your parents.\n\nOn top of that, we have an obligation to serve the students at our own institutions first. They are \u201cour\u201d students. A high schooler, even one who claims they want to attend our university, is not \u201cour\u201d student. And the place they take could go to a deserving undergrad instead. Even if a PhD mentors you, they could be mentoring an undergrad. The limiting factor is often how much time an academic has available for advising, so high schoolers definitely take a slot someone else could have.",

Except in some cases when a student is truly precocious, most or all of these positions come from connections.\n\nThis sub has a disproportionate number of high-achieving students. I think the (relative) prevalence of these research experiences on this sub has led others to believe they can be obtained easily/independently (for example by sending out cold emails). \n\nBut that REALLY isn't how it works. As OP said, most professors are just as fucked/overworked as high school juniors. And those who aren't probably have a team of graduate students to fall back on. \n\nAnyone who's been to grad school or has worked extensively with even very, very bright undergraduates will assume that a \"research position\" is really just a glorified internship. (Which is still valuable, because it shows dedication and topical focus.)\n\nGood post. Thanks for taking the time.",

          "text": "I don't think we should discount connections - I know the word has a bit of a dirty reputation around here, but past college we start using another word in place of \"connections\" - \"networking\".\n\nI, having been on multiple ends of the giving and receiving emails related to research opportunities issue, personally don't think it a super big deal for students who are interested in research sending out some emails. Worst that happens is that they say no, right? Within my own academic experiences, PIs not responding to your emails is often accepted as the norm simply because they have too many issues all at once. That doesn't mean you should meekly back off and accept you're being a burden, however - on the contrary, most professors I know hand out their numbers so you can text them if they forget. \n\nLook, I get that spam is unpleasant for anyone, but for people trying to break through their own socioeconomic barriers anything can go a long way. Getting somebody on your side, or some extra leverage in the farce we call admissions is incredibly valuable if you don't have many great options otherwise. I don't think that looking for research opportunities as a high schooler is at all \"dehumanizing\" a professor - if you think that's morally deficient, then you will have many, many more complaints about graduate school and job applications. It's simply how the game is, and you can't fault the determined for trying.\n\nFor the record, I personally did not perform and would not advise research with a college lab just to get brownie points on an app. Do it if you're genuinely interested. But the realpolitik of the situation is that this sort of thing is de facto a prerequisite for some programs like BS/MDs, so you can't really complain that people are aiming high.",

I agree that there seems to be this huge emphasis on getting research and internships as a high school student, and I couldn't agree with you more.

That's after we have taken college level classes, interacted with professors, and have begun to build a professional network.  Heck, even engineering graduates occasionally struggle to find jobs.  You guys are high schoolers; your college professional career has not even begun.  Don't worry about trying to get research or an internship right now.  If you can, that's great.

When I was in grad school, even having an undergrad in the lab was done as a service to science education; we expected them to be way more work for us than they contributed in return.   The only time high school students ever were at my institution was if they were part of a summer research program, and that was led by high school educators in combination with volunteer labs. \n\nYes, of course there are exceptions, and maybe one is more likely to see this on a2c, but even smart kids rarely have an adequate background for lab research. \n\nI think realistically most are better off with legitimately accessible opportunities like, as you mention, a part-time job, or some areas have summer programs.\n\nAlso, there is much ado made about getting published, and again, *most* undergrads who get to publish are considered more lucky than anything when it comes time for grad school.",

And they can 100% tell.\n\nIf you are that person, and are hoping to go into an academic research career, the best thing you can do now as a HS student is learn about the subject you want to study. Familiarize yourself with research in the field, find out what skills are useful in it (e.g., math or coding), focus on building those skills and the knowledge base that will make you a strong researcher in the future. If you\u2019re in this situation and have a mentor in your field, it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that they\u2019ll tell you that this is what will help you most, not doing basic tasks for a research project before you\u2019ve learned how research in that field works.\n\nIf you\u2019re not that person, you will be better served by doing something related to whatever it is you *are* passionate about \u2014 or even just doing a regular job for extra cash, as OP says.",

      "text": "THIS. I've refrained from being negative on posts of people saying to cold email professors, but... it is incredibly presumptuous (and borderline rude in some cases).  At an R1 school, professors are constantly bombarded with emails seeking research opportunities from:\n\n* undergrads at other schools who want to visit... if only you'll help them justify the expense -- or even get a visa (which might require perjuring yourself; no thanks);\n* undergrads at your own school, most of whom you do not know... because you would have asked your top students if you had a bit of research suitable for an undergrad;\n* grad students in unrelated departments... who want some paying job and have spammed the entire college; and,\n* grad students at other institutions who are trying to get an in to do research or get you on their committee or get a visiting position they can put on their CV or just get here to interview at companies... and have funding so long as you can get them an office (and they might need more funding for housing).\n\nAlmost none of these help a tenure-track young professor get tenure; almost none of these are more useful than a PhD student (who tend to be advised by tenured professors) or a top undergrad who has proven successful in coursework at that university; and, almost all of these are less work than bringing a high school student up-to-speed on research methodology (never mind not running afoul of issues with minors).\n\nThe people mentioning connections are spot-on: The only times I've given advice or ideas on research to high school students were when there was a family connection or it was a family friend -- and even then it's very hands-off: I'll give some tasks and check in a bit later and if they are floundering or have done nothing then that's the end of that.  Being a research-active professor means not having time to hold hands and get people up to speed on research methodology much less check that work gets done properly.  If you really want to do research with a professor, take a college class from them, be the top student, and then approach that professor... and you still might get shot down.",

      "text": "There's a lot of truth here! I interned at some Stanford labs when I was in high school, and spent a summer at a CSU (this one was paid). Honestly, a lot of the kids who were able to get a science fair entry out of it were connected to faculty to some way (i.e. they're kids of faculty, their parents are friends, whatever).\n\nI came from a rural high school, knew no one else who had done this, and all my emails were truly cold. Most of my high school teachers were... underwhelming. I also had to commute about +2 hours each way to get there. At Stanford, there seemed to be a small workforce of high school students in the summer from some very competitive nearby high schools who were used to it and viewed it as something to check off their list, which rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI did, in particular, appreciate how the postdoc and group who took me on (especially in my post-junior year summer) taught me a lot about the scientific process, and what scientists do. I still carry on those lessons with me now in college (I do a lot of undergrad research), and want to emphasize that you should do things in high school because you enjoy them and you want to learn more. I knew that I wanted to be a scientist, so I wanted to start by learning what scientists do in labs.",

      "text": "hmm, I would agree with a lot of this ,however, I would like to give my story as an example on how this could work out. In my Junior year, I had the random thought to email about 20 professors at the closest university. I wanted to major in physics at the time, and I wanted to see what it's like to actually do it. I got in contact with one professor and started doing coding projects and physics projects with him. After about 5 months (august of that year) he asked me if I would be interested in joining the competitive rocketry team since they would be using his lab. I said yes and I joined the team. I am now the only high school student in the team and I am also an officer of all the engineering teams within the organization. (About 200 students). I am also the team lead of a hobby rocketry engineering team. I also found my roommate here and a lot of mentors and friends. I also decided to commit to this university this fall because of the team and the people. \n\nMy case is rare, but I am extremely grateful that I decided to email the professor. I didn't get to do the real research that I expected, but I got way more experience and connections. If I had to give one advice, it would be to do it because you are interested in the subject and want mentors or want to learn more. Don't do it because you think it'll look good on a resume. Professor will see the passion and be more willing to involve you in things they are doing. Also, before going into it, aim to have some experience and skills such as coding.",

Thanks for sharing your perspective that it seems unrealistic at best and bothersome and absurd at worst. I almost always deter prospective applicants from emailing professors. Admitted students who are deciding whether to enroll is a slightly different situation that might warrant reaching out.\n\nUltimately though at the end of the day students cold-email professors to get \"research\" or \"internship\" experience because the admissions review process rewards these efforts. They have to compete with the students who have family connections, so for that reason I don't necessarily blame students for this practice. They're responding to rules that they didn't write.\n\n>I think there are many more fulfilling ways to spend a summer. Scoop ice cream, learn how to repair clocks, volunteer in your community.\n\nThese things, though noble and normal, are less or not incentivized in holistic review at elite universities. The teenager summer job in elite/affluent communities is becoming a relic of previous generations. It's replaced by bullshit internships, inflated research credentials, and suspect non-profits.",

      "text": "Thank you for posting this! I have begun wondering, with the influx of students cold emailing 50+ professors, what must be going through ya'lls minds. I think strangely enough research has become an EC which, when thought about, makes 0 sense. Since research isn't really just a tick-mark opportunity for a student, it supposed to be motivated by a will to study/improve something for a meaningful impact. So if a student is actually interested in doing research it should likely be motivated by a particular project that is of some significance for them and would help advance science in some way (no matter how seemingly small it may be). But I feel like some students have been tricked into thinking it is like a class, and that a professor will just step-by-step walk them through a process that they can use for a college application even if it means nothing to them. It is truly disheartening! This post should really clear many students burning questions surrounding the topic :D so thank you!",

And getting an undergrad degree, or even a Masters in many cases, does not make you particularly familiar with academia. So that probably covers all the adults in your life and certainly covers 100% of your peers. Even adcoms, if they have a Bachelors degree and then went straight to admissions, don't know what the academy is like *personally*.",

There was a misconception that you couldn't graduate without doing research that nobody at the school bothered to correct. (One of my friends couldn't find a research position last year and panicked because she thought she wasn't going to graduate). I think one of the teachers explicitly said the justification for that was to help us \"stand out\" in the college process. Ultimately, even though I didn't care much for the idea of research at first, I'm really thankful for my experience and I found it very fulfilling. However, that doesn't mean I'm not irritated at the idea of forcing high schoolers to do things they don't care about just for college app points.",

If you don't have much to show for your time under the professor...well, you probably didn't hold a significant role or learn much from your role.\n\nIn terms of summer research program vs summer research under a professor, what you do with the opportunity matters more than the opportunity itself.  If you learned something that you can now use in future jobs, you have officially taken advantage of the opportunity and have new skills to make your resume more attractive to employers.  So the answer is actually a question.  Do you think you will do better in a summer research program or under a professor?",
