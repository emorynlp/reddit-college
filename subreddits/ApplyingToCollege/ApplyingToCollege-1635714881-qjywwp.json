  "text": "hi guys. i\u2019m currently writing my common app essay, i know i\u2019m starting super late. i just wrote for two hours and felt like i had a huge breakthrough. i went excitedly downstairs to read it to my dad and his face was just completely blank while reading it. i ask him if he hated it, and he didn\u2019t say anything and just started criticizing it. i feel so discouraged and my confidence is so shaken. i feel stupid.\n\nhe said that my essay was too dark, and while it definitely does have dark themes, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really personal to me, and the main focus of my essay is how i overcame it and changed my life for the better. i know mental health is a taboo topic but i\u2019m really hurt because this is something i really put my heart and soul into, and i think it says a lot about me as a person.",

      "text": "One reason this topic is difficult to do well is that it highlights a weakness that can return under the stress of college. As you note, it is an extremely personal topic.\n\nYou could try a quick outline of a more positive essay. Think of one or two personal qualities you want to demonstrate to admissions, and then think of an anecdote or story that shows those. See the essay section in the wiki at the top of the subreddit; I like Hack the College Essay.",

      "text": "I think mentioning mental\nHealth ( or any other) struggles is fine but you really want the majority of the essay to be about how you managed/overcame them and leave a positive impression.\nSomeone said to me \u201cif you told this story to someone you just met at a party would they still want to talk to you after?\u201d  - you\u2019re trying to make friends with the AO. Be impressive, warm, funny, inspiring, clever - but not depressing, angry, aggressive, spiteful etc ( not saying you were- just general principles)",
