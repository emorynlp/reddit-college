  "text": "I have **studied** in both ICSE (9-10) and CBSE (11-12) i.e. **Indian National Curriculum.** The board exam **mark-sheet (transcript)** does not consist of percentage and class rank. The colleges and schools here **calculate best of 5 subjects** which is considered as our official percentage. It is not officially declared in our transcripts but that is what considered and followed here. Although my school in their merit list have declared my percentage but that is not official I believe? Since I will have to upload the official transcripts where my percentage (GPA) is not declared. So, how do Indian students (those following national curriculum) declare their GPA in the common app? PLEASE HELP ME.",
