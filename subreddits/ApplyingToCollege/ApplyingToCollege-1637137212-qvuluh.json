  "text": "Hi!\n\nHow do colleges, especially ivy Leagues/t-20s, look at being a coca-cola semi-finalist? \n\nI know awards like ap scholar awards and being a national merit semifinalist are pretty common among applicants to top colleges so they aren't really eye-catching to admissions officers. \n\nIs being a coca-cola semi-finalist similar in that it's an award that 'can't hurt but probably won't gain you any extra points' or is it a more impressive award that will make colleges go 'hmm that's cool.'",

Very few people make it to Coke semi, but it's basically an endorsement of the rest of your college resume, which anyone reading your application already has available to them.  So it doesn't communicate any *new* information.  That said, if you have space, might as well list it.",
