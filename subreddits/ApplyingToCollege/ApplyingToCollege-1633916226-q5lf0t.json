  "text": "Is there a point to apply to a school regular vs early action? Everything I\u2019ve seen is only pros for EA (scholarship availability, earlier feedback, etc). Is there like a limited amount that you should apply to EA? I am applying through common app if that\u2019s makes any difference, also have app fees waived so there is no issue there either. Thanks",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nOftentimes students need the extra couple of months to improve their app: essays, EC's (although kinda late), etc. If you need that time, take it. There is a limited amount of EA if you plan on REA (restrictive early action) to a school. In which case you cannot EA to any private institution of ED to any school. If you do not REA, there are no restrictions to EA. My suggestion, apply your safeties and targets early (get the stress off your shoulders, you have a backup, phew) spend some time working on your app and you can submit your reaches/other colleges RD. Just my take, but good luck!",

      "text": "If you are ready in time for EA, then that\u2019s the move. Some merit awards, in fact, require you to have applied EA. You\u2019ll get your answers sooner and you may limit how many schools you\u2019ll eventually need to apply to RD (if any). A lot of applicants don\u2019t have their supplementals complete in time or are waiting on another SAT/ACT score but if you\u2019ve got everything in order and you have fee waivers, go for it. Good luck!",

My ECs, test scores, and essays are all at the point where I am comfortable submitting them. If you need more time though, regular decision can be a good option. I want the earlier response though so I have more time to go scholarship hunting and such.",
