  "title:": "Please chill out complaining about \"immigrant parents\" or \"ethnic parents\" as a whole",
  "text": "I'm not saying that people can't use a2c to vent or need to hide their family background\u2014there's definitely a correlation between being an immigrant and inheriting a stressful \"grind\" mindset. \n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean that every parent out there who's Asian/isn't white/immigrated during their lifetime is part of that group. That statement might sound obvious, but I've seen a lot of posts in a moment of frustration complain about stuff like \"you can't win with immigrant parents,\" when what they really mean is \"you can't win with MY parents; anyone feel the same way?\"\n\n\"Immigrant parent\" has become a shorthand on this sub for \"pushy, academically-obsessed, and abusive,\" and that's quite the shame in my opinion. Saying they're all one way is a pretty broad collector for those whose parents are perfectly chill and don't get talked about much on this sub, and leads to clueless posts like \"I feel so bad for those with Asian parents!\" \n\nThere's no need to demonize someone's background, which is literally out of their control. Demonizing unhealthy behaviors would be more productive.\n\nAnd once more to clarify, I still think people should feel free to vent about parents being abusive or controlling or just annoying on this sub, and should feel free to speak about their family background and how it influences their dynamics. I also think discussions about how certain cultural values influence attitudes toward college can be useful and enlightening (one of my best friends has helicopter parents like I do, but the things they said and implied about the future were very different, as we come from different cultural backgrounds. It was interesting and a bit of a relief to discuss this with her.) \n\nBut please try not to bucket all people from a category into specific behaviors, positive or negative.",

They don't understand the system and they work too much to worry about the details. They may well actively pressure their kid not to attend college. They certainly don't check grades or know the SAT from a hole in the ground. They will pull their kid put of school as needed to help with family stuff. Their own experience tells them the best path to success is to leave school at 18, work your ass off in a trade or other \"real\" job, and be 100% dedicated to family. \n\nThose sorts of parents are under representation here, because they rarely have super high-achieving students. But it's absolutely a common pattern.",

It's not difficult to frame it in the singular as the parent being toxic instead of the ethnic group.\n\nWhich is another issue entirely. For instance (and from personal experience) Vietnamese immigrant parents tend to be hard on their kids (not all but a large chunk) but in Vietnam most are pretty lax. So it's less about the ethnic culture background and more about the culture of being in the US (sorry being US centric here). \n\nIt's just hard for us first gen from immigrant parents. We end up inheriting our parents dreams and aspirations. Luckily mine were supportive and loving but that's the case for others. However I don't generalize experiences.",

Having lived in my home country for a large part of my childhood, I also grew up with those same values or working until I had a perfect transcript and attaching my self-worth to my educational success. \n\nAfter moving a little more and being exposed to more international communities, my parents have adapted their mindset to ensure that they are being more open-minded and not place as much pressure on me. We have open discussions about mental health at home and they are fully supporting me with getting an international relations degree (which would\u2019ve been unfathomable for them in their childhood). I know it\u2019s been really difficult for them to change, but I\u2019m very grateful for how much they\u2019re trying \n\nconclusion, not all Asian parents are the same",

They put more importance in my moral upbringing, hardwork and humility. They educated me a lot, read books etc.They were strict in stuff like curfews and not doing bad stuff lol but not really about academics. They trusted me, they never pushed me to get a 4.0 or any ivy league.If I did fail they understood me and encouraged me to do probably better next time but was never verbally abusive or it just wasn't the end of the world. They just wanted me to do what I was passionate about, they never wanted to stress me out. I'm an average student, I had my ups but also downs, I met deadlines. They wanted me to be a good student but they're weren't pushy about being the top of the class.They always taught me that there was other things in life, being happy was important and education is education. It doesn't matter where I go. But ngl I do wish they had in some ways pushed me a little more or stayed more involved, I do think I could have done much better esp as college apps are approaching \ud83d\ude05",
