A LOT of colleges and universities have an older database tool called PeopleSoft, and adding a slash to any part of your name can cause significant issues when trying to move your data into this database.  Slashes are very unfriendly to the database systems that use slashes are part of their code.  \n\nNames are the last place that you'd expect to see a slash, but on the rare occasion that someone decides to enter their first name as Michael/Mike all hell breaks loose in Peoplesoft, and probably some other lesser databases as well.\n\nI'm sure there is some way to patch it to prevent it from happening, but PeopleSoft is a 20 years old software by now, and is incredibly user unfriendly. So it's not worth it for more offices to patch this for an issue that only happens once  every few years.  But when it does happen, the slash will halt the entire processing of loading your application data.  \nSo...you know...  \ndon't do that.",
