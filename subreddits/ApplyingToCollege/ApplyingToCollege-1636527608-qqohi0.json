  "text": "Congratulations to you all on becoming Semifinalists\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI\u2019m a college freshman and a 2021 Coke Scholar, so I feel like I\u2019m watching my younger A2C siblings going through the same process\ud83d\udc95\n\nYou guys made it through the algorithm round, which brings the amount of applicants from around 100,000 to around 1,600. Congrats! I remember thinking each round that I wouldn\u2019t make it to the next one, but you guys have got this!\n\nSome basic resources to help prepare for the essay round and following interview round:\n\nhttps://blog.prepscholar.com/how-to-win-a-coca-cola-scholarship\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h2_XGMzv_UU\n\nAnd here\u2019s the 2020 and 2021 Coke Scholar bios to help too:\n\nhttps://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/about/2020-scholar-bios/\n\nhttps://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/blog/our-2021-coke-scholars/\n\nAlso, feel free to reach out to 2021 scholars about their experiences applying! There\u2019s 35 Coke Scholars in my freshman class, and all the ones I\u2019ve met would be happy to help seniors applying. It\u2019s a very supportive group. \n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t make it to the Semifinalist round, that definitely doesn\u2019t say anything about your college prospects or prospects for other scholarships. My freshman class is full of brilliant students who applied to Coke and didn\u2019t get the scholarship for some reason, and we\u2019re all at the same school. Several of my friends are insanely talented and didn\u2019t get the scholarship for whatever reason, but they got into multiple T5s.",
