  "text": "So recently, I surprised myself with a 1420 on the sat after having only gotten a 1260 before. Being that a 1260 didn\u2019t warrant much attention as far as scholarships went, I\u2019m kind of curious what doors this new score opens up for me. I have been looking at Western Colorado University, a small public university that only offers full rides to resident (I\u2019m not from Colorado) valedictorians from what I can see. Does my full score even make me eligible to full tuition scholarships anywhere? Thanks",
