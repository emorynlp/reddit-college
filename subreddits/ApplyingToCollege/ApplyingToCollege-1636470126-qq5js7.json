      "text": "this is too vague/broad to answer imo but I moved from TX to RI (4 hour flight) for uni and I'd be happy to answer more specific q's about my experience. It was less of an adjustment than I expected; if you're in the US I recommend opening the Southwest credit card so you can build up points flying between school and home and get free flights. I say Southwest bc they have 2 free check in bags which is nice for moving in and out.",
