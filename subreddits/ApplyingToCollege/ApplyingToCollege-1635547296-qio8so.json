  "title:": "Can I use acronyms in my supplements?",
  "text": "For example, repeating \"Harvard's Center for Undergraduate research\" (not a real program) really takes up word space in the essay. If the university formally uses an acronym (HCUR), then should I just use that acronym instead? The only issue is, there'd be a lot of acronyms in the essay. But I'm assuming admission officers would know of these programs - even if they're more discrete?",

Like for lesser known programs (smt that's not widely advertised at the university), it's probably a good idea to do that. \n\nAlso, when you referenced specific courses in your supplement, did you say the specific course code (ex. Econ 104: Microeconomics) or did you just state the name of the course (in italics)?",

Depending on the word limit of the essay, you may want to cut the number of programs you mention and focus more on just \u201cdeep-diving\u201d into a few in order to cut the word count spent on listing program names. \n\nFor a course with a non-distinct name, I\u2019d use the course code (e.g. STAT 243: Numerical Linear Algebra), and use the name of the course for ones that are more distinct (e.g. Ecocentrism and Environmental Racism).",
