For UT CS, a lot of the rejects are likely Texas residents who didn\u2019t do anything during hs, or learn anything about college applications, and just chose CS as their intended major because it\u2019s hot. Also, if you\u2019re in-state, that acceptance rate is higher. State schools are much more giving when it comes to accepting in state people vs OOS. If you\u2019re OOS, than the Stanford comparison becomes more reasonable, thought that\u2019s not because of the program\u2019s excellence or prestige, but just the flawed approach state schools have to reviewing applications.",
