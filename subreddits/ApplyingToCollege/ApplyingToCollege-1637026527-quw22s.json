  "text": "I'm applying to the University of Kentucky and have completed 2/3 essays required for it. The last one I have to do is confusing and I was hoping someone could help me understand what they're really looking for and some guidance. The prompt is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n *\u201cExposure to new ideas and beliefs carried by different members of our community challenges us to grow intellectually and socially, preparing us for the world beyond our campus.\u201d \u2013 UK President Eli Capilouto*\u00a0  \n\n\n*Given your personal background, describe an experience that illustrates how you would contribute to the educational diversity at UK.* \n\nThis prompt has been circling my mind for over a month now and if anyone can help me that'd be awesome thank you.",
