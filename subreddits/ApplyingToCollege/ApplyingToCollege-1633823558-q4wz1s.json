  "text": " \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey guys, Im an indian student who gave his JEE advanced exam this year and while I'm not university any top colleges, I'm pretty sure I qualified. For a bit of background: I always wanted to go abroad to pursue further education having spent half my childhood in the US so even if I did get a decent rank, I'd probably not go for a college in India.\n\n\nNow with that out of the way, I've found myself in a bit of a conundrum. I recently learned that Jee advanced qualifiers get direct admission into German universities like TUM if their German is sufficient (mine's isn't yet but I have time to learn). But things get a bit tricky as I was already accepted into an international 2+2 program between a good university here and UNSW in Australia. I have no idea what to pursue or which would be a better choice overall. It's like my brain has just stopped working.\n\n\nThe price of both programs is about the same (TUM doesn't charge tuition but I'd have to stay for a full 4 years in Munich instead of 2 in Sydney which is pretty expensive) and both programs are about the same rank globally. I'd be taking student loans for both but both cases are heavily subsidized with a large moritarium period. My parents don't know much about unis abroad so I thought I'd come to you guys for advice. Do you have any thoughts that could help?",
