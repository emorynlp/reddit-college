  "text": "SOO I'm EDing to Cornell and I sent my TOEFL scores weeks back. Apparently they take more than a month or so to arrive at the respective colleges. Since Cornell also accepts Duolingo for internationals and Duolingo scores can be sent instantly to any college, can I give the Duolingo tomorrow and submit it? I took a practice test and it says I can get a 145. PLEASE THERE'S LIKE LESS THAN A WEEK FOR ED DEADLINES!! : (((",

      "text": "Do it, it's a super easy test. If you can get 100 on a TOEFL you can easily crack 130+ on the Duolingo, I actually took the test myself just to see how it is. \n\nNow, having said that, does Cornell absolutely require your TOEFL results to come from ETS directly? Because you can always download your results sheet as a PDF and a lot of universities will let you send that in as proof or self-report, and then they'll take you at your word or request proof later.",
