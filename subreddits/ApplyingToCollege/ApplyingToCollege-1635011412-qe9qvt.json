  "text": "Ok I'm tired of y'all being like oh I only have a 3.9 GPA Ill never get into any college ): . CHILL its not that serious. Yes you will have a hard time getting  into fucking ivy league but not most colleges holy fuck. Yall act like a 3.0 GPA is the end of the world. Touch some grass. Youre scaring people into thinking its not worth applying or even trying. For every HS freshman, sophomore, and even junior. Live your life. You shouldn't be so obsessed about getting into these prestigious schools. This sub can be SUPER toxic. Dont go to a college because people say theyre good. Go to a college YOU LIKE and WANT to attend. I can assure you most employers wont give a single shit where you go to college most of the time. They just want someone with knowledge, a nice personality and common sense. Go hang out with friends instead of spending the entire weekend studying. Spend time doing something you ENJOY instead of freaking out about a C on a test or something. And those of you on this sub, yall need to stop subtlety flexing and trying to impress people. We dont give a shit. I and many others just joined thinking they could get advice for applying but all everyone does is flex or try to lowkey flex like \"am i smart enough with a 1500 SAT and 4.5 GPA?\" Its annoying as fuck and Im 99% sure a lot of yall are lying or exaggerating. \nTLDR STOP OBSESSING ABOUT COLLEGES LIVE YOUR FUCKING LIFE ITS NOT THAT DEEP.",

There's always weird things that happen with admissions like that, especially if the school does retention rejections or there are extenuating circumstances. The other part I agree with. There are very few companies (McKinsey, Goldman, some quant firms) that really care where you went and pretty much all of their competitors pay the comparably anyway, and you're not actually iced out of getting hired there, it's just harder",

I only mentioned the acceptance rate thing cause some kids count >20% as a \u201csafety\u201d when it\u2019s more of a target \u2014 so not a guarantee even for relatively high stats kids. My anecdotal kid got into a *very good school* (no tears needed) despite his surprising rejections (and at schools where there is no yield protection). While admissions to top schools are unpredictable, there are also great safety choices that are often overlooked and undervalued because they have high acceptance rates.",

When colleges see a school report from your school, they\u2019ll know being outside of the top 10% of your school isn\u2019t slacking at all. Also, most admissions officers are well acquainted with the types of schools and students in their designated area so they\u2019ll take into account the competitiveness. For example, the USC admissions officer for the Bay Area region knows that a there\u2019s a teacher at this specific high school that never gives As in chem, so she doesn\u2019t mark down points for students having Bs in that class.",

      "text": ">Go to a college YOU LIKE and WANT to attend.\n\nFrom where I come from, people act like how you describe because the colleges that they \"want\" to go to are t10s. I go to a really competitive high school so literally in my friend group, a 1500 on the SAT is \"low\". Just the other day, my friend wouldn't tell me what he got on the October SAT because he felt embarrassed (turned out he got a 1550). \n\nI'm sorry that you dislike these types of people (I'm included in this lol) but sometimes they really can't help it because of the environment they grow in. Part of my brain tells me that I don't have to get into a top college and that I'll be fine in life, but the other part tells me to grind and settle for nothing less than the \"top\". There's just a lot of pressure to attend a top university and everyone here is grinding to do so. I, and many others are just not able to change our mindsets. I know how everyone is going to respond to this, but only a few people will be able to understand that we really can't help it.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that the people who indirectly flex are complete jerks.",

          "text": "100%, my school\u2019s environment for the top 20 is wayyy more chill and collaborative versus my friends\u2019 and the differences in performance and mental health are crazy. I know they probably have higher average SAT scores and raw smartness than our top 20, but we reach close to them AND still have time to hang out 3 days a week, join 7 clubs, sports, etc. Glorifying toxic competitiveness and reaching the \u2018top\u2019 will never work and it shows when we all go to college. Not to say that where you go to college is the final result and the goal, but for their school, only ~3 students go out of state/Ivy Leagues while my school has 20-30 OOS and people not ranked in top ten often still going to Ivies.\n\nThis isn\u2019t meant as a flex either but I don\u2019t have a great ACT in comparison to a lot of people\u2019s standards (32) but my resume is reflected in other areas, president of 3 clubs, area finalist for music, captain for a UIL team, etc etc, and same goes for my peers who\u2019ve also started their own clubs for their own interests! Versus the other school that only joins conventional clubs for their resume they don\u2019t even enjoy. \n\nFrankly, I see the difference especially when we apply for colleges and read people\u2019s personal statements. My peers have very genuine essays that really speak true to their characters (and it\u2019s backed by their ECs!) while my friends in the other school seem to feel lost and don\u2019t know what they even really like or have strong feelings toward. One of my friends is ranked #3 in his school but has admitted he doesn\u2019t actually like learning or cares for the courses, but gets satisfaction from getting 100s.\n\nThis is a huge generalization to make between schools but it is something I\u2019ve noticed for the past year that\u2019s frankly alarming. Romanticizing unhealthy competition never works out. Giving people healthy environments always results in higher performance and interaction with the course anyways. And in Uni, when there is no longer such a huge emphasis on competition, how will people fair when their main motivation was thriving in a fucked up environment? I believe it\u2019s why so many get burnt out in college, reaching the \u2018top\u2019 would gain them true happiness and now they\u2019re at the next level and there\u2019s something more to chase. Learning to love something genuinely and not be distracted by a toxic environment to be \u2018better\u2019 than others is something that I just don\u2019t think a lot of people get out of.",

It took me until my junior year to realize that if everyone was trying so hard to get a high GPA, none of them would stand out. They'd all just be a sea of numbers.\n#\nSo being in Boy Scouts, I went and completed my Eagle Project and got my Eagle rank. On my applications I talked about my leadership skills, love for the outdoors, and the challenges I've faced and overcome, both in my Eagle Project and my life. My GPA is decent, probably even better than most other public schools nearby, but in now way would I have stood out within my school. For reference, with a weighted GPA of 4.05 (unweighted 3.6), my class rank was ~220/~480. \n#\nTLDR; Colleges take a look at you holistically as a person, GPA isn't everything. Branch out, do what you like, have some extracurricular's with leadership roles under your belt. Colleges eat that shit up.",

In high school I actually ended up not applying to the colleges I actually wanted to go to and instead went to a community college because I didn\u2019t think that my 3.6 GPA (with stellar fucking ECs, btw) would get me into decent schools. Although I don\u2019t regret going to a CC, I did miss out on those college experiences as a freshman and my education will definitely not be up to par in comparison to those who went straight to a four year. Not to mention that I\u2019m going to need to take another year in CC because class availability can be so scarce here. A lower GPA is not the end of the world.

They might be disappointed in the short run that I\u2019m not some world famous scientist, or a rich investment banker, but they\u2019d be way more disappointed in the long run if I spent my entire life concerned simply about money, because they escaped poverty so that me and my siblings wouldn\u2019t HAVE to be so concerned with money. \n\nBut yeah, I very much do understand the feeling you\u2019ll disappoint them if you don\u2019t get a good degree, or a good job. One of my roommates at college and I had had a discussion about the pressure we feel to succeed because of the sacrifices our parents made, and how our third roommate (from a very rich family, who hadn\u2019t come from poverty) didn\u2019t seem to have the same fear or the same drive.",

I would have floundered at somewhere like Harvard because the atmosphere is like crabs in a bucket. I prefer my LAC where my professors know who I am, have all met my rabbit at some point, and are always happy if I pop into their office to ask for help. I needed a late-starting independent study program in order to retain my financial aid, and one of my professors was like \u201chey, I don\u2019t have plans for research but we\u2019ll think of something together, I\u2019m happy to advise you\u201d because she teaches my lab class of four students and knows I like what she teaches. I have friends at Harvard who have TAs teaching their classes, whose professors don\u2019t know their names. My professors will email me if I miss class because they notice I\u2019m gone and they\u2019re worried about me, ffs.\n\nDemographics, since you asked - I go to Colby College, as an astrophysics major, with a minor in chemistry (and potentially a minor in geology, I\u2019m in the process of adding it right now) and I\u2019m planning on becoming a marine or aircraft accident investigator, or going on to grad school and doing astrophysics research. I\u2019m a white guy, who was homeschooled K-12, and my current college GPA is 3.59 (it would be higher, but I had a very rough freshman fall. Every other semester I\u2019ve had a 3.8 or above). I haven\u2019t interned anywhere yet, since COVID threw a damper in my freshman summer plans, and this summer I chose to do exoplanet research on-campus with one of my professors. \n\nDo you feel like sharing any information about your future plans, or just throwing a tantrum that every adult on here is suggesting that you and other kids who aren\u2019t even out of high school yet might not have all the answers?",

After that, my plan is to work my way up to partner, and eventually start my own trading firm.\n\nAnd now that I know your background, it now makes sense why everything you said sounds so insane to me (especially the part regarding choosing a state school over Harvard, wtf? my parents would straight up disown me for less). You have completely different career goals and know absolutely nothing about my desired field, so I don't care much for what you have to say; I would rather stick to the advice from adults much more experienced than you who actually work in my desired field (which in general completely contradicts what you say). Not to mention you are a completely different demographic than me and have a completely different upbringing and culture so of course you have a fundamentally different perspective.

Life is pretty unfair; hard work put in doesn't always correlate to rewards returned. Your GPA has some bearing on college admissions, but that doesn't always have bearing on what happens *after* this point.\n\nSpeaking as someone who is an alum of a top school and has seen a good number of my peers excel (from high school and from college), the name of the school you go to really, really, really has a minimal impact compared to the character of the person attending. Yeah there are benefits and you should attend a nice school if you can, but this post is seriously out of touch with real outcomes and the world outside of the narrow view offered by admissions pamphlets. \n\nYour happiness and well being are genuinely not worth a few extra percentage points for the admissions office to view. I've walked that line - what ends up happening is you arrive at university and find that \"all work no play\" leads to self isolation, alienation, and negatively affects your experience and your learning. Seriously, I think this is a weird sort of arrogance to claim knowledge of how things are in college, when the most salient points you bring up are whether a GPA is above 3.9 or not. You don't last long if you keep that mindset up.",

Obviously if you want to aim for ivys or top schools you gotta have the basic requirements to be considered but nitpicking about it isn't gonna do u any good. Also getting in a great school doesn't not guarantee a high paying job. It helps you get more connections but not necessarily a job. If you have a 3.9+ GPA and a 1500+ SAT  then good for you I hope you get into your dream school but if you start bitching about how you wished you had a 4.0 instead of a 3.97 or a 1540 instead of a 1520 then its fucking annoying.",

I\u2019m just saying in general the college you go to in nursing doesn\u2019t matter as much as the college you go to in something like business. Nursing relies more on grades and knowledge. Finance relies on networking and prestige. No I\u2019m gives a fuck about the knowledge someone has. A lot of shit in finance can be self taught which is why companies only care about the school people went to not the degree",

Sorry to burst your bubble but I can assure you two things. You will NEVER work as hard as many people in life. You're obviously privileged. And 2? News flash!!! Going a a top school doesnt mean youll be successful. Plenty of people go to ivy and such schools and work the same exact job as someone who went to a \"state school\" you going to those schools does not at all give you a guaranteed job which you do not seem to realize.  Now hop off your high horse.

There is a huge illusion that going to ivy schools will make you successful, in reality the majority of the people that go there come from successful families and are just looking for a piece of paper or to continue a legacy. Have fun with your student debt!! I can't believe people actually believe that a university is what makes them successful. It's your work ethic! You are doing all of the work yourself and you PAY them just for them to tell you you're good enough. If you took all of the smart kids that went to Ivys and put them in normal colleges, they would still be successful because they are still smart. And Newsflash!!

Yeah, if you want to be a wealthy lawyer, you probably should aim for Georgetown or Harvard, but the difference between your average state school and an ivy isn\u2019t really that big. It\u2019s all about making the most of your college experience (choosing the right degree, having in-demand skills, work experience, etc)\n\n3) Where you go to school doesn\u2019t mean shit if you don\u2019t get proper work experience/ don\u2019t get skills that can\u2019t apply to a job. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cmediocre-paying\u201d either, but if you go about college in an intelligent way, you can easily make 80k+ a year as a student who gets a 3.0 in high school (80k should be your goal, but there are a lot of people who can probably get 100k+)",

I also had ISS like 7 times in high-school and a bunch of write ups. When I got to college, I changed my major 6 times before I finally found something I enjoyed. After 4 years at a community College, 70+ credit hours, without a degree, I got into Missouri S&T for electrical engineering. Passed with flying colors. Your high school GPA does not matter! People with GEDs (not saying ged are bad, but schools generally hold them to a lower standard than high school diploma) get into college with no problems. You'll be fine. Community College credits are college credits. One thing to keep in mind is to ensure you speak with you advisor about which scholl you are planning to transfer to so they can make sure you are taking classes that will transfer. Some schools are sticklers about not transferring certain class credits from other schools.\n\nAlso, once you get out of college, your GPA only matters at the first 1-2 jobs. After that, your GPA is meaningless and they only care about the experience.",
