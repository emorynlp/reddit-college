      "text": "Boston University- valuing money over academics. I know someone who was a graduate student there, and was teaching a class. While grading papers, he discovered that one of his students had plagiarized, so he gave that student a zero. He called the student in and asked them to explain the plagiarism, to which their response was that it was unfair to give them a zero because they\u2019d paid someone else to write their paper, who had plagiarized it. The graduate student graciously decided not to turn the student in to the university, which could have led to them being expelled. A couple weeks later, the administration called the graduate student in, and told him he had to change the zero. When he said absolutely not, the university was like \u2018their parents give a lot of money to the university\u2019, so he couldn\u2019t fail them. As a result of the whole experience, he quit the PhD program entirely.",

NYU also has the strength of the individualised study program (Gallatin) which is a really unique opportunity + their study abroad program which you can integrate into just about every major. There's also cool opportunities like how NYU has a law school early admissions program that if you're admitted under gives you full tuition scholarship for NYU law (which is insane, the T3 don't do merit aid and most people who get named scholarships that do cover in full for the rest of the T6 are truly insane so it's a huge opportunity) and you don't even have to take the LSAT for it.\n\nI'm at NYU and it's been a mixed bag. Love a lot of the school and I think the experience, the opportunities, etc. are truly unmatched and I can honestly say I couldn't imagine being anywhere else but also, God fucking dammit is the administration filled with evil bloodsucking leeches and the financial aid is shit.",

                      "text": ">  just for comp sci/engineering there\u2019s no need to go into immense debt for the NYU name when other schools also have connections.\n\nThe engineering school makes as much as the business school on average while theatre/arts/musics are some of the worst ROI majors of the school so it feels very misleading to suggest that. If you're talking about majors in which NYU students command a high salary and are very successful, it's nursing/engineering/CS/business. Honestly for how good Tisch supposedly is it's kinda terrible in terms of outcomes. IMO, you shouldn't even touch Tisch with a 10 foot pole unless you're a) obscenely rich or b) you won't take any debt for it and there isn't any other major you'd rather do. \n\nIn general, I really hate when people say the \"NYU is only worth it for film/business\" because it's almost always a result of circular reporting and it really devalues the many high quality programs that do exist at NYU. I mentioned philosophy because the graduate philosophy department is considered the best in America (has ranked 1 since Philosophy Gourmet came about) and you get taught by amazing philosophy grads from day 1. It also has a top tier mathematics department (Courant), its econ program is also really strong, etc.. If you go through SPS, there's the real estate program that's also considered top tier and is often forgotten. \n\nIt's a line that gets said about NYU in a way that wouldn't be said about other universities and it works by making a presumption that isn't made about other universities. Given that nobody operates in a vacuum, suggesting blindly that NYU isn't worth it outside of two disciplines (and I'm @ Stern lol) is incredibly misleading. If someone has a financial aid package that they're comfortable with at NYU, a lot of the disciplines at NYU are world class and *absolutely phenomenal*. \n\n[I'd recommend looking at this site](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7583742/). One thing to consider is it only considers people with federal financial aid so there's obvious biases, but you can see that a lot of NYU's programs have fantastic outcomes. In the ROI (Adjusting for Completion and Underlying spending)*, History has a $425k ROI, Poli Sci is $712k. For comparison, Columbia's History is $108k and their Poli Sci program clocks in at $636k. Now, I'm not saying go to NYU over Columbia if you get in for those subjects (I have a huge bone to pick with a lot of the methodology behind this and think it can have misleading conclusions), but my point is that NYU gets weirdly targeted as a school that just isn't worth it when it's actually just fine? Don't go there if you have to take a ridiculous amount of debt, but plenty of people go there each year without doing so. \n\n>  i\u2019d argue that the SUNY study abroad program also has amazing opportunities for i can imagine much cheaper, especially for NY residents\n\nThis is one of the things you'll understand when you're in uni and actually have to deal with coordinating study abroad. There's almost nowhere comparable to how amazing NYU's study abroad program is. I'm not exaggerating. Coordinating study abroad is so hard and NYU's portal campuses honestly makes it so easy. You don't have to worry about credit transfers (you take NYU classes), the consistent program and portal campus means that they already have an experienced team who can help you coordinate, everything you do goes through NYU as well, etc.. Elon has a similarly reputable program but of the T30/T50, NYU's is truly unmatched.  \n\n\n* Definition of that below from [here](https://freopp.org/we-calculated-return-on-investment-for-30-000-bachelors-degrees-find-yours-1f2f3c5e6dac):\n\n> ROI (Adjusting for Completion and Underlying Spending): The amount that a student can expect to see his or her earnings increase thanks to the college degree, subtracting the full underlying cost of college before subsidies, and accounting for the risk that the student will drop out before finishing the degree.",

You don't actually know much about NYU but you were quick to make a statement on it based on what? OTOH, I've heard that one a thousand times so it didn't take long at all for me to write a response lol. Methinks you did expand on study abroad because that's the one area where you do think you know something, not because you're just so uninterested in the rest :)\n\n\n>  i would like you to know that i am in uni\n\nYour flair literally says HS senior, forgive me for making an assumption that the dude saying he's a HS senior is a HS senior?\n\n> literally work in a suny study abroad office lmao i promise i know all about both NYU and SUNY study abroad programs as well as middlebury and UC schools and private programs and more. \n\nReally? Didn't realise SUNYs had 15 campuses around the world.\n\n[I just checked SBU](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/studyabroad/outgoing/programs/current-year/grid.php?type=faculty-led-program) and for the fall and Spring, you have 2 faculty led programs (both in Africa and over less common subjects) with opaque credit determinations. So I guess as a business student I am basically SOL? I'll have to study at a partner university instead and go through the hassle of the foreign bureaucracy, be one of very few students presumably in the program, etc.?\n\nAs a business student @NYU, I can take classes that fulfill my exact same Stern requirements in a predictable manner in the following locations: London, Prague, Madrid, Florence, Sydney, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai and they're all through NYU campuses so no credit transfer issues at all, all through the same NYU software, etc.. \n\nObjectively speaking, NYU's 15 campuses that serve as direct extensions of NYU is pretty unique so to say it's not that special suggests a lack of education on the subject rather than an objective assessment of how NYU runs study abroad. I'm open to suggestions because I'm always happy to learn about new programs, but I haven't really seen anything that has come close to matching that. \n\nThis is of course ignoring that you're kinda missing the point. Which is that the whole \"business/art/film is the only thing worth studying at NYU\" is based on a tired, uninformed trope passed around by a bunch of people who know nothing about NYU. Which I stand by. And I think your responses highlight exactly what I'm talking about tbh",

They\u2019re less often semester programs bc the professors that lead them are here\u2026 teaching. There is also a SUNY Korea campus. \n\nThe thing you seem to ignore here is that part of the value of a study abroad education with a partner university is being exposed to a new type of teaching that you haven\u2019t been before. What\u2019s the point in continuously exposing yourself to only american education but with different backdrops, when you can study at UCL or Tsinghua University? Learn how different areas of the world educate their students, teach and learn? It helps your mind to explore new systems of learning and processing education. Study abroad is not just a fancy vacation to go take your courses somewhere else. I\u2019ve seen NYU\u2019s study abroad courses and they are absolutely not worth the price point for me because I\u2019d much rather learn like a local than live in an americanized bubble for my own comfort. Studying Abroad is to learn to think in new ways. I\u2019d rather take the stony brook courses with different backdrops over summer or winter break. \n\nAnd I still believe that it is not worth going into debt for a stem degree at NYU when there are plenty of schools- I focus on SUNY here bc i\u2019m a NY resident- where you can receive an equally amazing education without crippling your future self, especially for those of us who need/want to go to grad school. i don\u2019t even think business/art/whatever is worth going to NYU for a good majority of the time, i just believe that\u2019s where NYU brand recognition works best. i don\u2019t care if their philosophy program is great, i\u2019m talking about brand recognition.",
