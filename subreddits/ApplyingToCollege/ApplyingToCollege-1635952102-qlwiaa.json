  "text": "Due to some unforseen health issues at my home in the final days of my early applications, I was unable to fill the additional information section and I had multiple things that I needed to say in there. I submitted my apps without it. Should I mail an additional information essay to the two universities I've applied to now? (Maybe telling them why I was unable to write one in the first place)",
