Students at the top of their class are already more likely to be qualified in other areas. Yes, being at the top of your class *will help.* We agree on that. But it won't be as crucial as the picture you paint of yourself. \n\nI remember hearing from Emory and UPenn officers (on reddit AMAs) that class rank is used to determine the difficulty of your school when it comes down to perfect grades. If everyone has near a 4.0, and you get 3.9, it means nearly nothing. But again, it truly is holistic. They don't want perfect students--they're boring.",
