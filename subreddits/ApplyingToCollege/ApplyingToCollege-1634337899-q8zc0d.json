  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m a senior and as Early Access deadlines come, I\u2019m at a pitstop. Most of the colleges I\u2019m applying to are test optional, and the others want tests anyway. I want to take the tests to have a chance at getting the Zell Miller scholarship along with Hope (since I\u2019m in GA and will be staying with undergrad) but I suck at tests due to my anxiety. I\u2019m scared to take the tests and ruin my chances of getting in any college. But also, will colleges look at me differently if I don\u2019t submit my test scores?? Are there any risks of applying without them??",
