      "text": "This is a very cliche answer but... it depends. For example,\n\na. Are you an applicant who is not a California resident, whose family makes less than $150k a year? Well.... UCLA is \"overrated\" because a. it costs $60k+ to attend as a non-resident, and b. UC schools do not offer need-based financial aid to non-California residents.\n\nb. Are you an applicant who lives in a state like California, Virginia, North Carolina, etc, with excellent public universities in your state, and you want to save money? Well, unless you're wealthy or in the financial position to do so..... shelling out >$70k a year for a private university is not worth it over the in-state cost and value of schools like UC schools, UVA, W&M, or UNC, which would be half the cost and provide a very similar quality of academics & opportunities.\n\nc. \"Overrated\" in reference to their USNews position? I'd argue that WashU (sorry ssseabasss) should be around #20, not #14. (and while we're at it, I'd bring CMU up to be around #12-#15. that's a conversation for another day though lol.)\n\nd. \"Overrated\" in reference to how much they're talked about on A2C and elsewhere? Well.... if you want to go into CS, \"lower-tier\" schools like UIUC/UWashington/CMU/UCSD arguably outperform Ivies like Dartmouth or even Yale.\n\nEvery T20 has its strengths, and every T20 has its weaknesses.\n\nThe financial situations of each individual applicant, as well as the preferences and personalities and future goals of each individual applicant, need to be taken into account to tell if a school is \"overrated.\" For a low-income applicant who's a California resident, UCLA might be an amazing option. For that same applicant who's a North Carolina resident, UCLA would not be a good option.",
