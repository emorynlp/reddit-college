  "text": "if youre going through the same frustration described above feel free to discuss in the comments, heres my rant:\n\nso im an asian student who just gave his Alevels and im applying for some canadian unis im interested in through the OUAC but woah, to submit my Alevel transcripts i have to talk to the british council to send my transcripts to the WES (world education services) apparently, and theres a fees that i gotta give to the british council for EACH TRANSCRIPT (which is 4 transcripts in total) and THEN more fees to the WES to actually send my transcripts over to the unis i wanna apply to and a fees for EACH uni im applying to??? \n\ni dont know if this is the case for everyone or if this is my anxiety getting the best of me and theres an easier way to do this but oh god this just feels so overwhelming\n\nfor context ive done applications through the commonapp for the states and it seemed tough but doable however this is just a LOT of work man idk what to do, im trying to find alternative ways to apply but its just as convoluted and messy",

I was considering giving the DET (duolingo English test) since it's pretty accessible + cheap (this was before i realized I didn't have to since I took English language as a subject in my alevels)\nRegardless, the rooting is mutual aight!
