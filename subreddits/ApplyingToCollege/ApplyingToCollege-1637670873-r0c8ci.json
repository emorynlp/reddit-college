  "text": "If you think about it, nothing about them is extra. if you want to get into a university that's good (Which tbh are the only ones where your guaranteed a job) you NEED to take a ECs. I went through my whole Middle School years and my freshman year thinking that they were optional for people, only there if they wanted to do something with their friends after school. Now I need to figure out what to do bcs my grades alone aren't enough.\n\nAt least I'm going into IB which kind of forces me to them so I'll just treat it as regular schoolwork.",

I'm not too sure too since I never apply but my school (top oxbridge feeder) almost encourages 2 types of overseas gunners: yuge nerds and extremely diverse people. The yuge nerds get into Oxbridge more often.\n\nBut I think that going into the UK makes things sort of a pressure cooker, since generally you'd want 2/3 internships in total and spring week before applying for summer intern?",
