  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am an international and I took the SAT last month. However, I couldn\u2019t study due to certain circumstances. There is another one in December and I would hope to try to hit 1500 with it. But is it worth it? Is there even time to use it?\n\nAlso I got 740 in reading and 720 in math",
