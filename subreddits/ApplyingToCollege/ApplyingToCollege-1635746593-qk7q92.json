  "text": "The activity is basically like a college prep academy that I go to monthly but heres the catch: its FREE and is run by my district who choose the top 50 underrepresented students during their sophomore year to participate(out of like 8k sophomores in the district and you have to be invited to apply) and basically gives them the advantage they need to get into a T20. The commitment is like 1 hr a week. Im just not sure if I should put it because it is a college prep thing and dont know how AO's will look at that. My college counselors said it would be fine if I did but I wanna know what you guys think? Maybe I just need to word it differently?",
