I mean sure they exist but it's rare that a single 17 year old has all the skills necessary to do what would normally take a whole team of adults to do in the real world. And sure they might have \"started\" the nonprofit with a group of friends but at that point was it really you who raised the money or was it a collective effort?",

Know a few previous Coke scholars who did that as well as several people I know at HYPSM. It\u2019s disgusting but the system incentivized it to be that way. At this point  it so that only institutional priorities, insanely rich people at private schools, low income excellent students or first generation can get in. The only way now to get in as an unhooked student is to have like 3 significant accomplishments or 1 god-tier accomplishment (i.e. Gordon E Moore @ISEF, Google Science Fair Winner, Time Magazine Most Influential Teens, Davidson Fellow, or something that doesn\u2019t fit in that box) for the most elite programs. People are so stressed about college that they will do anything to get their way in, even if it requires them to be unscrupulous and bend the truth. You\u2019re spot on.",

The key is to find a nonprofit with big donors already built in, and give them an excuse to donate.  If you align yourself with a NPO, and put on fundraising events, then the elderly rich people think \"Awww, young kids are so enthusiastic!  This should be rewarded!\" and donate. \n\nThe other way is that mom and dad donate to your NPO.  But there's no way on earth we could donate that kind of money, no matter how tax-deductible it is.",
