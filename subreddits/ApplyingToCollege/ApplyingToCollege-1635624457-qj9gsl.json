  "text": "Hello, I'm a 26 male who's been out of school since 2013. I recently have been wanting to start college but I'm worried since I've forgotten a lot of school stuff since it's been almost 10 years. I was looking into medical fields and I have been looking into MRI tech recently but I'm scared if I start college I might end up messing up a lot since it's been a long time. What do you guys recommend that I can do or are there any classes that I can take that would prepare me for college?",
