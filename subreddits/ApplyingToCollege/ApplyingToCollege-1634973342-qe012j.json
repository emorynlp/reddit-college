      "text": "Most of those are decent, some are very good.  I put some notes below, but I would certainly consider Cooper Union and Swarthmore.  I would also look into how hard it is to get internships as an international student, and whether the kind of co-op programs a school like Kettering offers changes anything - I don't know the rules under a student visa.\n\nMissouri S&T is the main public engineering school in Missouri. Not especially selective, but solid.\n\nCooper Union is great - specialized engineering/architecture/art school in New York. Completely undergrad focused. Would be my first choice of these.\n\nKettering was GM's in-house university.  Very hands on, lots of co-op experience,  tons of ties to auto industry. Not a traditional college, but engineering is what they are known for.\n\nMichigan Tech is a public engineering school, kind of like Missouri S&T. Big difference is the quality of engineering education at Michigan and Michigan State is also high. It's in the upper peninsula so cold and very snowy - not my taste, but it's a good school.\n\nMSOE is a small engineering focused school in Milwaukee. Good reputation.\n\nClarkson is in upstate New York, another small engineering school.  Their outcomes are ok, but they score kind of low on happy student rankings.\n\nSwarthmore is one of the best liberal arts colleges in the US, and one of the few with accredited engineering. Tremendous school.\n\nI don't know LTU really. \n\nClemson is one of the main state flagship schools in South Carolina, and is well regarded for engineering.  Not quite as strong as Virginia Tech maybe, but definitely good.\n\nIllinois Tech is kind of like MSOE - small, urban, private engineering school.  I think MSOE is a better school.\n\nMiami University is a public university in Ohio. Not really known for engineering, but it's fine. Ohio State is better known for engineering.",
