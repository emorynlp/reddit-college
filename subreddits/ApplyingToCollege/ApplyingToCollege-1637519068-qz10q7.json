  "text": "Hi guys :) I'm an international applicant, I'll go to Boston next year to start university, but I feel a bit scared and nostalgic for my life in my country. I know that what I want to do is study abroad and get a top education, but I can't avoid feeling this way for leaving my family and my entire life here. Do you feel the same? How do you deal with that?",
