  "text": "I am top 17% in class rank. This is bs.\n\n- I have a 4.0 UW\n- I will have taken 9 APs by the end of this year, I\u2019ve completed 5 so far\n- The only non-honors classes I\u2019ve taken are PE (required), chorus twice, and graphic design\n- I\u2019ve never taken a study hall or free period \n\nAt my school, you can take easy engineering classes with AP weighting. People also often take study halls and free periods, which don\u2019t affect their GPAs. I think it\u2019s really unfair that my class rank suffers because I take art classes instead of just going home.\n\nbut I\u2019m rank 69 so I guess I can\u2019t complain too much \ud83d\ude0e \u2026\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "A similar thing happened with me. There aren't quite as many overachievers at my school, so I'm still #6, but my GPA decreased by a full 0.1 because I took 4 years of choir instead of study halls. My class rank would be #2 had I taken study halls instead of choir for 4 years. \n\nProbably the best thing I can say is that admissions readers know that art and music classes drag down your GPA and will take that into consideration. In other words, despite having a worse class rank than others near the top of your class, you will most likely be regarded academically similar to them because of your art classes.",

An additional x points is added for each honors, AP, etc. So a GPA of 4.0 plus a set of courses and honors weighting is the same whether it includes additional unweighted courses or not.\n\nIt can be a pain to explain (she\u2019ll graduate with a 5.56), but it avoids the former system where no one taking band/choir ever could be Val/sal.\n\nFwiw, I find the California GPA calculator to be the same - if I include fewer courses, her GPA is higher.\n\nYes, it\u2019s not fair, but it is what it is.",
