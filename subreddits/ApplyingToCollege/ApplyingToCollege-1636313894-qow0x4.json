  "text": "one of my schools required 2 other recommenders so now I\u2019m confused about who to assign for the colleges where only one is required.\n\nSome context:\nOne is my dance teacher, known me for 13 years, can speak mostly about how I\u2019ve grown through dance and helped her during my internships. Really personal, but sort of focused on the dance aspect. I was also her financial advisor so there\u2019s some mentions of than as well which kinda relates to my major \n\nThe other is the program director from my old school (where I was the first 2 years of high school, she didn\u2019t teach me anything so she couldn\u2019t be put as a teacher recommendation). She\u2019s known me for about 6-7 years and can speak to my constructions to the school as well as my more a academic oriented achievements. She was my coordinator and I have a pretty good relationship with her and keep in touch with her. \n\nI think both of them would give me good letters. \n\nBasically, should I choose an arts teacher or my coordinator.",
