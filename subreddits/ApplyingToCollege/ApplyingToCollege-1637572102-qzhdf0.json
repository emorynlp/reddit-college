  "text": "I had less than stellar grades in HS (about a 2.0 GPA) and shortly after decided to join the military. I got some time left where I can balance work and still prepare myself for transition. My current plan is to do an associates program at a 4-year and if everything goes well, go for a bachelors, but I was wondering if it was worth the time to take CLEP courses to supplement everything else that goes into a college application and if it would have any meaningful impact on admission odds.",
