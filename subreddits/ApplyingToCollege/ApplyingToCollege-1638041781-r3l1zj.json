  "text": "I listed my friend (who is also my classmate) as my peer recommender. I specifically asked him to put some effort into this recommendation and he said he would. In an effort to be funny, he only wrote the word \"balls\" and submit it. I've already contacted the admissions office, but I'm worried that this might make me look bad as a candidate. How will this affect my application? What should I do?",

Implied current and future loss of earnings (if he doesn't get into the university and instead has to settle for one that he thinks is inferior) (Alternatively, if the mental anguish is too much for him and he misses certain events or trips because of it).\n\nSomething doesn't have to be illegal for you to sue someone.",
