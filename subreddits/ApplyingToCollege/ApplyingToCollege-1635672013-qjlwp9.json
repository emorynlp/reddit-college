  "text": "Okay so Im trying to rephrase this sentence:  As I noticed people around me embrace their identities, a feeling of ineptitude overwhelmed me. \n\nthe word ineptitude doesn't really fit in here, so does anyone have a word for me that conveys that people around me were actually embracing themselves, while I just felt lost and clueless? I can use clueless or lost, but I am repeating those words too often, so if anyone has a better structure or vocab. lmk",
