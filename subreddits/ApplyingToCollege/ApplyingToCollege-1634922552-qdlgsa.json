  "text": "So my new favorite hobby is listening to Seniors in my classes talk about colleges apps. Some of them are ridiculously confident (one called Stanford their target and NU their safety ). Some are not confident whatsoever (doesn\u2019t think they will get into state school with 88% acceptance rate). They literally don\u2019t pay attention and just spend class staring at their common app. The funniest thing is as I\u2019m typing this the girl in front of me is applying to cal poly, and the girls to my left are complaining that their parents are making them apply to USC.",
