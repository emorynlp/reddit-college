  "text": "A lot of people (a very respected counsellor, someone who was on the Columbia admission board, etc) have told me that I\u2019ll definitely get into an Ivy League but they can\u2019t say which one (obviously). \nIs it stupid to spend so much money on just ivy leagues??? Or could someone help me with which ivies to apply to. \n\nPS: I\u2019m sorry for this question. I know it\u2019s weird asf but I\u2019ve been contemplating for a lot of time. I really don\u2019t wanna spend my parents\u2019 money but i still wanna see if and which ivy accepts me :// I\u2019m gonna major in CS.",

Sure, they\u2019re nowhere near a Power 5 conference, but they consistently beat other D1 schools in both sports. They even win games in the NCAA basketball tournament sometimes. For a specific example, Penn beat Lehigh 20-0 in football this year. Lehigh isn\u2019t a bad football school by any means; it\u2019s still a school that the top athletes on most high school football teams would love to go to if they\u2019re offered.",

The schools you're most likely to get into are the ones that line up best with your academic interests and values. Like, if you're really into the idea of interdisciplinary learning and maybe combining art with STEM, you'll both be a better candidate for Brown (since that's the sort of thing they look for) and you'll be happier there (since the school and curriculum will be built around those interests).\n\nAlso, some Ivies are going to be much better places for you than others. You might adore Yale but hate Dartmouth based on their location, size, etc. Aaaand I'm sure you've heard it enough but it bears repeating. Ivies aren't everything.

You might read that you have to take something you dislike at one place and eliminate that, or alternately love requirements at another. Obviously campus vibes are important, too\u2026 big city, small town, suburban, campus size, etc. Do the online tours and see where you imagine yourself. \n\nWorking on narrowing down your list will save the stress of all the supplemental questions, but it will also help you to write some of those supplements as you may be drawn to some schools even more.",

It\u2019s a waste of your time and their time. I only applied to Cornell because it has a really good engineering program, I just disregarded the rest of the Ivies.

CS at NC State is in Engineering- you have to be admitted to Engineering first, then there is competitive admission to the major. CS at CMU is in its own school, with a <5% admit rate\n\n-course selection/ major pathway. Engineering based CS departments tend to be heavier on the pre-engineering/physics/math coursework. Gen Ed courses will be from the engineering pathway\n\n-cross majoring. At some schools it is difficult or impossible to major in two different divisions (engineering in CS and physics, for example) because of the major requirements\n\n-course selection and qualifying/declaring the major. Direct admission programs often have reserved seats in classes, and you typically just have to meet \u2018adequate progression\u2019 GPA standards vs needing a 3.3 or 3.5 average in the major courses (sometimes in a limited number of attempts) in order to become a major.",
