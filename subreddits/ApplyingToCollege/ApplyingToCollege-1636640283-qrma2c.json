  "text": "So my EFC is a out 23000 according to fafsa, but our family has very little funds to support me. (Fam of 5, only dad works, lots of debt because we needed new car bc old one got wrecked, and house is still being payed, and had to do repairs.\nWe have like $1000 total in savings... )\n\nMy dad says that he can maybe contribute like 5k a year at most. And that is vastly different than the fafsa EFC /:\n\nAm I fucked for financial aid.?",

      "text": "5k from dad + 5500 federal student loan + summer/school year work earnings 3-5k(?) = 13-ish k budget. Depending on how much you can earn yourself, you are close to being able to cover living expenses. (Which means, if you are looking for merit scholarships, you are looking for full tuition)\n\nTo clarify, colleges use the FAFSA form to help calculate need. However, FAFSA EFC, by itself, does not tell students what they can expect to pay. It is not enough info. Many colleges require additional forms such as the CSS Profile or the college's own form, considering both income and assets and often noncustodial income and assets as well, and each college has its own level of available resources and uses its own unique formula in calculating need.\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
