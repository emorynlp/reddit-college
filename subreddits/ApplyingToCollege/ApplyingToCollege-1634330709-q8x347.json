  "text": "Hi!\n\nI'm applying to Yale EA, and a few smaller public schools. I'm going to be applying to a lot more private schools during RD. If I needed a recommendation letter due on November 1st for Yale, when I email the professor, should I tell him that I want a recommendation letter for Yale, or should I tell him that I need a recommendation letter to Yale and the other schools?",
