  "text": "So I\u2019ve finished applying to all of my targets and safeties, and I\u2019m going to look for 3-4 reaches now. I wanted to know which I should realistically go for. I can put my stats below, thanks guys :) \n\nGPA: 3.9 (mostly filled with honors and AP) \n\nACT: 30 (don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll submit this to reach schools, I absolutely suck at standardized tests)\n\nAPs: Bio (4) Gov (4), won\u2019t even bother giving my physics 1 score lol, and this year I\u2019m taking \nCalc AB, APUSH, AP German Language, AP Spanish Literature \n\nA lot of volunteer hours from tutoring in school and in elementary schools; im a core member for a non profit and I teach classes to kids from underprivileged communities (usually all science classes). Leading 2 projects; collecting, raising money, and donating clothing to kids in the Carribean and sanitary products for children in Uganda. \n\nVarsity swim for 2 years, volleyball for a year (covid), 3 national honors societies (regular NHS, German, science), as well as some clubs in school\n\nPassion is learning languages (talked about this in my essay)",

Any preferences with size, weather, location, surrounding area, or vibe?**\n\n\\^ It's pretty hard to suggest schools for someone when you don't know their major, financial situation, or what they want in a school.",

          "text": "Of course \n\na. im leaning towards either biochemistry or neuroscience and I\u2019ll probably minor in linguistics \n\nb. cost is a concern bc i don\u2019t want to be spending 80,000 a year. my parents are willing to help but i wanna take on most of the debt because I have a twin brother and a brother who will be a senior in college next year, so i dont want them taking that on.(probably why we got some fasfa aid, and hoping to get aid from schools) but my parents finished paying my older brothers tuition (he goes to an instate school and has a pretty good scholarship in NJ. \n\nc. I\u2019m looking for a pretty medium sized campus, although i wouldn\u2019t completely mind a city one. ideally I\u2019d be right outside of a major city or be in a city but the school has a campus. In regards to weather, I\u2019m more of a warm weather person but I don\u2019t mind cold too much so as long as I\u2019m not in the depths of a forest I\u2019ll be good lol",

Here's my suggestions:\n\n**WashU -** I'm sure u/ssssseabass can tell you more about WashU and how it fits your criteria lol.\n\n**Emory**\n\n**Northeastern**\n\n**UMiami**\n\n\\^ For all four of those schools, go to Google and look up \"\\[name of school\\] net price calculator\" and use the link that pops up for each school to enter your family's financial information to get a cost estimate from each school. Note that merit scholarships are sometimes not factored in.\n\nBest of luck. :)",
