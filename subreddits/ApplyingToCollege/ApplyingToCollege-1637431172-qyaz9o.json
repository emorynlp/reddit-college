All the W2 substitute and 1099 substitute said was me checking off a box saying I don\u2019t qualify for either of them, and that was it.\n\nBasically IDOC is sending the college 5 duplicated documents, 3 of which are 1099 substitutes and 2 W2 substitutes that just said I don\u2019t have or qualify for either form.\n\nShould I contact IDOC on Monday?",
