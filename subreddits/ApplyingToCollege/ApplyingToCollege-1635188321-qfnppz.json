  "text": "I may have selected Other instead of Social Sciences for my history classes when self reporting. I've already submitted and can't change it, should I contact the college's admissions to change it or will they understand it as a simple error on my end? They still have access to my official transcript too so I'm wondering whether I should.\n\nI'm probably overthinking but would it effect my application review?\n\nDefinitely don't want this coming as a stupid question haha, I tend to worry about every little thing here so it might just be in my head",
