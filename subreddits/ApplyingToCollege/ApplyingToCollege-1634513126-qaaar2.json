  "text": "Call me overly paranoid if you want but my personal essay includes details about my elementary school like a physical description of the area and some of the traditions there, to keep it vague. Would an admissions officer reach out to the school to verify that what I wrote is exactly correct? It\u2019s obviously been a while since I attended so I may not remember every detail perfectly.",
