  "text": "Hi! \n\nI'm a freshman in India but I'm a US citizen and I want to major in Aerospace Engineering.\n\nI dont really know any EC's apart from the olympiads I'm preparing for (AMC 10 and USAPHO) that I can do that are majorly STEM focused.\n\nI also activley participate in class, GPA of 3.9 and Im applying for MIT THINK + LaunchX.\n\nAnother thing I do are writing declamation and debate competitions and I run a podcast.\n\nKeep in mind that I dont go to school due to the lockdown, so I cant start or participate in clubs/sports.\n\nIm kinda clueless as to what can take my app to the next level, what can really highlight me as a student and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCiao!\n\nTLDR; What can I do as  a freshman in high school to add to my college app.",
