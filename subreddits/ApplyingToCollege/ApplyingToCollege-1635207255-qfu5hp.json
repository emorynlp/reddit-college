Make sure you filled out the information correctly. Entering retirement account balances as \u201cinvestments\u201d is a common mistake.\n2. Make sure you complete the NPC for each individual school you\u2019re looking at. FAFSA is only for federal aid, so has no idea what aid any individual school will offer.",
