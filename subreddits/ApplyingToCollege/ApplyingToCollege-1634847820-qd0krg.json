  "text": "i just finished a college interview and i didn't think it went too bad but it was definitely not the best so i want to know how other's were to compare. \n\nso this college has optional interviews so i decided to do one because i really like this school. my interviewer asked the generic questions and i answered them but i feel like i could have elaborated more and made it more unique, instead of saying a bunch of generic stuff. im also a pretty shy person so i stumbled on some words a lot and there were some stuff that i forgot to mention. my interview lasted like 15 minutes. is that really short? does that mean my interview was kinda bad? i heard that typical college interviews were 30 minutes to an hour so i am worried that mine ended very short.",
