  "text": "I had this college essay prompt for University of British Columbia. As much as my career, my future, my academic interests are VERY VERY important in my life at the end of the day my peace of mind and my happiness is even more important. So not sure what I should write as choosing one is hard.",

      "text": "I wrote a similar one for Stanford and how I approached it was using a figure/ object/ really random thing that seems meaningless to other (a microwave) but is a carrier/catalyst of very special meanings for me (family and giving back). You could consider this approach, tho I would advise you to really look into the \u201cvibe\u201d of the schools you\u2019re applying to and see what kind of essays they prefer. Stanford just happens to like quirky creative stuffs",
