  "text": "Hey guys, for UPenn, I wanna apply as a health and societies major, but most of my activities are about bio. For the supplement that asks how did you develop/find your academic interests, I would be talking about bio and not really health and societies at all. Is this fine?",

      "text": "Biology is like directly related to health? Surely there's some way for you to tie in your interest in bio to your desire to study health and society. As a bonus, if you have an EC in one of the topics that Penn says health and societies majors focus on (\"anthropology, history, and sociology\") or perhaps in one of the areas that Penn mentions that students study (\"epidemiology, political science, business/economics, law, environmental studies, and bioethics\"), you can link that to your bio ECs to give your essay more depth.",
