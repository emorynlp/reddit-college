  "text": "I'm a dual citizen applying from abroad. There is no one around me that could properly evaluate an essay. I'm trying to get there from internet examples but I need feedback on my writing. Are there any admissions counselors, past AO's, or hell, college students that can lend a hand? It's pretty short, 400 words.\n\nYou can hail me in the comments or message me directly. Thanks so much for taking your time in advance.",
