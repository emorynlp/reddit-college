          "text": "While that may be true from a difficultly standpoint, your examples are specifically not true for the OPs question. All the APs are weighted and will be treated the same for purposes of rescinding an app. What is true is that a B in an unweighted class hurts the GPA more than a B in a weighted class, and the UCs look at overall grades (no Ds) and have a GPA floor when it comes to rescinding apps.",

      "text": "Unless something has changed since last year, *after* you\u2019re accepted to a UC, you can get Bs and even get Cs as long as you maintain a GPA floor for the unreported terms (I think it was 3.0, but with weighted grades, that could be a lot of Cs). Source: I read through the acceptance materials last year for one of my students. Ds are not allowed, so any student doing really poorly should contact admissions and work something out (UC admissions do not want to rescind & often will work something out).",
