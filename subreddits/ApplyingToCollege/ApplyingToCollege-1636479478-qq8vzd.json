      "text": "Start your common app now- check to see how many schools have extra essays. You can nibble away at the common app a few minutes at a time except for the \u201cbig\u201d essay. It only takes a few minutes extra to submit to additional schools **if they don\u2019t have writing supplements** Make a list of the extra writing supplements (if any) and start organizing and outlining now. \n\nAlso get your teachers alerted now to start preparing to write letters of rec. Request transcripts. Get an unofficial transcript now in case you have to do a SRAR or the courses and grades section\n\nIf you are organized and have a moderate number of awards/EC/ etc, it is reasonable to complete the straightforward parts of the common app in an evening. Only you know how long it will take to get an essay you are happy with.",
