  "text": "I can't believe we are going to receive our ED results in a month and half! All 12 years of school leading up to this moment. The fact that I am actually a senior in high school has not sunk in until I have submitted all my EA and ED schools. I want to say that I am so, so proud of yall. With the pandemic and all the confusion over the past 2 years, we did great and will continue to accomplish amazing things in life regardless of the college admission results. No matter which schools or what direction we head towards in the next year or the next decade, I hope we will be able to look back at our high school years and appreciate all the tears and sweat that we put into our applications.",
