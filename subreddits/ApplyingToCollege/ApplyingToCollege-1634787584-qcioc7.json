  "text": "Hey so I wanted to put some information thats related to my personal statement in the additional details section and I'm not sure if I can. So my personal statement is about some personal growth that I have had and I want to write in the additional details section about the results of that personal growth. Basically I want my personal statement to be the process I went through and the ordeals while the additional details section is just the growth like for example, me getting better grades in my junior year. What do you guys think? I just don't have enough room to include the results of my personal growth.",

      "text": "Make room. They limit you for a reason, the A.O. only spends a max of 15 min with your application, barely enough to read your personal statement and any supplementals and your transcript. They can see that you did better junior year from your transcript, so you don\u2019t need to elaborate much on it. The additional information section should be only used for information that has no place elsewhere in your application. It is not designed for you to use to get around word-counts.",

Then at the end I related what I learned over two years through my \"journey\"  to how I'll be successful in college and in a future career.",
