      "text": "Well there\u2019s no one method of getting in. There\u2019s students that are exceptionally brilliant in, say, biology, and get in. There\u2019s students that are exceptionally good at debating. And there\u2019s well rounded people. But make sure to have good grades, test scores, good rec letters, and strong essays. Those are definitely crucial regardless of what your extracurriculars are.\n\nAlso- most Ivy League / Ivy League level schools don\u2019t give scholarships at all. Financial aid, sure, but a lot of them aren\u2019t need blind for international students and that will affect your chances.",

Sometimes an interview- depends on the school \n\n5. Grades and test scores \n\n6. Current classes you\u2019re taking\n\nA lot of scholarships have separate applications or other requirements, but again, Ivy League schools don\u2019t give scholarships. Most other T10s don\u2019t either.",

                      "text": "I think maybe you should do a quick search online if you are very unfamiliar with how the process works because it\u2019s more complicated than I can explain- read up on how the common app or coalition app works since that\u2019s where you submit most of your applications. \n\nBut recs are generally from teachers- you usually need to have at least 1-2 from core teachers (like ones that teach math or science). \n\nEssays depends on the school. There\u2019s a lot of different prompts.\n\nYou should list out whatever courses you\u2019re currently taking at the time of applying.",
