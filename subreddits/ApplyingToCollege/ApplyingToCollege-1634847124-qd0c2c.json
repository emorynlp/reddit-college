      "text": "Well there\u2019s no one method of getting in. There\u2019s students that are exceptionally brilliant in, say, biology, and get in. There\u2019s students that are exceptionally good at debating. And there\u2019s well rounded people. But make sure to have good grades, test scores, good rec letters, and strong essays. Those are definitely crucial regardless of what your extracurriculars are.\n\nAlso- most Ivy League / Ivy League level schools don\u2019t give scholarships at all. Financial aid, sure, but a lot of them aren\u2019t need blind for international students and that will affect your chances.",
