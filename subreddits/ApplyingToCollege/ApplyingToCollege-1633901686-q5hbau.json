  "title:": "Is it too late to build up on extracurriculars?",
  "text": "I am a junior currently, and I have no extensive extracurricular activities. The longest thing I have on my resume is half  a year serving as the founder/president of a club I made back in February. I was also an intern and officer for half a year for two bigger clubs (red cross and key club), but have quit since then. I want to build up my extracurricular profile, not just for college, but as for being exposed to different career fields too. I'm most interested in extracurriculars that pertain math and/or anything related to vehicles and aircrafts. Sadly, my school doesn't have a math team nor anyone who is willing to become part of it.\n\n Where do I start?",

I also sometimes build lego sets if there are any available, but thats a once in a couple months type of thing. Is there anything I can do with the things I listed?",

Write about what topics you liked more (and wish to explore in college). \n\nFor example: [https://www.sae.org/](https://www.sae.org/)\n\nFor the lego sets, that's great because it backs up your interest in \"building things.\" Check out Lego Education: [https://education.lego.com/en-us/discover#confidence](https://education.lego.com/en-us/discover#confidence)",

      "text": "Never to late! Junior year onward is probably the most important in terms of extracurriculars in the eyes of AO\u2019s, so devote your attention to specific things that you like. Try to start looking for opportunities during the summer as well :) math is a very diverse field that is applicable in most areas, could you give more insight on what you\u2019re interested in doing with math so I can give you more specific suggestions?\n\nEdit: don\u2019t forget to have fun, although it may not seem like it, for the most part EC\u2019s, grades, etc. become irrelevant once you reach uni so make some memories that would last. Obviously it\u2019s great that you are thinking of EC\u2019s and academia, but just remember to balance things out. Good luck <3",
