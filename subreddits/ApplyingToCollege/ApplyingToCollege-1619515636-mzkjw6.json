  "text": "As someone who was known as the \u201csmart kid\u201d at my school, my grades really weren\u2019t all that great. My school was known for students going to great IVY\u2019s and top UC\u2019s, and I spent the four years in high school trying to reach the top. It made it worse that I held leadership positions in a robotics team, so I felt even more pressured to go to some great school. \n\nAfter a dreadful March of 2021, getting rejected and waitlisted from all of my targets and reaches, I felt like an utter failure. I was seeing Instagram posts and my friends on campus getting accepted to amazing schools that I saw myself in. I felt ashamed telling my relatives, classmates, and teachers that I got into none of the UC\u2019s. \n\nAlthough I did get into some Cal States, I received little to no financial aid. I only have one parent helping me pay for college, and money has been tight for the last few years. I started to wonder if a better education was worth being in debt in the future.\n\nAround the end of March, UC Merced reached out to me with their \u201cCount Me In\u201d program. They offered me a big grant and full financial aid that was going to cover all of my expenses (respectively). To be honest, I\u2019ve only heard bad things about Merced, coming from my classmates and relatives. \u201cThey\u2019re too new\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not even that competitive\u201d \u201cthe surrounding area sucks\u201d \u201cwtf is that acceptance rate?\u201d \u201cYou can do better.\u201d\n\nYou know what? Screw them. I\u2019ve committed to UC Merced today in Undeclared Natural Sciences. My dad and I took a tour yesterday of the area and I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the campus. I ended up spending almost 3-4 hours there. It didn\u2019t even cross my mind that Yosemite was so close to the campus, and I learned about how many opportunities students have with UCM\u2019s connections with the National Park. \n\nSorry that this kind of turned into a story time, but I just wanted to say that it doesn\u2019t matter what people say on what college you go to. My parents are thankfully supportive of my decision, and I hope my friends will be to. This goes to my school and everyone similar: Normalize going to UC Merced. Don\u2019t define someone based on what college they attend.",

UC Santa Cruz was the new UC then and the average SAT score was 1100.\n\nUSC is a great example of how reputations and 'prestige' change through ranking manipulation. I see USC on lists with Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Duke, Rice, Vandy. I mean its ranking is so high, so it attracts applicants with better numbers, getting more people to apply, which keep the rankings high.\n\n>Here's how USC is described in 1992:  \n>  \n>\"When certain students call the University of Southern California 'prestigious' they are not referring to its academic reputation. Sure, USC is a highly respectable private university, but that's almost besides the point in the middle of a very visible student contingent that has flavored the character of the school for years. These are the kids who give USC its reputation as a playground for the children of the affluent. They're the ones who define the best prospect for happiness at the school as someone who's 'rich, classy, and from a prestigious town.'\"  \n>  \n>\"'You can slide by here in the easiest of classes like a junior college,' students have said. But for more serious students - and people swear they do exist - USC does have extensive options.\"  \n>  \n>SAT range 980-1210\n\nReputations change and schools go up and down the rankings. It's more about what you do with your time while you're there. Congratulations on being a pioneer! I hope you have a great college experience - and to think you're getting it all for free!",

                      "text": "I never said Merced did anything. My point was that reputations change over the years as well as the perceived prestige of the school. \n\nFYI From Quora:\n\nUSC's ascendance in national rankings began after Steven B. Sample became president of the University in 1991. He did five major things: 1) made undergraduate admission to the university much more selective--I heard him say once that he wanted local southern California students to feel the shock of not getting admitted to a school they thought they would easily get into. USC continues to be even more selective in its student admissions, and that is one measure of a school's ranking. 2) He appointed an excellent provost, Lloyd Armstrong, who approved the building up of select schools and departments through the hiring of internationally known faculty members who raised the university's reputation and who, in turn, attracted excellent graduate students. 3) They put more funding into graduate programs, which also attracted better and more successful graduate students; 4) they expanded programs overseas, especially in Asia 5) perhaps most important, and related to the first four, President Sample initiated the most successful fund-raising campaign in the University's history. His successor, Max Nikias, continued record-breaking fundraising.",

It may not be the flashy prestigious school that kids on tv shows go to, but IMO that made it better. I felt like I was learning in classes WITH other students instead of the stress of constant competition. I went on school funded outings to Yosemite and Santa Cruz. I even had a professor stop me in the cafe to ask my opinion on their class. How many public schools have that much financial aid offerings PLUS the UC reputation AND have moments where a professor you haven't spoken to recognizes you from class to chat? I think you made the right choice.",

For OP, he got a full ride so and likes his program so it's completely worth it for him, however for other students it's not always going to worth the UC price just to go to a school with a UC name when you could go to a more convenient, usually cheaper, CSU or CC. CSULB is one of the best CSUs, but you should check the vibe and program before you can say for sure.",
