  "text": "I\u2019m planning on transferring to Georgia Tech for Fall 2022. \n\nFor my personal essay I\u2019m between two prompts and I\u2019m curious about which seems like the better topic for me to write about. The essay max is up to 300 words (I plan to utilize all 300 words). Here are my topics!:\n\n1: How a personal, distressing experience from high school (bullying and assault is involved) pushed me to peruse dual enrollment full time, allowing me to attain my AS at 17. The goal of this prompt is to emphasize my ambition and ability to overcome difficult situations.\n\n2: How the arts/music has been a very important factor in my life. Been playing for 15 years, concert mistress for 4 years, began playing with a college orchestra at 16, performed solo for luncheons, award ceremonies, local art events and a Christmas concert. Nominated for All State, made it to state level in Gov. Honors in the music category. Volunteered as an usher at a local classical music venue where I also assisted in introducing children to music. Attending my current university on a music scholarship that according to my admissions advisor is \u201cone of the highest music scholarships shes seen awarded in years.\u201d I was invited to play in a string chamber with all upperclassman as a freshman, and am one of two freshmen \u201cfirst violinists\u201d (more challenging music) while most other first years are in the \u201csecond violinists\u201d section of orchestra.",
