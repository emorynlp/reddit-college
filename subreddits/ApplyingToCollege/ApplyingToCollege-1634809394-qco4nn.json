  "text": "My counselor is mad at me because my ECs apparently are overstated. But they're not. I'm applying for a CS major and I haven't slept more than five hours at night since eighth grade. I've attended meetings at 3 in the morning and spent days on ten cups of coffee and no sleep. Now, if I keep my actual hours, they might think I'm \"lying\" but if I lie... well then it's a lie.",

      "text": "You should probably meet with them to explain this.  Remember that:\n\n1)  Your hours are not going to win you extra points or make you stand out.  ECs are there for the AOs to learn how you spend your time, what you value, what you pursue, and what else they can learn about YOU.  They aren't there to serve as some twisted accounting system rewarding whoever sleeps the least.  The hours number is used mostly for context, not for simply giving busier students higher ratings.\n\n2)  You can give yourself \"full credit\" for the hours you spend.  That includes time spent traveling, preparing, practicing, or whatever else.",

          "text": "Thank you for your response! I mostly meant that the AOs might see me as a liar and think I'm exaggerating my ECs time allotment because it wouldn't add up to a time that one can commit if they have a healthy lifestyle (which I do not) and will work as a disadvantage. They're probably not going to consider a student could be overworking themselves and just think I'm lying about my hours to impress them or something.",
