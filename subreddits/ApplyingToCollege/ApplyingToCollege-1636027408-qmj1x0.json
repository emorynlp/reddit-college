  "title:": "Cooper Union art portfolio question",
  "text": "This is really specific, especially bc I feel like not a lot of people have heard of CU, but I was wondering if anyone knew the format for submitting the portfolio. I know we submit it w the home test, but does anyone know if it\u2019s submitted physically and/or digitally? I pretty much just wanna know if I need to print out my digital pieces for my portfolio bc id want to use the nice paper at my school and I would like to do it before winter break lol.\n\nAlso, when I went to a portfolio review and was explaining my process and meaning behind each piece, the reviewer said i should \u201cdefinitely somehow include my process\u201d. Like, is there going to be a box I can fill out or something to explain each piece?",

The hometest instructions will be released -- Early Decision Dec 8 and Regular January 12\n\nThe Hometest will contain its own instructions to be followed explicitly, including how to do the portfolio submission. \u201c\n\nso i guess we just gotta wait until the home test to figure out specifics",
