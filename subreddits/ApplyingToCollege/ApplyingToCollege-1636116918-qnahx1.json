  "text": "Hi guys, \n\nSomething that my school does is take a picture of our first quarter grades to submit to colleges that need it ED, and the school I'm applying to is one that needs a report. The thing is, I have 1 B+ on the report  (but everything else is an A except for an A- in chemistry). Since I'm taking all AP classes, wouldn't course rigor make up for a low grade? I ask because my total GPA as of currently is still a 4.83 with these grades, but I was just wondering if my calculus B+ would break my application. Thanks!",
