If everyone just applies to 3 schools, they won't be able to get a fair comparison for financial aid/scholarship packages, safeties won't be safeties anymore cz their rates would go down and reaches won't be reaches cz their rates would go up. But I also think limiting the number of apps a person can send should be limited to, say 10 each. Similar to the UCAS system where the cap is 5 (UK is much smaller in population and area, so it only makes sense.) One can still use UC apps, apply Texas apps, direct school apps but the total number cannot exceed 10. It's a theory, right?",

      "text": "It's going to depend on how selective the schools are that you are interested in, whether you need financial aid, and whether you are applying ED or EA to your favorite(s).  One of my kids applied ED and got in.  She had also applied to one state school with rolling admissions and one more whose deadline was before getting the ED decision so 3 total.  One of my kids was hoping for merit aid and also considering some UCs.  She applied to 10 schools.  My youngest is a senior now and has 9 on his list and will probably do all 9 applications even if he gets into his EA schools since he hasn't actually visited any in person yet due to Covid.  I know kids from states where the state schools aren't as selective as the UCs are who only applied to their state flagship.  I've seen posts here from kids who are shotgunning the T20s who apply to 18-20 ultraselective schools plus 1-2 safeties.  I would say that if money isn't an issue and you have some reaches on your list, somewhere in the 5-10 range is pretty common.  Spend time making sure you really like your safeties.",

If you\u2019re determined to get into somewhere super competitive and you want to spread out your chances, then there\u2019s nothing wrong with applying to as many as you can (just be careful to avoid the pitfall of making yourself exhausted from writing 100+ essays, and also make sure you\u2019re not bankrupting your parents with application fees).",

There was this one thing (I don\u2019t want to say it here so I don\u2019t have people copying me lol) that some schools have but it\u2019s not largely public knowledge, and I talked about that and related it to what I wanted to get out of college & how it tied to my personal experiences (this makes literally no sense but it actually did in my essay) so I had like one polished section about that and I was able to include it in most of my why x school essays. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it lol without saying what it is but it shows I did my research as literally nobody knows about it (more adults would than highschoolers) and relates to why I\u2019m pursuing college. And obviously I discussed other stuff too. I don\u2019t think a lot of the prompts are too difficult tbh.",
