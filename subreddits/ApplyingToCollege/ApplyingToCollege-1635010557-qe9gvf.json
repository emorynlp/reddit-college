  "text": "Should I still apply to top tier schools? I just took the ACT today and it was SO HARD! I\u2019m an A+ student and taken a slew of APs  and no matter how hard I studied I couldn\u2019t get a better score.   I\u2019m from a region of the country where testing is available and it\u2019s just so disheartening that I just can\u2019t do this test.  I already applied to my dream school (Yale) test optional expecting for this test to go well but obviously it didn\u2019t.  Sorry just a rant \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
