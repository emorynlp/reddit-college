East coast is preferable, but I don\u2019t care. \n\nSize: not a big factor for me\n\ncost: I am looking for a more affordable university. I do not qualify for need based aid, so merit scholarships are a big factor.\n\nmajor: undecided, but something in the sciences\n\npolitics: left leaning\n\nSchools I\u2019m considering: Duke, Wake Forest, Gonzaga, Lewis and Clark, my state school\n\nmy stats:\ndemographics: white female from a rural state\n\nSAT: 1530 790 math, 740 english\n\nGPA: 4.0 unweighted, our school didn\u2019t weight gpa, but 4.41 weighted gpa based on my calculations. (I took all the honors and IB classes offered)\n\nclass rank: 1/170\n\nextra curriculars: this is where my application is definitely lacking.\n\n4 years of French. I am currently taking a gap year as an au pair in France. \n\n30 hour job shadow at hospital\n\n3 years of band, 1 year orchestra\n\n3 years of speech and debate\n\n3 years xc\n\n2 years key club\n\nsecretary/treasurer for 2 clubs that I only participated in for a year\n\n2 summer jobs",

      "text": "State school would be optimal. If no need based aid privates are 70-80k yearly. Your state school is likely 30-40k tops. You\u2019d definitely be a candidate for most schools however merit scholarships are few and shouldn\u2019t be expected. For science maybe Emory although again for undergraduate a state school that\u2019s reputable is optimal imo",
