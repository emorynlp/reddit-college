  "title:": "Unpopular opinion: I\u2019m happy that the rest of my senior year was cancelled.",
  "text": "Now I\u2019m by no means saying that I\u2019m happy this whole corona situation happened. It\u2019s awful that people have died and suffered from this disease. It\u2019s awful that people lost their jobs and loved ones. And I\u2019m definitely sad about the possibility of my freshman year of college being ruined.\n\nHowever, I was done with high school. Senior year especially. I had overloaded myself with 6 APs and two leadership positions that were taking a toll on me. My grades were slipping. I was at school from 8am-4pm then spent 4 hours after school four days a week going to tutoring because my grades were slipping. Then I went home and did more homework/studying. Then I got like 3 hours worth of sleep, woke up, and did the whole thing over again. I was exhausted.\n\nI was on the breaking point. I didn\u2019t have time to take care of myself, to eat properly, I was drinking 3 cups of coffee/energy drinks a day, I had no time for my friends or hobbies that I enjoyed. So when it was announced that school was cancelled, I was super relieved. That endless cycle was over. \n\nI\u2019ve been catching up on sleep, cooking healthy meals for myself, catching up on tv that I enjoy, talking to my friends on the phone, spending lots of quality time with my dog, and taking care of myself. I don\u2019t mind that I have to give up prom and graduation. I don\u2019t see it as \u201cnot getting recognition for the past four years\u201d or something valuable taken away from me. I was miserable throughout all of high school anyway and a dance and a long ass ceremony wasn\u2019t going to fix that.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I could\u2019ve lasted 3 more months doing what I was doing. I probably would\u2019ve broken down at some point. But now that I\u2019m at home with lots of time to myself, I can rest and rejuvenate. So yeah, this whole situation does suck. But I\u2019m secretly thankful.\n\nI do feel bad for people who were genuinely looking forward to senior activities though. I hope you\u2019re able to find some solace through these tough times. Just know that better times await us.",

I won't disclose the location but we are a private school and all everyone talks about are grades. Sure maybe it's because 90-91 is a solid B and 92-93 a B+ but the back talks my close friend warns me about for my slightly mediocre grades are just too much. Worse thing is they won't show or even admit they've been gossiping about anyone's grades which is just a terrible thing to do. Quite frankly I'm glad junior year will probably wrap up besides the AP exams being still on. Really need to get those guys off my shoulder but I know my abilities well so I've been trained to deal with this kind of toxicity since middle school. Take care of yourself my guy.",

On the flip side, my stress is going away, I feel more comfortable in my own home, and my mental health hasn\u2019t gone down. \n\nIf freshman year of college gets ruined, that\u2019s a different story",

      "text": "I feel this so much. One of the biggest events I was looking forward to during my senior year (USSYP Washington Week) got cancelled due to the coronavirus about a week before I found out school was getting cancelled too. I was devastated when that even got cancelled and I didn't know how I would manage going to school every day when I was so sick of my peers and tired of school work. I was dreading the last couple of months of school because all I wanted was time to sit back and enjoy myself. For instance, I haven't had much time to read books for fun or watch TV in over two years because I've been so busy with school. The last three months of senior year were going to be so busy with school work that I wouldn't have been able to enjoy those things.\n\nWith school getting cancelled, though, I can finally take a step back and focus on myself. Of course, I'm still incredibly anxious about AP exams, but I've been overall less exhausted than I was while I was in school. Once AP exams are over I'm sure I'll feel a million times happier.\n\nMaybe in the future I'll look back and wish I could have experienced prom or graduation, but right now, I don't really care. Those things are fun but going to college matters more to me than anything else. I also struggled a lot with making friends in high school, and some of my closest friends were in the grade ahead of me and had already graduated. So it's not like I was missing out on much socially. I'm also so grateful to be out of the competitive atmosphere of some of my classes. From a personal standpoint, school getting cancelled is a dream come true. I can only hope college classes in the fall don't move online.",

Would have skipped graduation too but mom and dad would have been disappointed and I had to perform with the wind ensemble in the middle of the whole thing. Never really thought that getting your name called, walking across a stage, shaking a random school board member\u2019s hand, and being handed a piece of paper and a flower was that great of a recognition. I really only would have missed my final wind ensemble concert and clay target league season.

To start with, the catering was really bad, it was unseasoned chicken, box mashed potatoes, and the mushiest green beans I\u2019ve ever tried to eat. Someone tweeted a pic of the meal to Gordon Ramsey and he tweeted back \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the last dance... run now.\u201d Then everything goes fine for a while, people are mostly messing around playing arcade games and laser tag, which was actually kind of fun. Meanwhile there\u2019s a smaller group of people on the very dark dance floor set up by the bar. The venue had papered over the bar but that obviously didn\u2019t deter a group of students from sneaking in there and stealing the booze. So a bunch of people are getting drunk and doing Xanax and by 1 am this one kid was found passed out from the alc and Xanax and an ambulance was called to take him to the hospital. The dude was ok fortunately but we were banned from the venue. My high school was pretty boring otherwise. The school only planned a very bare bones prom in the gym the next year and still wanted to charge about $80 a head so I skipped it.",

I could care less about that piece of paper lmao; my time on stage would mean nothing to most of the families of the other 1,500 kids graduating. They\u2019d all just be wanting to go home after their kid walked. Senior activities? Sure, it\u2019s sad they are gone, but still don\u2019t see them as recognition. Plus, OP was pretty fair in referring to it as a \u201ctrade\u201d; he\u2019s still recognizing that he had to give something up. And as someone in the exact same boat as OP, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume he couldn\u2019t handle it, as that\u2019s something different than just being worn out. Although I was handling myself fine in 6 APs w/ leadership roles and a job, that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t feeling burnt out like OP is describing.",
