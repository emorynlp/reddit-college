  "text": "Hi, so I have a record on my disciplinary history and I asked my counselor about reporting it to colleges when prompted. She told me not to report it under any circumstances because the school does not report it. Am I truly okay to say I don\u2019t have anything? Could the schools i\u2019m applying to find out? I\u2019m just worried of saying I don\u2019t and then it somehow comes up and i\u2019m banned from applying afterwards for lying. Thank you for the help.",
