  "text": "So for the colleges I want, I've reached exactly their 75th percentile score. Almost all have the same score as 75th percentile somehow, so that helps streamline it, but my question is that once I reach these colleges 75th percentile is there any point in retaking for a higher SAT? Its going to take some time and work, and there's obviously no guarantee I'll get any better, but I could do it if it'll help. But would it help to beat some college's 75th percentile scores rather than be right on the 75th percentile?",
