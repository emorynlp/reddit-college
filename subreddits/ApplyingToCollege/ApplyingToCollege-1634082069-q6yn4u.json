  "text": "Hi,\n\nYou guys may have received emails from several different colleges. I did too.\n\nBut when y'all first received emails from top-tier colleges, did you feel excited? Like you know, the feeling you get when you *might* actually be a capable applicant? I know a lot of college emails are just informational flyers and whatnot, but maybe it's just me when I'm full of beans after receiving emails from Caltech and Cornell and UChicago and stuff.",

I like the feel and emotion behind physical mail.\n\nYes, this here postcard from UPenn was touched by human hands, and probably put into a letter by human hands.. etc. And I was at least somewhat selected for it. As opposed to robots spamming you every week with useless information. The postcards always feel more like a \"we care about you!\" than \"apply please please please\"",
