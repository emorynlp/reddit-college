  "text": "So I'm applying to UMich, and they require ALL materials to be sent by Nov. 1, including the counselor transcript. I asked my counselor last week, and she said counselors had a different deadline. But, for UMich they are adamant about receiving the materials, yet my counselor still has not started my school report on common app. I emailed her, but she hasn't responded, and I can't talk to her on monday because we have a day off. What happens if my counselor does not submit it on time? I really don't want my application be sent into RD.",
