Like \u201cwasting\u201d your life learning an instrument, singing, painting, writing, gardening etc... are all completely okay but writing intricate stories by being someone who runs a DnD club or playing competitive video games at an above average/pretty high level is laughable if you brought it up in an interview. The only reasons I can think of is because the first ones are more viable if you wanted to turn that hobby into a career (but the whole point of a hobby is often to just have fun with it and not feel the need to be good enough to make a career out of it) and that those are all you creating something (although something like reading or playing a sport aren\u2019t you creating anything and those aren\u2019t looked down on). The whole thing just seems weird to me, maybe it\u2019s just because older people are generally the ones controlling interview culture and many of them don\u2019t understand/like video games.",

When she was writing her practice college essay she mentioned that she felt her live was \"boring\" And when her dad and I talked about it, it kind of is. She hasnt had the trauma of losing one of us, having us separate and divorce. We live in a small city neighborhood. In a home that we have been in since before she was born. When her dad and I were growing up, we both survived the divorce of our respective parents. He moved around a lot. I had horses and competed- which was a whole other mess. I went to an aggie high school and dealt with everything that went along with that type of schooling. so much more trauma than she has had to deal with. Not that we shelter her, but she just hasn't had any upheaval in her life. Anything she's had to deal with has been second hand via her friends.",

It sounds kind of shitty but unless your life has been interesting in a positive way (massive volunteering project that paid off or something) it seems like a lot of times they just assume you\u2019re trying to get pity points and immediately kind of dislike your essay. Having an activity you like to do that colleges like is probably the safest way to go with your essay (honestly writing about her DnD experience might be good if she can tie it into how it\u2019s changed/improved her as a person as it\u2019s unique (although obviously I\u2019d talk to an admissions counselor or college counselor at your school about it). \n\nI wrote about my mom\u2019s cancer, she\u2019s fine now, but obviously that still had a large impact on my life (to say the least) from causing me to move schools which made my rank go from 11 out of 400 to 36 out of about 390 losing my guaranteed spot into the state school I wanted to go to (as the school had smarter people and their middle school had more opportunities to take high school classes which let them cut their worst high school subject grades), to having me work with a cancer organization called \u201cCamp Kesem\u201d, to obviously the emotional impact it had on me. At the end of the day it feels like I was probably at a disadvantage for writing about that experience because admissions people automatically thought I was farming pity points rather than trying to show my experience and how I evolved as a person from it. Obviously this is just my experience though and maybe I wrote my essay badly so take it with a decent amount of doubt and talk to your daughter\u2019s high school college counselor person about it before writing the real college essay though.",

But I found out that I'm pretty resilient and can stay calm primarily due to my food service job than the average guy, so thats different. Then I built on what my job taught me or how it benefited me and so on. \n\nYou don't have to be a top athlete, have a crazy story, or the smartest kid to be interesting, so don't be so hard on yourself.",

      "text": "Sit down and take out a clean sheet of paper and a pencil. At the top, write, \"The Ultimate Guide to Being Awesome\" or \"OUR Great Soviet Plan To Get Into College\" or something along those lines. Then make a bulleted list of 2-3 word phrases of things that interest you. Be honest with yourself and stick to as few words as possible. Whatever comes to mind right there in the moment. Even something as simple as \"likes dish soap\". When you feel as though you've fried your last brain cells, stop, get up, get some water, put your mask on, and go outside for 5 minutes. Do NOT re-enter the space until those 5 minutes have passed. Rinse and repeat as needed until you've covered the page. Could take a few attempts. Once you have that, start a new page, but this time, write \"Essay Ideas For University or College of Blah Blah Blah\". Stick to 4-5 word small phrases that describe items on the first list like \"can watch hockey all day\". Repeat 5 minute break process. Later on your brain will turn these into actual sentences that'll make the actual essays a breeze. \n\n\nI made the mistake of bullshitting schoolwork in high school, as did most of us. Writing 5 page reading responses during 30 minute lunch periods became a new normal. You do not know pain until you've been staring at a screen for 20 minutes and only have two semi coherent sentences. I did this whole shpeel all through community college and now into university. It made 7 page reading responses a walk in the park sophomore year. Applying for scholarships follows the same process. Really gets the juices flowing instead of forcing you to bang your head on the table for hours on end. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. :)",

Sometimes, it's the little things you don't even realize are particularly interesting and prompts you think would be a waste of time that lead you to the perfect essay. Like I thought the 2019/2020 prompt of \"what's something you lose all track of time doing\" was gonna be a dead end for me until I started doing the bullet points and settled on something that I would've entirely passed over otherwise.",

Another one of my friends wrote his essay about swallowing a bee while biking and he is at Georgetown now. Another one of my friend wrote about struggling to play jazz and is going to Yale. Another one of my friends wrote about puzzles and is going to Rice. The best advice I can offer is to write about something authentic. Do not stress about this! You got this! Good luck!!!",

Since you're very young, it's normal that you might not have committed to a clear goal.  But this just makes it an even greater opportunity to distinguish yourself from others who, like you, don't know specifically what contribution they want to make.  \n\nMost people write, \"Since I was very young, I have been interested in...\"  and this is shit.   \n\nBut if you are going to major in business and you have a goal to create a business where... let's say... struggling divorced dads can work together to make money to pay child support by doing something improve the environment... then it's specific enough to capture the reader and prove to the reader that you are one of those rare \"driven\" people.  \n\nNo life is uninteresting.  Uninteresting by what standard?  I have hands and feet.  What the hell is even going on here.  The trick to writing this essay is NOT to try to be more interesting than the next person.  It's to carve out a clear, specific goal.  \n\nIf you're going to major in English, and you have a goal to help resolve conflicts around the world by helping different groups study together, like Arabs and Jews, maybe.... that is specific enough to really inspire the reader.",
