  "text": "So I recently submitted my ED1 application to a uni and want to make some updates. Like I just got my research published in a decently reputed journal etc etc. So... How do I do that ? Like what should I email him exactly because I want to talk to him over the phone so that he remembers me vividly. I basically have a lot of questions to get him interested in me but I feel like I'm trying to catch a Pokemon or some shit that 1 wrong move and I'm doomed. Anybody with some experience pls give me all ur knowledge \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nAlso on a side note - should I tell him on call that if I get into that university I genuinely believe that I'd make a million dollars a year 2 years after graduating ? And the fact that I honestly consider it provides me better value than any ivy league except Columbia ? Maybe wont mention Columbia but just this thought in general, should I mention it or am I digging a grave ? \n\nThis post is weird because I'm anxious \ud83d\udc4d",
