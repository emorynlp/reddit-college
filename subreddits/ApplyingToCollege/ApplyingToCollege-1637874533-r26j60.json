  "text": "Title\u2026but also Happy Thanksgiving A2C! Super grateful for all of y\u2019all and thank you to everyone who takes time to respond to other posts, especially all the paranoid little questions I keep having for no reason at all. \n\nThat being said, what are you grateful for? What\u2019s something small that makes all the difference for you? \n\nI\u2019m currently drooling over my grandma\u2019s sweet potato casserole and absolutely cannot wait to have it for dinner :)\n\nEdit: We\u2019re back to green A2C!",
