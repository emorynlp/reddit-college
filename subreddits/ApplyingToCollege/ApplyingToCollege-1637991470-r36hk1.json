  "text": "hi!!! i\u2019m applying from community college to a university as a junior,, my cc counselor said having a high gpa is all i need (i have a 3.99) and extracurriculars or volunteer hours aren\u2019t needed at all since i\u2019m transitioning from community college but i don\u2019t know how much i believe that ???? i literally have 0 school involvement or volunteering and don\u2019t want this to hurt me in the process of applying. (Everything has been online bc Rona\ud83d\ude13) The only thing i have going for me is some really good letters of recommendations, and i\u2019ve won some competitive school awards for my major if that counts. However throughout almost all of school i\u2019ve always had a job. Has anyone already taken this path or have any advice SOS i\u2019m the first in my family to go to college so im very confused and lost in this whole process pls help",
