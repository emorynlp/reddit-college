  "text": " \n\nI  am not used to the US educational system. I wish to utilize the option  of Credit Transfer to Harvard Extension School but unable to get useful  help from their pre-degree advising. Their simple answer is to complete  the courses and come back to them to see if it will be accepted for  credit transfer or not.\n\nMy confusion is that most universities use 3-credit hours per course. For example, [SNHU's undergraduate courses here](https://www.snhu.edu/admission/academic-catalogs/coce-catalog?bc=true&bcCurrent=Applied%20Statistics&bcGroup=Mathematics&bcItemType=Courses#/courses) or [TESU's here](https://www.tesu.edu/academics/courses) are all 3 credit hours per course.\n\nWhereas all of the Harvard University courses are 4 credit hours per course.\n\nWhen  I try to enquire how shall the transfer process work, other university  advisors direct me to speak to the destination university advising, but  then HES advisor tells me to complete the courses and then apply to HES  for credit transfer to get an answer.\n\nCan someone kindly explain from their expereince how do the 3 credit-hour courses taken elsewhere transfer to Harvard?",

          "text": "Yes, it is for ALB and I have used the credit tranfer estimate tool. That simply returns whatever you enter in it. \n\nMy question is that why are most universities 3 credit hours per course and Harvard 4 hours per course?\n\nThis is causing me confusion as I do not know how the transfer would work. \n\nFor example, let's take Microeconomics course: [SNHU is 3 hrs](https://www.snhu.edu/admission/academic-catalogs/coce-catalog?bc=true&bcCurrent=Applied%20Statistics&bcGroup=Mathematics&bcItemType=Courses#/courses/4J9DhTSKe?bc=true&bcCurrent=Microeconomics&bcGroup=Economics&bcItemType=Courses), [TESU is 3 hrs](https://www2.tesu.edu/course.php?CourseCode=ECO-112&sem=), [CLEP is 3 hrs](https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-exams/principles-microeconomics), but [HES' is 4 hours](https://courses.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses?keyword=%20Microeconomic%20Theory). \n\nSo, if I take Microeconomics elsewhere to transfer into HES, would I get 3 hours credit or 4 hours? \n\nIf I get 3 hours credit, would my course then be incomplete and would I have to \"top-up\" Microeconomics at HES in some way, or (as I am planning) can I go to the upper level undergraduate economics courses?",

              "text": "So on the transfer credit website page there's a statement on there that says \"credits are adjusted as needed to align with Harvard semester system.\"\n\nBasically you can interpret, that if you take a three credit class or test and Harvard extension school is a four credit class that the three credit class would be accepted as the four credit.\n\nThere is a Harvard extension score group on Facebook that's public you might be able to ask.\n\nI will add that HES is unusually vague but since I'm not finding a lot of complaints about the system online that I would interpret that as credits transfer without much of a problem. People like to complain about situations when they're not fair and I didn't find any new stories about Harvard extension College being unfair. Just another perspective. Good luck!\n\nThere sub Reddit for the extension school: [HES](https://www.reddit.com/r/harvardextension/)",
