  "title:": "losing my shit rn \u2014 put the wrong # of hours for one of my activities",
  "text": "i submitted my app on nov 1, and for one of the activities, i accidentally entered the monthly total of hours rather than weekly. (the activity ran for a few months) meaning that the total number of hours is 4x what it actually is.\n\ni\u2019m planning on including this in a list of updates that i\u2019m sending \u2014 how exactly should i phrase it? should i basically just explain the error and apologise for the inconvenience? i\u2019ve been pacing around for around 30 minutes from sheer terror since this is my absolute dream school and i don\u2019t want them to think i\u2019m idiotic enough to make an error like that (although i suppose i am \ud83d\ude2d).\n\nany help at all would be hugely hugely appreciated \u2014 thank you so so much!!",

I wouldn't bother emailing them to correct this since it will probably backfire. They'll think you lied and you're just feeling guilty right now. In the future though, always double check. That's what pdf previews are for.",
