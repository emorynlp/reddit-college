  "text": "Hi All! \n\nAfter a gap year and realizing that I wanted to study something that isn't offered at my LAC, I am currently looking at options to transfer. I want to study linguistics and go to a school above 4000 kids. My list right now is NYU, Cornell, WashU, USC, and Northeastern. Any other suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Thanks!",

When I posted this I wasn't looking for a chance me, rather some other linguistics programs at mid-large size institutions that could round out my list. I think me posting stats would be counter productive for that purpose, but I am happy to hear what you'd consider some safety schools.",
