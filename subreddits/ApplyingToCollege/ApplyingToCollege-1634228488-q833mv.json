  "text": "Sorry in advance for mobile formatting\n\nI am transgender and currently going through the legal name change process, but that takes forever so I\u2019m applying under my deadname but also including my preferred name in the application.\n\nMy recommender raised a concern, should she write my letter of recommendation under my legal name, or write it under my preferred name. \n\nThanks y\u2019all in advance",

      "text": "Pick one and keep it consistent - this is the most important part. I had a similar experience because of immigration name changes, and there was a lot of back and forth to confirm my identity.\n\nThe best option is the one currently represented on your legal documents, since that raises fewer questions. I think there are usually sections to put down your preferred name in applications (and especially after acceptances), so hopefully the issue can be corrected in the future.",
