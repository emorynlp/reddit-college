  "text": "I already have two academic letters of rec, but I recently asked another teacher that i had sophomore year for one. I asked because I started a club with her as the advisor and she can speak on my leadership skills. I think it will probably be my strongest letter. Should I submit her letter as an additional rec to ivies/colleges?",
