  "text": "Applying to a bunch of t20s with a 3.7 UW and 4.4 W GPA and 1560 on the SAT. I have (I think) above average ecs and decent awards. \n\nI genuinely have no clue what to expect. Part of me is thinking that I have no shot at these top schools solely because of my GPA. But then, another part of me is like, but every other aspect of my app is pretty much on par with other t20 applicants.\n\nI've heard the same old \"you need to have great essays\" and \"upward trend\" talk. but other people in similar scenarios as me, how are you guys doing and what are you expecting?  \n\nnot too sure what flair this falls under\\*",

I'm just applying to a whole broad spectrum of schools from super selective to not at all selective schools just because I'm finding it hard to estimate what kind of schools I have a shot at. I consider my essays and ECs to be well above average. I'm a National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist so in the event I get rejected from all my reaches I'm hoping to be able to take a full-ride scholarship at UT Dallas (assuming I get Finalist status and accepted to UT Dallas. The odds are hugely in my favor for both but I'm one paranoid as hell individual).",

I know it sounds trite, but it\u2019s def the essays that will now help you get thru the subjective round by admission officials. Good luck!  You are worthy and competitive for T20. I\u2019m not saying that as a cheerleading parent, either. I\u2019ve seen it!",
