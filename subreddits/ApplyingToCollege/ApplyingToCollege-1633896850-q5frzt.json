  "title:": "Should I do the brown video portfolio?",
  "text": "If you were admitted to brown last year, did you do the video portfolio? I really want to go to brown but idk what to put on the video portfolio anyways. I have no footage of any events I went to and I don\u2019t really know what to say. I only have my phone camera too and no editing skills other than cutting and pasting clips. Like will my application be at a disadvantage if I don\u2019t do it or will they just consider my application based off my written essays and just treat it the same?",
