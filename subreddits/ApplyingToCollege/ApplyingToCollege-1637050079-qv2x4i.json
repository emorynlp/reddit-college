  "text": "I'm an Asian-American applicant currently residing outside the US. I'm going to need a ton of aid, and heard conflicting advise from diff people. I'm applying to private schools which are all need blind so that shouldn't affect me much and was also considering state schools such as UVA, Umich and UWashington-seattle. I know that the UC\u2019s provide no aid whatsoever to OOS, but would applying to these state schools be a waste of time since I need aid?",
