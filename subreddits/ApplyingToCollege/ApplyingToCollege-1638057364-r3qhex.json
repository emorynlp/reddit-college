  "text": "Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was wondering the best way to write about USAJMO on my UC application. I don't know if i can say top 500 out of 100,000+ AMC participants since people who take the AMC A/B usually have a lot of overlap. Or, is this award known by most AOs to the point where my description of it won't significantly change the outcome?  \n\n\nAlso does the order of awards/ECs matter on UC app? mine are like not in order at all :/",

      "text": "I\u2019d say AOs should be familiar enough with what USAJMO is that you can just put it down and they\u2019ll roughly understand the difficulty. You could paraphrase the aops description: \u201cParticipation in the USAJMO is by invitation only. The test is administered to approximately the top 250 student combined scorers on the AMC 10 and AIME\u201d \n\nI would order ECs/awards in order of importance, as you do on the Common App",
