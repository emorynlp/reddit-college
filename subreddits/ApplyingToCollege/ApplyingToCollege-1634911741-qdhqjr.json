  "text": "I recently got accepted to UA and the admission counselor said of notifying me about scholarships in the coming week. I seem to like their Physics department and also some of their connections with renowned labs are making me consider UA seriously. HOwever, I come from a low-income background with around 15K USD/year. So, I was just wondering how much merit scholarship they give to international students with a decent profile? I have 1520 in SAT, a perfect unweighted GPA, and national and international recognitions in the fields related to my major. What is the maximum amount of scholarship that I can possibly get from them?",
