  "text": "For context, I joined my high schools DECA club that started back up a few weeks ago. The leadership positions are all empty, so there are 9 empty slots and about 25 members. I\u2018ve only been to 2 meetings and have no leadership experience whatsoever. Do you guys think i should wait until next year or is it worth applying now?",

      "text": "Yes! Even if you get a lower leadership position, you can use those positions as leverage later on when you run for something higher like club president. Bonus points if you make some change or contribution to the club in your role, as this will help you build your case for president even more. \n\nPlus, there's literally nothing to lose by running",
