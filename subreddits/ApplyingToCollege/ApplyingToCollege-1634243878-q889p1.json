      "text": "From someone who was supposedly admitted to Northwestern:\n\n\u201cAs I sip a mug of hot chocolate on a dreary winter\u2019s day, I am already planning in my mind what I will do the next summer.  I briefly ponder the traditional routes, such as taking a job or spending most of the summer at the beach.  However, I know that I want to do something unique.  I am determined to even surpass my last summer, in which I spent one month with a host family in Egypt and twelve days at a leadership conference in New York City  The college courses I have taken at Oregon State University since the summer after 7th grade will no longer provide the kind of challenge I seek.\n\nSix months later, I step off the airplane to find myself surrounded by palm trees, with a view of the open-air airport.  I chuckle to myself about the added bonus of good weather, but I know I have come to Palo Alto, California, with a much higher purpose in mind.  I will spend six weeks here in my glory, not only studying and learning, but actually pursuing new knowledge to add to the repertoire of mankind.  Through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program, I will earn college credit by conducting original molecular biology research, writing my own research paper, and presenting my findings in a research symposium.\n\nI decided to spend my summer doing research because I knew that I liked scientific thought, and that I would passionately throw myself into any new challenge.  I always want to know more \u2013 to probe deeper into the laws of the universe, to explore the power and beauty of nature, to solve the most complicated problems.  I have an insatiable curiosity and a desire to delve deeper down in the recesses of my intellect.  At the Summer Research Program, I found out how much I enjoy thinking critically, solving problems, and applying my knowledge to the real world. \n\nWhile pursuing research in California, I was also able to meet many similarly motivated, interesting people from across the United States and abroad.  As I learned about their unique lifestyles, I also shared with them the diverse perspectives I have gained from my travel abroad and my Chinese cultural heritage.  I will never forget the invaluable opportunity I had to explore California along with these bright people.\n\nI could have easily chosen to spend that summer the traditional way; in fact, my parents even tried to persuade me into taking a break.  Instead, I chose to do molecular biology research at Stanford University.  I wanted to immerse myself in my passion for biology and dip into the infinitely rich possibilities of my mind.  This challenge was so rewarding to me, while at the same time I had the most fun of my life, because I was able to live with people who share the same kind of drive and passion as I do.\u201d",

This essay is better than average in the sense that it at least shows reasonable understanding of describing the author's motives and passions, if a bit (read: very) ham fisted. I've seen a lot of essays that don't really even get to that point, and they're kind of all over the place and messy. I'll be clear though - this wasn't much of a benefit to the applicant, at best it was quickly overlooked or they said something to the tune of \"wow, very motivated\". Whoever this was definitely got in *in spite* of the essay, likely with impressive research supplements. \n\nMuch better essays come along when you try not to write an advertisement for yourself, and make it an expression of who you are. That's someone that the readers can relate to, but is also a lot harder than formulaic writing about your achievements.",

And you know what? That's ok! For a highschooler that level of accomplishment, interest and commitment in a subject is outstanding, but don't oversell yourself! Be realistic. There's value in learning how to do research too, not just in doing groundbreaking research. After all, top colleges aren't looking for kids that have cured cancer, they're looking for kids that are  sufficiently motivated and intellectually driven to maybe one day in the future cure cancer. Not to mention that this mentality is also so much more healthy than the previous overachiever one.",

      "text": "#The Sirens' Call of Accepted Essays\n\n>\"First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near them. Pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\"  - Homer\n\nThere's something intoxicating about essays that worked.  *If I just read enough of these, I'll figure out how to find the magic 650 words that gets me in!*  Part of this allure comes from the way education works - students are trained to learn by looking at examples.  Part of it stems from the mystique that surrounds admissions - since students know so little about how applications are reviewed and evaluated, they default to gobbling up whatever crumbs they can find, even if it's just a post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc generalization.  \n\nBut therein lies the danger.  Admission is holistic, and many applicants will get in *in spite* of their essay rather than because of it.  Many essays that worked [just aren't very good](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8pl29m/most_applications_are_not_very_good/), and this has been corroborated on A2C by a former AO at a T5, a former reviewer at UT Austin, and a Stanford interviewer.  /u/AdmissionsMom says to [\"avoid accepted essays like hot lava,\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i6kidu/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_yes_you/) and her own daughter was admitted in spite of a poor essay:\n\n>\"She was accepted to every school she applied to with the exception of Princeton, and she attended Harvard. I think we all just assumed her personal essay helped her with admissions because she wasn't the strongest student in her school when it came to doing homework or daily assignments. But when she used the FERPA rule to review her application later during her sophomore year, she discovered that she'd been admitted despite the fact that they hated her essay. They called it \"over-blown\" \"full of itself\" and \"way too self-important.\"\n\n#A Case Study\n\nAllow me to tie you to the mast that you may hear the Sirens' call.  Below is an essay that worked which I found openly published on the internet.  This student was admitted to Yale, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell, and Brown.  It's probably amazing and a perfect example to mimic right?  Buckle in.\n\n>The first time that I attended a water ballet performance, I experienced a synesthesia of sorts as I watched the swan-like movements of the swimmers unfold with the cadence and magic of lyrical poetry, the precisely executed sequences melding with the musical accompaniment to create an ethereal beauty that I had never imagined possible. \u201cYou belong out there, creating that elegance with them,\u201d I heard the quiet but powerful voice of my intuition tell me. For the next six years, I heeded its advice, training rigorously to master the athletic and artistic underpinnings of synchronized swimming.  \n\n>I flailed and plunged with all the grace of an elephant seal during my first few weeks of training. I was quickly and thoroughly disabused of the notion that the poise and control that I so coveted would be easy to obtain. During the first phase of my training, I spent as much time out of the water as in it, occupying myself with Pilates, weight training, and gymnastics in order to build my strength and flexibility. I learned things about the sport that outsiders seldom realize: that performers aren\u2019t allowed to touch the bottom of the pool, relying on an \u201ceggbeater\u201d technique also used by water polo players to stay afloat; that collisions and concussions are all too common; that sometimes the routine demands staying underwater for so long that the lungs burn and the vision becomes hazy. My initial intervals in the water were marked by a floundering feeling that seemed diametrically opposed to the grace that I sought. I began to question whether I was really cut out for the sport.  \n\n>I persisted through all of this and slowly but certainly I saw myself progress. My back tucks became tight and fluid, my oyster maneuvers controlled and rhythmical, my water wheels feeling so natural that I could have executed them in my sleep. Moreover, I became comfortable enough with my own role in the water that I was able to expand my awareness to the other members of my team, moving not just synchronistically, but also synergistically. During one of my first major performances, our routine culminated as I launched myself out of the water in a powerful boost, surging upward on the swelling currents of the symphonic accompaniment. I owned the elegant arc that I cut through air and water, my teammates and I executing the leap with the majestic effortlessness of a pod of dolphins frolicking in the sea. I reveled in the thunderous applause at the conclusion of our routine, for it meant that I had helped to create the kind of exquisite beauty that I had so admired years before.  \n\n>Though I never would have guessed this at the outset of my training, synchronized swimming has provided one of the central metaphors of my life. The first and most fundamental lesson that I learned was persistence, which I absorbed humbly and viscerally by way of aching muscles and chlorine-stung eyes. More subtly and powerfully, the sport also lent me an instinctive appreciation of the way that many parts interact to form an emergent whole, an understanding which I have applied to every area of my studies, from mechanical systems to biological networks to artistic design. I have become cognizant of the fact that, as when I am in the water, my own perception of myself is narrow and incomplete, that to really understand my role in life I need to see myself in terms of my interactions with those around me. Six years after my training began, I still pursue the sense of harmony and unity that synchronized swimming has instilled in me, riding the soft swells of destiny forward as I move on to the next phase of my life.",

          "text": "#Breaking The Sirens' Enchantment\n\nThis essay is simply not very good.  I would charitably give it like a 3 out of 10 for the schools she's applying to. It does a ton of things wrong and I would guess there was something really special about this applicant in the other sections of her application because she was admitted in spite of this essay, not because of it. Without getting into too much detail, here's a review of the shortcomings:\n\n**1)  Content, topic, and theme** - *How good is the actual content? Is it unique? Does it say a lot about you? Does the essay show depth of thought, intellectual vitality, initiative, originality, etc?  Does it fit the prompt well enough, or does it feel like it was written for something else and shoehorned in?*\n\nThe content here is merely ok.  Essays about synchronized swimming aren't especially common, but essays about sports certainly are, and this one doesn't do enough to distinguish itself.  Sports can be fine if you're a recruited athlete, which she may well have been. Otherwise, it should be approached with caution because it's SO hard to stand out from the stack with yet another sports essay. If she wanted to go with this, I would have encouraged her to make it a persistence essay or self-actualization essay that happens to also mention synchronized swimming.  To make matters worse, she uses a common topic to make common and predictable points about herself. Oh really, her hard work at something new and uncomfortable taught her the value of pErSiStEnCe?  *genewilder.jpg* \n\nIf you MUST use a common topic, then at least say something unpredictable, interesting, imaginative, or important about yourself with it.  The story arc is also lame and predictable. She was intrigued by something and tried it, she was bad at it, she worked hard, she got gud, she learned to be persistent. Anyone would see that coming a mile away.\n\nThere's only a little curiosity, love of learning, or penchant for exploration shown here and it's done in a rather direct and predictable way.  The only initiative shown is picking a sport and sticking with it - a trait shared with perhaps half of all students nationally.  The prompt doesn't much matter in this case since this essay could fit into several Common App prompt options.\n\n**2)  Style and Structure** - *Is the essay easy to read, authentic, creative, compelling, and engaging?  Is the style consistent throughout the essay and is it consistent with the rest of the application? Is the essay organized well? Does it communicate clearly?  Does it flow smoothly?*\n\nMeh.  This essay reads like it was written to \"sound good\" rather than to actually communicate something important and personally insightful.  It flows just fine, but I feel like it's a lazy river loop that doesn't go anywhere important rather than a waterfall culminating in a compelling personal revelation.  She makes the actual insights an afterthought in the essay. Seriously just one of her four paragraphs shares meaningful information about who she is and what matters to her and those are trite and predictable.\n\nThe descriptive and flowery details are meaningless and add almost nothing to the story. The reviewer is not reading to be entertained; they're reading to understand the applicant. The adjective vomit in that third paragraph says almost nothing about her as a person, only that she achieved her goal of becoming a competent synchronized swimmer (a point which should already be clear in her activities section and is therefore redundant). Use details and descriptions, but make them say something about you.  Don't try to be sensory and immersive for its own sake. One example of this that works is the aching muscles and chlorine-stung eyes - they show her dedication, commitment, and persistence. More of that and less \"swelling currents of the symphonic accompaniment\" please.\n\n**3)  Impression** - *What does the essay say about you? What will a reviewer likely think of you after reading it?  Is it compelling and gripping?*\n\nThere are precious few important messages shared in the first three paragraphs, and there isn't much to convince the reviewer that this will be worth reading or will meaningfully impact how they see this student.  The conclusion is full of meaningless cliches, sweeping generalizations, and worthless imagery. Say something important, don't wax eloquent about the \"soft swells of destiny.\" This isn't a Hallmark greeting card; it's the very essence of who you are. Share your core values, personal strengths, foundational beliefs, motivations, aspirations, and character traits, not that you, like every other 17 year old in existence, are looking forward to the next phase of your life.  I don't see much in here that shows what she will bring to a campus community or how she will benefit from the experience.\n\n**4)  Diction, grammar, and syntax** - *Are there errors or omissions, poor or clunky word choices, issues with word count, etc.*\n\nShe uses way too many big words and tries way too hard to sound smart. In most cases, that's not a good look. Sincerity is more valuable because your SAT and GPA will already show how smart you are. Usually this is off-putting and detrimental.  Also, the essay clocks in at 624 words, which leaves 26 on the table that could have been used to say something meaningful.  The grammar and syntax are great, so there aren't any other issues in this category.\n\n#Takeaways\n\n**1.  Stop reading essays that worked.**  What worked for them will almost certainly not work for you.  If you try to imitate them, you will present yourself as a cheap knockoff of something that might not have even been very good to begin with.  \n\n**2.  Start with introspection, not emulation.**  You need to dig deep and figure out two things before you start writing your essay.  First, what are you going to say about yourself?  What key insights, core values, foundational beliefs, personal strengths, motivations, aspirations, etc will you showcase?  And second, what stories, examples, anecdotes, quotes, or other support will you use to make those points indirectly in your essay?  How will you make these messages compelling?  If that sounds difficult, it's because it is.  [This post about the introspection and brainstorming process might help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i6kn6o/it_all_started_with_essay_topics_heres_how_to/)  \n\n**3.  Be Yourself.**  You aren't going to get in by being anyone other than who you are.  That might feel depressing because you know your own shortcomings better than anyone, but if you present the very best you have to offer, you can still stand out.",
