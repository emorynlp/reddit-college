  "text": "Hello, I've recently been applying to colleges though this FAFSA thing is getting stressful and no one has given me a straight answer. I figured I'd try here. So I would like to apply to more than 10 colleges. I've already applied to 10 and have those 10 listed on my FAFSA. Couldn't I just wait until my colleges accept or deny me and then list those colleges that accept me on the FAFSA and replace the denied ones with new colleges? I just don't understand. There's only 13 colleges I want to apply to, Could I apply to all 13 and them list the accepted ones on the FASFA after I get the decisions?",
