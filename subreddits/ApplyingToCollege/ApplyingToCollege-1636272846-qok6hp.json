          "text": "Honestly I really want the workload. I want to just learn as much as I can and they have all the resources to do so. They\u2019re cs program is super theoretical, which I love. The research opportunities are to die for. They have some cool things I think would be fun too. Like there\u2019s a student-run consulting group that\u2019s actually really active with social change/policy initiatives. They also have this huge nerf battle, and what better reason to take out student loans than that?\n\nI think why this sub is attracted to the school is that it appears to be an easier path to a crazily-high ranked school. UChicago is arguably T7, but if you ask any non-college obsessed human, they might even think it\u2019s a state school. So people get mislead into thinking that it\u2019s not as competitive as other T10s.\n\nA huge thing to most people is the way UChicago\u2019s degrees work. You\u2019re not going to get capped out of a certain major. Though this is the same for some Ivies and other top schools, at UC Hicago deciding your major is super super lax. I\u2019m pretty set on what I want to study, but if I get into a school like UT for my major, there\u2019s no option to switch.\n\nI think the last reason why it\u2019s a lot of people\u2019s top choice is the try-hard marketing sending a fake message (this may not apply to people on this sub since we\u2019re aware, but on the outside it\u2019s true). The school comes across as very quirky, leading to all the weird high schoolers out there thinking it\u2019s the only place they\u2019ll fit in. Whether it be UChicago\u2019s application, \u201cHarry Potter houses,\u201d a bOoK oF LifE marketing pamphlet, or providing of a major literally named big problems, they just make everything seem revolutionary.",

I\u2019d much rather just finally make some friends who are solid, and study/eat with them. It is terrible though for most people. A lot only attend since it\u2019s the highest ranked school they got into, and then are surprised when it\u2019s not the vandy experience. It sucks that they\u2019ll be miserable for so long, but if you only go off of rankings and what a school puts on their admissions website then you\u2019re kind of setting yourself up.\n\nThe grade deflation isn\u2019t too much of a problem though because everyone recognizes how shitty it is. It\u2019s super common knowledge amongst companies that a UChicago gpa should be boosted before it\u2019s compared with other applicants\u2019. A YouTuber (she\u2019s like one of the generic \u201chow to get into college\u201d ones) who went to UChicago said that job interviewers told her they normally do a 0.2-0.4 boost.",
