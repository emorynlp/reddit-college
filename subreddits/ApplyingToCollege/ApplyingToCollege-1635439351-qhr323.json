  "text": "I've played soccer competitively since I was ten, but for a bunch of different reasons I will not be playing varsity soccer in college but hopefully club or intramural. Anyways, right now I am the captain of the varsity soccer team, I played for Delaware odp( state team for Delaware), and played for a club team in high school. Soccer is important to me, but since im not applying to be a varsity athlete where should I put them in my activities list? I also have exactly 10 ecs and my counselor said i should put them lower and put my math and volunteer stuff higher. Thoughts?",

So unless you were able to gain acknowledgment of your abilities, I would not just put you played soccer as an ECx3 especially if you have other ECs to mention.",
