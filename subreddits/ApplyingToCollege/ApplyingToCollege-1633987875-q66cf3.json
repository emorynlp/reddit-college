  "text": "Guys idk what\u2019s up with me. I was SO excited for college and all that LAST year. Like when I was a junior. I made a common app as soon as I could and was very active on a2c (on an old acc) but idk this year I\u2019m just\u2026 not into it. Like my fighting spirit died. \n\nI just have no goals nor aspirations, I\u2019m not looking forward to it anymore. I wish I was just going to the next grade or this process was automatic cause I don\u2019t want to do it. Any of it. I\u2019m just so tired.\n\nI wish I wasn\u2019t and I still had that spirit from last year but \u2026 idk. I\u2019m just not into it anymore\u2026 I really need to get into it.",

It\u2019s just a lot. \n\nI suggest you take a break. Leave college apps alone for a few days. Then come back and get a couple of your ea apps done and then take a break again. \n\nLook for colleges that don\u2019t have an insane number of supplements. Look for colleges that respect your time and mental and emotional health by streamlining their application process \u2014 not the colleges that seem to delight in making it more and more complicated",

Apply to your state flagship, don't apply to any honors programs, don't apply to any scholarships that require a separate application or essays.  If your state flagship isn't a safety for you, then keep going down the in-state options until you find one that is.\n\nIf you want some OOS options, stick to schools that don't require supplemental essays and/or interviews.",
