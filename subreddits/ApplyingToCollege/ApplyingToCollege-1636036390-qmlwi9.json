  "text": "Hello, I already have submitted my early application, but something that I have been wondering if, how the universities know the number of APs offered at my school...\n\nI only took AP Calc because that was the only AP offered (Canadian school). I am not sure where it would be included in my application... I also doubt that my counselor have included that into her note, as I am like the only person applying to American univerities.\n\nIf I was supposed to mention it in my application, should I email the university?",
