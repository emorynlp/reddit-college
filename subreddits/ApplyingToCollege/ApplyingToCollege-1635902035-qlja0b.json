  "text": "I'm transferring from community college (California) to a University in fall 2022. Most likely a UC system school (Cal) but I'm trying for some top-tier schools as well.\n\nmy counselor told me that the schools don't want to see a part-time schedule in the spring before you transfer, they want to see you doing full time....\n\nY'all i've worked my @$$ off. i've NEVER had a regular 12 unit semester until this semester, I took 13 units and 5 classes over the summer, i'm nuts. but i'm nuts with a 4.0 and got 55 units in 1.5 years so :DI want to be able to take like... 7 units in spring (maybe even 4 cuz i can knock out a class in winter intersession...)... because I can. i'll have 55 units by the end of this semester and have all my transfer requirements done after my 7 units in spring. i need the time to make money, i'm not rich i'm on a pell grant, and for all i know, i get into a bad@$$ school and will have to move across the country this summer. i also need the break because i'm burnt out and i'm an oldie in my 30s with mental health problems and school is hard.\n\nplease just tell me i can take 4-7 units this spring. but i will do 12 if it affects my applications...i'm applying to like ivy leagues...but i'm a nontraditional student and they will know that...",
