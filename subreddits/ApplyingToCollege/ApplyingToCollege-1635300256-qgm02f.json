  "text": "My SAT essay score is not great. I've taken the SAT 3 times, and am going to super score two of my scores, neither of which are the SAT dates where I took the essay. On the common app there's a question that asks \"have you taken the SAT essay?\" and if I click yes, it prompts me to put in my essay score. If I don't plan on submitting that SAT date, is it okay if I put no?",
