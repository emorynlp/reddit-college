  "title:": "Procrastinated on my common app and now extremely regret it. Worried I will not make RD deadlines. Help!!",
  "text": "Disclaimer: I understand that this is all of my own making, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n\nI already have a clear list of what colleges I am applying to, and I've already taken in-person/virtual tours and had meetings with the admissions counselors and all.\n\nHowever, I screwed up in the crappiest way possible... I procrastinated on the actual common app itself.\n\nNow it is Thanksgiving weekend, and Regular Decision deadlines are just over a month away (and my original plan was to have them done before the holidays!)\n\nI already filled out the basics of the common app and asked for my rec letters. However, my college essay is trash and my advisor told me that it needs to be majorly restructured. I have not done even a single supplemental yet. I haven't applied for any scholarships nor done my FAFSA nor CSS profile.\n\nTo make matters worse, I also have ADHD, which makes me \"time-blind\" and makes it hard for me to stay organized and prioritize tasks (like essentially I could think that Youtube is more important than the next four years of my life, depending on my mood at the moment).\n\nSounds like a total freakin' disaster, I know.\n\nI know I could always go for a gap year and try again next year, but I don't want to do that. I love learning and I intended to go straight to college from high school ( I already know what I want to do, which is civil engineering). \n\nI know this sub is so on top of the application process, so I want to ask for advice, especially from u/CollegeWithMattie if he is lurking around here somewhere.\n\n How do I go about the last month before applications are due? Is this still doable or should I be considering gap year options at this point? Am I really ready for college if I procrastinated on something like this? \n\nI apologize in advance if I sound like I am overthinking or just rambling, I am just so overwhelmed right now and pissed at myself.",

Fin aid deadlines are way after RD deadlines, so no use in stressing about those.   \nJust try get the personal statement done, and then you can tackle the supps which shouldn't take all too long.",

              "text": "Depends. The more time you give yourself, the less productive you'll be. It took me about 3 drafts and a total of 2 or so months to finish my supps for the one university, but they sucked, while I churned out 500-1000 word supps for another uni in a handful of hours over a period of 1-2 days and they were comparably better, but by no means necessarily good.\n\nI imagine you might have some difficulty sustaining focus for extended periods of time, so sorry if it perhaps doesn't quite work for you, but just dedicating a couple of hours for it, ridding yourself of distractions, should be sufficient. Just depends on how clear of a message you have in your head that you want to convey.",

      "text": "Do the FAFSA first, then the common app essay. The Fafsa can be done in a couple hours, but have your parents nearby to help you figure out the taxes part of it. This is the most time sensitive thing you\u2019ve mentioned. For the essay, spend about 2-3 weeks on it. \n\nThe first week, nail down the topic and create a detailed outline, this will make things 100% easier. This is stuff like what story are you trying to tell? Are you writing about a challenging part of your life and how you learned and grew from it and became a better person/student/athlete, etc? What do you think your admissions officer is going to remember about you? If your AO was to give you a nickname, what would it be? Does it match what you\u2019re trying to get across? Really ruminate about what you want them to take away from your essay. \n\nSecond week, actually write the essay. Don\u2019t pay attention to word count just yet. Look at your outline and just flesh out the ideas you already figured out. Then when you\u2019re done writing and making sure everything is good, look at the word count and start editing to fit it. Try to make sure each paragraph flows from one to the next. Print it out and hand them to teachers, and ask them to read it once without editing and then write down three words to describe the person the essay is about (again, double check you\u2019re getting across the message you want to send to schools). Third week, if they have the time and you have the time, ask them to look it over and give you some last minute feedback to make sure it\u2019s everything it can be. \n\nThe supplements will be the tricky part but you said you have 3-4 so that\u2019s doable. Start on your target/safety schools first. The ones you truly see yourself realistically attending. Reach schools are the things of dreams, but you can\u2019t afford to spend all your time on schools where admissions requires a shit ton of luck as well as finesse and expert planning. Don\u2019t fumble the bag. You need to make sure they know you want to go there (even if you\u2019re not 100% sure) so that you lessen the chance of them yield protecting you, if your gpa and test scores are decently above their median. So spend the majority of your time on target/safety supplements and maybe one or two reach schools. And then if you have the time, go hard on other reach school supplements. \n\nFeel free to take my advice or leave it, I am not a college admissions expert but I am an ADHD procrastinator so I know how it feels to be in your shoes. That being said, when you get to college make sure to get accommodations. Getting accommodations at the college level changed my life this semester, and I am not exaggerating. Last year as a freshman I had about a 3.65 gpa and now I have an actual shot at getting a 4.0. Being fully online last year did really hurt, as well as the learning curve from hs to college so the gpa change isn\u2019t just impacted by accommodations but I don\u2019t think I could get a 4.0 with 16 credits without them.",
