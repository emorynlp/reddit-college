      "text": "Score ranges for class of 2025 are skewed high due to test optional policies, so that data is not terribly useful for this decision. As far as I can tell, the class profile for 2025 is the only place to see an SAT composite range.\n\nRice appears to have gotten rid of their Common Data Sets and now displays data in Tableau. Unfortunately, Rice does not seem to provide an SAT composite range there. For class of 2023, the range was 1470-1560, according to an old spreadsheet I happen to have.\n\nAs the bot says, consider the breakdown of your scores and where those fall (class of 2024 ebrw 710-770 and math 750-800).\n\nAlso consider your grades. If you have fantastic grades, perhaps the 1470 isn't adding value.\n\nMy personal inclination would be to submit a 1470, depending on the breakdown, but other people would probably disagree.",

But I do want to say that a 1470 is still very good and you should be proud. Average test scores at colleges are just inflated right now because of test optional policies.",
