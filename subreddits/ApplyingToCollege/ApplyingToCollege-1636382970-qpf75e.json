  "text": "So I applied early action to UT Austin. Their document deadline is today. But my sat score hasn't reached them even though I sent it on 26 oct and other uni did receive it. They received transcript through my counselor but still evaluating it.\n\nWould I still be considered for priority or they will push me to regular",

      "text": "They don\u2019t have early action. So even if you get pushed to the December deadline it doesn\u2019t matter much \u2014 unless you\u2019re applying for some honors programs.  All their deadlines mean is you can hear back earlier. \n\nThey also are test optional. Did you send them a copy of your test scores? I\u2019d upload a pdf and say that you requested them to be officially submitted from college board on October 26. If you have a copy of that I\u2019d upload that too. \n\nThen that\u2019s the best you can do. \n\nOr you can ask to be evaluated without scores.",
