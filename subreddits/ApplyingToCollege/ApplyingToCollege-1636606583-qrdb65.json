      "text": "If you were already planning on dropping the courses then understandable, but dropping a language and a core class just to work a job in high school isn't worth it at all. If it shows up on your transcript, it shows colleges a massive drop in rigor, which could be detrimental to your admissions decision.",

          "text": "Oh I didn't know that. But the high school consuler said that it was worth its since I already have more than enough credits for both things. Also, the rest of my classes, 5, of them are APs so it's not that big of a drop I hope",

              "text": "I wouldn't worry about it too much, it does no good to stress over what's already been done. You're like what, a junior? You still have time and 5 APs at once is more than enough. Maybe taking time to build job experience is a good thing especially if you don't have job experience. But in my experience as a senior who's dropping AP Psych (an elective) I've been told  by college advisors that dropping could be detrimental to my admissions decisions.",
