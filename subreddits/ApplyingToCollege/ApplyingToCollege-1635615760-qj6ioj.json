      "text": "Yes, it may be too good to be true. Depends on the college. FAFSA is just one *form* that colleges use to calculate need. Many colleges that offer generous need-based aid also require the CSS Profile, and income/assets of a noncustodial parent.\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. \n\nSometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask for all the info (such as noncustodial parent income and assets) included in their need calculation. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.",
