  "text": "I've taken a college class during the summer after 9th grade, another one during the summer after 10th grade, and two more during the summer after 11th grade. According to the UC admissions website ([https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html)), classes taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade, and classes in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade. However, when I try to put in both summers as 10th grade on the UC app, I'm getting an error. Does anyone know what I should do?",
