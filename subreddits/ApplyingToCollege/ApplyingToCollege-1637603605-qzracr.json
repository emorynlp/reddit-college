My internships were unpaid and the experience ec category says \u201cpaid work experiences\u201d so what should I put for internships?

However, if you have worked professionally in an area related to your major, it is internship. Admissions committee will not weigh a job / EC, by money earned from it. AFAIK, they will weigh it terms of relevance to academics.",
