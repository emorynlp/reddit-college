  "title:": "Need a recommendation by Nov. 1st -- drop ED school?",
  "text": "I wasn't able to find a suitable 2nd teacher recommender in time for Nov. 1st (it's a long story that I won't get into detail about), so I'm currently down to two teachers I could potentially ask for that -- my current (senior year) AP Lit teacher, or an independent research science advisor (worked with me all of junior year as an academic advisor, but I didn't have a \"class\" with him until this year). \n\nIs it worth sending an email to both of them and reaching out to see if they can write me an LoR in time, or should I withdraw my ED1 application and just ask them to write me an LoR for January? Or should I ask them if they can write one for Nov. 1, and just say if they can't, I would like them to write one for Jan. 1? Thanks, just really stressed :,)",
