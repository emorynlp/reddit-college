      "text": "Do you want to be right in the middle of a big city, with lots of shops, restaurants, and things to do nearby? Here's some schools to look into. They vary greatly in weather, size, selectivity, etc, so do your research on them. Best of luck. :)\n\n*Washington, DC:* **GWU, Georgetown, Howard** (HBCU) are right in the middle of the city. | **American U** is in a sort of residential neighborhood, but it's like 5 minutes away from everything; the city is easily accessible.\n\n*Boston:* **Northeastern, Boston University, Harvard, MIT, Simmons, Emerson** are all in urban locations of Boston and/or Cambridge. | **Boston College & Tufts** are in more suburban areas but the city is easily accessible.\n\n*Philly:* **Temple, UPenn, Drexel** are in urban locations of Philly. | **Swarthmore, Villanova, Haverford, Bryn Mawr** are in suburban areas but are accessible to Philly with varying levels of easiness.\n\n*NYC:* **Fordham, NYU, Columbia, Barnard, Yeshiva, Stevens,** and **Baruch** are in urban locations of NYC/close NJ.\n\n\\-----\n\nAnd there's more than 4,000 colleges in the USA, so I don't want to see any replies from other people like \"you forgot X university.\" I didn't forget any; I just named schools that I thought were relevant. Go comment the school yourself under your own comment if it's such a good school. (rant is over.)\n\n\\-----\n\nThen there's Chicago, Pittsburgh, LA, San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, etc. I'm too lazy to do more typing but you can go on Google Maps and explore for yourself.\n\nBest of luck! :)",
