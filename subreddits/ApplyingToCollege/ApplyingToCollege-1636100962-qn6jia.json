  "title:": "Fall 2023 Test-blindness for US Universities... rumors??",
  "text": "Hi all...\n\nI'm a Canadian student in gr 11, who will be entering university in Fall 2023, thinking of applying to US universities. I have a couple \"full-ride\" scholarships, should-be--good grades in the IB program, and a few good extracurriculars/internships/orgs etc... the scholarships are the only reason I'm applying - I wouldn't have enough money to go to the us without them.\n\nThe big question mark now is the ACT / SAT requirements. I have an ACT test booked in December and in April. I have barely spent any time practicing so far as I'm really overwhelmed with personal matters / schoolwork. I took a single practice test without any preparation and got barely 32, which  is low enough to hurt my applications for some/most unis. My main priorities right now just getting good scores at school, as some unis I'm thinking of applying to have already announced they are test-free which relieves some pressure, as well as Canadian universities which are just as awesome anyways.\n\nWhat I was wondering was if anyone much more involved in the uni admissions.. space? Has any vague idea of what most American universities are thinking of in terms of test blindness for 2023 due to COVID-19 reasons. Pretty much all the universities I'm thinking of have cancelled them for 2021-2022, but have not announced 2023. Caltech and Cornell stand out as the two who ARE test blind / not using tests in 2023, as well as the California public universities and a few others.\n\nI was wondering if  there are any rumors on what universities like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc... are planning on doing, and more importantly, when are they expected to announce their plans? I assume somewhat soon as lots of kids in my grade are probably trying to figure out the whole ACT/SAT mess right now.\n\nThank you so much, and sorry if this post is dripping with naivite!",

      "text": "I wouldn't reply on any rumors because they often tend to be false... Besides the schools you've listed, I don't think any others are going test blind as of now... In fact, the opposite might happen next year - many schools may stop being test optional if the tests are not being cancelled anymore due to the pandemic.",
