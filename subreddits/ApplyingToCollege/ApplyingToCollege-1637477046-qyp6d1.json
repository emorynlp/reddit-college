  "text": "My school (in N.Y) is offering college courses that would provide us an associates in liberal arts. Credits will be from Mercy College and it will be taken junior and senior year. I was assured I wanted to take them but not I\u2019m rethinking it as\u2014\n\n1) I want a freshman experience I do not want to start as a junior in college. I feel like I won\u2019t be able to network and connect as well and be jumped into college with people older than me all around that I won\u2019t be able to reach out to.\n\n2) I\u2019m interested in Communications/Journalism and aiming for Syracuse, mFordham, Northwestern, N.Y.U, Columbia, a SUNY that specialized best in that. Private universities are less likely to accept dual enrollment from what I understand and I\u2019m aiming to go to a private university. \n\n3) My Principal said she\u2019s trying to get a more prestigious university to take college courses from and she\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019ll be on a college campus taught by actual professors. My school is in a small low-income neighborhood as well that tends to be disorganized so I\u2019m not getting the certainty I want from these potential college courses.\n\nAre these not valid reason or should I think more about my decision to leave?",

      "text": "If your high school offers an AP class in the subject, consider that instead of dual enrollment. AP credit policies are published on each college's website, so you can know before you even take the test whether credit is possible and at what score.\n\nOne downside of dual enrollment is that they are college grades. College grades are forever, that is, many grad school programs include dual enrollment grades when they calculate your college GPA.\n\nFour year schools don't care about the associates \"degree.\" The courses do add rigor to your transcript, which can be helpful for selective college admissions.\n\nIf the courses do transfer - which will be determined course by course - you can still choose not to graduate college early, but take additional courses at college to explore whatever you want. This flexibility can be a great thing.\n\n(Personally, I think that some high schools use dual enrollment for financial reasons, as often the cost is paid by the district or state rather than the high school.)",
