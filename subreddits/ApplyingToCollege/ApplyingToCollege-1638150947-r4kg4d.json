  "title:": "Will a 32 ACT hurt my chances?",
  "text": "For context, I am an Asian male from a higher middle-income household. I have a 4.0 UW/4.63 W GPA at the end of Junior Year. In my opinion, I think I have strong extracurriculars with lots of research, science fair awards, and activities related to my passion. I plan to major in Electrical Engineering and have done well in most of the AP STEM courses recommended and got 4-5s on the 2021 exams. The last time I took the ACT was in April (Heard it had a bad curve but idk).\n\nI applied to the following schools:\n\n1. Case Western\n2. Georgia Tech\n3. NC State\n4. Northwestern\n5. Rice\n6. Stanford\n7. UIUC\n8. Umich\n\nI know my ACT is on the lower end of the spectrum. However, based on my background and other application materials, am I really screwed?",

I recommend you add a few more colleges to your list where (with your academic record) you\u2019ll be a strong candidate for admission and merit scholarships. Think about applying to a few colleges that admit 50%+ of their applicants.",
