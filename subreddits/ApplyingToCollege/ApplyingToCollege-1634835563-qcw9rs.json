  "text": "I still haven't sent my SAT scores to most of the schools I'm applying to. What if they don't receive my scores before Nov 1? Am I supposed to send my scores before or after I apply? I am self-reporting in common app but I haven't applied to any schools with common app yet. I am very confused.",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. \n\nHowever, other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - these colleges will not accept scores self-reported in the app.",
