  "text": "i think my parents can afford app fees but, you know, the cumulative cost is way too much. I would want to  relieve a tiny bit of burden off my parents so I was wondering whether I should email a few unis for a fee waiver.\n\nwill this negatively affect me in any way? should I ask my reaches or targets or safeties? and any tips about how to ask for it?\n\nI would appreciate any input on this, thank you :)",
