  "text": "Take a look at this\n\n[https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/international-applicants/exams-visas](https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/international-applicants/exams-visas)\n\nit states:\n\n\"Exceptions: You can be exempted from taking any of these exams if your  SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing score is 650 or above (600 or  above if presenting an old SAT critical reading score), or if both your ACT Reading and English scores are 27 or above, and if you have recently  completed at least four\u00a0years of rigorous academic study in any of the  following countries: it then goes on to list English speaking countries including US\"\n\nDo you need to both complete 4 years in those countries and get higher than 650, or is just the SAT enough? I know I can email admissions but they take 5 days to respond, and if you need both I'll need to take Duolingo ASAP.",
