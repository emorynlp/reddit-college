  "text": "I'm applying to Digital Media Design (DMD) at Penn and have to write an additional program-specific essay that asks\" Why are you interested in the Digital Media Design (DMD) program at the University of Pennsylvania?**\"**\n\nI don't know how to answer the academic and intellectual interests prompt without talking about DMD. Penn's website says \"For students applying to the coordinated dual-degree and specialized programs, please answer these questions in regard to your single-degree school choice\" but I don't know what that means. \n\nWhat's a \"single-degree school choice\" and how is it different from the specialized program?",

      "text": "The dual-degree does not apply to you unless you are going for DMD *and* another degree. The other wording isn\u2019t really relevant imho since your focus is still singular. \n\nWhen It comes to answering the question about exploring your academic and intellectual interests, I read this as what other courses will you take to enrich your DMD studies? What other electives, what other activities, what clubs, what internships etc.\n\nEdit: if you need hints, reread the description of what DMD entails: http://www.cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html",
