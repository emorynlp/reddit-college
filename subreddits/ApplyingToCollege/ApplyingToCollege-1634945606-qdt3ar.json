  "text": "The admission fee is $90. I'm at community college right now and will be transferring soon to some fairly competitive universities. I don't have many extracurriculars to put on my app, so I'm wondering if colleges will notice my membership in the NSLS? I'm not in any other frats/societies, and I've heard from some that it helps to have some kind of recognition from your peers. Also the membership comes with a personalized letter of recommendation, and wow I could use one of those. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
