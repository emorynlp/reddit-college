  "title:": "Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I am a highschool student in AP classes, and I was just invited to attend something called the \u201cNYLF: Medicine forum\u201d this summer. The details are vague and none of my classmates know anything about it.",
  "text": "I was wondering if anyone here has received a similar invitation and if it is legitimate or not. My grades aren\u2019t outstanding but I scored well on PSATS (I am in 10th grade) and the website said they select students from info that college board has so I am assuming I was selected because of that. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of thing, and am happy to go elsewhere if anyone knows the right place for these questions. It is being held at college campuses in the US so I think it is somewhat relevant.",
