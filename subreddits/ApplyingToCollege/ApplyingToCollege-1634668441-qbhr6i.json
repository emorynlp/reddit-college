  "text": "Hey y\u2019all. I\u2019m applying to Yale and I wanna submit a music supplemental. I play a fairly unique instrument (the harmonium) so I rlly wanted to send that over bc it\u2019s something I\u2019m passion about but no faculty at Yale does Indian music so it would be weird to evaluate my supplemental if I were to send harmonium.\n\nLmk what y\u2019all think. Should I submit one?",
