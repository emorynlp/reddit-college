  "text": "I am 19 and I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to go to college until recently. I live in northern Indiana currently but I plan on moving to Chicago sometime in the near future. So my question is, should I try to look for a college in Chicago or should I stay close to home for college and go to a well known college in my area?",
