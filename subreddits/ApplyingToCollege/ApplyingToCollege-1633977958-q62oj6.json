  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently writing an essay from MIT that asks me about my cultural background. I know that a lot of people write that they have family from Italy, Germany, etc...Mine is soo simple, I am from the north of Argentina, from a Province called Salta. And that is, lol, I don't have another background.\n\nWhat else should I say? I'm not into Salta's traditions nor music, I am just a guy who really loves technology. If you know any other aspect that I can talk about regarding my Argentinian culture just let me know.  Thank you so much \ud83d\ude01",
