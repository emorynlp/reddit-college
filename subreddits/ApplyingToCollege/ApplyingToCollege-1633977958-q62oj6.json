  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently writing an essay from MIT that asks me about my cultural background. I know that a lot of people write that they have family from Italy, Germany, etc...Mine is soo simple, I am from the north of Argentina, from a Province called Salta. And that is, lol, I don't have another background.\n\nWhat else should I say? I'm not into Salta's traditions nor music, I am just a guy who really loves technology. If you know any other aspect that I can talk about regarding my Argentinian culture just let me know.  Thank you so much \ud83d\ude01",

      "text": "there are so many things about growing up in Argentina that are wildly different from living in the US! it doesn\u2019t have to be the most impressive thing. maybe you can talk about the cultural value/opportunities in technology in Salta, some local/family traditions you embrace or don\u2019t quite understand... or you can tackle the \u201ccultural background\u201d prompt in an abstract way I guess",
