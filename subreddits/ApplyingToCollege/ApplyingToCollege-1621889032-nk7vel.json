I hope you know that Columbia is very much lucky to have you.  Congratulations to you as well for committing to Columbia, and I hope you love Morningside Heights because I know you are going to have a huge impact on their community.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if I am committing to Columbia yet unfortunately, but I am hoping to visit some schools this weekend, and I will absolutely try to get back to you and update you on my final decision.  If I do end up going, I would be absolutely happy to see you around at the Big Apple, and I hope you have a great summer before you begin your first year of college.\n\nHave a nice day!",
