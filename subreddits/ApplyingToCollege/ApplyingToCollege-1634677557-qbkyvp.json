  "title:": "Is it okay to ask for a rec letter to my volunteer service teacher if I have known them for 5 years?",
  "text": "(2 teachers already uploaded their rec letters for me)\n\nMy essay is about community service experience; about being a teacher's assistant to help kids. And the theme of my college application was that I want to major in psychology to become a therapist (clinical psychology) to help kids and adults.\n\nWill a rec letter from my volunteer service teacher be repetitive? or more valuable than an average counselor letter?\n\n(I don't know my counselor very well)\n\nAnd should I ask for a recommendation letter to the teacher of a class I helped the kid (my essay story), or a volunteer service coordinator?",
