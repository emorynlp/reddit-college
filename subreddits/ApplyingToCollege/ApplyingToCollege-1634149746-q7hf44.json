But it's not a bad tool either, and is easier to use than others.",

      "text": "UC Berkeley for L&S, just be aware that you need to hit a 3.3 in CS 61A, 61B and CS 70 once you're in to declare the CS major. You can also apply for EECS and get a direct admit but the acceptance rate for that program is somewhere around 5%. \n\nI'd be a bit concerned about OOS tuition but if you're willing to pay for it then no issues\n\nThey also may be introducing a new declaration policy in the new future, but as long as you're admitted and start school before they deploy it you don't have to worry about any changes they make",
