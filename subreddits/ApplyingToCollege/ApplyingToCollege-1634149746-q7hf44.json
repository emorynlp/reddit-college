You can also apply for EECS and get a direct admit but the acceptance rate for that program is somewhere around 5%. \n\nI'd be a bit concerned about OOS tuition but if you're willing to pay for it then no issues\n\nThey also may be introducing a new declaration policy in the new future, but as long as you're admitted and start school before they deploy it you don't have to worry about any changes they make",

Even if they do implement it after entering class of Fall 2022 has started school they get grandfathered into the old requirements and likely do not have to run the gauntlet\n\nAlso good riddance if it is honestly. Half the kids from my high school applied to some weird fluffy majors and then pivoted straight to CS once they got in. The EECS department is suffering hard with underenrollment in all non-math EE courses and shitloads of impaction in CS classes. My EECS and CS friends from HS trying to take the classes are seeing or have seen hours-long office hour queues in certain classes just to get help for 10 minutes on a lab. Makes the student experience absolutely miserable if you aren't a genius or highly independent\n\nThis is the best solution, who cares if people get rejected from Berkeley because of it. Going to UC Irvine or UC Davis for CS/CSE won't kill someone's future",
