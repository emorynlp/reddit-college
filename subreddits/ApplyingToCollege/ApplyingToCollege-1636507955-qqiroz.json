  "text": "I\u2019m filling out my activities portion of my common app which is the last section I need to complete and I was wondering does it matter how many hours an activity offers for you to include it bc 1 of the clubs I\u2019m in hasn\u2019t had a single meeting this year\u2026.. so should I just not include it? and I\u2019m apart of book club and we don\u2019t meet every week but we do have books to read so like that takes about 2 hours out my week so that\u2019s accurate right?",

And yes, you should include time spent on club activities even if it\u2019s not explicitly during the meetings (eg if you were editor in newspaper, you\u2019d include time spent editing articles outside of meetings as well as time spent on meetings).",
