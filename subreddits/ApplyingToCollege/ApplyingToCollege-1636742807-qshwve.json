  "text": "I\u2019m in the process of writing my personal statement, and was wondering if I should write about the time I got arrested. It was a very life changing experience for me that I genuinely feel made me a better person, but I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot by writing about me being a criminal. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I clicked yes (just for kicks before changing it to no) and saw that one had a limit of 400 words, perhaps you could write it there. But i don\u2019t think you should write your personal statement about it",
