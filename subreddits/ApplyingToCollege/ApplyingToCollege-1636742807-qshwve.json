  "text": "I\u2019m in the process of writing my personal statement, and was wondering if I should write about the time I got arrested. It was a very life changing experience for me that I genuinely feel made me a better person, but I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot by writing about me being a criminal. Any advice would be appreciated.",
