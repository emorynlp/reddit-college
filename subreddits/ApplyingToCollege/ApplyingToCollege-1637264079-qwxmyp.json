  "text": "Does it matter what teacher you ask for a letter of recommendation? I want to major in accounting in college and now I'm realizing the teachers I asked for recommendations have no relation to accounting like a math teach might would. I asked 3 teachers at first, my AP US History teacher,  my chemistry honors teacher, and my Algebra 2 teacher. My Algebra 2 teacher didn't respond but the others did. So on Naviance, some schools only allow 2 requests, and for those schools they are filled with my AP US History teacher and Chem teacher. Now the real problem is that like 5 minutes ago my Algebra 2 teacher just responded saying she will write me a recommendation... I do have schools on Naviance that allow over 2 recommendations which I will ask her to write for those, but what about the other ones that only allow 2? They are already filled. Would they really care that much that the recommendation is coming from someone not related to the field of accounting at all or do they mostly just care that at least someone is writing a recommendation about you. \n\nPlease excuse my grammar/writing, I'm rush writing this.",
