But, upon reading your original comment I responded to again I have a further question and point.\n\nu/FamousButNotReally says something along the lines of \"we are the only industrialized nation that has such a terrible social security net\" and you proceed to point out the spending aspect.\n\nHow does this refute him? Social security benefits are not the best, especially for people who have had low wages their whole life, and the VA is notoriously shitty in many aspects regarding health and veteran services\n\nPlus a lot of the direct safety net programs are pretty shitty. Since the US does it on a state by state basis, some states provide very little unemployment benefits (which considering the job market during economic downturn, suck!) , And welfare is also jacked up in many states.",

We spend so much money on these programs, so not \"terrible\", just inefficient. \n\nI'll forgot to address some other points that OP made, but I'm tired rn. \n\nstudent loans are mainly owned by the upper two quintiles of income. college tuition is a very complex issue that i won't get into right now, but it's quite a myopic view of our education system to only look at the most expensive colleges and not state schools/community colleges etc.\n\n[https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/)\n\n\\+\n\nOur COVID vaccine response was one of the best in the world.

Or you want to think anyone can just work hard and smart and succeed.     \n\nThe person who grew up in a poor town will never be able to get into a top college - because they had a terrible education.   There is literally nothing they can do. Most of the minority students in top schools come from rich or middle class families that are already well off.      \n\nYou have to read or take some classes on sociology and wealth and class inequality.   \n\nYou are arguing anyone can just \"work hard and smart\" but many people start with huge disadvantages.  People live in poverty because it can be very hard to get out of it.  The students who went to terrible public schools have no chance to get into a better college.     \n\nThe US is better for getting a good job and saving money than some other countries. In some countries you can never get a good job unless you go to college, and most people can't afford college at all (like the Philippines).   It's true the US has social mobility, but it's also true that it can be much harder for someone poor to succeed for many reasons.

It is just a means of taking advantage of the many for the few to live lavish.\n\nI\u2019d love to see the metrics on the how amazing capitalism has been to every place in the world that was decimated in the name of capitalism. \n\nYou can use whatever metrics you want to say people are living amazingly, but when we go through a humanitarian crisis like this pandemic and the poorest only get poorer and taken advantage of while the richest get stupidly richer - THAT is a broken system.\n\nAgain, not saying capitalism doesn\u2019t have its benefits.

Is your issue with the fact that poor people got poorer (an issue that follows every modern crisis) or with the fact that rich people got richer (which is mostly paper wealth)? Should I give you why that\u2019s the case and why that\u2019s inevitable in a modern society? \n\nYou talk about \u201cbroken systems\u201d but the vast majority of the world\u2019s vaccines have been designed and manufactured by the US or its Western European partners. Your average American today lives nearly twice as long as your average European aristocrat did one hundred years ago. More people than ever are going to college; our chances of living a happy, healthy life are better than they were at any point in time. An average US household has more disposable income than those in all but one European country. There are 50x as many obese people as there are hungry ones (at least in the US).\n\nBroken? Depends entirely on your worldview. I, for one, believe that capitalism has worked and will continue to work for the vast majority of people.",

I\u2019m a low income student going to an Ivy in the fall. I worked really hard and was lucky because my mom is a teacher and she saw how important education is.

                          "text": "Your comment made me use my brain for a bit, an unironic thanks. \n\nI think OP was being 'hyperbolic' about social mobility being a myth because they definitely did acknowledge its existence (or lack thereof) in respect to reality. Probably a misnomer for their frustrations.\n\nSocial mobility in and of itself exists, and manifests based on how society decides it to be: secularist nations have provided a platform for meritocracy, but . Your (entire) family had stumbled upon a combination of the right opportunities and rewards thereof as they moved up the social stratum. Opportunities expand with merit in the meritocratic system so it becomes self-sufficient with mutual exclusivity of both parties, observable as the disparity between poorer getting poorer and richer getting richer (either by reward or resources to access reward) grows larger.\n\nPerhaps you might've taken their statement a bit literally. People acknowledge the existence of social mobility, meritocracy, whatever, but term them myths because they are deceptive in current nature. Hence they do not exist... equally. Yes, by definition 'meritocracy' may exist in the USA (don't @ my ignorance, intl. student), but it is far, far harder for those who come from nothing to move greatly up the social stratum - which is backed by your anecdotal evidence. It isn't statistical: it doesn't happen to everyone (most poor/middle-class).\n\nThe rise commercialization of everything over the last few decades has increased opportunity to benefit per merit, and while it has recognized (even accommodated) the disadvantage of, well, disadvantaged individuals/students, the reward of opportunity for a small % of students who make it till here, it still perpetuates idealistic meritocratic methods. If you, a disadvantaged student, bust your ass off, then you will be recognized for your efforts with a free ride to X school where your value and nature of work ethic will be rewarded. Until then, you still have to work hard, harder than others, for the same recognition of opportunity.\n\nIt's less about social mobility conceptually being a myth and more about the malpractice of the concept making it a myth in today's society, because fundamentally it preaches equal reward. Like sure, meritocracy rewards individual value, but those who have access to means that amplify their value even if they worked incredibly hard for it. All classes will be equally rewarded but the higher the class, the greater the recognition of resources that aid reaching that reward, hence access to opportunity.\n\nThe disparity in advantage of those higher up and the middle class, the poor ads up making it increasingly more difficult for those in the lower class to be rewarded on the same basis.",

      "text": "The phrase \u201cmeritocracy is a lie\u201d is a vastly oversimplified and narrow statement, most often embedded in resentment. The fact of the matter is, today in the first world, our society does a decently good job in organizing people by merit and competence. Example: the qualification by any metric of an average elite school will be higher than that of a mid-tier school every time, in the workplace, your boss will almost always have more experience and knowledge then you, also in the vast majority of cases if you produce demonstrable positive change in an organization, you will be recognized and rewarded. Now does this mean, that\u2019s injustices don\u2019t exist? Ofcourse not, there will always be the boss that got the job through a slick scheme, or a rich family that paid their way to Harvard and there will always be that unknowingly genius kid that didn\u2019t get into an Ivy League bc he didn\u2019t have the resources . But by enlarge, meritocracy and competence hierarchies are very much still alive, although sadly, we are trying really hard to break it down in the name of equity. In any case, being rich doesn\u2019t automatically get you in. You also need to show some sort of competence, although you may think it may be less. Colleges/institutions lower the bar for the significantly advantaged, but they also lower the bar for the significantly disadvantaged (through affirmative actions and other policies). But it is very easy to point to the rich kid and reduce the cause of his \u2018accomplishment\u2019 to his wealth when in reality it\u2019s a very multivariate problem. Just like it\u2019s very easy for me to blame my interviewer for being racist if I don\u2019t get a job and he \u2018looked at me the wrong way\u2019. Yes situations like these exists, but there\u2019s no point in developing resentment and attributing this belief of \u2018meritocracy is a lie\u2019 across the board. Actually, it\u2019s very counter productive, psychologically, because this leads to a victim mindset and dissolves personal responsibility. Also, seeing the mindset of my rich friends, I would much rather be born into lower-middle class (as I was) than in a wealthy high class. So many of these \u2018rich kids\u2019 have no idea what their dads do, or what actually physical labor is, what struggle and crisis is - this is a great disadvantage in my view. These are my two cents. Thanks for reading.",

She gets 1560 she may not.  We'll let you know how this story turns out.   Oh and yes she will get in somewhere, but her path to getting into the top schools is much harder.  Don't just moan about money like it is the only inequality or the only thing that gets you in.  For most, just working harder will make the difference. Don't let perceived unfairness be an excuse for not putting in the work to get the qualifying grades and scores.  If you don't get into your dream school straight out of school, do what I did -- join the military.  Do what it takes, not what you think is fair.  I didn't stay in the military, but my path was always up.  I got into what for me was a good school for computer programming in my 30's, the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana after years of community college and self taught leaning on computers.

That is an entire discussion we could have (obviously not on this subreddit because of the double standards). My argument is that any comment that talks about the advantages of Rule 6 to certain people gets taken down. However, comments defending Rule 6 are allowed to stay on. Similarly, people are completely allowed to say whatever shit they want against rich people, yet when someone questions that (aka me), my comment gets downvoted. The reason the mods made Rule 6 was specifically the stop toxic discussions. I have seen many toxic comments that have just claimed that rich people can get whatever they want - if the mods are willing to ban talks against Rule 6 because of toxic discussions, but they are unwilling to ban talks for Rule 6 or against rich people, then that is the literal definition of a double standard. If you are going to ban a topic from being spoken about, then you must ban both sides of the argument. Also, if you are going to ban the topic from being spoken about for a certain reason, then you must ban talks about anything else that violate that as well. The mods need to stop the double standards.",

Of course there are poor free market countries, but there are a lot of variables that go into economic productivity and success. \n\nNobody\u2019s saying that we should go back to being a totally capitalist economy. We\u2019re mixed market, which is why there are public roads and institutions that are designed to serve us instead of turning a profit, yet also businesses whose goals are to stay competitive and make money.
