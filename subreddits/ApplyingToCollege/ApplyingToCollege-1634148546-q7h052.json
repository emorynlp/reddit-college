  "text": "I know this sounds counter intuitive but like a good 50-60% of this sub has some sort of crazy ec. However some people applying to colleges don\u2019t even know what the common app is. So are we like the 1% people talk about when it comes to college admissions\n\nLike this sub is like some feeder school\u2026like looking at the results last year you had like 200 people going to Berkeley.",

It also is the best in the nation for my program & provides great education & opportunities in many other areas. Your success is most dependent on what you do in college, not the college you go to (except for a couple of specific careers maybe I don't know, I'm not in finance).",
