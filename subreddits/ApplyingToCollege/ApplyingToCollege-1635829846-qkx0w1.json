  "title:": "I wrote an essay about being homophobic, and the process of me changing from that to accepting. Was that a bad topic?",
  "text": "I used common app to apply to colleges. I based my essay on the prompt about changing my view point. My essay talked about growing up very religious (I tried not to emphasize losing my religion, but rather the homophobia) but eventually waking up one day and just realizing that being homophobic is wrong. I end it with accepting myself for being bisexual and forgiving and making amends to the people I hurt.\n\nWhat do you think? I\u2019m super nervous because I haven\u2019t gotten responses from colleges yet, but I applied beginning of September. \ud83d\ude05",

You should also mention apologizing to people, but don\u2019t make it sound like you were a complete bully and abuser.",
