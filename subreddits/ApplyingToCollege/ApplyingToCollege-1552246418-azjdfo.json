At a point I thought that I wasn't even going to go to college. \n\nI can't thank the /r/A2C community enough. \n\nMy school literally doesn't have a college counselor because so many of us fail to even graduate high school, and navigating this whole American college process withouth a counselor was something I never thought I could do. I could barely afford taking one SAT test, let alone expensive private counselling.\n\n But people here like /u/admissionsmom , /u/scholargrade and /u/williamthereader and all the other amazing posts and help have really made it possible.\n\nYou all have been my college counselor, i love this community so much.",

      "text": "You have no idea how cool that is going to be.  Seriously, I know many students who went to similar programs.  It is legitimately like winning the lottery.  Not only do you get the crazy cash, free tuition, and awesome network, you will be an all-star student at UTD.  I guarantee you every prof at UTD knows who the McDermott scholars are and goes out of their way to interact with them.  You will get access to special classes, meetings with important people on campus, recommendations, research positions, internships, etc.  Their website even hints at this, but trust me you'll be blown away by how huge this is.\n\nState schools have enormous resources and often people overlook this because their resources per student aren't that high.  But they do not distribute those evenly, **not even close.**  There is a reason they're paying you $17K a year on top of all the other benefits.  You will discover that there are other fringe benefits that they don't (or can't) market.  I met with one of the deep-pocketed founders of one of these programs and his quote was \"We would have given them cars if we could have gotten away with it.\"\n\nYou're right, your whole life just changed trajectory and you still have no idea just how much.  This is way more amazing than you are able to understand right now.  When you land an incredible summer internship or research position because a professor went out of their way to open that door for you, when you get a crazy job offer or graduate school acceptance, and when you're in your late 20s and all your friends are complaining about their student loans, you'll start to see what I mean.",

              "text": "One other word of advice for you:  if you ever get an email from the McDermott program director or other staff asking for volunteers to represent the university at [X] function, **DO IT.**  They are literally paying you to be the best, brightest, and most prominent students - and they're trying to do everything they can to make you successful and launch you into whatever else you try to achieve.  Opportunities like this are really rare in the real world, but super common in programs like this.  A few examples from students I know who went to programs like this:\n\n- Attended football games at a D1 powerhouse program in the President's Box\n\n- Sat next to an Economics Nobel Laureate at a university dinner\n\n- Had meetings with distinguished NYT best-selling authors like Ta Nehisi Coates and others\n\n- Met with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve **for an hour AT THE FED.**  Literally just a handful of students and the Fed Chairman sitting in a room doing Q&A.  There are people who would pay six figure sums for that.\n\n- Met with ambassadors, judges, foreign officials, visiting professors from other universities, etc\n\n- Received priority access to research funding (this was sort of a backroom handshake deal where the director in charge of funding said something like \"I'm the director of funding and you should apply\" after meeting with the student for something somewhat unrelated.  The student then applied for funding and got fully funded *surprisedpikachu.jpg*.)\n\n- Study abroad with the foremost scholars and experts in the destination areas.  One student was at an archaeological dig in Turkey and asked the tour guide a question, then got a shockingly detailed response.  Turns out the tour guide was the chief archaeologist and author of the foremost book on that area.  He happened to be friends with the professor from the student's university who was leading the trip, so he volunteered to give a personal tour of several restricted access digs and spent 4 hours with the students showing them stuff literally no one else ever gets to see.
