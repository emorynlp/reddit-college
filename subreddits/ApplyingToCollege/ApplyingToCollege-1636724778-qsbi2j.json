I'm in grade 12 (which is called pre college where I live), so I may not be able to provide professional advice but loll physics is HARD well at least for me and many others. I'd suggest to limit the amount of subjects you choose because physics and the math that goes along with physics is HARD and time consuming. Dont try doing economics and political science etc along with physics. Applying what you learned in physics may be kinda challenging. I'd suggest joining some clubs/groups related to physics and astronomy to get practical experience. Oh and for astrophysics, you need computer science (gotta learn how to code). Memorizing would do you not good in physics...yes you have to memorize formulas but make sure you actually understand the content.",
