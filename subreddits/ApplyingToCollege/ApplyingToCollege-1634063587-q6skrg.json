  "text": "I spend a lot of my time painting, so it\u2019s one of the prominent activities on my common app + it\u2019s something I discuss in my personal statement, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to submit a portfolio by Nov 1. I\u2019ve read that it could be reviewed by faculty, and since I don\u2019t have many \u201cserious\u201d pieces (I mostly do studies, so not original pieces, or paint fanart) I don\u2019t want the portfolio to be viewed negatively.\n\nIf I don\u2019t submit one at all, would that look suspicious/incongruent to the AOs?",

              "text": "Well...yes and no. If it is really amazing stuff, it will keep eyes on your application, but unless you are applying to an art program, it won't help you as an applicant. Though, in general, the name of the game is getting an AO's eyes on your application for longer than the 60s or whatever they have (it's insane!). So point two is that if you add in your portfolio as an extra, it can distract the AO from other, stronger parts of your application that could actually get you admitted.",
