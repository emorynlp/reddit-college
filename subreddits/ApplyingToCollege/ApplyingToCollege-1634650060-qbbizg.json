  "text": "I am international from an underrepresented country and from a tiny peripheral city. \nNo way other students apply from my school to US schools.\nI am afraid colleges wouldn\u2019t know what to compare my grades to, because it might seem bad on an American scale, but compared to my class I was at the very top. (We don\u2019t have class rank) \nDo I need to provide some extra information?",
