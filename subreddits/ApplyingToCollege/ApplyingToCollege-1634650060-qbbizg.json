  "text": "I am international from an underrepresented country and from a tiny peripheral city. \nNo way other students apply from my school to US schools.\nI am afraid colleges wouldn\u2019t know what to compare my grades to, because it might seem bad on an American scale, but compared to my class I was at the very top. (We don\u2019t have class rank) \nDo I need to provide some extra information?",

      "text": "In general, your school college counselor or whoever does that job is asked to submit 1. Counselor recommendation and 2. school report.  That school report usually summarizes the basic info of the school, the grading scale, what advanced courses are available, the % of students who graduate, etc., so colleges can get an idea of how hard or easy your school is.   You can also ask if your counselor would state in the recommendation letter that you were at the top of your class.",
