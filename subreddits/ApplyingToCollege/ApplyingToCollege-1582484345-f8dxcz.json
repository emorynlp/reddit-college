  "title:": "The Ivy League vs The Techvy League",
  "text": "After years of public pressure from pretentious high schoolers and their parents, the Ivy League - Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, and Dartmouth - finally voted to kick Cornell out of the Ivy League. In an official statement released to the press, Harvard, representing the League, explained that \"Cornell had failed to maintain the humanities and liberal arts focus necessary to stay in the League\".\n\nCornell supporters were devastated, claiming that this decision was an attack against Cornell's high acceptance rate and its mission to educate the masses. The Institutes of Technology - MIT, Caltech, Northwestern - watched as the debacle unfolded. Together, they decided that they would do something to right the wrong.\n\nOn a Tuesday morning, Cornell received a phone call, \"Hi Cornell, it's MIT. We have some things to discuss...\"\n\nCornell arrived at The Conference. Inside, sat MIT, Caltech, and Northwestern. \"We've brought in some powerhouses to help us with what we're about to do\", MIT announced.\n\nCarnegie Mellon entered the room. UC Berkeley entered the room. Stanford entered the room.\n\nA document was passed around, gaining signatures from each of the schools. On it, read \"The reign of the Ivy-League ends today.\"\n\nOn September 1st, 2025, the Techvy League declared war on the Ivy League, flooding the airwaves with billions of negative attack ads.\n\nMIT vs Harvard\n\nStanford vs Princeton\n\nUC Berkeley vs Yale\n\nCalTech vs Columbia\n\nCarnegie Mellon vs UPenn\n\nCornell vs Brown\n\nNorthwestern vs Dartmouth.\n\nDuring the 2025-2026 admission season, acceptance rates for each of the Ivy League institutions rose to an all-time high while acceptance rates for the Techvy League institutions fell to a record low. Slowly but surely, Ivy League alumni stopped providing donations to their alma maters, and endowments at each of the Ivy League schools began to dwindle.\n\nBy 2033, 8 years after the war had started, the Ivy League surrendered. Running out of money and no longer able to fill their freshman classes, the Ivy League had come to the end of the road. Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, and Columbia had already boarded up their campuses while Harvard, Princeton, and Yale pleaded for mercy. None was granted.\n\nIn 2035, the Ivy League institutions are nothing but a memory. The Techvy League - MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, CalTech, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, and Northwestern - reign supreme.",

      "text": "Continued...\n\nAfter the Techvy League movement started, more and more colleges started to focus on such aspects, and now there were way too many qualified colleges that were eligible for the league, 16 (all of them included). At this moment, MIT and Caltech had the idea of bringing up their rivalry to an official stage to make things more interesting and goofy. Thus formed the two Techvy Leagues with 8 colleges in each of them viz. T-League (Entrepreneurial) [Led by MIT] and T-League (Academic) [Led by Caltech]. They then implemented a very intriguing and seemingly controversial policy: If admitted to any college of one of the leagues, that student may not under any circumstance, transfer to a college of the competing league, as any attempt would result in cancellation of his/her degree. This move has impacted the admission process in substantial ways and Universities have implemented creative ways in their policies to conform to the new rule...\n\n(Someone continue this...)",
