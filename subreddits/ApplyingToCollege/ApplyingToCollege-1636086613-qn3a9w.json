  "text": "I think I did too much. I am basing my ECs on an underrepresented major combination (envirosci + neurosci) instead of neurosci + CS, my true passion, got a patent, news coverage, harvard research related to it as well as a huge community thing. but it is disingenous. Even though I am a bay area asian male I DONT have to do so much to get into a top 15 school. I am doing myself wrong by basing my ECs off of getting into a top school. And I see tons of kids from my school get into schools like cornell and t15 with less qualifications.  No major awards, positions, maybe t5 research position which everyone who applies gets. Even as bay area asians in stem. But they all were genuine with their intentions.\n\nI see tons of overqualified kids (think of people appearing on Forbes for their organization, ranking 50 in NSDA) get rejected... probably because they did everything for college. \n\nThe FTC team next door ranked 13 in the world. Everyone in that team was genuine with their intentions. 2 people there were in my class. And it payed off \n\nI am just  a prestige simp - and it probably will come across...... ",

      "text": "Whether you are accepted to a particular college or denied rarely hangs on one thing that you did or didn't accomplish. There is a part of the admission process (parts really along the path from reception to sending the decisions out) having nothing to do with grades, scores, GPA, and the \"softer\" ECs and activities. You may never be able to \"rationally know\" why someone with lower stats is accepted. It is the thing that makes for holistic viewing. Schools that make emphasize stats/or stats alone only need a computer churning out decisions. ..skipping the human element completely. This resulting decision in holistic admissions can be more or less serendipitous at different junctures, or reader subjective, or plain 'ole dumb luck depending upon absolutely nothing that you have any control over and no reflection on your extremely strong application. You can be sad, angry, resentful ...an appropriate reaction to your disappointment. But, do not think this is the \"ultimate judgment\" of you as a student or individual. It is not a rejection of you in any form...I really try not to use \"rejection\" in this context at all. A long admired (revered?) Dean of CAS once said that Princeton's practice of shutting off the phones for two weeks after decision day should be adopted by every university...because there are no \"good\" reasons why a particular student was not accepted. As harsh as it sounds, it might just be that at that 5-10 minutes in Committee Review, \"we just liked someone else better.\" (This was a hundred years ago...I have no idea if Princeton still does shut down!!!) Once your app is sent in, you have done all you can humanly do...you need to find satisfaction, relief, and balance. Let it go, hope for good things to follow...but the world will still spin, the moon and sun will dance their duet, and life really does go on. Demonstrate your maturity, resilience, confidence, and competence at meeting life on its terms and participating in its richness.",
