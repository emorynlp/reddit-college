  "text": "Is it worth it to try and go to a t20 school for pre med? Or should I try my best to get scholarships for decent schools that will allow me to keep a 4.0(or very close to 4.0) GPA?  I\u2019ve heard from many doctors that where you go for undergrad doesn\u2019t make that big of a difference as long as your MCAT score is high and your GPA is high.  If I can save money during my undergrad and go to a prestigious medical school, I\u2019d rather do that.",

That being said \"go to a prestigious med school\" is very very difficult. Getting into a T20 med school is 10X harder than getting into a T20 undergrad IMO. It is easier from a top tier undergrad due to opportuntiesm pprestige but if you take all your chances and work hard at any school you can do it",
