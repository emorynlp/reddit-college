  "text": "For context, I played a sport freshman/sophomore year at a very well known sports high school (like Mater Dei, IMG academy level, perhaps a little bit lower but usually ranked t20 in multiple sports). In season (14 weeks) I had like 20+ hrs of practice per week, so I ended up doin not too much freshman/sophomore year. Should I include this on my app or nah?",

Science Museum Guide for like 50-60 hrs over 9-10), but might be a better fit to include on the application. Just bc I spent so much time on it, do you think it'd be important to include this?",
