  "title:": "I'm in my early twenties looking to go back College and trying to find one that would easily accept me even if it's just online only. I tried Community College once but it wasn't a good fit for me. Anyone have any suggestions?",
  "text": "Hello, I'm looking to go back College and I definitely need some help. I was C and B student in Highschool and I also was horrible in math and only passed the minimum math class requirement to graduate. I also scored low on The PSAT and didn't even bother taking The SAT.  However with all that being said I was accepted into two universities that I applied  to on my own but I couldn't afford to attend either. I then started Community College but dropped when I realized it wasn't a good fit for me personally. Now I'm here thinking about going back to school but I honestly can't think of what I would major in. Maybe something in business administration with a minor in design or history? I honestly can't make mind up.I also started a decent \"For Now\"  job with plenty days off that would be perfect for online classes. I have seen way to many legitimate universities that have \" \"Online Classes\" only  to find out that the name is just being used by one of those for profit ventures. I enrolled in an online class from the local community college but I honestly don't want to deal with them as they lack alot of resources. I would really appreciate some help as I want to go back and get a degree but I just don't know where to start.",

      "text": "Look and see if you are eligible for some of the online offerings of big public universities -- schools like ASU, U Florida, Oregon State, Penn State, Colorado State, etc.  Those are some of the better ones that have complete degree programs online that are run by the schools and weren't farmed out to for profit companies. \n\nYou might need to retake an SAT, or take a community college class or two if your grades aren't quite there, but their admissions standards should give you a good benchmark of what's needed.\n\nThere are some bad ones you may have run into that look like those unfortunately -- Purdue Global for example sounds good until you find out it's Kaplan that Purdue just bought and rebranded.",

      "text": "If you don\u2019t know what you want to do (major\nIn) and are paying out of pocket and it seems money is an issue, since you couldn\u2019t afford the 2 schools you were accept to, I would find some place cheap to go (like online community college). I would focus on taking general education requirements or getting your pre- reqs out of the way by taking them at your local community college, and also improving your gpa and then apply as a transfer student to a local state college.\nAlso I would highly suggest you fill out the FAFSA, if you are independent you might qualify for a Pell Grant, which would help to pay for your education.\nMany community colleges have articulation agreements with the local state schools that will seamlessly transfer credits you take at the CC into a 4 year program at the state school. Or check out your non-Flagship state college- usually they have lower tuition and admission requirements than your state flagship.",
