  "text": "I'm in my Junior year and realized less than 2 weeks ago I will graduate this December. I have never taken the ACT until this past week, and will take it again twice. So in all of my applications, I have no scores to list yet, but I can say that I have three tests scheduled or am waiting for scores. How exactly do I update my application when I receive them? I have already submitted my application for one school, Georgia Tech, but I don't really know how I'm going to supply my scores when the time comes. I'm fairly new to all of this stuff in general, so this is a bit stressful considering EA applications are due in the next 5 days for most institutions. The deadline for scores appears to be January, so I have some time, but I don't know how the scores are to be uploaded.",

      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept.\n\nMany colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. Most schools that accept self-reported scores will have a way to update scores in the admission portal.\n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. For these colleges, order an official report.\n\nExample, googling ga tech standardized test scores leads you to [https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/standardized-tests](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/standardized-tests)\n\n>You have two avenues to self-report your standardized test scores. First, we will consider self-reported scores listed in the Common Application testing section. Additionally, **after you submit your application, you will have access to a form in your admission portal to self-report scores**. We will not use scores received on your school transcript or via email, fax, or postal service.  \n>  \n>If\u202fyou are admitted and choose to enroll at Georgia Tech, you will need to submit official test scores before attending orientation.",
