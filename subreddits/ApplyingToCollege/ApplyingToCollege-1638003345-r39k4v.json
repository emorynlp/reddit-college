Once you get accepted and are committed to that school, they\u2019ll require you to send your official transcripts as a way of \u201cverifying\u201d your self reported grades. However, you\u2019ll usually need to send your unofficial transcript to the school through the common app as part of the counselor\u2019s report if you\u2019re applying through that.",
