  "text": "School messed up dad's middle name, abbreviated his middle name to it's first letter and that's now there on all my transcripts, and apparently cannot be changed. (I tried to bring it up earlier along they sort of ignored me). Will that cause an issue? I might be overthinking it  but it's already caused issues in my government-level all country mandated exams so I hope it won't cause an issue for the college applications? and student visa?",
