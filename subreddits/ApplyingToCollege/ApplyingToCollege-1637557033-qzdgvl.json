  "text": "A month after I graduated HS, I got shipped off to boot camp. Im trying to get into school again. I\u2019m trying to use the common app but when it asks certain questions about classes I took (dual enrollment) I can\u2019t give them a concrete date, the best I can give is an estimate. Will this slow down my admissions process ? On the other hand Would it be better to directly apply through the school instead of the common app? These might seem like goofy questions but I\u2019ll appreciate any feedback you can give. Thanks",
