  "text": "Just got done with my first college interview of the year. Was not as bad as I would have thought. We talked for nearly an hour and it was an overall pleasant experience. I do see why a lot of people get nervous before interviews, me included, but if you know about yourself, your interests, and your motivations then you should be prepared for any question they can ask. I should also note that you should definitely come prepared with intelligent, discussion provoking questions, not \"does ____ university have a study abroad program?\"",

It\u2019s fine to be nervous before an interview, you\u2019ll likely overestimate the impact of it, so you feel like everything is on the line. \n\nAnd yes I\u2019d echo that you should ask questions. I asked pretty surface level stuff which wasn\u2019t great",
