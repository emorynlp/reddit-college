      "text": "For college admissions the major tends to not matter. But the school you go to matters more. Since getting into a t5 means you knew a bit about how the process works. Also as an undergraduate student you need to talk to the admissions at your school, become a tour guide, etc get an internship with them and use it to kick off your career.",

I\u2019m gonna be honest, you will need a masters degree minimum to really make it worth it (depending on your values of course) but it\u2019s not useless. Just very saturated so jobs might be harder to find. But I wouldn\u2019t put it in the useless category because they\u2019re definitely great jobs available if you play your cards right. You just gotta know what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re getting yourself into because it may not be easy.",

That's all. I work in college counseling now and others in my field have degrees in business, marketing, education, etc.\n\nDon't worry about the specific major. Study what interests you, because you can always change it or find a different path into what you want to do.",
