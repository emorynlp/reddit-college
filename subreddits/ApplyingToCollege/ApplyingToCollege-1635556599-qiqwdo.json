You can literally experience all four seasons in one day. I experienced bright sunlight, snow and hail, and rain (not in that order) within a few hours. Some people I know have became very creative in their social media posts complaining about the snow lolllll.",

      "text": "I attended a T50 public school and studied C.S.  Here are my biggest complaints:\n\n1. Academic advising was a no-op.  The advisor understood the degree requirements and routed students into classes that would result in them meeting those requirements, but that was the extent of it.  I was able to understand the degree requirements and prerequisite structure from reading the course catalog, so advising added very little value.\n2. The C.S. department was fairly theory-focused and did a somewhat poor job of preparing me for actually working in software.  Some of that is on me; there's definitely some stuff I could have done that I did not do.  However, I was never told \"you need to learn X\" or \"you need to do X\".  Hard to account for \"unknown unknowns\".\n3. My interaction with the school administration, including at the department level, was highly transactional.  I was very much \"just a number\".  Not to my individual professors (though, sometimes to them too), but definitely to the school as a whole.  I was totally fine with that, tbh, but there are some people who yearn to feel \"valued\" and \"known\".  With 35k undergrads you ain't getting that.\n4. In most of my classes I was probably among the top cohort of students by raw ability.  This was both good and bad.  Good in that it allowed me to do \"alright\" grade-wise without working too hard and/or being stressed.  Bad for the exact same reason.  When I went to graduate school and became roughly the median student I was not prepared for the amount of effort it would take to be successful.",
