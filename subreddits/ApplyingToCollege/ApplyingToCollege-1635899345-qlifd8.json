  "text": "\nI am currently a high school graduate and I've paused my academic year in the college in my hometown of Tbilisi, Georgia.\nI possess a TOEFL IBT score, which I have obtained in the previous fall.\nMy most important goal is to start my first semester of college precisely in the summer of 2022 in USA. So basically, I want to start with the summer semester.\nCan you advise me about this matter?\nI want to find out if it is feasible and what I should do to accomplish this task (like, how to send the scores, or how to apply for summer semester, visa,etc). \nI would be grateful for your help.\nThank you in advance",
