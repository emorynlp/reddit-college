In general, you can use the search on [abet.org](https://abet.org) for accredited engineering schools in the US.\n\nThere are definitely closely related degrees at other schools that are good too - USC's \"Civil Engineering - Building Science\" for example is jointly run with their architecture department.\n\nMore broadly than those, a lot of civil engineering majors in the US have structural emphasis options.",

              "text": "You would want to make sure that the degree is considered the same as a US one under the Washington Accord, or that the abroad school has ABET accreditation - either would be fine for working in the US. That's certainly possible, but can be a headache at some schools that you wouldn't expect - the US and Germany don't have mutual recognition agreements for example.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Accord\n\nI don't know about the time difference - many bachelor's degrees take three years instead of four in Europe, but it's also far more common to need a master's degree in engineering to practice there.",
