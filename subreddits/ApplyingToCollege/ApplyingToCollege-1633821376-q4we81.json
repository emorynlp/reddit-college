  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m an international student from Canada applying to some Ivy\u2019s. I was asking my counsellor for my class rank, however, he told me that the school district doesn\u2019t allow that information to be disclosed to students and therefore he can\u2019t provide it, especially since my transcript doesn\u2019t include an official class rank. Will I be held at a disadvantage?",
