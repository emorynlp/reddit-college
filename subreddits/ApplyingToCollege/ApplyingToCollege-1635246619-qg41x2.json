  "text": "I'm planning to major in Computer Science, so I took Harvard University's online CS course \"CS50's Introduction to Computer Science\" to expand my knowledge. Since I got over 70% in all the assignments that were part of this course, I acquired the CS50 Certificate recognizing my successful completion. Can I mention this certificate in the honors section of the common app? If so, is it's level of recognition international or what exactly?",
