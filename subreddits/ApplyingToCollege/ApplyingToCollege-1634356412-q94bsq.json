      "text": "i have a few ivys on my college list here\u2019s my reasons\n1. needs blind admission and financial aid is usually only at these exclusive private schools cuz they\u2019re rich. i know harvard and stanford (not an ivy but same idea) like wave ur tuition if under like 60-100k depends on the school \n2. tbh the prestige i know that\u2019s a little superficial but just the name on ur degree can help you (to some degree) especially with the rich alumni networking stuff\n3. setting like people location etc\n4. rigor. i tend to do poorly in like not rigorous classes cuz apathy lmao so an intense academic environments actually motivates me? \n5. my mom is asian need i say more",
