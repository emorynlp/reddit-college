  "text": "When I was looking back at my Common App to submit some December 1 deadlines, I noticed that I put the deceased date for my \"Parent 2\" down wrong. (I marked down February 2005, when it should have been January 2005.)\n\nThe date on the FAFSA is correct in saying January 2005, and I've already submitted the FAFSA for all of the early action schools that would have been affected by this error. \n\nIs this a big deal? Do I need to email the admissions offices of all of these schools and let them know? Or will they think I just made a small typo and that I'm overreacting?",
