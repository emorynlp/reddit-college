  "title:": "Is distance a valid reason to not want to apply?",
  "text": "Hi!! I live in NoVA, and for anyone not familiar, it's the Northern region of Virginia, commonly associated with the DMV area (DC, Maryland, Virginia). Anyone in VA knows the big three- UVA, William and Mary, and Virginia Tech. I'm aiming to major in polisci, and VT is a super great school for my intended major. To be honest, I visited and I just didn't like it. It's pretty and all, and the education is good, but it's a 4 1/2 hour drive, and I love my family and my hometown too much to leave it behind to only visit during the holidays....besides there is literally NOTHING around VT. Like just cow fields. \n\nHere's my dilemma: All of my friends are applying to VT, and everyone I know gets shocked when I'm on the fence about it. Is distance a valid reason not to apply to a school? The EA decision is on Dec 1, so I need to decide quickly.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m applying to ten schools (all major schools in VA), just wondering if I should not apply to VT!",

I do know the area, one of my good friends grew up in Christiansburg and you\u2019re right that every thing of interest would revolve around VT unless you\u2019re into the outdoors. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t think it is distance that it should be eliminated for. Not wanting to be in a college town is fine. But, I\u2019d definitely expand beyond UVA and W&M. Are there any other areas of the country you might like if they\u2019re more urban?\n\nNear you, you also have the D.C. schools of American and GWU, also no slam dunks for admission. Someone else also mentioned GMU.",

      "text": "That's a valid reason.  I'd probably still apply to an in-state public like that as you might change your mind, but if you want to stay close to home enough that you'd prefer somewhere  like George Mason you can skip it. \n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable with just UVA and W&M as options given how selective those schools are.",

      "text": "My sons, also from NOVA and now college seniors, also wanted to be close to home \u2014 ideally, within a three-hour drive.  But I did encourage them to apply broadly just because it\u2019s difficult to guarantee that one will get into UVA or W&M (and I\u2019m a UVA Law alum).  So they applied to Virginia Tech, JMU, Penn State, and Villanova, among others.  So while I believe that distance is definitely a valid concern, you might nonetheless want to be flexible with your applications just to make sure that you have a handful of options come spring.  Good luck!",
