      "text": "if this is not a shitpost:\n\ngreek life is the word for sororities/fraternities. it's a weird US-exclusive concept. they're called \"greek life\" because the houses use greek letters as their names- no relation to the country of greece. \n\nthe system: \n\nmostly in large state schools, there are a variety of greek \"houses\". most of the biggest sororities/fraternities will have a literal house where some of their more senior members live, but a \"house\" refers to the entire member body, not just those who live in the house. these \"houses\" have a combination of three greek letters (like alpha, beta, gamma, theta, chi, psi, omega) as their name. sorority is the name for the female houses, fraternity (or frat) for the men. i'll get crucified by people in greek life for saying this, but it's just a large club that's not based around any subject (like a chess club or theatre club), it's just a social club. sororities/fraternities usually have multiple \"chapters\" (the same house in different schools). \n\nhouses have regular required meetings and service events (each house has a charity focus). they require their members to pay dues and there are pretty strict rules against missing meetings and general conduct. \n\ngood things about greek life: colleges generally keep it around because it increases alumni donations and is a way to keep student's behavior under some control (because the greek house can discipline its members) and just about anyone who stayed in it tells you that it's the best thing ever and the bonds you form are lifelong and magical. also any member defending their own house will go on and on about what good work they do with their affiliated charities ~~even though the philanthropic elements exist almost entirely for good publicity~~, the sororities especially like to say they produce upstanding, well-mannered, sophisticated citizens, and in theory putting a house on your resume could get you hired if the hiring manager was a member of your house.\n\nbad things about greek life: sororities especially are highly segregated (there are designated Black sororities, \"ethnic\" sororities, and the biggest sorority conference- the Panhellenic- is almost entirely white), party culture is stereotypically closely tied with greek life, rape culture and fraternities are almost impossible to separate, hazing (abuse/required rituals during initiation) is very much still a thing, joining a house is time consuming and expensive, and the culture of secrecy around a house's rituals & traditions (and the culture of undying loyalty to each other encouraged by the house) can make abuse & criminal activity go unreported. sororities especially can also be surprisingly expensive and systemically keep out members who can't afford their abundant hidden fees and dues. \n\nthe percentage of students in greek life really varies from school to school. generally, it's most common for public schools, big schools, \"party schools,\" and more rural/college town schools. it's especially huge in the southern US. \n\nyou see far fewer sororities/fraternities in tech/specialized schools, city schools, religious schools, liberal arts schools, and places with extremely rigorous academics & admissions. \n\ni know i'll probably get crucified by some greek life members for this explanation, but this is just the facts. i've never joined, so of course members will try to brush off the facts about the bad sides of greek life by saying \"bUt YoU'vE nEveR bEeN iN iT sO yOuR oPiNiOn iS tOtAlLy InVaLiD\", but this is just the facts. feel free to fact check any of this, but be aware that greek life summons such unwavering and frantic devotion/defensiveness from its members that it can be very hard to separate fact from opinion, especially online.",
