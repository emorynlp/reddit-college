  "title:": "Does it hurt me to submit two ACT & SAT scores?",
  "text": "I've studied a fuckton for a while now and I'm taking the ACT again tomorrow and SAT again in November, I'm expecting to raise my scores considerably based on practice test results and how I'm feeling. \n\nBut, my early deadlines are Dec 1 (all materials arrive by Dec 8) -- and late deadlines Jan 1\n\nThe reporting timeframe shows that its possible I receive my scores and they get reported in time -- but also possible that its too late.. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is, should I submit my previous score(s) incase the new ones don't come in time? SAT 1350, ACT 27          - I'm applying to a lot of reaches, I expect to get a 1450+ and a 31+ from practice tests, so my application needs to look as good as possible.. Does it hurt to send these lower scores incase the newer ones dont come in time? Should I take the risk and not submit them since they're lower than needed and its possible my newer scores come in time?",

      "text": "I wouldn't submit the current scores to your reaches since they're both a bit low... It may be better to wait for the new scores to come in first, since your deadlines are after that.",

      "text": "If your current scores are above the mid-point of accepted students on the school\u2019s CDS, go ahead and submit. If not, don\u2019t.  This is the standard advice, regardless of future testing.\n\nIf future tests come in higher, make the same decision with the same decision criteria.\n\nIf you are correct saying \u201cthey're lower than needed \u201c, then don\u2019t submit them.\n\nTo your title question - no, schools know how to superscore and will use your best score, according to their scoring policy.",
