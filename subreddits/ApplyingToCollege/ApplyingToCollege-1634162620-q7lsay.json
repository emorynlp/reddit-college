  "text": "So I'm in my senior year and I'm taking ap lang. But the teacher is like a 60 yr old dude who reps Miami ohio like its harvard, this dude makes it so fucking hard to get an A. Litterally studied for like 10 hours over two days just to get an 85 on the test. Hes not even testing on ap topics, he is testing memory of small useless details in our ap text book, and has no grades besides like test grades. I have a B in this class rn. Out of all the people who have taken his class in the past only like 1 out of the 15 I know of had A's for all four quarters... yall any advice.\n\nAlso how badly will having let's say a B or b+ affect my gpa or chances for top colleges? Like will they look comparatively to others in my class or if I get a B in a grade deflated class is it the same as a B in an inflated class? Rn I have 3.923 unweighted. Our school doesn't do weighted at all. I'm the only dude in my class who has taken more than 2 aps if that matters lmfao. And only one of two to take ap lang at all lmfao",

However, if most people at your school take AP Lang and if a significant number of them get this instructor, then, in theory, that should be reflected in the grade distribution statistics in your school profile (if it includes that level of detail).",

I knew what kind of test it was,  but we had like 30 pages filled with text where we had to memorize the contexts or examples or lists etc. Like it's so difficult to memorize the most random details when there are 30 pages of it to remember. I annotated and made quizlets of the lists and examples given, and still only got an 85% Idek what to do anymore, \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this dude uses the weirdest vocabulary and phrases to throw you off on true and false questions.",

I'm just hoping I have a chance for a top 20 even though my school doesnt offer much in terms of APs and academics. Last person to go to a huge school was like early 2000s and it was to duke sooooo, Im hoping. My counselors are not very good, my school in general is not accustomed to people applying out of state (Ohio). So Im hoping I can do fine bc other than this sub senior year, I never had any help with any college admision lfmoa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE. And the counselor I liked got pregnant and is on maternity leave during college app season soo. thats tuff",
