  "title:": "Should I apply UIUC regular decision instead of priority so I have another shot at the SAT?",
  "text": "I'm applying Math+CS there with a GPA on the lower end, and a 1450 SAT(750 math). The UIUC website says that applying priority increases your chances of getting into the major that you want, but I'm not sure how much it matters. Would it make more sense for me to wait until RD to send in my application? I'm pretty sure I could bring my math score up to 800  and english to like 720+ by then. I would also be able to spend more time perfecting my essays.",
