  "title:": "I've given multiple lectures in my history class at school as a high school student. Does this count as an extracurricular?",
  "text": "Hello! I'm a high school junior. Last year, I was asked by my history teacher to give a series of lectures on WW2 to my class. She wanted me to give these lectures because she was very impressed by my historical knowledge, especially in WW2. No one else in my class ever did this, nor was asked to.\n\nI feel that this might be a good thing to add as an Activity on my Common App, but I'm not sure if it's okay to note since I never had an official title of Teacher Assistant or something. However, I spent a lot of time on my lecture slides and the material I taught was covered on our tests. My lectures took up entire class periods.\n\nMy teacher did not give me a specific list of topics to cover, and wanted me to choose what information I wanted to share within a certain area (war strategies, political ideologies in that time period, etc.)\n\nI learned a lot about educating others and got a lot of experience in public speaking through this opportunity. It also made me very happy to be able to share my interest with my classmates and teacher.\n\nShould I include this as an Activity in my Common App? Or would it be better to add to Additional Info or as an Essay topic? Any feedback is appreciated, thank you!\n\nI should also note that I'm applying for a major in International Relations and a minor in History, so I'm hoping that showing my experience in things like this may help my application.",

      "text": "You should absolutely include it!! If you're still in contact with the teacher / have a school counselor who knows the teacher, you should definitely try and talk to them to see if they can give you a legitimate title of some sort. Even if they don't,that's fine, since AOs wouldn't ask for any sort of \"proof\" of this.\n\nThis could definitely make a great topic for an essay, or you could include it in your ECs (or both) and if possible, getting an LOR from the teacher can also add something positive to your application.",

          "text": "That's a good idea! The teacher has left our school already, but we still keep in touch and she's written letters of recommendation for me to submit to some summer programs I wanted to (and did) attend in the past. I don't think my school in particular would let me have a sort of title since it's a private school and they don't allow students to be assistants. \n\nIf I put this experience into an essay, though, I'm not sure what I could talk about or mention that would be necessarily interesting. What would you suggest?",

              "text": "Oh okay, makes sense! You can probably add her LOR in the additional letters section incase your school doesn't allow her to submit it as a regular teacher.\n\nI feel like it would definitely be interesting and show how much you're invested in your intended major and how you're willing to go above and beyond the regular school curriculum and learn about events, and also helping your peers in learning those events and facts. It's very impressive indeed.\n\nMandatory mention that I'm an international student so take whatever I say with a grain of salt.",

So long as you or your teacher find a way to explain on the application\n\nIn my personal opinion, this is a pretty cool thing to do, even without considering admissions. I've also really enjoyed whenever I taught something to a class",
