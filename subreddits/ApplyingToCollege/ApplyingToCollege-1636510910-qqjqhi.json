  "text": "Okay so I had an injury 2nd semester of 10th grade. Yeah yeah blah blah no one wants to hear about it. But i did get a bulging disk+ sciatica in my lower back from my sport. It made the entirety of junior year (virtual learning) very painful for me and i had to study in weird ways and it was just hard bc I practically could not sit at my desk for months.\n\nBut before you get your A2C panties in a twist I am not writing an essay about it, but it was a significant injury and I kinda feel like I want to mention it. Could I sprinkle something in the Additional Info section about this? \n\nIf yes, what do you think I should say? If no\u2026wHY?",
