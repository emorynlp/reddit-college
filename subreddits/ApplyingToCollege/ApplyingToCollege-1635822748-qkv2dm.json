  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to be a mechanical engineer. I have done cad models in the past as well as mechanical designs and physically built products. However I didn\u2019t have time to put them in a portfolio even though I do talk about them in my application cause the deadline was today and I was pressured into submitting early. Can I still sent that portfolio to schools I already applied for?",
