  "title:": "I Did Not Make it to the ED Deadline.",
  "text": "Applying ED and getting over with college admissions before the New Year was once a dream for me. And here I am, who pushed back her colleges to all RD because they didn't finish their essays on time and did not want to submit rushed, half-baked ones to her top school. Please tell me I am not the only one in this situation :( Now I am worried I won't get into any college at all. \n\nSenior year in IB sucks, and I wish my school would take into account those applying early when setting internal deadlines. I thought I did everything right: started brainstorming ideas for my common app essay back in January winter break, wrote drafts during the summer... I honestly don't know what went wrong, and after all the work I put in to make it ED, I lost all motivation to even apply RD.\n\nAlso, if you have any tips for managing a senior workload and college apps, I would highly appreciate them. \n\nTip for Juniors doing IB: please, completely (and I mean 100% done) finish your EE in the summer. Have drafts of your IAs in the summer. Finish all standardized testing in your junior year, and, if possible, ask your IB coordinator for a year-calendar with all the IA/EE deadlines. Don't be me.",
