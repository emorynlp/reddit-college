  "text": "MY school has no clubs or anything other than academic stuff (except sports and some mandatory activities), the school has excellent things to do in middle school but nothing to do in high school. Everything is focused on academics. No clubs to write about in the Activities section in the Application. School is ranked in top schools in the state and has the best faculties in the state.\n\nGot up the courage to approach to principal to allow students to form clubs and use school resources for projects. But dropped that idea because of being called out in front of everyone.\n\nThe cherry on the top is it is in India where nobody gives fluff about ECs and focuses just on academics. \n\nEveryone discourages the plan of studying abroad just because of cost and advice to ignore top tier schools in the world and take admission to any tier 2 or 3 schools in India.",

      "text": "You can talk about things you do for family (caretaking of anyone any age) or whatever interests you pursue outside school. It doesn\u2019t have to be club based, there\u2019s lots of schools with few to no clubs and also lots of kids who do stuff by themselves. You can be an independent too! Think about what you like, do you run a discord or play competitive online games? Do you shop and prepare food for grandma? Do you like to find out about the history of your part of the country or go to museums? Do you do yoga or ju jitsu or tennis? Any of these things can be mentioned as activities. They aren\u2019t \u201cless\u201d. Good luck, reach for whatever you want, you might get it.",
