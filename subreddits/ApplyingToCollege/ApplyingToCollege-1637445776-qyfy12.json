      "text": ">Please help\u2026interview tmrw\n\nI went through 7 interviews so far. None of them asked me about a time that I failed or anything like that. The closest thing would be \"What is one of your weaknesses?\", which only 1 person asked. All of them basically went like this:\n\n1. Tell me about yourself // Tell me about your high school.\n2. What do you do in your free time?\n3. How would others describe you?\n4. What are your academic strengths/weaknesses? // What are your personal strengths/weaknesses?\n5. What drew you to apply to (our school)?\n6. Why do you want to major in X // What do you want to be doing 10 years down the road?\n7. Random question or two, like what's your favorite book? or What is something you learned about yourself over quarantine? or How would you contribute to diversity on campus?\n8. Then you have 5-10 minutes to ask your interviewer questions about their experience or about the school itself, as well as the school's culture, sports, academics, and that sort of thing.",
