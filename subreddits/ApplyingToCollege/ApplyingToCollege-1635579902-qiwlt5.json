  "title:": "A high US News Ranking does not mean higher academic prestige",
  "text": "*This post was inspired by a comment of someone wanting to transfer from Michigan to WUSTL because of prestige.*\n\nThe undergraduate academic reputation score from US News and World Report (out of 5):\n\nWUSTL - 4.2\n\nUNC - 4.2\n\nUVA - 4.3\n\nUCLA - 4.4\n\nMichigan - 4.5\n\nCal - 4.7\n\nIn US News, Washington University is probably higher in the overall rankings because of retention and graduation rates, and some other things--like alumni donations. WUSTL has been at the top of the lists of schools where far more students come from the top 1% than the bottom 60%. About 22% of the class have families that make more than $630,000 per year, and 6% makes less than $65,000. (For Michigan it's 9.3% very rich; 16.5% normal to less.)\n\nNow, UNC-Chapel Hill has the same undergrad reputation score as WUSTL, but its student wealth scores are pretty much reversed (6 %: 21%).\n\nSince US News gives more weight to retention and graduation rates than academic reputation, WUSTL is higher up on the charts.\n\nAnd it is little wonder that the retention and graduation rates are higher when the student body is overwhelmingly well-off. If you are a middle class student struggling but still passing classes in your first or second year in college, you may decide to drop-out to work or go to community college for a bit and save money. You may be on a scholarship that dries up when your grades aren't great. If you're struggling but passing and your family makes $630,000 a year or more... well, you're getting a gentleman's C and maybe you should bring some of your textbooks to Tahiti over the break.\n\nOh, and student debt and alumni giving together are weighted higher than student selectivity. You know who is in a better position to graduate without debt and therefore be a little more generous with donations? People with rich families.\n\nSources: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)\n\n[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings)",

      "text": "Another comment about this:  academic reputation scores may not actually be as meaningful as we'd like.  IIRC they mainly poll university faculty and presidents.  That set of individuals is going to be hugely swayed by a school's faculty strength in terms of research output.  That may not match exactly how the average, say, hiring manager, thinks about these schools.  It also fails to capture regional differences.\n\nw.r.t. graduation and retention rates, money is certainly a factor, but also the caliber of students each school admits.  WashU likely admits a stronger set of students, as a whole, than Michigan, so even if wealth were the same we might expect a higher % of  Michigan students to blow up during their freshman year and/or fail to graduate.\n\nWhat would be nice is if we had perfect data and could model 6Y graduation rates based on each school's selectivity, major distribution (maybe some are less likely to finish than others), and the financial situation of its students.  Plus whatever else is relevant.  Then we could look at schools that are positive and negative outliers vs. what that model would predict.",

          "text": "1. Washington U is a ***great*** school. No doubt about that. It just isn't more academically prestigious than some lower ranked schools. This shouldn't be offensive, it is still very prestigious.\n2. You acting like 4-year-old social science research is hopelessly out of date is comical. You're a freshman now, so I shouldn't hold this against you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Find me data that isn't outdated\n\n3. How about you find me some hard research that in the past 4 years WUSTL has reversed its admissions policies to the point where it is on the same level as UNC-Chapel Hill? That would prove me wrong more than saying the equivalent of \"Well, Sophie graduated.\"",
