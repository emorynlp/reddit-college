      "text": "Don't beat yourself up. You are far from being alone in this. Pandemic school worked well for a small subset of students, but for most it was a nightmare. Grades dropped across the board.\n\nLuckily, most intelligent admissions officers know this, and will see from your transcript that you're a pretty solid student save for one bad semester in a sea of bad semesters for everybody. \n\nYou're not f****ed. We definitely need more nurses, so no school or hospital system is going to turn down a potentially hardworking nurse over one stressful English grade. And if they do, it probably isn't a good fit for you anyway.",
