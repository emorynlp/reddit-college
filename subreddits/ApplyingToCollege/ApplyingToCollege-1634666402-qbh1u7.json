  "text": "I just submitted my common app application and wrote 94.50/100 as cumulative GPA, however after the submition, my counselor called me and said it was actually 92.96/100.  After realizing I immediately sent an email explaining the situation to 5 colleges that received my application, and below is the email. Do you think this is a solvable issue? Would they correct the GPA? And would this affect my application? Thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI am -, an international applicant from -. My common app ID is -. About half an hour ago I applied to - through Common App, and just realized a mistake, and immediately after it happened, I am writing this e-mail. On the common app, in the cumulative GPA section, I wrote 94.50/100, but after submitting the application, my counselor informed me that it was actually 92.96/100 and she wrote it as such on her application portal. Thus, I kindly request you to change it to 92.96 or tell me what I should do in order to fix it. I am terribly sorry for the trouble, and if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to ask.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\\-",
