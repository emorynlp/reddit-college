  "text": "Some people say that I can't major in biomedical engineering if I don't do robotics. I think this is kinda stupid because you should be doing things you like. Robotics really isn't for me though. I don't like the idea of building robots, and I can't code. Also, if y'all can give me tips on what ECs I should do to be a biomedical engineer, that would be great.",

      "text": "Hey! I'm going into BME next year and I can say that this notion is absolutely stupid. There are SOOO many tracks of BME, whether it be Biomaterials, cell and tissue engineering, or Biomechanics. While Robotics can definitely be helpful if you are looking into Biomechanics, it isn't required whatsoever. There are other tracks of BME where you can delve into other topics, such as gene regulation, electricity and biosensors, and even going into the pre-med side. Btw what grade are you in?",

You should be taking the highest levels of math and science available to you - particularly precalculus or calculus as well as chemistry and physics.",
