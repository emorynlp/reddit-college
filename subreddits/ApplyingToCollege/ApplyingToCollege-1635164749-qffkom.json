  "text": "I'm ED'ing to either Penn or Cornell but have no idea which choice is better. From what I understand Penn is in an AWFUL neighborhood and the food/housing aren't great, while Cornell has an incredible campus, top-notch food and housing, and an overall better culture (along with being ranked higher in my major). \n\nMy dilemma is that I'm not a strong applicant - I'd say my EC's are above average, my GPA is average (4.3/5) and my SAT was only a 1540. My rec's are on the above average side but not much higher. I have legacy to Penn though, so my chances of getting in are nearly double that of Cornell. \n\nPlease help in any way you can - I have a great chance to be accepted into a great school, and a decent chance to be accepted into an exceptional school - which should I go with?",

It is in an urban area and there are areas several blocks from campus that are a bit sketchy. But there would also be no reason for you to venture into those areas.\n\nYes, the food is better at Cornell, and I can't speak for Cornell's housing, but those are not really strong reasons for choosing a college IMO.\n\nIf you like Cornell better, and the major is stronger at Cornell, apply there.",

Students go on to be some of the highest earners.  Boundless respect.\n\nAgainst Cornell: Ithaca is a shithole, and since it\u2019s in the middle of fucking nowhere you can\u2019t just go to a good part of Philly or NYC like you can at UPenn.  You\u2019ll forever be the one who went to the worst Ivy.\n\nUPenn is an objectively better school.  The fact that you have a better chance of getting in is a blessing.",

Penn is routinely voted worse campus of all the ivies.\n\nRegardless, I been to Penn. Campus isn't bad IMO, but most beautiful? Over Princeton and Harvard? nah\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nalso I think you misunderstand what objective means",
