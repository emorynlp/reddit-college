      "text": "It is a form with financial aid info, often required if you are applying for need-based financial aid. The information contained in the CSS Profile is used by colleges in calculating a student's financial need.\n\nVisit each of your colleges' financial aid websites and carefully follow their instructions for applying for need-based financial aid. If you are international and the college offers need-based financial aid to internationals, there will be particular instructions that apply to internationals on the financial aid website.\n\nIf you are a domestic applicant, run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.\n\nWhen the CSS Profile is due will vary by college and application deadline. Usually, it is best to submit financial aid forms by the application deadline so that you can receive your financial aid package around the time you receive your acceptance. If you applied to colleges yesterday and need financial aid, the time to submit your financial aid forms is NOW.",
