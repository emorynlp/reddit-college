I\u2019ve seen a few Caucasian friends throughout my time at high school that had Hispanic and Asian names but that didn\u2019t always correspond with their ethnicity.  Of course in most cases they do but not always and usually if you don\u2019t tell them explicitly they can only assume which in most cases they wouldn\u2019t since they don\u2019t have a benchmark to go off of.  CollegeBoard in particular can only report on your race/ethnicity if you tell them specifically.  If you don\u2019t report it, their algorithms are incapable of processing the data for demographic purposes whether it be for research or analysis.  This process is typically automated.",
