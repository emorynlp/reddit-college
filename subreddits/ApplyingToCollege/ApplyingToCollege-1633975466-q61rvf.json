Not mind-blowing, but decent.\n\nThird person I talked to was an english major from U Iowa, he claimed that my essay was \"amazing\" and one of the best college essays he's read (he does private essay counseling but my public school pays for him to come in and read out essays). \n\nLast person I talked to was my AP Lit teacher who's been reading these essays for more than a decade now. He pointed out a few things I should fix/play with but still ended up calling my essay \"pretty good\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTalk to more people.
