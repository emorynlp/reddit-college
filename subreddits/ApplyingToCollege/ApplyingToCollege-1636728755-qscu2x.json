  "text": "Hi fellow A2Cers! So I know to apply OOS for UC schools you need at least a 3.4, but is that your UC gpa or just your regular gpa. For example my regular is like a 3.3 \ud83d\ude43 but my UC gpa is a 3.5. So can I still apply?",

I don't know the answer to the question about eligibility, but being competitive is the bigger problem.\n\nLook at the admission data for UCs and consider the likelihood of admission to a UC that would actually be worth the out of state cost [https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/freshman-admit-data.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/freshman-admit-data.html) The only one where a 3.5 weighted would be above the 25th percentile is Merced.\n\nPSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nLots of housing issues at some UCs and CSUs right now - not enough space.",

Look at the link I left for you above, as it will take you to admission stats for each UC, including the middle 50 percentile range for GPA. I think the reported range is UC weighted GPA, though it could be UC weighted and capped.\n\nAs I said above, I thought your UC weighted GPA was 3.5. What does rogerhub give you for UC GPAs?\n\nAs you can see from the above link, UCSC's reported range is 3.81-4.20 for their admitted class of 2025. (UCSC costs 68k/yr out of state. Not an awesome value. See also the housing issue https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2021/09/13/thousands-of-uc-students-struggle-to-find-housing/)",
