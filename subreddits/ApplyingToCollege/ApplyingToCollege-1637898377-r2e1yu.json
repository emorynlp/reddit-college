I\u2019ve been following this sub for a while and one thing I find confusing is that it seems everyone is talking about essays?\n\nI\u2019m in Canada and the majority of schools do not require essays at all, no matter what program (usually Art is an exception).\n\nIs essay a huge thing in the US in general, or is it for some set of schools, or some certain programs?",
