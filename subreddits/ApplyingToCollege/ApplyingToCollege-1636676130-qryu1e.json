      "text": "PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\n OOS students pay 55-58k per year to attend CU Boulder, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nSometimes CU Boulder offers merit to out of state students, though the amounts are typically not large.",

      "text": "My kid goes there, and is enjoying it so far.  If you are in-state I think it's a good option in a lot of areas - especially in the physics/space science/engineering fields.  Whether it's preferable to Mines or Colorado State really depends on what you want to study and what kind of environment you want.\n\nIf you aren't in-state, it's a really expensive option.  Their location is so good they can attract a lot of students who can afford to pay the full OOS cost, so they don't need to use merit aid to recruit in the way some of their academic peers do.  That also skews the demographics of the school - for a public school they have a lot of wealthy students. Diversity isn't great either, although it's been improving (especially with the proportion of Hispanic/Latino students).",
