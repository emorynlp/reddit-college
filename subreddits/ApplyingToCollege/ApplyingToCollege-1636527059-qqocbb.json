  "text": "**Note:** I am just curious, I don't want to take away from those who need immediate help, so feel free to ignore my post if time is short.\n\nGeneral Questions I have include:\n\n* What sort of grades are required to get into top US universities (specifically UC Berkley, Stanford, MIT)?\n* How will re-sitting an exam affect an individual's chances?   \nE.g., if someone does bad in AS mathematics and re-sits the exam.\n* How many A-Levels should I be taking? Is 4 A-Levels too little?\n* How important is taking a foreign language? We don't get very many subjects in A-Levels, hence not too keen on a language but will take if needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal Question I have:\n\n* My school rid of IGCSE exams. They developed their own exams for NZ year 11 (sophomore year in the USA)\n* How important are these exams going to be?\n* What happens if I do bad here but get all A's and A\\* for my A-Levels?  \n*(Hoping this question isn't too much of a chance-me type of question)*",

More than 4, or 4 in unrelated subjects, is not required or desired.\n\n>How important is taking a foreign language?\n\nNo requirement to take a foreign language at A-level. But there is still the expectation of foreign language study in your years prior.",
