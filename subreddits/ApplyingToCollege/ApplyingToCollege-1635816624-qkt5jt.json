  "text": "Okay I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too dramatic, but I\u2019m genuinely losing sleep over my applications. Even though I\u2019m applying RD everywhere and taking everything step-by-step, I still can\u2019t help freaking out over them. It just constantly feels like I have a burden on my shoulders, and I don\u2019t know how to make it stop.",

      "text": "i was very anxious until i got close to finishing my apps, and ive been feeling pretty calm (with the occasional breakdown). i just remind myself im on the right track, having a schedule/staying organized helps a lot, bc i can look back on it and remember ive thought the whole process through and that i\u2019ll be fine. go outside for a walk or watch a funny tv show/movie. do things that make you happy in your downtime. also verbalizing your stress might help. i (un voluntary) broke down a couple times in front of family, and complained with my friends very often. writing in a journal might be another way to destress.",
