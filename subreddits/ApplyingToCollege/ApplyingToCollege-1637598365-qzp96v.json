  "text": "Hi, what do you guys think about applied math(statistics) and economics double major and teach myself programming need for dat science? \nYou don\u2019t really need the theoretical computer science for data science, and I can pretty much teach myself languages, tools and other concepts I need from the \u201ccomputer science\u201d side for data science? \n\nI am primarily thinking about math and economics because I want my bachelors to be open to not just data science, but other entry analyst jobs to start off with that might not need any coding. Also, do you think economics helps with domain knowledge in data science? \n\nML is a big thing in data science specialization, and I am thinking about teaching myself that too. Although might be hard, I think I don\u2019t need to be a computer science major to become a ml engineer. I am thinking bootcamps, udemy that also give certifications and books if I need them. There is always YouTube. On the other hand, teaching myself stat and economics might be harder, also especially because I have taught myself some programming for things already so I have an idea of how to use the online resources to teach yourself the programming although I haven\u2019t done any ml things yet. \n\nI know colleges have data science specialization or majors, do you think I should do that or double major in applied math(statistics) and economics, and teach myself the computer science tools that I am going to need. \n\nLet me know what you guys think...",

      "text": "Well, with all the resources on the web (Stanford, MIT , courseera , Udemy, YouTube) - one can learn any topic. At least for the first job, companies would look at your major and courses (along with projects). So having a formal degree helps if your primary interest is in data science.",
