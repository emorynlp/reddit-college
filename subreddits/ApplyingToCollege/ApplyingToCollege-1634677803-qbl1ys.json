  "title:": "Potentially Sensitive EC Religion Topic",
  "text": "So I was able to put together and run a Catholic Book Club with a good about of members (20ish active members). We read different theological literature and and even literature that goes against our own faith, (it's all pretty academic reading). With the recent scandals and more people being secular in todays society would it be smart to avoid mentioning this, or could I write about this? I have truly made good connections / friends in this group and put a sizeable amount of work into creating this. \n\nOpinions?",
