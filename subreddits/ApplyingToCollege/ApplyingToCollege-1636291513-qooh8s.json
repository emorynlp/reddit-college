  "title:": "(Un)popular opinion: It's okay that seniors are freaking out about the little things.",
  "text": "There's been an uptick of posts where seniors are wondering about the little things: a typo they made, how they haven't gotten an interview yet, etc. I've seen a number of really great responses to these posts, but also snide comments like \"chill\" or \"stop overreacting.\"\n\nFor a while, the latter type made me terrified to post about little things. I dreaded seeing someone drop by and tell me to chill, because it made me feel worse when I'm looking for some reassurance/ help.\n\nBut then I thought: are seniors really overreacting? For an international student like me, an acceptance to a US university is the difference between getting a world-class education and returning to a war-ridden home. For some of my friends, getting into university is the thing that just might break the poverty cycle. And for all of us, these applications are the culmination of our K-12 education and a stepping stone for the rest of our lives.\n\nWhen so much of our lives is banking upon these applications, we certainly have the right to be worried and ask questions freely. It's absolutely valid, and we should be able to do it without facing any random snide comments.\n\nSo if you're one of those people telling seniors that they're overreacting or something along those lines, please stop. It's not the right time to be doing that right now, and certainly isn't helping anyone. If you're not one of them, thank you for being helpful and considerate. You've helped a lot of people, including me.\n\nAlright, that's all I have to say. Have a wonderful day, and good luck to everyone during this application season!",

Of course, it's difficult to see that when you're in the moment, but in retrospect, you'll really be mentally slapping yourself for worrying over things that truly didn't matter. And I imagine AO's are being inundated by really trivial requests that for the most part waste their time.\n\nSorry if it comes off as harsh, but just another perspective.",

My life is ruined!  And this is not even the usual mistake that I'm known for!!  I mean, for which I am known!!\"\n\nStudent X reads this.  Realizes that they didn't even think to check on ending prepositions.  Goes back to their essays, finds two examples.  Thinks that it is something they also need to freak out about.  I mean, about which they also need to out-freak.\n\nThe \"chill out\" message is not for the OP of this type of message.  Everyone knows they're not going to chill out.  It's for everyone else reading the message who thinks that they also need to freak out because they made far more \"serious\" errors.  They are questioning their non-freak out status given the current evidence of freaking out around them.  \n\nThe \"chill\" message is an attempt at convey some reassurance: this is the kind of nonsense up with which you need not put.",
