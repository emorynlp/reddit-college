  "text": "Considering dropping AP Gov. For reference, an A+ in Honors would be an extra .25 to my gpa.\n\nMy school weights by giving .25 additional weight for honors, and .5 additional for AP.\n\nBasically, an A- in AP = A in Honors = A+ in Standard, which also means A+ in Honors = A in AP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
