  "text": "Hello, and thank you for clicking on my post. In high school I made a 3.25 GPA. This was heavily weighted down by my sophomore year where I got close to a C average. I had a very weak work ethic, and was very unhappy during that time in high school. In my junior year I did decent with like a 3.8 and a perfect GPA in my senior year, but even compared to that half of my high school career I am now a much harder worker. I have changed a lot, but unfortunately what is done is done. \n\nIm going to a alright public university for physics in Louisiana. It runs on a trimester system so you have 3 schedules every year.  This would mean that id be able to report 2 trimesters on a transfer application that I send out in march.\n\nI should get all As in my classes this semester and should be able to keep that up. not very challenging or at least I could handle much harder. I'm taking Calc 1, Physics mechanics, and Chem 1.  Along with a  couple required classes.\n\nI did decent on my SAT getting a 1430, but I could, and probably will, study for it and get 1500-1600 to have a better application for transfers.\n\nMy extracurricular here is not that much involved with the university but I have a lot of hobbies. Things like programming, chess, playing guitar. \n\nIf I built up a portfolio of programming projects, or improved my rating in chess significantly, or both. Would that make for an impressive extracurricular?\n\nI assume I would also need very good rec letters. I am a bit worried as to how I can make this happen though. Just doing very good in classes doesn't seem like it will be enough. How can I stand out to professors so that they would have something good to say about me?\n\nI love physics and math. I want an opportunity to study with other hard working students under top notch professors so I want to transfer into a very good school. I know the transfer rates for Ivy schools or ones of similar strength are extremely low. But I swear that if I was the way I am now when I was in high school I could have been competitive at schools like this. Is there any chance of getting in one of these schools. Is there any work that I could do that would give me a chance? \n\nAnd what about transferring into a good but not top, top school?",
