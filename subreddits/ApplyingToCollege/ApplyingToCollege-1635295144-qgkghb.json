  "title:": "A couple questions abt Wesleyan, if anyone knows",
  "text": "I'm interested in Wesleyan, probably ED 1, but I'm curious abt the student population. I've done the on-campus tours, virtual events, etc. but there are still a couple questions I have:\n\nWhat is the political diversity like? I'm center left and would like a college that respects both sides. Ik Wesleyan is liberal, but is it a college that one side bashes the other?\n\nHow are parties? Are they super tame, out of control, or perfectly in-between?\n\nAccording to a virtual event, someone said that \"A lot of students self identify as queer,\" is this true/what percentage?\n\nNone of these are really dealbreakers, but I am just curious",
