  "title:": "A couple questions abt Wesleyan, if anyone knows",
  "text": "I'm interested in Wesleyan, probably ED 1, but I'm curious abt the student population. I've done the on-campus tours, virtual events, etc. but there are still a couple questions I have:\n\nWhat is the political diversity like? I'm center left and would like a college that respects both sides. Ik Wesleyan is liberal, but is it a college that one side bashes the other?\n\nHow are parties? Are they super tame, out of control, or perfectly in-between?\n\nAccording to a virtual event, someone said that \"A lot of students self identify as queer,\" is this true/what percentage?\n\nNone of these are really dealbreakers, but I am just curious",

      "text": "Hello, current Wes Freshman.\n\n> What is the political diversity like? \n\nLiberal definitely, but I wouldn't say that people here shove it down your throat very hard. There are definitely very harsh critics among students about those who identify as conservatives, but I don't think it affects things very much.\n\n> How are parties?\n\nIt definitely depends on where you go. Most parties are very lowkey and are a BYOL (Bring Your Own Libations) event, so don't expect to go to parties and be offered tons of alcohol. Though, there are definitely a few which do get quite energetic and quite populated. Nothing i would describe as out-of-control, thouhg.\n\n> is this true/what percentage?\n\nI'm not really sure on a percentage, but it's true. In my experience, there is a much larger non-male identifying queer population than male identifying, and so as a gay male the dating pool is sort've small.\n\nBest of luck on your application! If you have any other questions feel free to ask; I know the deadline is creeping up fast.",
