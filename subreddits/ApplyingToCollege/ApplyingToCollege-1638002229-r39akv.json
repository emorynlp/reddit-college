Haven\u2019t got an interview letter, but since many people on the Internet claim that they\u2019ll arrange interviews online even if there are no alumni in your region/country, I would like to know your thoughts on this topic.\n\nEDIT: Panicking rn please someone answer lol",

If you don't get invited to an interview (ED) it most likely means that you won't be accepted, as almost all admitted students, at least internationally, are interviewed. I'm not fully sure about this so don't quote me on that.\n\n___\n\nOn a side note, check out r/IntltoUSA!",
