  "title:": "Is it bad that a quarter of my school is applying to schools I'm applying to?",
  "text": "For context, I go to a pretty competitive school, and my class size is around 400 kids. I'm shotgunning and applying to colleges such as UC Berkeley, CMU, and Cornell. 130 people have already applied to UCB, 75 have already applied to CMU, and 80 have already applied to Cornell. Is it going to be harder to get in with a greater number of people applying? Or is it proportionate with the acceptance rate?",

But to answer your question, yes you will likely be compared to your classmates. While I don\u2019t think there is a strict quoted, I highly doubt Cornell is going to take 80 kids from the same high school.",
