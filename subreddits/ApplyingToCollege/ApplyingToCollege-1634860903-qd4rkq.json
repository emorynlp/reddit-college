  "text": "Throughout High school, I\u2019ve never really thought hard and taken anything seriously in regards to what I wanted to do for college, and now during Senior year I\u2019m very anxious as I\u2019m stuck as I l\u2019m quite unsure on what to do. To those who have taken medicine, or Cs as their majors, or have taken both as a double major how is it? How did you know you were passionate in that field?",

But, okay I see, I\u2019ll try and take that to heart as that sounds like great advice. I\u2019m in between things in terms of I want to do, I\u2019m thinking of either being a nurse or studying for Cs, but I don\u2019t really know much about either field in terms of actually working in them. I kinda just want to experience what they do for a day and see what the  work environment for working in those fields is like",

CS I\u2019m not too sure, but afaik most people end up being software engineers so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a non glamorized YouTube video on what that\u2019s like. Your parents might know someone at their work or have friends that do CS stuff, you could see if you could shadow one of them\n\nAnd dw about wording you\u2019re good",

Anyways thank you for the great and astute response, I really appreciate your advice, and I would probably ask around about the experience to shadow nurses. Thank you again dude btw,",
