  "text": " Hello! I want to major in international relations in college, so I want to get some early experience or achievement by interning somewhere. I love writing about and discussing current events, so anything within that field would be an awesome opportunity. I also notice that there are far less internships for humanities high school students, so I'm having trouble finding some that would work for me. I prefer to work remotely due to the pandemic.\n\nAny suggestions or comments are appreciated, thank you!",
