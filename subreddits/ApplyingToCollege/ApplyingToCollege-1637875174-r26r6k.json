  "title:": "PSA: If you are applying to a Cal State school, you major matters a lot in admissions decisions",
  "text": "With those California public university applications due in a few days, there\u2019s lots of chatter about UC applications. Most people know that UC rejection rates are pretty high and even highly qualified straight A students with lots of AP credit and leadership may find themselves needing a fallback plan if they don\u2019t like UC Merced. \n\nMany of the CSU schools are awesome. They generally have smaller classes, and a ton of practical specialized majors designed to build skill sets that can win you a job. And the best are as good as or better than many of the UCs. Since there are no essays required (except in special cases where majors are severely impacted) and one application for all campuses it\u2019s an easy and obvious safety plan. \n\nUnless you apply with your major as CS, engineering or nursing. It can actually be easier for some people to get into Irvine, Davis or UCSC than SDSU, Cal Poly SLO, Long Beach or SJSU for those. That\u2019s because of the different approaches to admissions.\n\nUCs say they use \u201cholistic\u201d admissions, comparing applicants against others in their high school and considering how background and life challenges might play a role in their grades and accomplishments. That\u2019s what the PIQs and activities charts are for. \n\nCSUs generally admit by major, using a formula that heavily weights grades. They used a combination of grades and ACT/SAT scores until 2020, and are now tweaking new approaches. Basically GPA and a few other things like living in the local area, being first gen, or low income status are used to calculate a score for each applicant. They have an estimate of how many students they need to admit for each major based on past yield rates and use that to look at the pool and come up with a cut off score for each major. SJSU has a good clear explanation of how this works on their website that can be used to give you an idea of whether your application in that major is truly going to be a safety option in most CSUs. https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/\n\nSome other schools and majors provide past cutoff info if you hunt for it, especially very competitive ones. Cal Poly SLO uses a bunch of additional factors like extra English and math classes, participation in AVID, time spent working or in extracurricular activities and leadership to calculate their scores. That\u2019s a set of extra questions on the Cal State apply application. You need a lot of extra points to make the cut for the most competitive majors, like CS. \n\nWhile you can switch majors pretty easily most of the time at a CSU, it\u2019s hard to move into the most impacted ones. Nursing is exceptionally tough, even if you start as a pre-nursing major. A lot of computer and tech majors can be hard to switch into as well.\n\nAdvice: \n\n- only apply for a major if you have the grades/extra points to come close to the previous cutoff and/or you are sure that\u2019s what you want\n\n- if you are set on a particular CSU and not sure about your major, pick a less popular one (and check if you can because child development at Cal Poly had a shockingly high cutoff score from what I could guess) \n\n- one of the best safety options around is the guaranteed transfer options to the UC or CSU from California community colleges.
