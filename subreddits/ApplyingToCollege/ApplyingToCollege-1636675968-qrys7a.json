              "text": ">25-50% would be great\n\nSuch a school would merely take a little bit longer to go bankrupt.\n\nKeep in mind that other than five schools \u2014 Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst \u2014 every other school in the US is need-aware for international students. So you can cut any school\u2018s overall acceptance rate of 25-50% down to a fraction of that if you are an international applicant needing aid.\n\nThere is literally no such thing a safety school for an international student who needs aid.",
