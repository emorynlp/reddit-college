  "text": "Most colleges I\u2019m applying to\u2019s early action is ended in less then 2 weeks, and I\u2019m in a program that wants students to apply to at least 12 schools (I have 17). I plan to go for Acting or some form of performing arts and I\u2019m looking at audition requirements and I\u2019m unsure of when I need to do them. Like I\u2019m praying it\u2019s after getting accepted because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing 17 auditions. But I can\u2019t figure it out. Anyone out there who knows, please tell me!",

      "text": "Many colleges are auditioning online these days, so that's one benefit you have over the kids who did this before the pandemic. They needed to fly to Chicago to audition at unifieds in Feb. \n\nDo you have an account on Acceptd? That's generally the platform theatre schools use for initial auditions. You can film your best monologues and post them there. \n\nFor acting there are two acceptances - one to the college for academics, and one after your final audition, which usually takes place in January or February. So you might get an acceptance from Pace in December, but that's just to Pace's general undeclared major program. If their acting BFA department likes you, they'll have you film and send an additional audition, or they'll have you do it live for them over a zoom chat sometime in Jan or Feb.\n\nYou might have to audition for a school that doesn't end up accepting you academically, but that's more rare. CMU and USC sometimes do this because the admissions and theatre departments don't talk to each other until closer to decision day.",
