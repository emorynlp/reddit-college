  "text": "So I last minute decided to apply for MIT EA, I do not have school tomorrow, but My teachers and counselor have like a work day type thing.  would it be rude to ask them to attach their LOR and transcripts on the last day? They have already done so for the common app way back, but I sorta want to apply Ea for Mit. Or should I just wait for RD.  \n\n\nEdit: will the school care too much if they receive the LOR and Transcript late if the teachers do not notice the emails in time\n\n&#x200B;",
