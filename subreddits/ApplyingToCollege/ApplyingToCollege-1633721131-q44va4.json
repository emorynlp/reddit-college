      "text": "Do both.\n\nMake your college list, with the deadline for each that you plan on applying by.\n\nAlso plan to apply for financial aid by those deadlines, even if you have more time. Presumably you do want to receive a financial aid package as close in time as possible to any acceptance. \n\nNOTE, many colleges require other financial aid forms in addition to FAFSA, such as the CSS Profile. Check the financial aid application instructions on each college's website. Also run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",

              "text": "Just to clarify, you don't apply \"to\" FAFSA.  FAFSA is just a *form*. Eligibility for federal student loans (which are small) and Pell grants (also small) involve filing FAFSA, but the bulk of financial aid comes from the colleges themselves (and they each might have additional forms they require besides FAFSA). You are applying for financial aid *from the college*. Follow the college's instructions.\n\nYou definitely do not want to wait until you are accepted to apply for financial aid. You  do it *now*, *while* you are applying for admission.\n\nThe exact order in which you submit your college applications vs your FAFSA and CSS Profile *does not matter*. But, do try to get your financial aid forms submitted by the college's application deadline.\n\nExample of what you *would not want to do*: wait until after you get accepted, then apply for financial aid and find out that the college has none left.",

      "text": "FAFSA only really should take an hour or so, unless you have a complicated financial situation.  Because of that I wouldn't put it off - just sit down with your parents this weekend and get it done if you can. Being done on the early side can also matter for need based grants from your state -- those funds can sometimes run out.\n\nIf you have some school that has an early EA/ED date you really need to focus on it's fine to focus on that application first though.  As long as your FAFSA is in by the priority aid date of the school and your application is in on time, they don't really care about the order they receive them in.",
