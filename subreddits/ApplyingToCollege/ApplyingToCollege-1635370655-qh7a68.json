  "text": "Helppp I'm STUCK \n\nso for lit class at the beginning of the year my teacher made us write college personal narrative lessons and I wrote about swimming lessons I took when I was 7\n\nMy teacher really liked the beginning but she critiqued the end a lot (to be fair I kind of cared less and less as I went on bc I just wanted to turn it in) but I want to use it for my common app essay and have no idea how to end my essay. My teacher said it was very wordy (it was 735 words, I edited it today and brought it down to 689) but I'm not worried bc the last paragraphs are the longest and I realize a lot of it is redundant \n\nHow should one end a college essay? I was thinking about how I could say how when I study marketing in college how my 7 year old self will make me successful and explaining how I will do good in the future but idk if that's good or not",

              "text": "I think coming full circle is better with something more specific than just the idea of your 7-year-old self (though it's hard without having read your essay). But I think the way you are presenting it now with the 7-year-old spirit seems a bit cheesy unless that is specific to what you mentioned in the beginning (again hard to say without more context)",
