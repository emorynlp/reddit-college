  "text": "As the title says, I\u2019m just wondering whether it\u2019s fine to focus on maths even though I\u2019m applying for a computer science major. Of course, I do also talk about computer science and a couple projects. But for example, question 6 from the UC application is about an academic subject.\nIs it okay to talk more about maths if I have a better story to tell or will it harm my chances of admission?",
