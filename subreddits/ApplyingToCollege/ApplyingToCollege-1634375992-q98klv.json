  "text": "Hello,\nI am international who doesn\u2019t apply for financial aid, 1440 (720m, 720e) sat. My personal essay is rather strong and I have okayish EC\u2019s. I guess my interesting side is that I had to go through 32 months of mandatory military service (which is what my essay is about).\n\nI am looking to apply to a good school, one that will be worth studying in the US for. I know my SAT is weak for top20 but I was wondering what you guys were thinking about northeastern? Is that considered a good school? Is it worth it ? What are its stereotypes? \n\nDo you have any other ideas of schools I should apply ED for with my stats?",
