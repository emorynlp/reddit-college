      "text": "I swear I'm not procrastinating but....\n\nThink of procrastinating like not brushing your teeth or something. The consequence of that would be terrible breath for you to deal with. Why would you put yourself through that, especially when the solution's so simple? Just go brush your teeth! There's always a little bit of progress to be made.\n\nNow, since we're mostly wired for more immediate threats than college deadlines it can be hard to jump into action at any given moment. But should it make a difference if the consequences of not brushing show up in like a day or if they show up a few months or years down the line (like with not working)? No, that's completely arbitrary. Think of all you have to gain!\n\nIf you don't start, your breath will stink. Get to work!",
