Don\u2019t waste your money applying somewhere you won\u2019t actually go, but otherwise, apply everywhere because you can only really apply to college once (or twice if you go to a CC, but still)",

Also, some schools ask for a letter from your school corroborating your request, so if you don't actually fall in financial aid bracket, you might get denied.\n\nEdit: Forgot I was on new Reddit.",

That guidance represents the best interest of colleges, not students.\n\nApplying to more colleges gives you more power in the market: you choose the best deal for you.

They asked me how much my application fees were and I answered honestly: $810. I don\u2019t qualify for fee waivers, and I feel bad asking my parents for that much, so I worked over the summer to save up the money to pay for every single one of my application fees myself. My friends said that was $810 down the drain. \n\nThat\u2019s $810 for my future. I love school. I\u2019m excited for college.

I\u2019m applying where I can and some of those slots are taken up by big-name universities and some are a bunch of cheap schools. \nA little unrelated, but I need to apply to bigger universities and big name LACs, because as any person looking to prosper in English will probably tell you, where your degree comes from matters. It absolutely shouldn\u2019t, but at the end of the day a degree from Columbia or Bowdoin is going to look a lot better than one from the University of Iowa when applying for jobs. It\u2019s a sick prestige game and it shouldn\u2019t exist, but sadly it does. And if I want to do better than my parents I have to cast my net wide, safety and reach schools alike.",

Everyone has varying reasons for applying to a ton of schools - I think merit or need based aid factors are a huge part of this which I respect a lot. I get peeved (confused) though when I see students clearly just applying for prestige purposes when their combination of schools really makes no sense (no unifying factors that draw these schools together) for example, the structure and rigidity of the Columbia curriculum vs the fluidity if brown. Or the humanities focused core curriculum of Columbia VS the science focused girs at MIT. Or huge differences in school size, student life culture, or the quality of the program they are interested in.\n\nI\u2019m all for students applying to more schools if they can, but this just shows me that they haven\u2019t really done their research to the extent where they can have a realistic view of what their experience will be like and if they will enjoy it. There are always exceptions to the rule though, some people are amazing flexible and adaptable to varying situations and would be happy in a variety of places, but I\u2019m not one of them.\n\nEdit: peeved is not the right word here, I\u2019m not really mad about it, more just questioning",

          "text": "Some majors mean that schools are a major thing. People going into Investment Banking etc would tell you that recruiting nearly pretty much occurs only at top universities for the best places to work at. \n\nFor these folks they don't really mind the college experience culture etc but rather see it as a means to an end. This may be because attending a school in which you dont particularly like the student life of can be worth it if you can get into Goldman Sachs for example. (University can be viewed as education primarily not for culture or student life)\n\nOthers (like me) can also be encouraged to apply for some places due to parents pushing in a particular way (this is especially effective if they offer to pay of a list of universities of their choice). \n\nOthers again would also view college simply as a place to get the best education they can and thus will follow where they believe the highest quality programs is.\n\nFinally and probably quite commonly some people just love the name branding of some schools",

I know admissions are independent of each other. Shotgunning does work because so much of admissions is based on luck/ subjectivity. How your application is viewed depends a great deal on who reads your application and how they present it to the committee. For applicants who are generally well qualified (good grades, scores, ECs, recs), it is worth applying to many T20s. It probably won\u2019t work out well if your application is much less competitive than others, but people who want to shotgun usually know themselves well enough to determine if doing so is for them.",
