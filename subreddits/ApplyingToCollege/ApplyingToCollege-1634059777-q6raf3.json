I ran out of most options cause spring again and applied to as many privates offering good financial aid as I could. Don\u2019t care about anything really as long as it\u2019s cheap, and not in the deep red like wv or in the south cause I\u2019m a POC (not to stereotype, just wouldn\u2019t feel safe).\n\nThank you!",
