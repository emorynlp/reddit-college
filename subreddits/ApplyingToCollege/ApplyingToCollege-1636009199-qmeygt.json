  "text": "Title.  (tw slightly sensitive topics; ed/discrimination)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like this sub would have some cool ones! For context, I wrote the commonapp about competitive Scrabble and how exposure to the game opened up my passion for linguistics (I'm a tournament player but speak a few languages and I linked those). Then my supps for various schools talked about crime psychology/that being my career path, an incident with homophobia, my experience w my ED (ana), spelling bees, math homework being my enemy (yes, uchicago fun prompt) and more! but tell me about yours! :)",
