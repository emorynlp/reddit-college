  "text": "my mom working and having depression resulted in me not being able to get transportation to do many community service events. However, I have done a little bit and I really like it.\n\nSo if I were to say how I wasn\u2019t able to have transport and that limited the amount of community service and then say that the little bit I did do has significantly encouraged me to want to do more community service (and then list the programs I\u2019d be interested in). Would that be ok in a supplemental essay or is it going to sound like I was making up excuses ?",
