  "text": "I haven't even started my Common App essay yet, though I know what I'm going to write it about. That's not the problem though, it's my LORs. I have 1, which is all I technically \"need\", but Im applying as a STEM major and it's an English teacher \ud83d\ude29. Plus I'm going test optional, which means I really need strong LORs. I had another teacher lined up but for some reason when they submitted the LOR it never showed up on my end. It's due tonight and I couldn't possibly ask any of my teachers to write one by midnight . \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d What do I do?????",

I've finished my first draft after around an hour of work, it's at 950 words, I'm moving on to revising and cutting it down to under 650. And yes, I like it so far, but it definitely needs revising. My topic if your wondering is about how I tried fixing a hard drive error on a laptop but couldn't unscrew the back to get to the hard drive. So I left it for a while until I returned to it, only to discover that it was because I was turning the screwdrivers the wrong way \ud83d\ude0c. I then fixed the hard drive error and was greeted by a power adapter error. Anyways, it has a humorous tone, but overall I'm trying to show perseverance, an inclination to want to solve problems, being able to step back and take a look at the situation and see the problem, etc. I have a motif sort of? Idk what to call it. The error message, ERROR: HARD DISK NOT FOUND, reappears thought the essay. Idk I like it, it's fun. If I'm not finished by the deadline I'm cool with going RD for my ED.",

And even if I had, I did not come up with my new topic for it until this morning. I spent the time between my first one and this morning brainstorming ideas in my free time. Yeah, I still couldn't come up with anything until today \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. My common app essay will not change very much at all when I submit it for RD applications. I never expected my essay to be the strongest and I'm okay with that. I still have an hour if I had wanted to make any changes to it . My ED was the college that I know I'm only getting into by some miracle, so it doesn't really bother me that much. In fact the only part of my application that will change much for future RDs are my LORs and any supplemental essays that colleges may have. I'm very aware that I'm a horrible procrastinator \ud83e\udd74, but I do my best work in the few hours before stuff is due. I'll update if any of my LORs are able to get added on afterwards.",
