  "title:": "how many website views are considered \"respectable\"",
  "text": "So as a CS project, I created a website, and registered a domain and all of that, and started getting a decent amount of views, and not bad Google placement, but I was wondering what's a respectable amount of views for something like this? 1,000/month 10,000/month, 100,000/month?? *Like tbh I know 1000 means pretty much nothing as one of my random websites I forgot about that hasn't been touched in years gets that amount, but what would AO's consider a decent EC?* Are there other ways to quantify a website's success beyond just views and google search placement?\n\nAlso how do AO's verify this? I'm 99% sure that neither Cloudflare nor Google Analytics report this info to just anyone that asks, do they just take your word for it? Every month visits fluctuate +/- 10%, (normally upwards though :D) so if they theoretically had a way to verify and it was off by a margin of 10% would they get sus? I'm not saying i'd inflate views, but the \"free online traffic checkers for your competitors\" websites are often off by alot, no matter what website you look at, and I'd be really devastated if I had to put that value which is like 40% lower than actual traffic. (plus some are way higher or way lower than that)",

      "text": "AOs are not also SEO experts, so the specific number probably won't be very meaningful and there's a roughly 100% chance they're not going to try to verify whatever number you put down.\n\nI'd add, \"I  made a website with N views/month\" is kinda meh in general, depending on what the website actually does and/or whether you're making any money off it.  I could make a static site with a ton of free porn and probably get a decent number of views, but that won't (and shouldn't) impress anyone.",
