  "text": "I just applied and visited a college I want to go to and it\u2019s so stressful. I would have to live on campus and idk if I\u2019m ready to move out. Plus seeing all the classes I\u2019d have to take and then doing extra curricular activities just it\u2019s so much. Then the financial stuff and having a job too. How do you do it? How can I decide what to do?",

      "text": "Living on campus is not that much more stressful than living at home, except for the fact that you have a room mate.  This is good training for living with another person, which the vast majority of us will do at some point in our lives.\n\nThe number of classes you take is usually fewer than in high school.  Most high school students take five academic courses at a time:  math, English, science, social studies, foreign language.  A typical course load in college is five classes at a time.  In my experience, the workload for my college classes was not significantly different from my high school classes.\n\nYou don't really \\*need\\* to do extra-curricular activities in college.  Most people do them simply for the enjoyment.  For instance, joining a non-academic student group.\n\n\\*Paying\\* for school can be legitimately stressful if money is tight for you.  This is doubly true if you're having to work part time while taking classes.  This is, IMO, a strong argument for attending a less selective school \\*if\\* doing so makes the money situation more manageable.",

      "text": "\\-Living on-campus is does not require nearly the same level of logistic complexity or responsibility that moving out does. Sure, you'll do laundry and organize/clean (though I know students who don't) and maybe cook occasionally, but you don't have to worry about tracking all the bills since the school covers them or about finding a place or basic furniture. Mostly it's like living somewhere for summer camp, but for longer.\n\n\\-Figuring out the course requirements can be complicated, but most schools have more than enough time for you to explore for the first year or two and still complete a major on time. Just try to be aware of if you'll be completing a requirements-heavy major (chemistry in a lot of places), program (pre-med), or double majoring.\n\n\\-Financial aid can also also complicated\u2014luckily, once it's set up via FAFSA and scholarships and the like, your parents and you don't really have to actively worry about it more often than once a term when tuition is due.The source of the financial aid does not tend to change drastically from year to year (unless you fail a bunch of stuff at once).\n\n\\-Extracurriculars should ideally add utility to your life, AKA be fun given the amount of work they require. It's not like high school where being super involved and having leadership positions is necessary for a resume\u2014you can always get research/work/internship experience/TA instead. I know people who have few to no extracurriculars through the school and pretty much all their activities are vocational.\n\n\\-Having a job is not required either, especially in the first year. Some people don't get jobs all through school and only build experience through classes and internships.",
