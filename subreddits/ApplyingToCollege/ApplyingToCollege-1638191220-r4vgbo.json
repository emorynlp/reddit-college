  "text": "Hi! I'm stuck on the part of the UC app where we have to rank our preferences for college assignments. I'm applying as a Data Science major (really interested in statistics), and from what I've heard so far, most people rank erc and revelle last? Any recommendations on how to rank the other colleges based on GE? Any help would be very much appreciated, thanks!",
