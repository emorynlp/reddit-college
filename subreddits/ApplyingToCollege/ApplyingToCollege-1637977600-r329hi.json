  "title:": "Is it ok if I take US History online?",
  "text": "Helloooo! History (especially making those connections between different things and the \"big picture\") is not my thing; I absolutely despise it. APWH is like that right now so I'm assuming APUSH is too. I have absolutely no plans of going into social studies. Even if I do, it might be a minor to do with Asian culture. **Will it be okay if I take all these AP Social Studies 9th and 10th but I just take a regular US History online in junior year?** AP Gov and AP Econ sound interesting to me so I'm excited to take them. This may sound stupid but I just need other perspectives. :)\n\nEdit: By online, I just mean it will be on Edgenuity simultaneously with my other courses next year.",
