      "text": "Yes, for campuses that admit by major, your choice does impact your admissions chances.\n\nNo, you should not declare another intended major in the hope of switching later. For CS majors, it is often extremely difficult to declare the major at a later date. You should only apply to a campus in another major if you would attend that school without being able to study CS. Otherwise, you should go to a school that admits you in your intended field. A B+ will not be the deciding factor in your admissions decision. \n\nAt the undergraduate level, the field you study matters much more than where you study it.",

If they look at the classes individually, compared to my major, I think it would hurt.",
