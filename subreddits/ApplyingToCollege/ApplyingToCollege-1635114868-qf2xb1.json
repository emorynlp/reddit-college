  "text": "Basically I was a moron and I forgot to send scores to UMD, I just sent them (didn\u2019t rush, saw online that it\u2019s not worth it). Is there anything else I can do? I\u2019m not too worried since I don\u2019t think I would go if I was accepted but I want to keep it as an option, so I\u2019m sort of panicking right now.",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat lol. I spoke to my UGA admissions officer and she said as long as my SAT scores go in during the review period, they'd be looked at. If they don't go in, my application will be moved to the regular decision pile and ofc my scores will be in by January cause I ordered them last week. I'm assuming UMD has a similar thing too. But I would always suggest reaching out to your admissions officer, if you know who it is, and letting them know your scores might be late.",
