  "text": "Hi all, I was wondering if Harvard had any classes that use experiential learning as I\u2019m going to make that appeal in my college essay, that I learn well by that method, and hopefully one of the majors I\u2019m applying for teaches that way so I can use it in my essay. I tried googling it for a while though I couldn\u2019t find anything.\n\nI\u2019m going to major in Political or Environmental Science, if that helps. \n\nThanks for any help!",

          "text": "Thanks, I found something! And this is a different question so feel free to not reply, though I was looking at my essays and I know the college essay is supposed to be more geared to the college and show what qualities you can bring to the college, versus the more generic common app essay which can be sent to multiple colleges.\n\nThrough I got confused because the prompt I chose for Harvard was: a list of books you read in the past 12 months. Is that just to get to know you as an applicant?",
