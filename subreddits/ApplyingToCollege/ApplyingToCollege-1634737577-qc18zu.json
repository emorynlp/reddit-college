  "text": "I have an essay to submit in around 2 hours and I've barely started so I'm going to make this quick.\n\nI've been meddling around with the fafsa website for quite some time now and it's honestly getting on my nerves, but what's the most surprising part about this is that I couldn't find another post on reddit(or anywhere for that matter) that has expressed the same level of disdain that I'm feeling right now. I messed up with the college list that I had inputted on the list, which determines how much and which schools would be considering me for financial aid, as most of you probably know. Now I kid you not I have at least logged on 10 times throughout the past week on multiple web browsers(chrome, edge, internet explorer, opera gx) and if the website wasn't already down because apparently the US government can't get a website set up properly, I would always be greeted with a message that said \"fafsa is currently not available\" or something like that AFTER editing the school list. All of this with the delightful cherry on top where I would have to wait around 5 minutes before finally getting on to the page where I can re-enter my school list. \n\nI've read something saying that there is some type of app that I can download which would probably be more user friendly, but sadly my app store does not provide such an application, guessing that you have to have the US app store for this to be an option. I've tried everything and I'm honestly out of ideas here.",
