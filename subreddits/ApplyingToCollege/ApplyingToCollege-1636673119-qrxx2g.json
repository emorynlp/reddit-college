Especially if you\u2019ll be applying for financial aid.\n\nCollege is too big a decision, and too expensive an outcome, and young adults need to understand this stuff to be prepared for the world.",

          "text": "Out of sheer curiosity, can I ask why? My parents raised me with a vague idea on their salary (idk their exact salary; but I know the ballpark within about 15k) because they wanted to make sure that I know what my family realistically has and what I should expect from it.\n\nI\u2019ve just been raised with an idea that it\u2019s better to talk to kids about money as early as possible so they get how you spend your money, save/invest it, and know the limits of spending a family can afford.\n\nAgain, this is a great example of cognitive dissonance and I really just want to hear your perspective (ofc only if you feel comfortable sharing) :)",

              "text": "I mean, there are salary estimators out there so if anyone wants to know what I make then they can probably land in the right ballpark by using one of those.  I wouldn't withhold the information if asked; I just don't feel the need to volunteer it.  One thing I'd like to avoid is the situation where my kid tries to argue, on the basis of my financials, that I should be willing to spend more on college than I am.",
