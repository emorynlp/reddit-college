  "text": "There are so many students, that all the recs they write seem generic. Students turn in an application of sorts and the councilors write up a rec based on that. As a sophomore, what can I do to show my councilor my strengths, not in a written application but by knowing me personally? I go to a pretty completive school, top 200 nation wide and many of the students have great scores and ecs and I feel looking at mine she might not be impressed. I've only talked to my councilor for small things unrelated to me. Should I just go ask her question? even if I have none? What are somethings you guys have done to create a stronger mutual understanding for each other?",
