  "text": "I keep seeing people talk about how they are scared that their supplementary essays aren't good, or that they haven't started writing them yet. But, for art/design students, y'all worried about your portfolio? Like it feels so simple, just \"submit # of your best works\", it's literally just putting files into slideroom, but theres always unspoken requirements. Like how you shouldn't have a portfolio full of only 1 type of work, eg. illustration or photography. Or how some want to see process and sketches, even though it isn't technically your \"best\" work. If you look through my post history you can see that I have been really trying to improve my portfolio, but every time someone gives a critique I get so pressed. Any one else feel this way?\n\nAlso i'm not saying that the essays aren't important, i'm just saying that the portfolio is an extra thing to worry about on top of the essays \ud83d\ude2d.",
