Keep in mind that class of 2025 score data is dramatically skewed due to test optional policies. I don't think I've seen any info on the percent admitted test optional at Northwestern, or a score range for ED, though try googling.",

              "text": "Correct. The fraction of students admitted or enrolled without scores at highly selective schools ranges from a quarter to a half or more. (Obviously depends on the school.) Note that admitted student scores are higher as a group than enrolled and also that test optional students are more likely to enroll (have higher yield), just some context to keep in mind when trying to decipher published score data.\n\nIf you can find data for earlier classes in the scores-required era (2024, 2023), that also might be worth considering as a truer picture of the score range. See the college's Common Data Set section C9 (CDS 2020-21 has score data for class of 2024, CDS 2019-20 has score data for class of 2023.)",

      "text": "A very common misconception is that it is easier to get into a college in Early Decison, because the acceptance rate is higher. While you may get a slight boost to your chances based on the commitment aspect, there really is no difference in the types of students that get in ED versus regular decision. If you got in one round, odds are you would have gotten in the other. For the rarer chance that you get deferred then accepted, that is most likely because the college did not want to take any more students ED, so they moved you to the regular pool and accepted you there. To answer your question, odds are the middle 50 percent SAT for ED is equal to or higher than regular decision. There are overall more competitive candidates applying in ED, so the college accepts a larger portion of those from an even smaller applicant pool, resulting in a higher acceptance rate, but a constant type of student accepted.",
