      "text": "\\- that small differences in rank are meaningful after college graduation\n\n\\- that FAFSA EFC is what you can expect to pay. (To clarify, colleges use the FAFSA form to help calculate need. However, FAFSA EFC, by itself, does not tell students what they can expect to pay. It is not enough info. Many colleges require additional forms such as the CSS Profile or the college's own form, considering both income and assets and often noncustodial income and assets as well, and each college has its own level of available resources and uses its own unique formula in calculating need. Run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate.)\n\n\\- that the UCs are worth applying to out of state. (For certain majors, from families who can afford full pay, maybe, if you don't mind the overcrowding and you really want that atmosphere. In most other cases, not a great value. PSA, no need-based aid out of state, 65-70k/yr.)",

But, that's how it is with the world of college admissions, kids don't know what they don't know, and come to forums like this in their own time. There's a new crop every year, gradually throughout the year.\n\n(E.g., mark my words, there will be some unfortunate out of state poster in March, overjoyed with their acceptance to UCLA, asking how they can find their financial aid package... This happens every year, which is why I take every opportunity to post on UC threads, to get the message out.)",
