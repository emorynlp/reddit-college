  "text": " \n\nThere are students applying for a program of study in a college. They all have passed the same prerequisite courses in a certificate level in the college, and now their unweighted GPA (0-4) is submitted for selection process together with some other scores from other categories.\n\nThe director of the program specifies for GPA 40 points from total 93 points she has given to all different categories. The lowest GPA allowed to participate in this competition is 2.5.\n\nThere is another category which is a standardized test, and students have been given scores in the form of percentage. The lowest percentage allowed to compete is 70 percent. The director of the program has assigned 30 points for this standardized test. The table she prepared for assigning the relevant point to the achieved score of each student has two columns one for percentage score which she has started from 64, assigning zero to it; and the successive rows contain 65, 66, 67, ...100. the other column which is the points column starts with 0 as I said opposite to 64, and then 0.83 opposite to 65, 1.66(0.83\\*2) opposite to 66, ..., 30 opposite to 100. \n\nWould you please let me know how the table according to which each student's point for his or her GPA should be assigned will look like? ( The lowest GPA allowed to participate in this competition is 2.5.)The selection process is solely based on who has got the highest score after summing up the points from all the categories with total possible points of 93.",
