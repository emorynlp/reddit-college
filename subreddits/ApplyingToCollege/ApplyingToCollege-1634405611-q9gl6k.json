  "text": "Title basically; I've also played a varsity sport and done a couple other summer programs throughout high school but didn't have any space in the Common App activities section to put it down. According to the phrasing of the additional info section, it says \"Do you wish to provide details of circumstances or qualifications not reflected in the application\" and technically these would be \"qualifications not reflected in the application\". Would y'all recommend I include these in the Additional Information section? Or would AOs be annoyed at this? Thank you!",
