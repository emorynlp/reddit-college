  "text": "So I've been applying to colleges and am kinda confused what my target schools whould be.\n\nI've shortlisted UW Madison, UT Austin, University of Minnesota and UCSD.\n\nWhat other colleges should I add to my target list. I'm an international student with a 1540 in the SAT, okay ECs and am planning on majoring in CS.\n\nShould I apply to UIUC, CMU or UCLA? Are there chances of me getting in there.\n\nedit: Most of my shortlisted target schools are reach schools. What CS colleges should somebody target with a profile like mine?",
