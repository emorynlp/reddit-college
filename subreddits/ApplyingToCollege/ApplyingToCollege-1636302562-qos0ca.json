  "text": "So, I was thinking of sending an application to Notre Dame. Academically, Ik it's in the T20s and I have read good things about its English Department. However, I wanted to know if I will be welcome there as a queer poc. 'Cause it's a Catholic school and I am not really religious. Plus, I have read some reports about how its LGBTQ+ students were discriminated in Notre Dame's Mendoza School of Business by the administration. Ik that it's student body is split evenly with regards to its political affiliation, and that doesn't really bother me, nor does its lack of Greek life. Can someone currently attending Notre Dame enlighten me a bit? I will probably ask in the school's subreddit as well, but I wanted to ask here first. Thanks in advance!",

          "text": "What I will say is that the reddit thread you linked was from 4 years ago, to be fair, and in that time span ND has improved a lot towards these issues. Still not as liberal as most T20s, but they are getting a lot closer to it. As a freshman and from my personal experience, I'd say that the Niche survey is kind of BS and at least half of ND students identify as Democrats. Most of the republican or conservative thinking students I've met have been seniors, and since they are leaving this year it shouldn't be too much of a concern. Even as a minority attending here, everyone has been absolutely splendid and open.",

      "text": "I'm currently attending ND, and while I personally am not LGBTQ+, I know that people here in general are very accepting of them! There was one homophobic girl senior who came to trash the LGBTQ awareness festival at our dorm by writing a really messed up article, but everyone in our dorm condemned her and signed off on a response to her anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. It was actually kind of heartwarming because in our group chat everyone was talking shit about her and her values and supporting the people in our dorm who were LGBTQ to not let her words get to them.\n\nIn regards to the religious factor, I will not lie that the administration is really religious, but there actually is a lot of people from what I know who are Muslim, Jewish, and even atheist. Religion is offered from the classes and the dorms but no one pushes you to actively be involved. From what I know ND has made a lot of strides in improving diversity with each incoming class (both in race and in religion). The new 2025 class had US students of color and international students make up nearly 40% of all incoming students. The business school students are a bit conservative but only mainly with regards to the economic side, and I'd say that even including them Notre Dame as a whole has more liberal students than conservative.\n\nTLDR: ND is becoming a lot more accepting to everyone, so don't worry! \n\nAlso if you have any more questions, feel free to PM me!",
