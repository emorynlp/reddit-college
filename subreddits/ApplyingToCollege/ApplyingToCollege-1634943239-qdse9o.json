  "text": "so today i was filming a dance audition video for one of my early schools.\n\nwe had filmed over 75% of the video when my teacher decides to (for the first time during this entire 2.5h period) rewatch a clip we had just filmed to make sure everything looks fine, only to see an error message displayed on the screen. so he takes out the sd card and puts it in his laptop to see if any of the other videos we filmed were messed up: all but the very first clip we filmed was corrupted. why he wasn\u2019t checking continuously to make sure nothing was wrong with the clips is beyond me considering:\n\n1. this exact thing has happened before to a friend\u2019s audition video that they filmed (using the same camera)\n\n2. said camera is a 5+ year old camcorder\n\n3. he buys cheap sd cards\n\nso anyways i brought the camera and sd card home to my dad who works in tech and he said there\u2019s nothing he can do to fix it \ud83e\udd29\n\nwe\u2019re filming again on monday morning and i\u2019m bringing my dad along to film it because i have trust issues now \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 i\u2019m so excited to film another 5 audition videos with them \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29",
