  "text": "A while ago, I made a chance me post for my dream school. It\u2019s competitive and with my stats, it just didn\u2019t seem possible at all. All my ECs were work related since I had to help support my family, and I seriously lacked transportation for any after school programs. My freshman year was a disaster due to all the hardships that came with belonging to an impoverished family. My SAT was...not that great as I hadn\u2019t learned a lot of the concepts. I was a mess.\n\nI\u2019m not mad at the people who chanced me. They were just being realistic. It hurt to see that my chances at getting into the university were near impossible, but somehow, it triggered me to fight harder. I studied hard, used the city bus to get around, and worked hard to impress my employers (I still hate retail). Doing this, I brought my GPA and SAT up, became the vice president of my high school\u2019s NHS, and I even managed to get a rec letter from my boss. And you know what?\n\nThey gave me a chance.\n\nI went from thinking \u201cHow could a poor black girl become an Engineer?\u201d to \u201cIt\u2019s really freaking happening.\u201d I can still barely believe it. When I first found this sub, I thought it was a wrap. I thought \u201cLol, ain't no way\u201d every time I saw someone with God tier stats got rejected from somewhere. I felt hopeless until a few of this sub\u2019s members gave me some words of encouragement. Although I did have my down moments, I still did everything I could to improve myself.\n\nIt was a battle getting here and I have every intention to keep fighting for my other goals in life. I'm in love with my future and I feel great.\n\nUpdate:\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t expect this post to last this long lol. I thought it would be removed because it\u2019s kind of an acceptance post. I really just wanted to share my experience for the other low income members of the sub. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged when you see the other students stats and achievements. \n\nStudents who live in a situation similar to mine: You do not need to have academic/athletic extra curriculars to go to college. Don\u2019t feel bad that you can\u2019t join the robotics team because you have to work when they meet up. You are doing one of the greatest ECs of your life: caring for your family. Good luck, you got this!\n\nWith that being said, THANK YOU EVERYONE! For the kind words, the congratulations, and the awards! I am ready to take on U of M!",
