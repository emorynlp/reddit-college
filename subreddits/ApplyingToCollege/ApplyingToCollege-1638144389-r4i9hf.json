  "text": "Does anybody else really wish they could read their recommendation letters? I have 3 from teachers and I\u2019m a very outgoing person so I have good connections with them all and feel like they\u2019re pretty good. I also had an alumni rec for one school and I\u2019m just curious. It\u2019s not that I want to resd it before I send them out, because they\u2019re all sent out already I just want to know what my teachers had to say about me and how that could determine where I go. Anybody else?",
