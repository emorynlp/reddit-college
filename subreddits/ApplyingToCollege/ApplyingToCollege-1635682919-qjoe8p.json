Whether it remains a link in whatever online system AO\u2019s use on their end is unknown/unclear.  But several AO\u2019s who post here say that no one will click on a link in your application.\n\nYou can surely put it there for \u201cproof of concept\u201d but I would assume it will never be clicked on.  (I have one in my resume for this reason.)",
