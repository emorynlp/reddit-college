I got the vibe that CMC was mostly econ/poli sci people who are notorious for having kind of a \u201csnake-y\u201d vibe although I don\u2019t think that\u2019s representative of everyone on campus. I also think if you\u2019re a minority you might feel more welcome at Pomona. Academically, CMC is more pre-professional where Pomona has a very classic liberal arts feel. CMC also has a bigger athletic culture (hence their gym) and is more politically conservative. I think the students that attend really like their respective schools, it just depends on fit and personal preference.\n\nHere\u2019s a link that answers your question so you don\u2019t only get one opinion!\nhttps://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/cmc-vibe-compared-to-pomona/1725633/3",

There's a lot of schools that have one or two mission style buildings, like LMU has a few, but also mixed in with some very modern architecture.",

I think it's part of the hyperbole in this sub, where people have 'always dreamed of going to Duke' or something like that, but have never really looked into it. UCSF is only for graduate medical fields (and related studies).",
