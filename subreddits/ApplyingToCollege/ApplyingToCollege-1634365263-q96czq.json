  "text": "So I have been in so much stress lately mainly because I keep on wondering if applying to t20s is worth it if I am an Indian expecting financial aid at these institutions. I've read numerous articles claiming that it would immensely hurt your chances if youre asking for aid. I just have no idea as to what can i do to increase my chances of getting accepted into these instituitions. My stress has now started to affect my life- I am barely interested in anything, I prefer being alone, panicking about my fututre. I also wanted to know if any international does gets in with financial aid. I agree there are need blinds like Harvard, Yale, MIT, Princeton, Amherst etc, but theyre bloody competitive to get in. What should I do to increase my chances? Should I even consider applying for Undergrads? Or wait and apply for MS and focus rather on getting in top indian instituitions?",
