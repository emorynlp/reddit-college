  "title:": "23 year old father going to college for my daughter, but I have no idea where to start.",
  "text": "My parents weren't exactly \"involved\", and they never talked to me about college. Long story short I graduated by the skin of my teeth pretty much on great test scores alone, and I fucked my life up for a few years until I had a child. I turned my life around for her, and I want to go to college to provide a better life for her. But like I said, nobody ever discussed college in depth with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not dumb, I was just lazy and never did any class work other than tests, and I always scored pretty much the highest score in the class. And since having a child, working hard is no issue for me nowadays. I believe the time is right and I'm ready to start classes... but I have no idea where to start and I don't particularly have a lot of extra money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could give me advice, or things you wish you would have known before applying for a community college, I would greatly appreciate it.",

You can sit down and plan your course of study, which classes you need, how to fill out a fafsa and apply for financial aid, how to use the school's online platform (Canvas, etc) and register for your first semester. They will also help you plan your transfer and articulation agreement with the university where you intend to finish your bachelor's degree.\n\nGood luck! You can do it.",

      "text": "You can find a lot of basic info in the wiki at the top of the subreddit about applying to college generally. I would start by reading through that, just to get an idea of the application process.\n\nIf you are considered independent for FAFSA purposes, that would help with getting need-based financial aid -- from colleges that offer generous need-based aid. [https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/fafsa-dependency.pdf](https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/fafsa-dependency.pdf) (Perhaps the following might apply to you: \"Do you now have\u2014or will you have\u2014children who will receive more than half of their support from you between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023?\" Answering Yes would make you independent. Same for being married.)\n\nRun the *Net Price Calculator* on each college's financial aid website to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nConsider whether you want to limit your search to colleges that are within a certain geographic distance from your child. Seeing what colleges are out there can sometimes be as simple as a map search.\n\nIf you will be attempting to work full time and go to school, community college is an obvious option. If you live in a city with four year universities, some may offer a night degree program for nontraditional students that is worth checking out.\n\nAlso google for blog articles on nontraditional students, or adult learners, trying to go to college.",

They can be so beneficial for not only academic planning (if you want to eventually transfer to a 4 yr institution, you'll want advice from one of the counselors at the cc to plan your coursework.), but support in and out of school, less 'shock and awe\" having been out of school for awhile, and general GOOD STUFF of life. Two sons and I took classes in the \"academic. center\" of a community college system. Some of the best instructors any of us had including top 20 universities. Much more in tune with adult students conflicting schedules, demands of many facets, and desire to do well. Good Luck!",

There are even some 2 year degree such as computer science or a respiratory therapist, etc that you can make good money from. There are also degrees which are set up to \u201cflow\u201d smoothly to the local 4 year colleges. If you do very well in CC you can join the honor society and probably get a nice scholarship to a 4 year when you transfer. Usually you will save some money too by doing 2 yrs at the community college rather than the 4 year. You might also feel more comfortable at first at the community college, since there are more non traditional age students. Good luck.",
