  "text": "Hi A2C, this is Arpi Park. I\u2019ve been around in the college YouTube space for a while.\n\nThere was a post yesterday that has since been deleted that shows how I plagiarized a paragraph from an NYT article by Jessica Bennett on RBF. Here\u2019s the article: [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/fashion/im-not-mad-thats-just-my-resting-b-face.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/fashion/im-not-mad-thats-just-my-resting-b-face.html). First, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that I wronged Jessica Bennett by copying her work.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the OP to delete the thread, but it\u2019s been deleted. I also deleted my comment because I figured I could make a post instead. I also tried posting this a few hours ago but it was removed for linking my essays.\n\nThe main takeaway was that I did copy the paragraph from the article. I changed a few words around, but I used the same sentence structure, setup, punchline, etc. I basically tried to use the same joke without copying it word for word. I also used Su at Su\u2019s idea for a Stanford short question. I meant what I wrote, but I did get the idea from them.\n\nBesides those two examples, I spent a lot of time poring over essays I found online. The ones that come to mind are Su at Su, Spirited Gal, Eleni Arizona, Tiffany Ong, Nicolas Chae, Danielle du Preez, Jasmin Dalsgaard, and various articles/books. I didn\u2019t copy anything else. You can judge that for yourself if you\u2019d like. I deleted the website that used to have my essays and put them on a Google Doc instead. The mods said I can\u2019t share them here, so I\u2019ve posted them onto my Reddit profile. Su at Su has deleted their blog, so out of respect, I won\u2019t post any of their work on here. I imagine that they deleted the blog for a reason, so I would encourage not digging for it.\n\nI don\u2019t have an excuse for what I did. Back then, I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, and I was wrong.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that I have a platform. The first video on my channel was about my college essays. I really thought I had figured something out and tried to share it with others. I treated myself like some sort of college application guru. I then went on to build up my channel using Stanford\u2019s name. It\u2019s all very scummy. I've removed the videos having to do with Stanford from my channel.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the dishonesty and plagiarism as well as profiting off of the over-hyping of college admissions. And if I took a spot away from a more deserving applicant, I\u2019m sorry for that, too.\n\nPeople have already notified Stanford\u2019s admissions officers, so I\u2019ll hear about the full consequences soon.\n\nAs a side note, I ask that people stop spreading unrelated rumors about my personal life and those around me.\n\nEdit: [Further notes](https://www.reddit.com/user/ramyunhair/comments/m8agnm/further_comments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

I figured my glasses would cover the circles under my eyes.  \n>  \n>Only later did I behold what I looked like \u2014 and it was [terrifying](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102977828893830&set=a.763613545180.2418823.907446&type=1&theater). It wasn\u2019t that I was disheveled; it was the actual face that looked back at me in the frozen screen shot. My mouth curled slightly downward, my brows were furrowed, my lips were a little pursed. My eyes aimed forward in a deadpan stare. I looked simultaneously bored, mad and skeptical. I was basically saying to the newscaster: *Die*.  \n>  \n>In that moment, I joined the ranks of a tribe of women who suffer from the scourge known as \u201cresting bitch face\u201d or, increasingly, just RBF.\n\nThe essay excerpt:\n\n>Receiving my 9th grade ID card, I nearly jumped when I saw my picture.  \n>  \n>I must not have heard the photographer say \u201cSmile\u201d as he took the photo. I just sat with my neutral expression (a terrible mistake).  \n>  \n>My eyebrows angled sharply, my eyelids slanted downwards, my lips slightly pursed, my eyes locked in a cold stare\u2014I somehow looked bored, judgemental, and mad all at the same time. My face was basically telling the photographer, \u201c*Burn in Hell.*\u201d  \n>  \n>I then realized I had a problem. I suffer from what is commonly referred to as \u201cResting B\\*tch Face\u201d (RBF for short). When my face is relaxed, I unintentionally look very angry.",

I would not call this essay distinctive in anyway; the only thing he changed was the context and switching certain words out for synonyms.",

This was a great apology, but let's not pretend that it isn't a \"huge deal.\"\n\nAlso, citing sources for a personal essay is the easiest way to get immediately rejected by a college.

It's still a very good essay that captures an interesting side of his personality in a fun way. \n\nCiting sources in a personal essay is also not a death trap. You're allowed to take inspiration from other people and repackage them to develop your own arguments. Of course, in this case if he cited the  joke, that would have been counterintuitive, since it goes against the reason he used it to begin with. \n\nMaybe I should be more specific when I say huge deal. Plagiarism is wrong, and I'm not here to defend him. I don't care. But, I don't think that joke was the sole contributing factor to his acceptance. In other words it didn't make or break his application and therefore it doesn't seem, *to me*, that he stole a seat from another applicant. He's got a sense of humor, he could have come up with something else (even if it wasn't much of a banger) and the result would have been all the same.\n\nOf course, that's just conjecture, or god forbid, an opinion.",

It would have to infringe on the IPC policies, given that it is a copyrighted content. This excerpt falls too short to be considered an infringement of copyright policies, since the copyrighted material here is the article not each single paragraph. Assuming Arpi did not admit stealing the paragraph, it could very well pass with no consequences in a court of law. Anyone can start a paragraph with a story about taking a picture, having a dead face, using that word choice, saying something with their face to a person, and introducing a concept as a result. It is way shorter than being legally considered \u201coriginal content.\u201d However, copying the structure of the article as a whole even with great modifications would be copyright infringement. Anyways, plagiarism is sh*t. This is definitely unacceptable, but it would still have been deemed legal in a court given OP didn\u2019t plead guilty. Also, if this was taken as is right now to the court of law, his online confession would be not admissible as evidence.",

Plagiarism is stealing, if someone was stealing from a store or a bank you'd arrest them and put them on trial where they'd receive the sentence they deserve. Also, it doesn't matter how much you steal. If someone stole a pencil from a store and someone else steals 3 million from a bank both are still thieves.

Idrc if you take homework answers off the internet but, taking someone else's essays/papers and/or creative work is just plain wrong. Like, imagine writing something off your personal experience and someone else claiming that it's theirs. You can have a similar experience to someone but, no one can truly have the exact same experience as someone else due to factors that affect one's perception. Sure it might be 90% similar but, it's not the same that's why it's not justifiable.",

I took the post down primarily because I was concerned about your well-being, but also because I felt like there was genuine malice brewing in the comments.\n\nI'd like to say that I fully considered the impact this would have on your personal life, or what it's really like to be vilified by the internet, but I didn't. All I can really say is that I'm sorry for the undue hatred being sent your way\u2014and if worse comes to worst, and Stanford decides to expel you because of this, I hope you'll believe me when I say that I'll be sorry for that, too. I trust that they'll see your track record and will choose to believe in your growth and forgive you. It was a serious lapse of judgment, but not one that I think should reroute the course of your life, especially now. That's not to minimize the gravity of the error, but it occurs to me that this has, in many ways, been extremely dehumanizing for you, in the sense that we've been talking about you this whole time, but not really as a human being, just as the college YouTuber or Stanford student. I have an older brother who's your age, and if something like this were to happen to him, despite knowing that it'd be his own fault and his own idiocy, I'd be terrified for him anyways.\n\nTo echo your original comment, this is probably weird coming from me\u2014but I pray everything works out for you, and I hope you'll let us enjoy more of your creative work in the future. As for me, I'll be reflecting on why I felt the need to bring this to light in this manner. I said it was out of the shock of discovering it, but I wonder if there wasn't a bit of malice brewing in my heart as well.",

Essays are a huge part of the process, and the fact that he took structure, ideas, and more from other people is not \u201coverblown\u201d. That ends people\u2019s careers- which is why it\u2019s important for repercussions to be given BY THE SCHOOL not by other people. Stanford would have found out- whether it was going to be through YouTube drama or A2C people emailing them because this affects their brand and their integrity. Whatever happens won\u2019t happen because of people pointing out this guy\u2019s mistakes. It will happen because he made them, and profited off them- ironically in a similar way to those in the varsity blues scandal.",

Though this came as a big big shock, but I am glad you are able to be transparent with us, and I do get how the idea that \"nothing is original\" can sometimes lead us to believe that creating something out of the same idea is not the same as plagiarizing. And that's true, to an extent, and sometimes the lines get blurry for us especially when we are so desperate to get into that \"dream college.\" \n\nRegardless of whether or not this causes you to be rescinded from Stanford or some other consequence, I do want to thank you for the fun and joy that many of us derived from your YouTube videos. I do not think the guy who made \"Honey Nut Cheerios\" has suddenly been removed from existence by this new guy who plagiarized his college essays. We all make mistakes, and I do hope that you are able to stay strong during this period regardless of what happens. I believe in you, Arpi. Though I may have watched you initially for your college content, I stayed for your personality and your interesting opinions (ex. Kpop Boy Fetish). Anyways, see you on the flip side :)",

All this little crybabies are salty because they think their spot got taken away by this person because of a few sentences they didn't write\u2014as if that would've been the deal breaker. I think the reaction here is absolutely absurd.\n\nRegardless of whether he wrote those lines, all the other lines in his admissions essays were well written and obviously was make with care and competence.\n\nI maintain that there is a very significant difference from copying work in an academic journal to use in your own unpublished paper and copying a description of a noun from a blog to use in (what for most people is) a personal, private, unpublished work.\n\nWhat bothers me more is that people are on their high horses acting like they have never wronged in their life and are above any such thing, and I think that's a lot of crap.",

Plagiarism is wrong and he did plagiarize, however, if Arpi went to any other lesser known school- would he still be getting this same reaction? I think the issue lies more with people yearning to be in Stanford exclusivity, than Arpi\u2019s academic integrity. Combined with the fact he has a platform based around college essays and getting into Stanford. Most people viewed those videos because they also wanted to be considered in Stanford\u2019s \u201cpool\u201d.  The disconnect from real/ worse problems like one student being of more academic value than another is just horrible. What\u2019s done is done. He was admitted and his essays weren\u2019t the only thing that defined him as a candidate.",

It was filled with ppl saying \"I wonder if his other essays are plagiarized\" or \"what else did he plagiarize\", or \"I bet he plagiarized everything\". Sure stealing one or two lines might not be a big deal and maybe you won't get caught, but if you do, it calls into doubt everything you did and will do. It is very hard to put something like this behind you. Every time someone see yours transcript or maybe even looks you up they'll see you plagiarized that one time. Moral of the story, don't cheat or plagiarize. You are seeing the consequences in real time here.",

At Stanford I had a higher chance because of legacy, but I didn't even apply. Why? Because I had no inspiration for its essays. One answer I did have was the 'lack of empathy' for the 'Biggest problem faced by society today' prompt, but then another Stanford youtuber's video said just that, and I couldn't even use it in my essays.\n\nSo, bottom line is that, yes, you did take someone else's place, and you did it without caring much about what you did, hence all the essay writing tips on yt. However, you're also a witty and talented person, who, I believe, could have gotten into Stanford without plagiarizing. What happens next is up to Stanford.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. No matter what happens, we're all humans and we all make mistakes.",

Does he deserve it over people with perfect GPA, test scores, and most important, original essay? Because he definitely took a spot from a highly qualified student.",

It's a bad mistake, and he's not an awful person for making a mistake (I am sure he'll go on to learn from it and do great in life), but it is in fact, a serious lapse of judgement. There are too many students to count who worked just as hard as he did, had just as much potential, and did not proactively and intentionally plagiarize. And he took one of their spots...a life changing spot for many.  And he didn't admit this plagiarism freely, upon self reflection...he got caught.  Hence the apology.  So when you say it 'doesn't make him any less worthy to be at Stanford'. WOW. What the hell is going on at that school? That makes me cringe.  If this doesn't make him 'less worthy' to be there, I am not sure what does.  It's also been my experience that students with this type of ethos are not 'one time' cheaters...",

In fact, you are EXACTLY the kind of person that is RUINING these schools; you are a striver, no matter the cost. The fact that you would think to COPY somebody else on such an important document really speaks to your lack of scruples and character, not to mention your lack of original thought.\n\nYou and other strivers have unfortunately taken over the academic landscape at elite institutions, including my own. \n\nBut, I don't blame you for your actions. You don't exist in a vacuum. I blame the system of college admissions in this country. These AOs are paid a pittance to read hundreds of essays, they can't expect to check everything for plagiarism or even to read things very closely. So, you logically reason that the only way to impress these people (who were not the best students themselves, by the way) is to steal and borrow and write flowery pieces that will impress people who only have 3 minutes to read them. What a ridiculous system.\n\nWhen this \"holistic\" system encourages and even enables strivers like you, it's no wonder our once elite institutions are losing credibility year after year. \n\nYou deserve whatever is coming to you.

The people saying it is no big deal are downplaying a serious academic offense that could get them in serious trouble at university. And that is just what happens to them\u2014I mainly sympathize with the people whose words and ideas are stolen. If someone were caught stealing $20 out of Jessica Bennett's wallet or another student's phone, people would be outraged, but because these are someone else's ideas (much more valuable in my mind) instead of possessions, some people think it's acceptable.",

Not entirely their fault, but these kids do not have a lot to share, and whats sad is that top schools select kids that are supposed to have their identity made up of many different things, but then the kids basically make their identity the school after they arrive. You seem like a very genuine person and I think Stanford will see that. The mob against you is not made of people who want justice but people who are spiteful. Stanford itself is not spiteful.

Combine that with severe envy, fear, and insecurity of stressed out applicants fretting that college acceptance rates are at all time lows along with the entitlement of the masses to gleefully embrace cancel culture without perspective on magnitude and degree, so that everything is punishable by death instead of reasonable consequences short of being fully cancelled and without regard to the reality that they will be the next ones cancelled for their own human mistakes.\n\nA recipe for disaster in this country.",
