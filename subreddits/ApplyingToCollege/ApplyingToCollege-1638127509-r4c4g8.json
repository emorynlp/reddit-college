  "text": "Is there any difference between free and paid score reports in terms of arrival time? ETS says that:  \n   \n*Score delivery time can vary based on how you took the test and how your designated score recipients receive scores (all times approximate):*\n\n* ***ETS****\u00ae* ***Data Manager****: 6\u20138 business days (11\u201313 business days for TOEFL iBT\u00ae Paper Edition)*\n* ***Scorelink\u00ae*** ***Service****: 8\u201310 business days (11\u201316 business days for Paper Edition)*\n* ***Postal Mail****: 10\u201312 business days plus mailing time. Allow an additional 7\u201310 days for mail delivery in the United States and 4\u20136 weeks for mail delivery to other locations. For information specific to your postal system, contact your post office.*\n\nBut on the same page, they say that additional score reports will arrive within 3-5 business days. I ordered additional scores before and they arrived in 5 days which is good. Will free scores arrive within the same time or more(6-8 days)?",
