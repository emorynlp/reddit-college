The biggest one for me is always the \"Why do you want to attend X university?\"  It's great hearing how your parents went here and you want to go into business and that you want to experience the football games on Saturdays.  Cool, tens and hundreds of thousands of students can write and many do that exact same essay.  Plus, there isn't really anything in that essay that is special to our school.  You can be excited about going to football games at thousands of schools and there are a lot of good business programs.  We want to read specific reasons why you want to attend.  Interested in going to Tennessee?  What are specific parts of the business program that interest you?  What opportunities do you want to take advantage of?  \"I am interested in the International Business program at Tennessee because I want to work in a global company.  The Smith internship program would give me an opportunity to work abroad and learn what working in a global company is like first hand.  The ability to create my own specialization program in the major is exciting as well because I want to add the sustainability specialization to help create more sustainable and responsible businesses.\"  Those are actual examples that show you did research and have an idea of what you'd like to do.\n\nI've read a few essays that really did a good job showing who the student is or explained a lot about their situation that made me want to advocate for them.  Sometimes it helped them get admitted and other times it didn't change much.  There have been more essays I've read that made me not want to admit them.  Some students have good grades and test scores, solid ECs, and then their essay is 2 sentences long giving me nothing.",

Poverty is all over the world and down your street.  These students tend to write essays about their seeing poverty for the first time because they ignore the homeless people and poverty problems in their own cities.",
