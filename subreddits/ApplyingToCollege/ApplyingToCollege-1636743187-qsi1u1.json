  "text": "I got accepted to both for Mechanical Engineering, was wondering if one was a better choice than the other? As in like teachers/clubs/internship opportunities/whatever. The financial aid was the same for both since I am in state.\n\nI know A&M is higher on the US News list, but was wondering if there were any alumnis here that had anything to say.\n\nThanks in advance :)",
