          "text": "I never joined that sub and I'm so, so glad I didn't. I visited it a few times after my SAT to confirm some answers and again on the day of the score release to see how people did, but that's about it. I'm so thankful I didn't obsess over the SAT and prep 24/7 for months like some people on that sub lol, because that would've just stressed me out and probably led to a worse score because of nerves. Instead I'm chilling with my 1540 after doing literally one practice test the day before my SAT.",

                  "text": "Even if you do prep more than I did, that sub unnecessarily stresses over something that, even for its highest scorers, does not deserve that much stress. Prep for standardized tests experiences diminishing marginal returns, and when you prep too much, those returns eventually become negative and make you perform worse. You should be prepping for a few weeks at most, and definitely not more than 2-3 full practice tests each week.",
