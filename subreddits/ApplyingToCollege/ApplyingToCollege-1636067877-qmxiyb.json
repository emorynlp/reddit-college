  "text": "Like the title says. I\u2019ve submitted most of my apps already, but i don\u2019t know if this is something relevant that could help my chances at getting into a college. For context, I\u2019m trying to go to the Schreyers Honors College at Penn State. My parents haven\u2019t affected my college app process too much, but it is impacting the fact that I want to go to college and live on campus, and that\u2019s pretty much it. Should I email the college and tell them this or does it not matter?",
