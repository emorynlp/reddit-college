  "text": " I'm certain my counsellor sent my transcripts to all the schools I applied to, but UF says they haven't received my unofficial transcripts. Am I supposed to ask my counsellor for my transcripts, and upload the official documents(with the schools' letterheads), or just create new ones myself? I'm guessing the latter, and that they're asking for self reported grades.",

Have you confirmed whether there is a place to do that?",
