  "text": "Ok, so I cannot for the life of me find a clear answer. What is self reporting and do I need to do it if I already sent my official scores? I plan to take the ACT again in December and hopefully get a better score. Do I need to click \u201cyes\u201d and self report these scores? Or just click \u201cNo\u201d and stick with the scores I already sent? Thanks in advance :)",
