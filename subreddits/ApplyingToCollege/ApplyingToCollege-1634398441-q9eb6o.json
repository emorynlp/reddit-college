      "text": "Hey, good luck OP.  \n\nYes, you should ask for transcripts for all high school courses/schools.\n\nYou can ask the Principal, Vice Principal or someone else to write the counselor letter. They should explain that your achool does not have a guidance counselor role and then give some context for the type of school it is and your role and accomplishments in it.\n\n\nYou got this!!",
