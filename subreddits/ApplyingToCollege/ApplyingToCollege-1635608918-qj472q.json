  "title:": "Submitting Multiple SAT Scores to Colleges",
  "text": "So with the early action deadline coming up for many colleges this also means submitting SAT scores that you wish for colleges to see. \n\nFor me personally, I have taken the test 2 times. The first time I took it I got a 1500, and the second time I got a 1380. However, the second time was a School Day SAT day, so I had the opportunity to send my SAT scores to a few schools for free which I did. At the time I did not know what my score would be, but now I know how big of a gap there is between the two scores.\n\n I am wondering if the sending of my 1380 score would hurt my chances of getting admitted when college admissions officers see that I initially got a 1500 but the test after my score dropped by 120 points.",
