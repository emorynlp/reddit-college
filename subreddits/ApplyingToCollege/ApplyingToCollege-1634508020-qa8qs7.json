They have the perfect balance of being vibrant with lots of things to do while not being overwhelmingly crowded/large/crazy like NYC or something. And I love how the towns are almost \"centered\" around the college, where shops + restaurants have signs and flags from the school, professors walk around the town with their family, etc. It feels very community-oriented and there's a lot of school spirit.\n\nAs for urban schools: **NYU, Northeastern, BU, GWU, Georgetown** are all in awesome locations as well. So much to see and do nearby.",
