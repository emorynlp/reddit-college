  "text": "I spent 15 years of my life learning how to study and deal with the fact that my brain worked a little differently than everyone elses \n\nI used unhealthy coping mechanisms and managed to get straight As meanwhile i was absolutely miserable\n\nI learned how to deal with the academic regression that came as a result of my autoimmune disease as a child and started to work on my depression \n\nAnd then covid hit and i realized i really didn\u2019t know how to study \n\nI spent almost a year attempting to get an ADHD diagnosis and when i finally did i was like ok now i need to learn how to do work \n\nAnd now I\u2019m finally fucking happy and i have friends for the first time in my life\n\nBut i don\u2019t know how to do school. How to focus. How to be successful. \n\nAnd i miss when i was depressed because i was able to use schoolwork to zone it out\n\nBut i don\u2019t want to use unhealthy coping mechanisms and now i don\u2019t know how to do anything\n\nI\u2019m so overwhelmed but so unbelievably happy and it\u2019s terrible \n\nThe overwhelmingness of everytbing is really getting to me \n\nI am a 4.0 student. I was a 4.0 student.\n\nNow 3/5 of my grades are Bs and I\u2019m not going to get in anywhere I\u2019m applying \n\nUChicago is absolutely my dream school i love learning and i love everything about the school but i can\u2019t figure out how to do stuff like i used to \n\nAnd I\u2019m trying different adhd medicines but none of them are working quick enough \n\nAnd I\u2019m tired of not getting social queues and working really hard for no results \n\nI have to apply test optional because my six intense months of studying resulted in a lower ACT score and i don\u2019t have the energy anymore to work really fucking hard just to not even be able to focus \n\nI\u2019m so tired of it and I\u2019m so scared none of my work will pay off\n\nAnd i don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to be a physics major but that\u2019s what i want\n\nI want to be smart",

Look at executive function and cognitive inventory, [like this.](https://www.ldinfo.com/cpi1.htm)\n\nMedications change your brain chemistry, so you'll have to adapt too. \n\nMaybe do a year at cc to find your new groove. And absolutely keep pursuing physics -abundance of resources on YT & reddit!",

      "text": "Was just listening to a podcast in which it was mentioned how difficult some UChicago classes are in terms of \u201cweeding\u201d people out. That one of the host\u2019s daughter\u2019s former classmates from the Lab School who were straight A students in HS are taking Org Chem (iirc) at UChicago and pulling 40s-50s on the tests. Be careful about over-idealizing the UChicago experience (or anything).\n\nBesides medication, have you considered adding in morning exercise to your routine? Heard this can be helpful for focus for ADHD brains.\n\nGood luck and give yourself some grace. You sound so hard on yourself.",

The fact that you went fishing for a diagnosis after COVID hit and you realized you \"don't know how to study\" (and that it took you a year to find a doc who would give it to you) makes me fairly skeptical you actually \\*have\\* ADHD.",

          "text": "Actually i took time to find a doctor because it was incredibly expensive to find one under insurance, not because i kept going to different ones\n\nAfter my antidepressants fully kicked in i also noticed other symptoms that i maybe associated with adhd \n\nI was fucking terrified to bring that up to anyone because i didn\u2019t want to seem like i just wanted something to be wrong and because I\u2019d done well in school before \n\nBut covid made me realize how bad my focus was and i realized that when i stopped using unhealthy coping mechanisms \n\nI have no reason to lie about having adhd. \n\nIt\u2019s just now that i know i have it i feel bittersweet because i don\u2019t want to go back to unhealthy coping mechanisms and am learning how to study in a healthy way\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been living in a lie \n\nAnd i want a solution. I know that medicine isn\u2019t an end all be all but to some dumb extent I\u2019m tired of working really hard and still struggling\n\nIsn\u2019t it ok for me to wish for some magic fixer for just a little bit on my rant of a reddit post ?",

              "text": "Understood.  Sorry I jumped to conclusions.  In my experience plenty of kids (and parents!) do go fishing for diagnoses, thinking that meds are going to \"fix\" their kid's grades / study habits / etc.  Glad that's not the case for you.\n\nSounds like you maybe need to learn to not beat yourself up so much about your \"lack of focus\".  It is what it is.  Not everybody is capable of becoming a laser-focused study machine (I'm certainly not).",
