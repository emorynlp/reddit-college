  "title:": "IBDP vs A Levels, which is preferred?",
  "text": "Need advise from Ivy league college students, IBDP/A levels teachers, counselors, or anyone involved in the admission process.\n\nI'm a 10th grade student based in Mumbai, India. Looking to do my undergrad abroad (USA, Canada, Australia etc.). Interested in sciences, so will probably pursue research in biochem/genetics or medicine.\n\nI have done my research on A levels vs IBDP, and A levels seems to be a better option for me. However, I have seen many youtube videos and Ivy League student interviews that say colleges prefer IBDP. Is this true? **Will choosing IBDP (a reportedly more challenging program) improve my admission chances over A Levels (which will give me time to work on extracurriculars I actually care about)?**",

      "text": "As you are interested in pursuing Science/medicine, you cannot study all 3 Sciences in the IBDP instead you can only study 1-2. The IB has a lot of other requirements like TOK, CAS and an extended essay of 4000 words. All this will make you more holistic and better prepare you for college. The A levels however is more flexible and goes in depth rather than breadth. It'll give you more time to do EC's and other stuff. Both are equally recognised and rigorous  so it comes down to your personal preference and way of learning.",
