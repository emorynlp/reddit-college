  "text": "I\u2019m really just not sure what I want to do but I know I want to go to college. I can\u2019t justify spending $50k a year to go to an out of state school because I just can\u2019t be sure what I want my career to be. My issue at the moment is that I have a new career idea every few weeks. \nMy question is: could I go to an in state public college for my pre reqs then transfer to a different school if I decide on a major not offered in my state? (I live in Utah, I don\u2019t have a whole lot of reputable options). If I wanted to do a semester abroad would I lose my option to do this? There\u2019s a lot of articles on transferring from a community college to a four-year but I can\u2019t find anything on what I\u2019m looking for. I should probably be focusing more energy on scholarships than this but I was wondering if anyone had advice. Anything relating to career exploration would also be appreciated. :)",
