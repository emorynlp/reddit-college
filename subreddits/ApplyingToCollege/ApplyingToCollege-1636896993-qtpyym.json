  "text": "Hi, I want to apply to film school, and I had plans to make a short film for the application this month, but I had gotten covid and hadn\u2019t been able to shoot and the apllication is due december first. \nMy question is: Is it work it to still try and make it in 2 weeks or use an older short I\u2019ve made. I was thinking the first one because I think it shows what I was capable of without any experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me. (I\u2019m an international student from Europe)",
