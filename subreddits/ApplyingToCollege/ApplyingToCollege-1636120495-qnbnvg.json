  "text": "So I submitted the CSS profile to my 3 EA / ED schools on November 1st (Monday). However, on all my portals, the status for my CSS reads as 'awaiting'. Is it normal for it to take this long to arrive? or should I contact the schools? \n\nAlso, for one of the colleges it says on their portal that the CSS needs to be filed before November 5th (today). By filed, I am assuming they mean sent right? or are they already supposed to have received my CSS? \n\nThanks in advance : )",
