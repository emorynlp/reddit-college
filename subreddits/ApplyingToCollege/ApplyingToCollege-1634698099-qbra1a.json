I have military experience and real world experience in a field that relates to the unergraduates I want(Comp science). Currently in California if that matters.\n\nQuestion is would it be worth to apply to a school with a lower acceptance rate(around 30%) and somewhat competative.\n\nAll online is an option, but prefer to do hybrid.",

California community colleges often have programs for whatever local schools for guaranteed admission, a [TAG](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html) program for UC\u2019s, and guarantee at least one local school. Also in state public universities give priority to transfers. Work hard at a CC get your GPA up and you have a chance at that 30% school, your highschool GPA shouldn\u2019t matter",
