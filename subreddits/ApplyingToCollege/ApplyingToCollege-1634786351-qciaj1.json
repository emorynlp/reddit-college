  "text": "Hi, I've been working on my Penn essays for a month now and I'm honestly so happy with them, but I have a 1500 SAT (780m and 720e, and a 15 on the essay which is rlly bad cus I didn't study and wasn't planning on taking it but my proctor wouldn't let me cancel it) and strong ecs but not like crazy good. I'm applying for engineering, do I stand a chance with my SAT being in like the 25th percentile?\n\nWhat I'm really asking is how big of an impact will my sat have, and should i maybe consider going test optional since my essay score is really bad - can I maybe not submit my essay score?\n\nThank you!",
