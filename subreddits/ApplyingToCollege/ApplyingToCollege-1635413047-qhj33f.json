  "text": "I've recently decided i would like to go back to school after years of wasting away in retail and having zero drive in what i want to do. I've really taken an interest in the idea of teaching English in a foreign country like South Korea or Taiwan. I like the idea of getting away from the US and seeing the world. I understand that i would need atleast a bachelor's in English and a TEFL certification. But I'd like to avoid staying in the US just to study and possibly drowning in debt. So i thought why not just go to a university in another country? I would have the benefit of traveling already and i hear there's more affordable options. so i would appreciate some advice or recommendations on what universities i could start looking into to see what i need to do. :)",
