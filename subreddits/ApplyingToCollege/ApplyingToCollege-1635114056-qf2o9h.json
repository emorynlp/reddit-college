If it is assessed higher, then it would make sense (depending upon if you\u2019re near the aid range) to pay down a mortgage or pay off debt. If it isn\u2019t, then it doesn\u2019t matter. 10,000 less cash from paying down a house = 10,000 more equity in the house. \n\nEither way, definitely a good call on expenses that aren\u2019t investments.

          "text": "EFC stands for \u201cExpected Family Contribution\u201d, aka a family/student\u2019s ability to pay the costs of college for a certain year. The EFC is simply an estimate as to how much you may pay for college, but in reality colleges are not obligated to follow this. So, usually, EFC is not the maximum price you will pay for any college. EFC also is used to determine how much federal aid you can get. The EFC does not vary across public vs private, but the net price may vary(tuition varies). Also, most private and some public schools also utilize something called the CSS Profile, which is a more in-depth non-government FAFSA which factors in more assets, expenditures, etc to give you a more realistic picture of how much you/your parent(s) may pay, and allows institutions to give institutional(private need based) aid. IIRC, the FAFSA does not take into account housing and food costs, but the CSS profile does. More info here: https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/how-calculated",

      "text": "Not something that is overlooked, but a pet peeve: unlike dividend income on stock, rental income on property is hit twice by FAFSA. \n\nIf $100,000 of stock pays a $2,000 of dividends, you have $2,000 of additional AGI, but the stock price drops to $98,000 after the dividend is paid. So you have $2,000 less in investments but 2,000 more in income. They offset. At least immediately after the dividend is paid until the price of the stock fluctuates. \n\nLet\u2019s say you have a rental property worth 250,000 with 150,000 of outstanding debt. The investment is worth 100,000. Same as the stock above. Let\u2019s say that you also have rental income (rent revenue - expenses including interest payment). It generates 2,000 of rental income a year after all expenses.  Same as the dividend above. The value of the investment doesn\u2019t go down. It remains at 100,000. So you\u2019re charged the full investment value + the income. \n\nThere are only two ways to get equity from the property:  1) take out another loan. In which case you won\u2019t have any income because of the extra interest expense. 2) sell the property. In which case you won\u2019t have any rental income because you no longer own the property. It\u2019s not economically correct to assess the value of the investment AND the net income generated from that investment. The income stream is what determines the value.",
