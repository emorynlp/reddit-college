  "text": "I\u2019ve been working on a Sneaker reselling cookgroup for two years. Im an assistant and I study and predict the reselling market, and of course give my predictions to over 150 paid members. The thing is, since this isn\u2019t an usual extracurricular, I don\u2019t know how to describe it. Because first things first; I highly doubt an AO is going to know what a Sneaker reselling cookgroup is..\n\nBut I have no ways to actually explain it, and there is no chance of me not adding this EC since it is related to my intended major.\n\nHELP!!",

          "text": "This is a good answer. Say something like this in the EC section, expand on it slightly: \u201cperformed market analysis for a small company to Maximize profits\u201d or something of the like, and then use this EC as one to expand in your extracurricular essay where it is applicable. I suggest you don\u2019t make it the subject of your personal statement unless you have a lot of insightful things to say, though, in case you were considering that. \n\nBig indicator of the value of this EC is the hours you put into it. If it has a high number of hours people might be more likely to consider it something legitimate and valuable; be honest though, because overestimating your work time will make it clear that you are BSing for brownie points.\n\nEdit: also don\u2019t be afraid to name drop your cookgroup if you have the characters to fit it, they might not know what it is but if your application is good enough to receive consideration, they might consider a cursory google search.",

It would be easy to put its a \u201csneaker cookgroup\u201d, but only resellers know what a sneaker cookgroup is. I have no other way to say it. Just read what I put in the text itself before saying that lmao:P",
