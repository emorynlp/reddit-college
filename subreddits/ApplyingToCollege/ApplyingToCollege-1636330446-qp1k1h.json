  "text": "I'm really confused about how to fill out the Self-Reported Academic Record on the UIUC (myIllini) portal.\n\nSo from the UIUC FAQ:\n\n>\\> You must have your high school transcript with you when  self-reporting your courses and grades, entering all information exactly  as it appears on your document. **All semester, trimester, or quarter  grades must be listed. Don\u2019t average grades.**\n\nThe portal says:\n\n>\\> If your transcript shows grades for 2 semesters, 3 trimesters, or 4  quarters for each class, **list each grade separately**; do not list a final grade.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't see a place to enter a Semester 1 and Semester 2 grade for each course -- I can only enter one. This is what I see: [https://i.imgur.com/JwLh3AS.png](https://i.imgur.com/JwLh3AS.png)\n\nI just don't know what to do, should I separate my courses out by semester?\n\n**EDIT: UIUC responded to my email saying that  if a high school issues grades per semester for a year long course, each semester should receive its own line. They\u2019ll know that it was a year long course because we specify first or second semester.** Solved!!",

          "text": "Thank you! I\u2019ll probably do this, but this conflicts with the instructions:\n\n>\tIf your transcript shows grades for 2 semesters, 3 trimesters, or 4 quarters for each class, list each grade separately; do not list a final grade.\n\nSo it reads that they don\u2019t want a final grade if it\u2019s a yearly course with 2 semester grades? But their instructions also doesn\u2019t make sense because Algebra II for example, is one course rather than two.",
