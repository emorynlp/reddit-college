  "text": "I have a TA period (senior year, so it\u2019s only been a couple of months). I\u2019m TAing for a subject related to my major and have already done quite a bit (tutoring kids and seeing significant increases in grades, literally teaching the class when we had a sub), but again it\u2019s only been about 3 months. Could I add this as an activity? Because this TA period isn\u2019t really mentioned anywhere else in my application.",
