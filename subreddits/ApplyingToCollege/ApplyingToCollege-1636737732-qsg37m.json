  "text": "Over the summer, u/mcneiladmissions and I wrote the following; we're both big proponents of LinkedIn, and we know that a lot of y'all are seeing some interesting (shall we say) uses of the platform. Due to the madness of the admissions season (and me moving halfway across the country), it's only now getting published.\n\nThere was also some 'no you do it' going back in forth between Alex and me, so if you like this, please throw him an upvote too so I don't feel bad about being the one to post it.\n\nFor online networking, the premier professional hub is Linkedin. Linkedin has the largest professional user-base of any networking site in the world. \n\nLinkedin is often the first platform where industry pros share important announcements about opportunities that may be relevant to you. Internship opportunities, digital introduction meetings, webinars, and important pieces of news are all circulating on Linkedin. \n\nThe platform also allows new users to connect directly with seasoned industry veterans, so LinkedIn can offer an amazing opportunity to students who are beginning to dip their toes into the professional waters. \n\nBut with power comes great responsibility. Having access to everyone under the sun **does not** mean that you should reach out without first planning about your approach. \n\n## The Basics: Setting up a Profile\n\nThe first step in conquering Linkedin is to complete your profile in a way that attracts the right kind of attention to yourself. That means being thorough and filling out each major section of your profile. \n\n**Photos**: Start by adding a nice, professional profile picture (or at least one where you\u2019re looking at the camera and your eyes are open!) and a banner photo. If you don\u2019t know what to add for a banner photo, I would recommend something non-controversial and easy to look at, like a nature photo. Banner photos are sized at 1400 x 425 pixels. \n\n**Bio**: In the bio section of your profile, write a short paragraph summarizing some key elements about who you are, why you\u2019re on Linkedin, and what kind of opportunities you\u2019re looking to attract. Be modest and realistic in your bio. You don\u2019t need to inflate your accomplishments or pad your resume. It\u2019s OK to not have an extensive bench of experiences. Just be truthful. \n\n**Experience Section**: Fill out whatever experience sections you can without misleading. If you\u2019ve worked a job, add that to your resume. If you participate in extracurricular activities (debate, athletics, an esports team, etc.) make sure to list that as well. Focus on filling in the one or two most meaningful experiences you\u2019ve had. \n\nWith each experience you have a choice about whether to add a description or not. It\u2019s perfectly OK to leave it blank: this may be the best course of action if you\u2019re feeling unsure about what to write. \n\nIf you do fill out the description, provide succinct, bulleted summaries of your achievements and responsibilities. Limit your bulleted count to 3 per experience (not a hard rule, but a best practice to avoid fluff). \n\nAs a student, you may not have the most extensive resume. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just represent who you are truthfully and with humility; people will see that and appreciate your honesty. \n\n## Building your Network on LinkedIn\n\n### Searching for Contacts\n\nSearching for people is probably the most straightforward method, and if you\u2019ve got a definite idea of who you want to find, this works well.  For example, if you were trying to find Bill Gates, just type \u201cBill Gates\u201d.  \n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to find everyone who works at Facebook in a given location.  As there are a lot of people at Facebook, you\u2019ll find yourself scrolling through, but eventually you\u2019ll run into the \u201cCommercial Search Limit.\u201d\n\nUnlike other social media, LinkedIn only makes a portion of its money from ads.  Instead, they want to pay for Premium.  And unless you\u2019re willing to shell out $40 or more a month for a premium subscription, LinkedIn will limit your search results.\n\nInstead, think of the search bar as a bit of a scalpel; use it sparingly, but it can help you find the most effective path to a specific person or company.\n\n### Deepen contact searches by using company filters\n\nEarlier, we used the example of Facebook as a company that you might want to research.  Scrolling through the tens of thousands of people who work at Facebook is exhausting.  Instead, try this.\n\nSearch for Facebook, then click the company\u2019s profile on LinkedIn.  \n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll see a number of tabs, one of which is the People tab. \n\nClick it, and suddenly you can sort through Facebook\u2019s employees based on where they live, where they went to college, their job function, and their skills.  \n\nNow this does count towards that Commercial Search cap, but here\u2019s the thing - even with that cap, LinkedIn still displays two or three top results.  If you\u2019re searching for Engineers who use Python and went to UC Berkeley, then you can do that, and find someone who meets that description.\n\n### One more ninja strategy for outreach: Use LinkedIn Groups\n\nTypically, when you find someone on LinkedIn, you\u2019ll message them via a connect request. We cover the best practices for composing a message below. \n\nThe basic problem with outreach messages is that the length of those messages is capped.  Sometimes, you\u2019ll need a few extra letters.\n\nThe solution for that is LinkedIn Groups. \n\nLinkedIn Groups exist for a variety of interests; there are groups devoted solely to networking, and there are groups devoted to incredibly precise topics. \n\nIdeally, you\u2019ll want to join a few groups that are interesting to you, even if you don\u2019t participate in the discussion. Many of them are full of people who think they know everything, but they can be a useful way to add new stories to your feed.\n\nBut that\u2019s not why you should join groups. \n\n**Instead, you can message people who are also in your groups without a cap on the character count. If you\u2019ve found someone whose work really resonates with you, this is a great way to do it.** \n\nHere\u2019s how to **really** make sure your message gets noticed:\n\n* Wait until they say something in a group (or in their own feed) and message them in reference to it.  \n* If you really want to zero in on someone, follow them and then comment on their posts - this is much more effective than most other methods when the person you want to connect with is incredibly famous.\n\n## How to outreach like a pro\n\nIt can be a bit scary to do \u201ccold\u201d outreach to strangers on LinkedIn. But remember: making cold introductions is what the platform is for. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to not overstep boundaries with your outreach, or to ask for something that\u2019s unrealistic. \n\nIf you\u2019re sending invites and messages to Marc Merrill, CEO of Riot Games, don\u2019t expect much in return. For business leaders at smaller, more accessible companies, you may stand a better chance at getting through - but here, you need to make sure you\u2019re sending the right message. \n\nGenerally speaking, you shouldn\u2019t expect a cold contact to be very interested in reading an essay-length message. Your first outreach should be short and to the point, with a pre-written message that clearly conveys a few things:   \n\n\n1. Who you are. \n2. Why you\u2019re reaching out and why you want to connect.\n3. What your \u201cask\u201d is. (This one may be optional depending on your goal in reaching out.) \n\nHere\u2019s an example of a short, well-formatted Linkedin outreach message: \n\nHi \\[FIRST NAME\\]! I\u2019m a \\[high school/college\\] student exploring opportunities in the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ industry. I\u2019m trying to learn from professionals who focus on \\[TOPIC\\]. I would love to connect in a brief introductory meeting to ask your advice about my future. Do you have any time in the next week for a 15-minute chat? Thanks! \n\nYou might not want to schedule a meeting right away. If so, your message might look like this: \n\nHi \\[FIRST NAME\\]. I\u2019m a high school student--just wanted to connect with some professionals in the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ industry. Thanks!\n\nFrom there, provided you find some willing folks, you should be able to set up a fairly consistent stream of introductory meetings. You\u2019ll be well on your way to building out your Linkedin network. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith that, you probably know more about using LinkedIn than your parents and teachers do.  If used properly, it\u2019s an incredibly powerful platform.  Again, you don\u2019t have to show out on it (trust me, doing so will get the occasional eye roll).  Instead, be honest, be yourself, and start building your network.",
