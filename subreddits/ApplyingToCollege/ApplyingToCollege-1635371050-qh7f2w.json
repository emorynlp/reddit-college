  "text": "The commonapp is asking if a family member attended this college. My parent did a program there, graduated, and received an accredited diploma. However, he did not receive a degree. The college\u2019s website says the child or a graduate from any program is considered a legacy, but the commonapp specifically asks how many degrees the parent recieved. Considering my parent has a diploma, do I put 1 or 0? Would it harm my chances if I put 0?",
