  "text": "My man started the break-up text with a hella good metaphor: \u2018these last few months with you have been a dream. And as much as I would\u2019ve liked to stay warm and comfy under the covers with you forever, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u2019 \n\nHe then ended it by circling back to the same metaphor: \u2018you and I were like a really good dream you wake up from and desperately want to be real, but know deep down it can\u2019t. Who knows, maybe someday we\u2019ll wake up and find that it\u2019s reality. Until then, bye and gl.\u2019\n\nWhere tf are this level of writing skills when I\u2019m trying to write supps. Jfc.",
