  "text": "I applied ED to GWU and they are the only school I know of with a \"late-December\" decision date. Do I just check every day from December 15th onward? How am I not going to be stressed when every other person gets their decision December 15th-17th? Also what time of day do decisions come out? Will I be checked 15 times a day or just once in the morning?",
