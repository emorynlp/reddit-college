  "title:": "HOT TAKE: Colleges should stop advertising that they are accessible to everyone, including low-income internationals.",
  "text": "Using a throwaway account because of extenuating reasons. When my family immigrated to this country (not USA but a different one; funny how everyone assumes you can only immigrate to USA) they did not have enough money to have two meals a day. They were dirt poor because some people in top positions decided to have different nations and separate god knows how many people from their actual homeland. They came to a country where they did not know anything, and had no certainty of their future. Within 3 generations, they worked hard enough and sacrificed a lot to get where we are now, but guess what, it's still not enough for these colleges in the U.S.\n\nI know I am not Ivy League or Stanford material, and that's fine. But I know that I could have gotten in other equally good schools, what with my stats and all, if it weren't for financial aid. For all their talk about \"holistic review\" they reject an applicant because of something not in their hand. No, my parents couldn't afford to send me to a feeder school. Yes, I had to work hard to get my ECs because resources and opportunities were not handed to me on a silver plate. No, my parents couldn't afford to spend 10 grand on external counselors to get all my apps done. (Someone actually did this and admitted it on a whatsapp group for internationals so Idk how this is fair.)\n\nColleges will be like \"oh, internationals are welcome here.\" Newsflash: only internationals paying a full ride are welcome here. I wish I was born straight so I didn't have extra incentive to get out of this god forsaken country. Every passing day, I can feel my spirits breaking more and more as I traverse everything on my own, with no help. I wish I hadn't turned so bitter, but this is actually the first time I have been class conscious. And I am glad that it did. Atleast, I am proud of myself and I can look at myself straight in the eye.",
