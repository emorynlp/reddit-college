  "text": "Hi, I completed FAFSA on 10/2, but none of my college portals show FAFSA as processed, and some of them have had their priority deadline pass. However, my CSS took 1 day to show up as processed. Has anyone had experience with FAFSA taking a long time to process, or should I be concerned that my FAFSA may not have \"gone through\"?\n\nThanks so much!",
