  "text": "So I\u2019m part of a music prep program at Rice (my #1 university) where I take weekly lessons and give recitals there (I play cello). I really like it, I get to go to campus every week and preform there, but would something like this catch the eye of the AO when I submit my application? I\u2019m still a junior and by the time I apply I will have been part of the program for 2 years. However, even though I really like music I don\u2019t plan on majoring in it. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering how much a program like this would help my application? This is my top school and I really want to go there.",
