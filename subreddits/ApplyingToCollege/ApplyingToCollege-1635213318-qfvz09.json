  "text": "I'll answer first.  \n\n\nIt's made me a lot more cynical about the things people do outside of school. I think that everyone is doing everything for college.

      "text": "Honestly. I feel like this whole application process has kind of made me done with high school. I am lucky and unlucky to go to a competitive high school. Lucky because it is a good school and I recognize the privilege of it being better funded.

I don't have the best stats and I try to focus on myself. But my goodness the comparing and the toxicity will never end and I just feel like this whole place isn't good for me generally. I just want it to be May already so I can get out of here and enjoy my life.",
