              "text": "So for need-based, you need to:\n\n1. Check the box on the Common App that says you want to be considered for financial aid,\n2. Submit your FAFSA (and CSS if required) by whatever date the school indicates.  Usually this is a different date than the application date.\n\nFor non-need-based (i.e. \"merit\") scholarships/grants:\n\n1. If the school requires it, apply by their EA or \"priority\" date.  If a school has an EA date they usually want you to apply by that date in order to be considered for the maximum number of scholarships.  They do \\*not\\* expect you to apply ED in order to be maximally considered.\n2. Some schools require that you indicate you will be applying to their honors program in order to qualify for certain scholarships.  This isn't that common.\n3. Some schools make you fill out a separate scholarship application separate from the Common App.  Sometimes this is in their portal, which you only get access to after you submit your application.  Sometimes it's not.  In some cases this is only necessary if you're applying for their \"big\" scholarship (e.g. Eminence at Ohio State, etc.)\n4. If you're shooting for talent-based scholarships, there's usually a whole separate process for those since they usually require an audition.",
