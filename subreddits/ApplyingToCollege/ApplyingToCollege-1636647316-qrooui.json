  "title:": "This is my hardest year by far.",
  "text": "It's Senior year \u2013 supposed to be the best year of HS \u2013 it's not. I am trying my best rn to hold myself together and not have a breakdown every day, while I see other Seniors at my school giving no f's about colleges, ECs, and classes. My mental health literally cannot take it anymore, so it's just me trying to suppress my deteriorating feelings each day, while people tell me \"it's easy for you to do good in classes.\" It's not. Do they know how hard I try? The all-nighters and constantly staying afloat with school work just for them to say \"well obviously you did good, it's 'natural' to you.\" Like I cheated my way out of life. Like a simple \"congratulations\" would be enough. I can't even say the ECs I do or the things I have achieved because they think that I'm being pretentious and bragging. Do I not deserve a chance to be proud of myself? \n\nHence, when I talk about college apps with the essays involved and say the amount of time I spend on each one editing and stuff \u2013 I get comments like \"you're overthinking this\" or \"you don't have to be worried about getting in.\" Yes, I do because I want a better future for myself. It's not only my dreams that I am fulfilling by going to college, I am fulfilling my parents' dream as well. \n\nBeing an Asian-American doesn't help either, when they are like \"oh you're brown, so obviously you're  smart.\" They fail to acknowledge the work ethic shadowed by every A. I work hard because of myself and my parents because I have adopted their American Dream and have sought to do good in life and be a good person. I have begged my teachers and GC not to tell anyone my college list because I do not want another reason to quit. Because I am about to break.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for listening to my rant (I am sorry, I just had to get it off my chest).",

Then you can decide which ones doesn\u2019t add value to your life right now and say No to it. It may look like having to change a schedule, drop an activity, cancel a meeting, or literally tell someone No. From another stressed senior I\u2019m proud of you. Your already doing so great and most of the time you don\u2019t even realize it. Keep it up bro",

What I did was write a bunch of emails to myself that are set to be sent years from now. \n\nI don't know why but it felt liberating to know that I'll probably consider the current hardships and struggles to be trivial a decade from now. I'll be a completely different person with a different mindset and a different life. In the grand scheme of things, this is just a small part of life",

This is exactly why I lie to people that I always study because I would hate it if someone were to feel less than me purely because of their grades. Your grades do not define you. Your ecs do not define you. Your personality does, and it is clear that you are a determined individual who will do great in college while all of us who don\u2019t study as much will probably struggle since we have not developed any study techniques or tactics to help us study for hours on end. Your life will get easier in college while ours will become hell. Don\u2019t compare yourself to them because you will have completely different experiences. \n\nSenior year is only easy for people who slack off and for the majority of us on this sub it will be one of if not the hardest years of our high school life. Never compare yourself to others to determine how your life should be lived. I literally have no social life what so ever. But I\u2019m happy with it. I don\u2019t care that society wants me to party and drink in college because I would rather be at the library or sitting at home by myself. \n\nEveryone has their strengths and weaknesses but you just only see other people\u2019s strengths and only your weaknesses. You need to realize that those people are flawed too and just because you are flawed in one way doesn\u2019t make you less than them.",
