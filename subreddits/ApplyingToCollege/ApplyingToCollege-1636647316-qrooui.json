  "title:": "This is my hardest year by far.",
  "text": "It's Senior year \u2013 supposed to be the best year of HS \u2013 it's not. I am trying my best rn to hold myself together and not have a breakdown every day, while I see other Seniors at my school giving no f's about colleges, ECs, and classes. My mental health literally cannot take it anymore, so it's just me trying to suppress my deteriorating feelings each day, while people tell me \"it's easy for you to do good in classes.\" It's not. Do they know how hard I try? The all-nighters and constantly staying afloat with school work just for them to say \"well obviously you did good, it's 'natural' to you.\" Like I cheated my way out of life. Like a simple \"congratulations\" would be enough. I can't even say the ECs I do or the things I have achieved because they think that I'm being pretentious and bragging. Do I not deserve a chance to be proud of myself? \n\nHence, when I talk about college apps with the essays involved and say the amount of time I spend on each one editing and stuff \u2013 I get comments like \"you're overthinking this\" or \"you don't have to be worried about getting in.\" Yes, I do because I want a better future for myself. It's not only my dreams that I am fulfilling by going to college, I am fulfilling my parents' dream as well. \n\nBeing an Asian-American doesn't help either, when they are like \"oh you're brown, so obviously you're  smart.\" They fail to acknowledge the work ethic shadowed by every A. I work hard because of myself and my parents because I have adopted their American Dream and have sought to do good in life and be a good person. I have begged my teachers and GC not to tell anyone my college list because I do not want another reason to quit. Because I am about to break.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for listening to my rant (I am sorry, I just had to get it off my chest).",

      "text": "Sometimes it\u2019s good to take a walk and reflect on the things you\u2019ve done this week. Even if it is hard to do, just try and think back. Then you can decide which ones doesn\u2019t add value to your life right now and say No to it. It may look like having to change a schedule, drop an activity, cancel a meeting, or literally tell someone No. From another stressed senior I\u2019m proud of you. Your already doing so great and most of the time you don\u2019t even realize it. Keep it up bro",
