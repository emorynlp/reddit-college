  "text": "Have been looking at: **Yale\u2019s extensive course offerings and vibrant conversations beyond the classroom encourage students to follow their developing intellectual interests wherever they lead. Tell us about your engagement with a topic or idea that excites you. Why are you drawn to it? (250 words)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you reckon I could respond to this with the story of the founding and building of my own socially conscious company? The issue I'm finding is I don't directly answer why I'm drawn to it, but it can be inferred from context. Do I need to be more direct here?",
