  "text": "I was rejected from every schools that I applied to last month.. and i just became a full-time software engineer at the company I\u2019ve been interning at since last year!\nI got reallly high salary for my age and experience(higher than entry software engineer at top tech companies like samsung in my country). \n\nJust know that you don\u2019t always need college to advance in life. Your grit will advance you by itself.\n\n\u2014-\nI want to say, do ECs that really excite you and you like doing. That four years of highschools isnt nothing. If you use it to develop yourself, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to pursue you interest while you are not expected to. Thats four years of experience that you may get ahead of others",

While I agree that a college education is definitely not essential, don\u2019t forget that if you change your mind in a year or two or more, you can always apply again. More and more people are starting college in their twenties (or beyond) these days. I\u2019ve worked with a couple of successful coders who spent years at Facebook, Airbnb, Snapchat, and other places before they started the college app process again. It makes for an interesting application for sure.  Good luck and have fun with your new adventure!!",

As of tips, remember to stay engaged and interact with your collegues, there are a lot to learn from them! If you are doing cs, definitely work on projects and take online courses on your own to better improve your skills. But yea, work is hard at times, but once you get through it, you will definitely see yourself grow very rapidly",

It skips a step of having to prove yourself on an application somehow, and definitely gives you more options, but if you've found a good company that treats you well and may have some career advancement opportunities, I hope you do well.",

People without degrees get rejected even before a human gets to read the resume.\n\n> Call the HR department of several companies and ask if, for your kind of position, they would prefer someone with 4 years of hands-on experience and software certs or someone with 0 experience but a 4 year degree\n\nThat is assuming you can get 4 years of full-time experience, but as I said most people would not be able to get that in the first place because of the screening process.",
