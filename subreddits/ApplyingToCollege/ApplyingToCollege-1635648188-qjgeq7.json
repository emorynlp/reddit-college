  "text": "I'm interested in applying in the UK. But I'm very confused on how to navigate the UCAS application at all! Its like 1930s stereo instructions.... \n\nAny help from anyone who went through the process would be extremely helpful! I'm specifically having an issue with my education section. I added my school... good there. But they wont let me continue without adding a \"qualification\". So which button do I click? They all look like gibberish and none look like a normal HS diploma option. And when I do click a random one. What are these questions...\n I'm assuming a module/unit is a class/course?? And qualification date is just when I graduated? I'm  so confused... help me!",

What I would recommend is looking up the contact for the USA advisor (it\u2019s on their website or just search it up) who can help be an advisor for your application. I did this and my advisor was able to help me go through the application process and even put in some information for me. Good luck!!",
