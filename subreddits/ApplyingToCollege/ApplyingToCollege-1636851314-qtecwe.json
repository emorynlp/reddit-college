  "text": "I'm kinda confused, because on the FAQ on CommonApp and the other application website I'm using tells me to not add in AP credits as college credits, but I talked to another senior, and they said that their counselor told to include it?\n\nHonestly I'm not even sure if I should include them, because I already submitted to two colleges and I didn't include them, and I tried looking everywhere online too but couldn't get anything useful :(",
