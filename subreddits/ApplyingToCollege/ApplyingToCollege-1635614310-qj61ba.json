  "title:": "Sometimes, getting rejected from your top choice is the best thing for you.",
  "text": "So, I had a long spill about how getting rejected from your top choice just might be the right thing for you, but I wanted to keep it short. \n\nI got waitlisted and then rejected from Barnard in 2019. I was so adamant that I was going to be a Poli Sci major and be an activist. I was a frequent poster back when we only had 100K members here. \n\nStarted taking Poli Sci classes and I disliked it so much. I ended up dropping with a \u2018W\u2019 twice and skipping classes. Changed to Philosophy major. Another \u2018W\u2019. Turned into an English major. Suddenly, writing wasn\u2019t fun anymore.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I was introduced to reproductive health. I picked up extracurriculars and an internship opportunity and fell in love! Turned to a Public Health and Nursing dual degree student (a degree from my current school and Emory in 5 years). \n\nLast night, I got accepted into Emory\u2019s transfer BSN program. \n\nHad I not gotten rejected from Barnard, I would have been in a major that I disliked. I would not have discovered my passion for equitable healthcare for all, especially for underrepresented groups. Barnard has no nursing program, but my current school did and I can see now why I wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nIt just wasn\u2019t where I was meant to be, for good reason.",
