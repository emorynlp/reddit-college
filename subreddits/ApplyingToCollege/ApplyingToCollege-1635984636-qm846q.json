  "text": "So I\u2019ve heard many times that you should always apply for scholarships and waivers that you may qualify for. At the end of the MIT application, it asked if I wanted to request a fee waiver, so I clicked yes.

This has me worried, because at the end of the day, I probably don\u2019t qualify for one, but I did it just in case. Will this affect my chance of admission, and will I eventually have to pay it?",
