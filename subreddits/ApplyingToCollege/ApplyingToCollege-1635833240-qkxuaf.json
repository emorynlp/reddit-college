  "title:": "First Quarter Grades Importance For Early Decision",
  "text": "Hello\n\nI am applying early decision to Haverford college, and they are asking for first quarter grades. I have a 3.9 UW gpa, with a 4.5 W GPA, but my first quarter markings show all Bs because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nI am definitely aiming for the majority of  them being As by the end of the semester, but will this hurt my chances at my early decision school if I send all Bs for my first quarter grades? How can I plan on making it so that it doesn't hurt me in admissions, (ie. a counselor explanation, idk)\n\nAlso, if anyone known any details about Haverford college which you think I should know, please feel free to let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you!",
