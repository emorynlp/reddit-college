  "text": "I go to a small school, and very few people take the AMC. I already missed the deadline last year, and I really wanted to take it this year. And now I've missed the deadline again :( Like bro last year, November would've been the earliest of earliest of earliest of birds. \n\nAlso, 2021 will apparently have 2 AMC competitions?",

      "text": "Yes, MAA changed the schedule this year (and going forward) based on the scoring delays of the last few years. (Turns out that finding you qualified for AIME the day before AIME was not a good thing - who knew?).\n\nThey actually announced the change to proctors 2-3 years ago.\n\nYes, there will be two sets of 2021 AMCs, though AIME and subsequent phases will still be next year.\n\nIn exchange, there will be no 2021 AMC8 - it has moved to January.\n\nYes, the A set of tests is next Wednesday.",
