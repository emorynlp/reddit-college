  "text": "Hi! I'm probably overanalyzing this but I was wondering about the possibility that my application could be read while parts of it haven't be processed yet. For my EA school, I'll be submitting close to the Nov 1 deadline, after which my counselor will upload my transcript and LORs. I know there's usually a grace period, which the college also says they have:\n\n\"As a standard practice, we offer a grace period after the application deadline during which teachers and counselors may submit application materials.\"\n\nThey also do mention that \"materials submitted by others may take several weeks to process.\"\n\nThey did say that they \"*reserve the right to evaluate an application and render a final decision even if all pieces of the application have not been received*\". I just want to confirm that this doesn't include unprocessed materials. It's not possible that my application would be read in, say, early November, before all the documents have come in, right?\n\nSorry if I sound irrational! I'm just a panicky senior haha.",
