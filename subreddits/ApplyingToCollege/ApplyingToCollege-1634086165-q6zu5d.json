We accept the DUOLINGO ENGLISH TEST, THE IELTS ACADEMIC (INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE TESTING SYSTEM), the PTE ACADEMIC (PEARSON TEST OF ENGLISH), and the TOEFL (TEST OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE). Since official submissions of the DUOLINGO ENGLISH TEST are free, we suggest the official submission of those results; applicants can self-report all other English proficiency test scores.",
