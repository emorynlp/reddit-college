  "text": "I live with my aunt, who isn\u2019t my legal guardian from what I know and she has claimed me on her taxes for at least the last two years. My dad used to claim me on his taxes before then. My mom isn\u2019t a citizen and I have no access to her tax returns. I\u2019m afraid of using my dad because I\u2019m worried it might make me be considered \u2018Out of State\u2019 but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll let me use my aunt. Where can I find answers?",

      "text": "You still have to report info from your parent usually, unless your aunt is your legal guardian or you are an emancipated minor, or you fall under one of the other exemptions that make you an independent student:  [https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency)  .  Your aunt claiming you on taxes is still fine -- dependent for tax purposes and dependent for financial aid aren't the same.\n\n[https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info) is the best starting place for the official guidance if you aren't independent, and would cover some other circumstances that might apply.\n\nI want to note that the FAFSA info isn't going to be what determines your residency for in-state or out of state purposes. Each state has their own guidelines but if you've been continuously living in a state for the last few years and are graduating from a high school in that state you should be fine.",
