  "text": "I live with my aunt, who isn\u2019t my legal guardian from what I know and she has claimed me on her taxes for at least the last two years. My dad used to claim me on his taxes before then. My mom isn\u2019t a citizen and I have no access to her tax returns. I\u2019m afraid of using my dad because I\u2019m worried it might make me be considered \u2018Out of State\u2019 but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll let me use my aunt. Where can I find answers?",
