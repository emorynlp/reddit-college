  "text": "These are so fire, there are many incredible ones. \n\nI feel the best one I watched though, was one that got deleted. If you know which one I'm talking about, it's really an emotional rollercoaster that culminates in a really wholesome moment.\n\nHere are my top 3 not counting that one:\n\n[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpukZnIhbN4)\n\n[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMqhI2QpD4)\n\n[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKLPLlyb9Kk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI rly like it when they include the screen recording of the portal and you can see the decision as the viewer, for all you future YouTubers pls do that thanks!",
