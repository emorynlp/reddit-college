          "text": "Less well known. I just mean less famous, not that its a bad school. Like, if you ask people all over the world what is the best college, almost anyone would answer harvard/mit/oxbridge. I doubt many at all would say stanford. And stanford isnt known, outside of the US, as a school on harvard\u2019s level.\nThis even extends to business school, where the majority of people in the country take stanford over harvard, but the vast majority of internationals take harvard because the brand name is much bigger which is important back home",

I'm not wrong; I just hadn't seen the updated yield rate numbers.\n\nStanford's yield rate was 82.1% or 81.1% (some of their school-affiliated websites say 81.1, some say 82.1. Poets and Quants say 82.)\n\n[*https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2019/05/07/these-universities-were-the-toughest-to-get-into-in-2019/2/*](https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2019/05/07/these-universities-were-the-toughest-to-get-into-in-2019/2/)\n\n\\-----\n\nHarvard's was 81.7 percent for the Class of 2022, according to the website of their school newspaper.\n\n[*https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/05/83-percent-of-those-admitted-to-harvard-will-attend/*](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/05/83-percent-of-those-admitted-to-harvard-will-attend/)\n\n>The yield for the Class of 2022 was 81.7 percent.\n\n\\-----\n\nI guess it's really not a big difference at all; anything above 70 is ridiculous and anything approaching 80 is so crazy to me; it's cool to think that 4/5 of accepted applicants ended up attending. Very impressive.",
