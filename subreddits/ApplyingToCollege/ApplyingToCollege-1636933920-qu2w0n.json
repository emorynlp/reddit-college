  "title:": "Would certain recommendations help or perhaps make things more difficult?",
  "text": "First, let me address the title, I don't think that a recommendation could make things worse (IDK and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask) but I did not know how to phrase it. I'm trying to apply to somewhat competitive colleges in the Boston area, I would consider myself a good student, unfortunately, my grades don't quite reflect it. I have strong native Mayan roots. My mom and my family know Rigoberta Mench\u00fa (She won the 92' Nobel Peace prize for fighting inequality against Native Mayan People in GUA)  since before I was born. She has known me for quite some time and we frequently had get-togethers before I moved to the US permanently. This brings me to the question at hand. Would it be appropriate if she wrote a letter of recommendation that speaks to what type of person I am, or could this somehow be seen as entitled?",
