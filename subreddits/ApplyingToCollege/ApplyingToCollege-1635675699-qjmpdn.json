  "text": "Anybody else feeling sad because they don't attend a fancy feeder/boarding/top-rated/charter/magnet/private school?? cause same. I'm so sad. I feel like AOs won't even consider me.\n\n(Edit: I would like to clarify that my intention is not to discredit those currently attending the listed schools above. I was word vomiting because data proves that many privileged students from those schools have a much higher chance of getting into such institutions with better resources. Please don\u2019t get offended!!)\n\n(edit 2: also, hugs for my intl. /FGLI students. I didn't mean to make this post to discourage you all. Just wish colleges would choose more students from underrepresented areas. You all deserve to shine and deserve a spot. That is all<3)",

                  "text": "Sure, but far more students from those super competitive high schools get into those elite colleges peer class, compared to those from average ones. The majority of High school valedictorians don't get into T10 schools even though they performed better relative to their peers. If you go to an elite private, or magnet school, even if you're not ranked 1st you still have a shot to get into T10. If you go to an avg high school, if you're not ranked 1st or have a very strong hook. Your chances of getting into a t10 are virtually non-existent.\n\nCheck out https://polarislist.com/ The schools that are sending double digit numbers of students to HPM, are all either elite Private schools, elite magnet schools, or public schools in super wealthy, well educated suburbs.\n\nAlso I think your overestimating the whole 'colleges evaluate you in the context of your school/classmates' thing. What this means, is basically to take the most challenging coursework at your school, and do as best as you can in them. It doesn't mean you literally have to outrank anyone. As long as you have a decent enough class rank. You will meet this criteria. Being able to compete against students from all over the country is the more valuable criteria and going to an elite school that has a shit ton of resources and a good rapport with top colleges is far more valuable in that regard.",

(this isn\u2019t the case for all these schools) but i know my school was a college prep fancy private school one of the top in my city and the rigor of ALL the courses even the easier ones is pretty outstanding and every day was stressful and i wasn\u2019t even in all APs or honors in fact i only took 1 AP in all 4 of my years. so i guess i\u2019m talking more abt like magnet and college prep schools and not just private cuz of course there are private schools that aren\u2019t this stressful. but me and all my friends used to have discussions about it and in public speaking class a few people even gave speeches about the system. like there was so much pressure out on all of us to pass and they were always talking abt like the status of our school you know wanting us to go to the best colleges and well represent our school so they were always pushing for more especially during the college application process. just my view. i guess all i\u2019m saying is it is a blessing and a curse. and some ppl can handle that pressure but a lot of us couldn\u2019t. (again just wanna say i count my blessings i\u2019m extremely grateful that i got to attend the school)",

(also don\u2019t wanna seem like i\u2019m some privileged entitled person but still complain abt everything) cuz i\u2019m definetely not that lol. defintely great gil but honestly would probably prefer going to a less preppy school especially if you have anxiety or any other type of mental illness really like i do. depends on the person for sure cuz some people can take that pressure and thrive in that environment. i\u2019m just not one of those ppl \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Yeah but at least there were resources. \n\nI went to a poor public high school in a poor area, cause I\u2019m poor:\n\n* 28% of the kids are proficient in math (most fail basic algebra)\n* 39% are proficient in reading (most read at the 6th grade level)\n* our clubs are barely funded because the money goes to the football team. The soccer has made it to nationals but yeah let\u2019s fund the football team that hasn\u2019t won in 19 years. \n* there is no SAT prep, anymore. We had one SAT teacher, who was also the Mock Trial/Moot Court teacher and the Swim Coach. He was arrested for child sexual assault, child molestation, and other horrible things. I cried reading the stories from my friends and graduating class about what he did to them. I was in Mock Trial and he offered to drive me home. I got so lucky I said no. Other teachers knew and did nothing because we were just minority kids, they didn\u2019t care what happened to us. \n* prevalent racism from many White teachers. We got called gangsters, trash, multiple slurs for Black, Hispanics, and Asians. \n* THE AVERAGE SAT SCORE FOR MY OLD HS IS A 992 \n\nAnd that was the HIGHEST average we have had in years. \n\nI look at schools like Exeter and Horace Mann and wonder if I could\u2019ve been better. But it\u2019s too late for me. \n\nI won\u2019t send my kids to a school like Exeter or Phillips unless they want to. But I won\u2019t send them to a poor high school like mine. I know a lot of the public schools in the next county over are nice and have all their clubs funded cause the county is rich. At least there, they would have options. They would have SAT prep and tutors, and tons of ECs from Student Council to YACHTING. That\u2019s right. They have yachting and horseback riding as ECs at a public school. \n\nOf course, if I want my kids to attend a nice public school, I have to be rich and get a home in that county (homes cost 1 million in that county).",

      "text": "(on my alt so I don't doxx myself but) I'm a senior at a super highly ranked STEM magnet school and it honestly is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there are amazing resources available here, all sorts of classes available for you to take, and some absolutely amazing peers and teachers! I'll admit that you can't really ignore these obvious benefits, and I'm really lucky to have had the opportunity to make use of them. But also, and I'm saying this as someone who loves my high school, it's not always all it's cracked up to be.\n\nFor one thing, the coursework is *tough*. My school's math department is a good example of this: on the two math tests I've taken so far this year, the class averages were a 78 and an 85, which dragged everyone's grades in the class down by roughly a letter. This is not exactly good news if, like almost my entire class, you're a senior concerned about what's going on your transcript. There's also an awful lot of homework, to the point that during the week before early deadlines (!) I wasn't able to do any college apps work until yesterday, Saturday, because I was so busy finishing projects and assignments.\n\nAs for class selection, I'm kind of disappointed that despite all the opportunities, I couldn't actually pursue stuff as much as I wanted. The strength of our STEM program means that kids are heavily inclined to quit their other interests (such as in the humanities and arts) for STEM, and those who don't (I, for instance, am part of the school band program) can't really delve super deep into stuff because there just isn't much space on our schedule. (Plus, we get docked on our GPA for not taking as much fancy advanced stuff.) Looking back on all the courses I've taken, not many of them were ones I couldn't take at my neighborhood high school, which is really unfortunate.\n\nAlso, the \"amazing peers\" thing has its drawbacks too. Have you ever gone on A2C or ChanceMe and seen all the kids with their crazy accomplishments and gone, \"Oh my gosh, I'm nothing compared to them\"? Yeah, now imagine if you have to see them in the flesh seven hours a day, five days a week. And the worst part is, *they're all nice people!* You don't even get the satisfaction of \"well, at least I'm a good person\" because everyone else is too. Instead, you're left with constant impostor syndrome, praying that some crazy good kid isn't also applying to your ED/REA school.\n\nThere's also the stress culture. I alluded to this earlier, but there's a lot of work and everyone does a lot of stuff outside of class. Time and energy are not infinite resources, unfortunately, so what ends up happening is that people get really stressed and sleep-deprived (which happens at every school, but even moreso here). There have been several times where I'd see a tired classmate and ask, \"What time did you sleep last night?\" only to be met with bloodshot eyes and a slightly manic \"I didn't.\" This is bad for obvious reasons. The administration and student mental health groups are trying to change this, but change is naturally slow.\n\nThese are just some of the main things I've noticed over the years here. Now, this is just my two cents, and I'm not trying to disparage my school (I really do love it here!) or other similar schools, but I think the drawbacks are real and they should be acknowledged. Also, keep in mind AOs aim to contextualize every application, so even if you're at a fancy school they're going to see how you took advantage of the resources available *at the fancy school*, not just in general.\n\n(Wow, this was a really long essay. If only I could put that much work into my supplementals...)",

A family down the street from me (also poor) put a chunk of their financials into sending their daughter to a very good private high school in my area. She also goes to an ivy now. Either path has pretty good chances of taking you where you want to go, as long as you\u2019re a competitive applicant. That being said, I would say that the majority of people I know at my college come from families who are very wealthy, very high achieving, or both. Their admissions advantage is not necessarily derived from privilege they\u2019ve experienced only in high school, but instead from privilege they\u2019ve had access to their whole lives. That is actually likely good news for you though, because it kinda suggests that the particular high school itself doesn\u2019t matter too much, but instead it\u2019s the life circumstances that are significant. And if you\u2019re in a place such that you\u2019re considering applying to some tippy top schools, it means that you\u2019ve put the work in to overcome this wealth/privilege gap, and you will be just fine. \nThis turned out longer than I intended it to be, but hopefully I can inspire some of you who are having doubts about your application. It\u2019s not guaranteed that you get into your first choice, but you WILL be okay and have a great time wherever you end up.",

Being in a program that does not provide as many services or as much individual attention to the student and still thriving is impressive, and so is being near top of your class at a private institution. Admissions people get applications from both year over year and, in my personal opinion from the stats of the people I have talked to on this campus, admissions people take into account your particular situation and education accordingly when evaluating your application. Being the best member of the community you can be by contributing back, truly applying yourself to your academics in a way that is reflected in your transcripts and GPA, having a solid SAT score, displaying passion and drive, and not letting adversity prevent you from doing any of the above seems to be what admissions people generally care about in this most recent admissions cycle. You should not let the lower prestige of your HS prevent you from applying to great schools, rather embrace it and show that you thrived in that environment however you can. It\u2019s not possible to do better than the best that you can do in your particular environment whether that relates to your HS, socio-economic status, or both and, at least in my experience at this top institution, AO\u2019s understand that and consider it in their decision-making.",

      "text": "So I went to a college prep academy and I don\u2019t think I was at an advantage when applying within my state. I was waitlisted at my top 2 schools. I ended up foregoing the traditional college route and joined the merchant marines, 8 years later I\u2019ve returned to a four year school, now pursuing a paramedic license so I can be a medical officer on ships. In 2021 I made it into the two schools I had applied to as a highschool senior in 2012. Without any other academic experience since then, just based off my highschool grades and applying as an adult with a clear path of the career I want. And I\u2019m a hell of a lot more focused now that I have a clear goal I\u2019m pursuing.\n\nIf I remember correctly college admissions allot a certain number of spots at each school, and at a private school you\u2019re competing against the really competitive kids. I made it into numerous out of state schools but I didn\u2019t make it into the 2 state schools on my list because the other students in my class with better grades were just more academically appealing to them.",

People hide their ECs from each other in fear that others will \"get ahead.\" People snake each other out all the time.\n\nEveryone has research, there are people with patents, international level awards, we have like 20 national merit semifinalists. There are like 40+ people with straight 4.0s. People take 6 APs in junior and senior year. We have people perfect scoring APs all the time.\n\nI don't think it's as rosy as you think it is. More resources means more competition. Since everyone's a demon, with insane academics and ECs, it's near impossible to stand out.\n\nDespite being demons, only 1 or 2 students get accepted into Ivy's or MIT every year, so idk if the chances are really much better. Maybe the data says otherwise, but it doesn't feel like its much different here. Most people wish they went to a less competitive school so they could \"stand out.\"",

The kid who lives too far away from everything to participate (assuming online opportunities aren\u2019t enough for their area of interest). The kid from a middle class or above family who could comfortably afford to send them to summer opportunities/a better fit high school/etc but chooses not to).\n\n3.

They\u2019re focused on surviving, not school and if they ever have the idea college may be a way out, the school counselor just laughs given their grades (and no student ever goes anywhere but the local CC where they invariably drop out in their first year. Far more attend jail than college). Same thing for the eldest of a poor family who has to work to put food on the table when not babysitting younger siblings).\n\n4. The life-punch type (everything was on track until life punched them in the face: the super star athlete who got unlucky with a debilitating injury, the straight A & EC champ whose parents died in a car accident early senior year who can no longer concentrate on school work or apps anymore, the senior who is somehow seriously sabotaged by a jealous classmate through no fault of their own, the terribly unlucky senior whose had a series of moderately bad things happen in a row and it\u2019s enough to drown them but not enough to be a trauma essay etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone else: life happens, it\u2019s rarely ideal for anybody, focus on yourself, what\u2019s within your control & work it out.

All my life I longed to go to a public school because of the vast opportunities and diversity I can get there. Why do I have to pay $10 for a HOME GAME when we\u2019re 3-6. Very pretentious people so u stay alone from the drama and toxicity. Like if u have a .1 or 1 gpa lower than someone else, then your lazy, a piece of shit and have no future ambitions. Administration is racist too",

I go to a top 50 public school and the benefit isn't as big as you think. The only thing a top school does is force you to take a very rigorous course load (ex: at my school the average amount of Aps taken is 11). There are actually some downsides as well. For example, you have to compete with your own classmates to get into top schools and there are way less extracurricular opportunities due to the school having less kids (my grade has under 100). The competitive evnviornment can also be bad for those who don't do well which leads then to have mental health problems.",

The biggest problem I'm facing is at the moment because our school DOES NOT have any counselor. I'm applying Cornell ED and am receiving ZERO support from my school! The teachers don't know how to write recommendations. The counselor LOR according to my school is only a generalized one for all students, which is of 15 lines. Now, they're threatening us to not upload our transcripts and all because we submitted our application without asking them. The deadline for Cornell ED is in ~15 hours, and our school is yet to upload everything. Wish me luck.\n\nSo yaa! I feel although you might get opportunities at small high schools usually difficult to get at super good schools due to the competition, the lack of even the most essential opportunities disadvantages you in the most unimaginable ways!",
