  "text": "Hi, I'm currently a sophomore (CA resident) at a TX public university, and I applied to transfer to many schools and got accepted into UMich and UDub (main campus in Ann Arbor and Seattle for both) (these are my only 2 options).\n\nUMich Pros:  \n\\- have friends from HS who I know really well who go to UMich and love it  \n\\- everyone I know loves Michigan even if it's hard  \n\\- rigorous academics  \n\\- really good university with top notch STEM  \n\\- great medical school and great opportunities to conduct research and get clinical experience  \n\\- top ranked bio program  \n\\- college town (love the college town experience), loved my visit\n\nUMich cons:  \n\\- really expensive compared to my current uni (\\~50k) and UW (\\~55k) at like 70k+  \n\\- related but would have to take out loans for about 60k over my degree at UMich (fortunately have parents covering rest)\n\nUDub Pros:  \n\\- Cheaper than UMich  \n\\- know more people from HS but don't know them as well  \n\\- rigorous and academics  \n\\- really good university with top notch STEM  \n\\- great medical school and great opportunities to conduct research and get clinical experience  \n\\- top ranked bio program  \n\\- pretty campus\n\nUDub Cons:  \n\\- have to take \\~13k loans (feel bit better about this than 65k loans though)  \n\\- everyone seems really depressed there  \n\\- visited recently and it was rlly nice but also smack in the middle of massive city  \n\\- maybe I'll get a very slightly worse education or smth  \n\\- harder by a bit to take non major classes (but very poss still i think)\n\nSo, what do u guys think, shud I go to UMich or not?",
