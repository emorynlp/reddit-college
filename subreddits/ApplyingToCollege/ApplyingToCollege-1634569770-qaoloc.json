  "text": "i am so frustrated and lost lol. i was going to write a story about my mental health bc it\u2019s a big part of who i am (i\u2019ve been dealing with it for five years). but i do not want to write a sob story and i don\u2019t want admissions officers to take pity. i haven\u2019t really had any interests bc i was depressed lol so i\u2019m just very stuck at the moment. i\u2019m also a very bad writer and it\u2019s hard for me to put my thoughts into words. what are some good questions to ask yourself to brainstorm? also just any advice would be greatly appreciated",

      "text": "Look at college guy's website, he has a bunch of brainstorming exercises/ideas. Mostly centered around values/interests. You want to show yourself in the best possible light so I'd suggest focusing on a value you have and showing it.\n\nEveryone has interests! You could even talk about music/games/shows u like and connect it back to yourself. Maybe take a walk and take note of things in nature?\n\nI'd personally avoid talking about mental health in the essay because  \n1. It's a common topic  \n2. It makes you seem like a liability esp. if you haven't 'dealt with it'",
