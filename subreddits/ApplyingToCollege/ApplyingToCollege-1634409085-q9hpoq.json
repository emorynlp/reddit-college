  "text": "Hi I'm a student applying to Cambridge from the United States, so I know I have to submit a transcript. However, for the life of me, I cannot figure out where to send the transcript. My school uses Parchment, so I have sent it to \"Cambridge Admissions - Graduate Studies\" but I get the feeling that that is incorrect. Does anyone know where students need to send their transcripts?",
