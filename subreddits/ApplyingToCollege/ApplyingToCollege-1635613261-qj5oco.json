  "text": "I'm applying to Colorado School of Mines, who has two optional writing supplements. I haven't written them yet and am planning to apply EA... The common app says that they are \"optional but strongly recommended.\" \n\nHow much could not submitting them hurt my chances? I have above average stats in terms of SAT and possibly GPA for Mines, but my ECs might not be anything special (or maybe they are, no clue tbh). \n\nAlso, could the lack of essays impact merit scholarships? Theoretically, if the scholarships are truly based off of merit alone, they wouldn't really care about essays, but realistically I imagine they do.",
