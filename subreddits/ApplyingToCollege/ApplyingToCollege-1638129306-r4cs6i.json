  "text": "According to the UC visual and performing arts requirements, they allow two one-semester courses from the same discipline such as music, dance, and visual arts.   \n\n\nI have taken a semester of drawing 1, photography, and computer animations.   \n\n\nWould these semester-long courses fulfill the requirement since they are all visual arts, but **not sequential** (Ex: drawing 1 and drawing 2)?  \n\n\nThank you so much.",
