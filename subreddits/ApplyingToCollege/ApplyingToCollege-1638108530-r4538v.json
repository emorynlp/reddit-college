      "text": "Hey sorry but I do have a question- apologies if it sounds dumb, but... how do yall start so many clubs? Like after a certain point, won't all those be saturated/made already so new ones can't sprout out?\n\nBut for ordering... I think it's difficult since the difference between each activity is not very big. I'd say you want 2 categories of sorts? So the ones you put first will be 7, 1, 2, 6 in any order, and the others will just be ranked lower",

          "text": "Huh, I am not sure I understand why you grouped those things together\u2026 Do you care to explain please?\n\nTo your question: I think the secret is to find someone to do it with you, who can help you out when there is a lot to do right now. Also, it helps if school doesn\u2019t cost you too much time (which it doesn\u2019t in my case). Also, don\u2019t be shy to give others responsibility. I know the feeling: but I can do it better! Well, maybe, but you have to focus on the stuff that is especially important to be done well",
