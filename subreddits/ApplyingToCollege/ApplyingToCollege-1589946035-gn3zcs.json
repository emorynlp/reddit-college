Whether you ended up first or last place in that National Science Olympiad you went to last year, just remember that the fact you made it to that level of competition is groundbreaking.\n\nI'm confident we are all going to end up in great professional careers. The college admissions game is a crapshoot, but we are all hardworkers. And that won't change whether we go to community college or top twenty schools.\n\nCongratulations for making it this far. \nAnd upcoming sophomore, junior, and senior classes, let's give it our best to show what we are capable of this next academic school year.",

And it was even shittier a couple of years ago, when I first started preschool.\nBack then, you had to be a certain age to start a certain grade or level of education in both public and private schools. So when I transferred schools from a preschool to one of those kindergarten through middle school complexes, I was denied admission to the third grade of kindergarten because I was two months shy from completing the minimum age requirement. \n\nSo I was left no choice but to repeat a year of preschool, even though I had zero academic problems. Truth to be told, I remember drawing anatomy figures and full on organs in preschool. By the time I hit puberty I was finally diagnosed with intellectual giftedness. (I hate the stigma. I see myself more as a hard worker than a \"gifted\" person).\n\nThis has happened to a ton of people in my grade. Technically, I should be getting ready for my junior year, not my sophomore year. I've moved on though, I appreciate that extra year now more than ever because it gave me more time to sharpen my skills and encounter new challenges from being in below average early education classes. In a way, it helped me become the ambitious person I am today, but I still feel it's  unfair.\n\nIt sucked back then, really messed up my self esteem when I was in elementary school.",

Yep, harvard students and ASU students are both getting a good college education. In fact, someone with a 4.0 at ASU is way more likely to go further or get into a higher ranking grad school than a shitty 2.0 harvard student. In conclusion, all an ivy league school\u2019s name really is, is a bragging point. Students who go to these schools are going to want to yell at me and say how hard they worked to get there, and i\u2019m very proud of you, okay? But your professors are just as good as professors at other colleges, in fact people graduate from harvard and go teach at other schools. All that really matters is what the school offers that fit YOUR interests, what you can afford, and where you can succeed. If you want the best education or the most renowned professors, they can be found at any school. Go somewhere cool and fun, where you KNOW you can be successful in that environment. You can be smart enough for harvard, but if ASU is the better fit then fuck harvard. (No shade to ASU it just felt like the best example here. I have nothing but respect for both schools).",

ASU\u2019s offerings are pretty weak unless u jump to grad level classes early, and then you\u2019re kinda stuck without many peers the same age. At UChicago for example there are the honors analysis & algebra sequence which are way harder than any undergrad sequence ASU offers and classes you can actually be in with people your age.\n\nPeople should really look at course offerings and what\u2019s covered in them between schools rather than just saying that every school teaches the same thing.",

The Harvard student, meanwhile, was outcompeted by their more impressive peers (many of which have connections that give them a leg-up in the first place), and doesn\u2019t have nearly as robust of an educational experience.\n\nAlso: you\u2019ve put a lot of value on coursework. Ivies are well-known for grade inflation and their coursework isn\u2019t supposed to be any more difficult.

I also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s very difficult to do research with professors at Harvard, but I can\u2019t say for sure on that. A middling GPA from Harvard will also get WAY more interviews for anything where it\u2019s difficult to get interviews for (ib, mbb, quant finance).\n\nI place an emphasis on coursework because for something like Math application to grad school is primarily courses+letters of recommendation+research. Having a rec from a well known prof (much more common at Harvard) can carry a lot of weight. I actually have looked at the different courses at different schools, and can tell u that it\u2019s wildly different lol. Go look at ASU\u2019s math classes for undergrads and read syllabuses, it\u2019s very limited. It seems that you haven\u2019t really looked into it and are just parroting the fact that \u201call schools teach the same stuff\u201d. Find me advanced courses for undergrads in algebra or analysis or geometry or any math in the ASU catalog https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/classlist?t=2207&s=MAT&hon=F&promod=F&e=open&page=1\n.

You seem to be conflating rigor with name value. The OP of this comment thread is talking about going to a school with high name value and whether that provides an advantage. As I said before, Harvard and other Ivies have massive grade inflation. If you are interested, you should read more about it here: https://www.businessinsider.com/13-schools-where-its-really-hard-to-fail-2013-5 The classes offered may be more varied depending on the strength and size of the department as well. A school with a small math department isn\u2019t going to offer as many classes or have as many big-name profs, but that\u2019s a separate discussion. (In my experience, this is something that grad applicants struggle to understand as well.) \n\nAs for your first points about opportunities - have you heard the saying \u201cgrants beget grants\u201d before? If a student competes more easily for scholarships and opportunities at their home institution, they are more competitive outside of their institution. From my experience, it is also extremely difficult to do undergraduate research at Harvard - not only are there more students looking for research because the overall pool is more competitive, but professors are less likely to take on undergrads for meaningful work (that might be publishable) because they have a lot of grad students to work with. You are correct about some fields being able to fall back on the name value of a school, even with a middling GPA. But in my field, where everyone\u2019s applying to grad school and research experience is king, a student\u2019s direct competition with peers for limited resources will have the biggest effect on their career opportunities.",

Mizzou might have shittier math, but that's not what I'd be there for. \n\nI could go to Columbia for pre-med, or I could go to stony brook which is considered a top tier school for medicine. My degree wouldn't look as fancy, but stony brook has lab opportunities for middle of the pack students, whereas in Columbia my girlfriend can't get any lab time until she's a  senior or in graduate school.\n\nFind a school with good results in the major you want. Almost any course at a top teir ivy can be just as good as a course at a school with a much lower barrier to entry, you just need to do your research.",
