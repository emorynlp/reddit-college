  "text": "I\u2019ve struggled with depression my entire life, and honestly these past few months are probably the first and only time I\u2019ve ever existed without it while being aware of existing at all. It  would be challenging to NOT mention it given the influence it has had on me. Furthermore, it\u2019s made my prior grades abysmal, so that would require explaining. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m also aware of the risk involved in making this my topic. After all, from a colleges perspective it\u2019s a risky investment to accept someone with a history of mental illness since they have a higher chance of dropping out / failing. Due to this risk, I\u2019m exploring all avenues to ensure I make this essay good. Most places seem to say the same thing with spinning it into a strength, discuss your improvement more than the suffering, etc. but these are a bit vague for my liking. Does anyone have examples if good essays on the topic, alongside any less obvious tips?",
