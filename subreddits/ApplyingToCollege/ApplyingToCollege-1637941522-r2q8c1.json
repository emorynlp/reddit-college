If you take a piece of fruit at lunch and/or dinner, it could be a \"free\" healthy snack for later or breakfast for tomorrow.\n\nAlso, you can usually buy a fridge/freezer (they are often on sale during the summer) for about the same price as renting.  But it's a pain in the butt to haul a fridge/freezer during move in/move out.",

It's still kinda unnecessary\n\nIF you are going to be going to a school where there's >10ish professors in your department (small college, uncommon major, whatever), look up some of those professors on ratemyprofessor. Also check out your schools average rating on RMP. \n\nThere are about 8 professors in my department that teach the 15-18 classes in my major I'll have to take. My life would be a lot more miserable if those professors sucked. Yours would be too. Ratemyprof is ur friend.",
