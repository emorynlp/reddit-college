  "text": "I am an international student, and it is in no way easy for me to cancel and retake the SAT (financially and a time matter) especially that the October SAT was my first and the last chance this year!\n\nSo if I mentioned in the additional info section that I was really sick when I took the test would seem like a lame justification or a good reason for not scoring that high on the test? I mean how would they validate that I am saying the truth?\n\nPs: my GPA is really good and way above average, so would that help as proof?",
