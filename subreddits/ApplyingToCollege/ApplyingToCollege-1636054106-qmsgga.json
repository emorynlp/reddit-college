Don't sweat it bro just talk about stuff u are passionate about and sound like a big fat nerd. Make u prepare for the question \"why swarthmore\" and emphasize on how each element you mention is important to you PERSONALLY. Make it super personal and ask questions!",

This is not a deciding factor for Admission. Plan ahead, be on time, dress appropriately if you have questions prepared it may be easier...and answer any questions candidly. Smile! and enjoy it. If you are very uncomfortable, you might want to work on being in these situations for life-experience.!",

My interviewer just asked some common questions like \"tell me about yourself\" and then got into some details about my ECs. It felt like a conversation because he didn't just read off questions from a pre-prepared list. I got to ask him a few questions about what he studied and his experience there. If you have any questions let me know.",

He asked me about what I was doing in school and I got to talk about Anne Hutchinson and women in the Puritan colonies for like five minutes. The rest of it was mostly me explaining my ECs which are a bit weird, and then me asking questions about Swarthmore. You'll be totally fine! Just write down a short list of questions you want to ask, have a couple bullet points ready about why you like the school, and you'll do great.",
