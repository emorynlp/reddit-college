  "title:": "Early Action vs. Regular Decision for UMich",
  "text": "I've been planning on applying to UMich early and the deadline is in 3 weeks. I've been brainstorming for my supplemental essays, but I haven't written much yet and I'm not particularly good at writing. Could it be better to apply RD instead of EA so I would have more time to work on and improve my essays? In the extra months I wouldn't plan on trying to do more ECs or anything, I would just want to use the time on my essays. In other words, is it better to apply early and risk rushing through my essays or apply regular and take more time to go through my application? How much does applying early help chances of getting in (if any)?",
