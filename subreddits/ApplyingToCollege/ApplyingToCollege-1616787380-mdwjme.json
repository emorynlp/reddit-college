Many candidates reapply and enroll after one or two years elsewhere.  Others enroll in our graduate and professional schools after earning  their undergraduate degrees. Should you remain interested in Carolina,  we hope you will stay in touch. We would welcome the chance to help.\"\n\nA lot of kids are obviously hurting right now and think that their college academic lives are ruined before it has even started. Not true, in fact, many of you are about to start your long journey towards becoming the next generation of graduate/professional students, lawyers and physicians. There will be many more stops on this journey. Just because you didn't get a chance to attend as an undergraduate, doesn't mean you won't be accepted later on. That little touch gives hope and lets face it, hope is really important right now.",
