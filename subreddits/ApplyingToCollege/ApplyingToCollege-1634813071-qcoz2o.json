  "text": "Hey guys!\n\n**Demographics:** White Male from under represented country. (Am not applying for financial aid)\n\n**Age:** 22 (Had to do mandatory military service)\n\n**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science\n\n**GPA**: In my national exams to graduate high school my average was 86/100 and weighted average 109/100 (I took the hardest classes).\n\n**SAT:** 1440- 720 math 720 English. [breakdown](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492511023056683008/898541022097866792/image0.png)\n\n**Coursework:** No AP's in my country, the national exams I took are sort of compared to AP's I guess, I had 10 of them which is pretty much the most a student can take. I have a computer science and programming course within those. \n\n**Honors:** Academic Excellence award 12th grade.\n\nCommunity engagement excellence award 12th grade.\n\nWithin an organization I was a part in that teaches students from the periphery of my country about entrepreneurship, we made a \"company\" and created a prototype for a product. We participated in the competition of that organization (it is a national competition between the entire organization) called \"Entrepreneur of the year\". We won third place in two different years and were recognized by 2 national newspapers and a local one.\n\nMe and my group won a sort of regional Skillz competition (programming).\n\n**Activities:** [took a screenshot of a poorly worded list](https://gyazo.com/7b8e3180f164802e0cde53378eee1fab)\n\n**Essays:** my common app essay is pretty strong I would say, very unique experience.\n\n**LOR:** Since no one in my country (or my city for that matter) applies to US colleges, the teachers have no idea how to write a good LOR. They do like me and the letters should be good, but nothing too crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What I'm asking:** Let me know what can be realistic reaches for me.\n\nI am probably doing ED to Northeastern (wanted an ivy or a higher ranked university but am pretty sure I have no chance). Just give me both a reverse chance me and a real chance me I guess for my major in top universities, and what you would recommend me to go for.",
