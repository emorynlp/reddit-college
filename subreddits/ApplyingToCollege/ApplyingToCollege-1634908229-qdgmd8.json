  "text": "Soo I have a problem, I am an international student, and my parents separated in 2014, and got a divorce in 2016, but I don\u2019t talk to my dad much, he doesn\u2019t help us financially, and obviously he doesn\u2019t live w us, and he doesn\u2019t speak English to fill out css profile on his own, but he isn\u2019t absent, so he kind of exists and I have his contact information and blah blah blah. BUT, I got yelled at for asking for financial documents from my dad, and I don\u2019t have an official statement from police or social workers to fill out CSS profile non-custodial parent waiver. Anyone\u2019s got the same problem? Please, help me, Idk what to do\ud83d\ude2d",

If he does contribute, you can fill out his financial information next year, but i don\u2019t know how strict the criteria are for no contact. \n\nCSS profile is kinda bs",

I then realized that I'd made a mistake on my CSS Profile regarding his employment status so now I've got to get that fixed. \n\nBTW, does anyone know how to make changes to the CSS Profile after you've submitted it?",

If he doesn't comply, can you try and talk to the colleges you're applying to and explain the situation? Maybe email them? \n\nI'm in a low-key similar situation but like he does financially contribute for my education. Hope everything works out, good luck!!",
