  "text": "I EDed to a school and their npc showed a good amount of aid, but my EFC on FAFSA is like 12k higher. So I was wondering if the EFC or the NPC is more reliable and if I could use the NPC to appeal my aid. Has anyone from previous classes received a fin aid package that was significantly different from the NPC?",

Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.",
