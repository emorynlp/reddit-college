  "title:": "Stanford Parent Contribution for QuestBridge",
  "text": "I just ran Stanford's Net Price Calculator, and it says my estimated parent contribution is \\~$3,000. This is very worrying to me since I know Stanford prefers to match with those with a PC of $0. The thing is, most of the financial questions they asked were based on last year's tax returns. This year, my parents have had a significant drop in income. Anything I can do about this?",
