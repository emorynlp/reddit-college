  "text": "Supplementary material: I participated in a very prestigious music festival singing in a choir, there\u2019s a video on YouTube of the performance, but there are 150+ people on stage. Should I submit it? The performance is of very high-level. (I\u2019m a international students so I thought that a video might give an idea of what I wrote about an EC in the respective section). \n\nTHE COLLEGE WEBSITE STATES \u201cIf not a solo recording, please indicate your\nperformance in the description\nsection of the media details\u201d.",
