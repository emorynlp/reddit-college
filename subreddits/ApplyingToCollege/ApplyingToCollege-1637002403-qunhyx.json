  "text": "I was looking into how to make a CSS profile and came across that I needed to mention payed tax on 2020. My dad has payed tax for 2019 in 2020 but for 2020 itself, hasn't payed any tax yet. He has filled the tax form for 2020 and sent it for assessment. But it hasn't been assessed and returned yet. What can I do?\n\nHe said that he'll probably be able to get papers by Nov 30, but my deadline is Dec 1. In fact, for financial aid, some deadlines may have already been crossed.\n\nSo should I just not apply for financial aid? What can I do? Please help me.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic, since I have yet to receive the tax return and apply for financial aid, should I actually not apply for it? Do universities reject those that tend to ask for aid?",

They may adjust, and as long as he hasn\u2019t attempted to defraud or something, it shouldn\u2019t be that far off (especially if a tax preparer handled the return). So you can use the data from it regardless of if he has a refund or payment due because he has sent the official return.",

Many colleges separate their decision to accept you from what tuition aid they may grant; many colleges are need-blind. You can search on the schools\u2019 websites for this info under \u201cfinancial aid.\u201d If you\u2019ve already done FAFSA the CSS shouldn\u2019t take much longer. It\u2019s more detailed but it\u2019s what you need for school aid (vs gov\u2019t aid).",
