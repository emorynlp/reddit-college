  "text": "I\u2019m asking for my cousin, her last school to apply to is UIUC but her family is a bit low on funds to supply the last bit of her application fees. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll get one by asking or not because she\u2019s international also and we have a reputation of not really getting fee waivers.",

      "text": "I agree with the other poster. With no need-based aid for her, if she can't afford the app fee, consider how she would afford the school. Check UIUC merit availability,  though ilthe school is generally competitive enough that I imagine merit possibilities tend to be not huge.",
