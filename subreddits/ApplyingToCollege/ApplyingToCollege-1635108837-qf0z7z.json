  "text": "Regret procrastinating but I\u2019m unsure of what to write about. Writing isn\u2019t the problem it\u2019s just which idea can convey myself best bc they all hold equal importance in my life. I have three options I\u2019m thinking of and that is:\n\n1. Walking away from God as I\u2019ve grown older. For some context, my dads a pastor and I resented my religion bc it dictated my life (scared to use it tho since it\u2019s controversial and heard it\u2019s an overused topic)\n\n2. My identity as a black American at pwi\u2019s and experiencing racism, discomfort, isolation, and self hatred. How in light of those experiences and last years protests it has led me to create a club at my school focusing on social issues and volunteer work. \n\n3. Living bi culturally in America and hating everything abt my ethnicity until one cultural practice impacted me enough to take pride and love myself.\n\nPlease give me your thoughts/advice",

      "text": "- Would stay away from #1 as it is not only overused, but can easily upset the admissions counselor. If your admissions counselor is super religious and they have you and another applicant with the exact same stats as you but a different essay still written as well as yours, who do you think they may subconsciously lean towards? \n- Being from a different culture is also a bit overused. However I like how for #2 you relate it to the club you made. And I like how in #3 you relate it to an actual cultural practice. Lots of people just write \u201ci\u2019m a different race and it\u2019s hard\u201d and don\u2019t go deeper by connecting it to something else, so props to you. \n- I would do which ever out of #2 and #3 you think would be the most unique and that you can write the best about",
