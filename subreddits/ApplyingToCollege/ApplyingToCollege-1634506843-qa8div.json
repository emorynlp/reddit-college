Your SAT and GPA is within the range of several, and you can still get in if you\u2019re below given you write a good essay. Since you don\u2019t know what to major in, I\u2019d Recommend a larger school since you\u2019ll have more options.\n\nCommunity college is an option if you want to save money, but your scores aren\u2019t bad enough to mean you have to go to one.",
