  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a sophomore in at Rutgers University, New Jersey hoping to transfer to UCSD or SDSU (I\u2019m a resident of California). I\u2019ve done some research and I know that UC\u2019s prioritize California Community Colleges and I haven\u2019t seen any info like that for CSU. Despite knowing that, I\u2019m still going to try and if anyone has any advice or has been in the same situation please feel free to reach out, it would be really helpful!",
