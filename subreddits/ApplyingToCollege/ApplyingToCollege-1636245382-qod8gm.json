  "text": "I ended up being extremely desperate last week due to insane amounts of stress resulting from personal/family-related issues and I cheated on a test and got caught while the teacher was grading it, do colleges rescind over stuff like this? Most of the colleges I've applied to haven't required any information regarding in-school punishments and if they do, they only ask if it's a suspension over a few days.

They get soft real quick and forget all about what you did, maybe even letting you retake the test.",
