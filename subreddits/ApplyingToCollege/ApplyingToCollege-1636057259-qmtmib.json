  "text": "title. I'm doing fine in the class but I don't really know if it's worth it. I've already scored a 5 on AP Lang so that will get me some English credit, just debating if I need/want more. currently being put through the wringer between CRJs and college apps\n\ncontext: I'll be an engineering major, possibly in honors college (so I'd take the enrichment english or whatever), and one of my top schools give lit the same course credit as lang and the other gives a different course credit. oh, and my school's AP exam registration closes in  2 days. I've payed but that's the deadline to get a full refund",

If some do, are the extras course credits valuable towards graduation?\n\nCurious - how does an exam in May conflict with college apps?",

So if you don\u2019t feel like you need to take it then don\u2019t waste your energy and money",
