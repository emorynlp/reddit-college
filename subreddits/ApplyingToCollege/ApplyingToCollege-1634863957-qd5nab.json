  "text": "I\u2019m a high school senior in my first semester. I want to be an engineer and have already taken AP physics 1 and got an A. But this year I\u2019m taking both AP Calc and AP physics C. AP physics is so incredibly hard and I just don\u2019t have the motivation to do good or to study. I\u2019ve been struggling mentally since my junior year ever since COVID and it\u2019s taken a real tank to my will to do good. I\u2019m debating dropping it but I don\u2019t know what that will look like to colleges, especially since I want to be an engineer. What I\u2019m trying to ask is, should I drop it?",
