  "title:": "Common App Essay Question",
  "text": "I have finished writing my common app essay and like what I have written and don't want to change much, but I have come to realize that my essay *could* be interpreted in a way that answers the \"Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.\" prompt, but I don't want to risk submitting it under this prompt if it doesn't quite answer everything that admissions officers are looking for in this prompt. If this is the case, is it best that I submit my essay under the \"Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.\" prompt?",

      "text": "The first prompt contains two or's in there for a reason - you don't cover either of the listed conditions instead of addressing all of them... Moreover, most AO's start reading your essay without even bothering about which prompt you've picked... So you should be fine with picking the first prompt as long as you largely answer the question.",
