              "text": "Apologies for the late reply! I asked because all emiratis (UAE residents) automatically get a full-ride to NYUAD once they\u2019re accepted. I\u2019m not quite sure how it works for international students tho. A quick google search told me they provide merit-based support, so i\u2019m assuming it\u2019s for a select few only.\n\nHowever, I was part of the NYUAD program over the summer, so I can ask my NYUAD professors if you\u2019d like!",
