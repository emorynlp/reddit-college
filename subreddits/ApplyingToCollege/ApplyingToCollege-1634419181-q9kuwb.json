  "text": "Hey I wanna be a CS major in college and I got a Microsoft Technological Associate for Intro To Java certification last year and I took a Programming class at a regional education center which should also count as dual enrollment.

      "text": "It will show that you are serious CS but will likely not be a significant pull in your favor since I don\u2019t know if they care about your current CS knowledge since the into classes have the assumption that everyone is new to programming.
