      "text": "Every university will have a student disability office. It's federally mandated. Contact your school's office after you're admitted and find out what documentation is required to start the accommodations process. If you have the appropriate documentation for ADHD, you'll receive accommodations that help reduce the barriers you experience. Some examples might be a distraction-reduced testing environment, extended test time, written feedback on progress, written notification of changes in assignments and deadlines, assistive note taking device, etc. Each individual's situation is different, so talk to your college. You can do this before classes start so your accommodation plan is in place on day 1.\n\nEdited to add: you can also receive reasonable accommodations for internships, co-ops, practicum, or other field experiences. Additionally, your school's counseling office likely has groups focused on time management, self-care, scheduling strategies, interpersonal communication, and other areas you might like to work on.",
