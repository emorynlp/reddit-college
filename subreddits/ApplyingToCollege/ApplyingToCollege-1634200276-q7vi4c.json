  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who didn\u2019t have time for extracurriculars panicking about not having enough to put in the activities section. My school is organizing its annual virtual MUN on the 22nd of October (right before the EA deadline lmao) and it\u2019s beginner-friendly, so if you\u2019re interested I can PM you the link:) Apologies if this isn\u2019t the right sub!",
