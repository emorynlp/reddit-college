  "title:": "Will I still make it into National Merit Finalist?",
  "text": " \n\nHi,. Will me dropping AP English lit in favor of P English stop me from being a finalist? I have a confirming SAT score of 1470 and good grades (3.9 UW, 4.771 W). Just worried that dropping the class in favor of an easier one will mess me up but it is taking up so much of my time and the teacher assigns so much work. It is difficult because I work a nearly full-time job outside of school and just don\u2019t have the time to do it.\n\nI am currently a semifinalist if that was not clear\n\nI guess what I am really asking is:\n\nDo the students who can\u2019t achieve confirming SAT scores along with those who do not fill out the application account for all or nearly all (98+%) of semifinalists who do not become finalists?",

      "text": "Dropping AP English shouldn\u2019t have any bearing on becoming a National Merit Finalist. I think the last question you asked is a separate thing and I would think that would be the reason, but I don\u2019t have any special knowledge on the subject. 98% seems too high of a percentage for them to actually be rejecting people besides those who literally don\u2019t meet the standard or fill out the application",
