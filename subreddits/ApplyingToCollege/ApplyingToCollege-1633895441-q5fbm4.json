  "text": "Most early action deadlines are November 1, so I was wondering if I sent my SAT score today will they make it to the schools I apply to in time? Another question, do I send AP scores to all the colleges I apply to, or the ones I get admitted to (which, obviously, is after the deadline)? \n\nAll advice is appreciated",

      "text": "First check each of your colleges' websites to see what SAT score reporting methods they accept. Many now accept scores self-reported in the app or portal, for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. Others may still require an official report prior to admission.\n\nIt can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks for colleges to receive your SAT score report. (It takes some time for College Board to put the scores in the college's account and then the college typically downloads batches of score reports waiting in its account on some regular schedule.)\n\nMost colleges accept AP scores self-reported in the app.",

Don't waste money on sending to schools that allow self reporting.\n\n>do I send AP scores to all the colleges I apply to, or the ones I get admitted to (which, obviously, is after the deadline)? \n\nNeither. Just the one you will be attending, with the exception of Georgetown which will require an official report if you want AO scores considered with the application.",

No reason to wait.\n\nAP scores can be self-reported, with an official report to the school you choose to attend next Summer.\n\nAs always, check individual schools for exceptions.
