  "text": "I feel like projectile vomiting right now. Brown asked for my updated grades and I have a B in English rn. I talked to my English teacher last week and he essentially told me that he would give me an A by the end of the semester (bc I\u2019ve been showing progress and my IB predicted is a 6). Ik that Brown asks for midterm grades but I thought that would be my semester grades. I realize know that by the time those come out decisions will already be sent out. Will this penalize me?",
