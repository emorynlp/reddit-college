  "title:": "Difference between \"internship\" and \"work (paid)\" in common app activities?",
  "text": "There are two categories \"internship\" and \"work (paid)\" in the common app. How do they differ? Some say that internship is more focused on gaining experiences. How will AOs consider them differently, or this is just a small detail that they usually don't pay attention to?\n\nMy situation: I work at a software company part-time, but not as an intern per se (in the contract they say that I'm a \"contractor\"). I did learn a lot through the job though. Not sure which category to put in.",
