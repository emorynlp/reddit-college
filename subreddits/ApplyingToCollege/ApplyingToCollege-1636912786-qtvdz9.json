  "text": "What I have right now is okay (I think), but after reading other posts about the additional information section, I need to change it for my RD reach schools.\n\nI have about 8 awards/recognitions that I couldn\u2019t fit in awards or squeeze into activities, so I have them in the add section. Apparently that\u2019s not good, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m not representing myself completely by deleting them? Even though AO might not see them as important, or they\u2019ll be things other applicants have. Idk man. Not sure what to do.",
