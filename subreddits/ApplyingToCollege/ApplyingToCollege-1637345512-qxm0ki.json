  "text": "This is something I keep seeing, and it\u2019s confusing and a little infuriating. So many of y\u2019all are like \u201cI must be miserable all throughout high school, and change myself into a person I\u2019m not, to convince my dream college that I\u2019m a great fit for their culture\u201d\u00a0\n\nLook, either you have what it takes to make it at a top school, or you don't. If you hate every aspect of the \"you\" that colleges want, why the hell do you think you'll like it there? Spoiler alert - you won\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like competitiveness, or thrive under academic pressure, it\u2019s not going to magically change in college.\n\nSO many of you have this really weird victim complex, that you insist on mixing in with humble-bragging. Some of you throw in a little, subtle racism into there, which is not a great look. There\u2019s also a LOT of classism/elitism, because you all seem to believe that only poor/lazy/stupid people\u2019t go to T20\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure what you all want, other than to be praised and told that you\u2019re a genius, but it\u2019s really getting insane. One of you is literally willing to \u201csettle\u201d for BERKLEY.\u00a0 Another one of y\u2019all thinks only T20 schools are worth attending because they\u2019re the only schools a degree matters from. Delusional.\u00a0\n\nY\u2019all need to get a fucking grip on yourselves, before you get to your \u201cdream\u201d college and realize you hate it, and that no one there wants to listen to your classist, elitist ass whine about how you hate it there too.\u00a0",

      "text": "I\u2019m guessing this is about that recent rant post by an op who deleted their account, where they were complaining about having to \u201cfake\u201d themselves on apps to colleges over a probable misconception about what those colleges are looking for. \n\nWhile I think this post is a little harsh, I literally put two hobbies that didn\u2019t amount to any awards or anything on my own apps so I agree with the general point here.",

I don't remember being delusional. I think that's the difference, for me",
