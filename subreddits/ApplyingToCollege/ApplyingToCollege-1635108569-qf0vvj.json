  "text": "Junior with a 1550 sat, 4.67 GPA, 3 seasons of a sport, volunteer tutoring for 2 different organizations, maybe a national merit semifinalist PSAT score, and active in a few other clubs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nby the looks of it though, I can only attend my state school which has a 70% acceptance rate because of the cost of other schools and how much cheaper the in state. It would basically like being forced to go to my safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are my options? Id estimate that I could cover about 25K a year, not poor enough to qualify for substantial financial aid, parents have to put other siblings through college too. Are there any schools that give full rides? Do I have any options out of this?",

      "text": "National merit finalist would open up a lot of big merit scholarships for sure. \n\nMaybe you wouldn't prefer them to your state school, but that's usually full tuition at Fordham, close to full tuition at Texas A&M, full tuition at ASU, and a complete full ride at schools like Alabama or UTD.\n\nYou can also shoot your shot at more selective schools that also have big merit scholarships - Duke, Case Western, etc.",
