  "text": "I just finished my IELTS speaking test and I swear I could have got a better examiner.\nI am generally told to be more soft spoken and was in for a shock today when the examiner kept on asking me and signalling me to speak louder.\nBecause of the constant confusion and my occasional 'sorry's and 'pardon me?'s, I totally lost the flow during the second part of the IELTS (speaking on a particular topic) and basically feel like I flunked it because I could hear myself repeating the same 2 sentences over and over again, for an entire minute. \nFor my other sections, she would ask me a question and I would answer them in full detail, only to be greeted with a 'why?'. Like, DID YOU EVEN HEAR ME BUDDY??\n\nI have my remaining IELTS exams the day after but I'm not sure whether or not me doing well in then even matters anymore since the examiner probably gave me no more than a 5. Although my gut feeling still says I should get a 7+ (hopefully someone else grades my exam since it was recorded), I'm still very scared about it because my gut also says that i flunked it. (The colleges Im applying require 6.5+ in every section)\n \nNow I'm just sad and confused since I messed up one out of the four sections and I'm not at all sure if doing decently in the other three make up for it.\n\n\nEdit: The IELTS is also an extremely costly test and I really don't think I want to put my parents in a position where they have to pay for it again and I don't want to go through the embarassment of a second attempt either T___T",
