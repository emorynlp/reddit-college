But I kinda want to stretch it to 800 because of an idea I've got and the writing. Would it mess up my application if I do so?",

Don't make it longer than you have to if there are places to cut down on fluff and repetitiveness. Just to be safe, I'd go into it thinking that the AO may only read the first 550 words, so make it a good essay that keeps them engaged! As long as it's not pages and pages of dull monologue (which is where I'm sure AOs would check out), I think you'll be fine, just keep it shorter if you can, and good luck!",
