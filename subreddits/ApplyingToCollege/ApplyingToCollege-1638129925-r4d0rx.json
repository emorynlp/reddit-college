  "text": "Hello! Any ideas or advice is super welcome. \n\nI\u2019m applying to Berklee College of Music - it will be my second degree so it\u2019s been a number of years since I graduated high school.\n\nHowever, it was an online school based in Florida called Crescent Preparatory - it has since closed but I need to get my high school transcripts for my application.\n\nAnyone have knowledge of how I should go about obtaining my transcripts?",
