  "title:": "Guys, in 2019 (right before covid), I won the overall National Championship in my sport but then covid happened and my junior, senior years barely have any achievements. In other words, my best achievements are all in/before 10th grade.",
  "text": "I did win 3 state medals in 2020-21 but didn\u2019t go for nationals because of covid. Is that alright? Or would the colleges think I\u2019m using covid as an excuse. I apologise if this is stupid but a lot of people told me not to mention too many 10th grade achievements and I\u2019m super scared now",
