      "text": "Seems like listing it is of marginal benefit.  It's completely unverifiable, did not result in any credit, credential or award, and, tbh, makes you look like kind of a weirdo.\n\nNow, if you made a mobile app or website that people are actually using, or if you contributed code to an open source project, etc. then that might be worth talking about.\n\n\"Self-study coding\" is on par with \"I read physics books in my free time\".  It's a hobby, and not one that necessarily reflects positively on you.\n\nI work in software.  Hardly anyone \"studies coding\" as a hobby.  They do it in order to acquire skills they need to get a job or because they want to build something and need to figure out how.   Learning how to code (or use a particular framework or library) is a means to an end, not an end unto itself.",
