  "text": "I got a 1440 (660 EBRW and 780 Math), but due to a large workload (Essays and Class Exams) I don't have time to prepare for a resit. I am sitting the TOEFL soon and I am achieving high scores in that so will that help? \n\n(I am going to major in MechE)",

I think that with a 1440 you will get in the places where they would have taken you with 1600. Otherwise, not even a perfect score could have helped you.",
