  "text": "hii, i\u2019m an int\u2019l who\u2019s applying to the us, and one of my family\u2019s biggest fears is gun violence. we\u2019ve heard of a ton of instances of on- and off-campus shootings, so we\u2019re kinda terrified, and it may end up being a deal breaker if i somehow get a spot at a college.\n\nare guns a big problem on/ around campuses? eg do supermarkets with literal gun aisles actually exist, and is there open-carrying? we hear about shootings in supermarkets and general public spaces, so the threat seems to be huge, but we aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s just a stereotype. ik it also depends on location, so if it helps, the places i\u2019m applying to are in the northeast, north carolina, and houston.\n\nthank you so much! v worried about the gun threat ahaha so i appreciate any insights!!",

      "text": ">one of my family\u2019s biggest fears is gun violence.\n\nNot a completely unfounded fear; it's way worse in the U.S. than it is in other wealthy nations.  That said, you're about as likely to die from a gunshot wound as you are to die in a car accident.  Also, roughly 60% of gun deaths are suicides.  Of the remaining 40%, many happen because the *victim* is criminally involved.  Gangs, drug traffic, etc.\n\n>we\u2019ve heard of a ton of instances of on- and off-campus shootings, so we\u2019re kinda terrified\n\nCampus shootings do happen.  Your odds of dying in a campus mass shooting are very, very low.\n\n>are guns a big problem on/ around campuses?\n\nReally depends on the campus.  If the campus is a high-crime area then your risk is elevated (though still low).  If the campus is in a low-crime area then your risk is less.\n\n>do supermarkets with literal gun aisles actually exist\n\nNo.  The closest thing might be sporting goods stores, but even there they'll have the guns under lock and key.\n\n>is there open-carrying?\n\nVery few places.  Even where open carry is legal it is still pretty common.\n\nViolent crime rates vary *wildly* from neighborhood to neighborhood even in the same city.  If you do the following your odds of dying to gun violence go way down:\n\n1. Don't shoot yourself.\n2. Don't be in a relationship with (or live with) someone who owns a gun.\n3. Don't get involved in the drug trade.\n4. Don't join a gang.",
