  "text": "HELP! I kind of procrastinated, but I've done well with all my essays up to now. I have one more supp to do for ND then I'm done w all my EA!!! However, I cannot figure out what the heck to write for the last ND essay. You can choose 3 prompts: What would you fight for?, What is unique about your name? or If you could give a lightning talk (3-minute talk about something that interest you) on any topic (academic or not) what would it be? I really am stuck and I need to finish this today. Help me, fellow applicants!",

      "text": "I say go with whatever you can write the most unique thing about. Like if your name is your Grandma\u2019s and that\u2019s it. Maybe not that essay. If you\u2019d fight for a movie being the best, that could be funny. What I\u2019ve found is that it\u2019s so much more important HOW you write than WHAT you write. They are looking to see your personality in the essay, so pick the prompt that fits your humor, mindset, style of language the most. Hope this helps:)",
