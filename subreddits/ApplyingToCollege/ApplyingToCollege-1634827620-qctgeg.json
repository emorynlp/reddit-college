(Low for top schools.)\n\nThe dirty little secret about \u201ctest optional\u201d is that the top schools don\u2018t really need your test scores.  They know the strengths/weaknesses of your high school and whether your GPA, class rank, and EC\u2019s are at the level they want.  I mean, you know that these schools used decades of admissions data to model what their previous decisions would have been in a \u201ctest optional\u201d situation before they committed the policy. Esentially they KNEW they didn\u2019t need our scores before they gave us the \u201coption\u201d to not submit them.\n\nUltimately, I believe, that anyone thinking \u201cwith test-optional I\u2019ve got a shot I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise\u201c is fooling themselves.",
