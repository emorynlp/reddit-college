  "text": "9So I applied and finished my application(using the college's website) to a college at 9/29/21. And I requested my transcript using Naviance about a day later in which it was sent on 10/6/21. Weeks later, I see the college stating they haven't received my transcript. I literally contact their undergrad admission team to figure out the problem and it's still not received. I'm just worried because in order to qualify to the honor's program and other scholarships, I would need to turn everything by 11/1/21. I need help.",
