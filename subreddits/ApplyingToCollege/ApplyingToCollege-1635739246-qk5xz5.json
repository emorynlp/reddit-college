  "title:": "How do I know if my recommenders completed their letter of recommendation on CommonApp?",
  "text": "I asked my counselor, 2 teachers, and lab mentor to write me a letter of recommendation. I'm lookin on the Recommenders & FERPA tab, and my counselor's section is the only one that has a \"Submitted: \\[date\\]\" to the right of their name. All of my recommenders (including my counselor)  say \"Not Started\" on Counselor Recommendation (under counselor section), Teacher Evaluation (under my 2 teacher's sections), and Recommendation (under my lab mentor's section. What's does the \"Not Started\" mean, and what does the \"Submitted: \\[date\\]\" mean? My lab mentor sent me a copy of the letter of recommendation before he was going to send it, so I assumed it was going to be submitted. One of my teacher's said he would have it completed by a specific date, but it also isn't done (they are somewhat laid-back though). The CommonApp website was also being really buggy to me two weeks ago, so I don't know if it's that or my recommenders didn't finish it yet. Sorry for the wordiness and thank you for the help!",
