  "title:": "Can't do more than one sustaining class properly: Advice and Help",
  "text": "As someone gunning for t15 from the bay area, I am under pressure to get straight A's. However, AP Bio and Spanish 3 are both sustaining classes - they require work every day. AP Calc and APUSH can be done last minute, a) because calc = fine if you study for a week, and do nothing else and b) APUSH is really easy. However, Spanish 3 difficulty = AP Spanish, and I have to put in the time like everyone else. Furthermore, it is a CP Class which is ever so demotivating to put in >1 hour of work in per week, considering that I have 5 AP Classes. My other two AP classes (AP Psych/APES) take up my weekend, since they are done through UC Scout. Since they have no deadlines they are pretty easy. It becomes even harder in the face of a hard AP science like Bio, where the teacher expects long hours of work everyday to get an A.\n\nBy the way I have an F in art and C in CP English 3, which will both be fixed if I catch up. I have A's in all my APs\n\nTLDR; cannot manage both AP Bio and Spanish 3 at the same time - good chance I will get a B in one or the other. Does a B in spanish really make a difference as a environment major. Would an A in AP bio and  a B in spanish look better or worse than a B in AP bio and an A in spanish?",
