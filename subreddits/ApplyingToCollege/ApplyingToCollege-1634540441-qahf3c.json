  "text": "Basically I signed up for an info session and no one showed up. I emailed them asking if there were any in the future and they said I could meet one on one with them and ask questions. I\u2019m really nervous and excited because this could work in my favor maybe? It could also be horribly awkward and I ruin my chances of getting into the university. I made a list of questions to ask. Any recommendations?",
