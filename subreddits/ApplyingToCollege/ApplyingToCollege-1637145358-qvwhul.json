  "text": "Hi Reddit. Thanks for checking out the post and I hope whoever reading this is having a great day!\n\nI am an international student from Japan and planning to apply to US colleges & universities as an undergraduate. Financial aid is crucial for me. There isn't much financial aid offered in my home country, and even if there is they are super competitive. So I need financial aid from US universities. I heard except for the MIT, Harvard, and Yale research schools barely give aid to international students, whereas in contrast, liberal arts colleges tend to be more generous. Out of the liberal arts colleges, which ones tend to be more open to giving aid (even not fully, just part is okay too) to international students? Thanks in advance.",

I don't know about the others(I imagine they are similar) but Swarthmore(a T5 LAC) had a 0.2%(5 out of 2200) rate for internationals requesting aid in RD this past app season.",
