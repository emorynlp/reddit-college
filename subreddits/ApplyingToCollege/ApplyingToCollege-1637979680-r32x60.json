              "text": "Did you get high school credit?  If so, here is information from the College Board. If not, looks like you just send a copy of your college transcript to the colleges you are applying to.  \n\nHow do I report a college course I took during high school in Courses & Grades?\n\nWhen high school students simultaneously take college courses through a college or university, this is known as dual enrollment. For Courses & Grades, only courses receiving high school credit (i.e. appearing on your high school transcript) should be reported in this section. If you are not receiving high school credit for the course, you do not need to report this course in Courses & Grades.\n\nIf you are receiving high school credit for a college course, here's what you need to do:\n\n\u2022 Select the grade level that corresponds to the academic year in which you took the course (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, or Other)\n\n\u2022 For the School Name, select the high school that awarded the credit for the college course\n\n\u2022 For the Course Level, select 'Dual Enrollment'\n\n\u2022 Complete the remaining parts of Courses & Grades\n\nYou must still send official transcripts from your high school(s) and any college(s) you attended.",
