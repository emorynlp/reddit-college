  "text": "I know a 1270 is pretty decent, but idk if it's quite up to par with where I'm at overall. Considering where my GPA is at, I'm just curious if that score would hinder me at all, whether it be in admission, scholarships (especially), or anything else.",

      "text": "If you are applying to a test-optional school, the rule of thumb would be to not report a score below a certain threshold. Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th. Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/.",
