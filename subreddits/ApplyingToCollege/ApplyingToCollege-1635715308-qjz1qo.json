  "text": "hi! so i've been finalizing the last details of my ea applications, and for one school, there was one supplement where you must respond to option a or b. i've written and completed a few drafts for both prompts and like both essays. \n\nQ. 1   \nsay, if i respond to option a in my official supplement, and respond to option b in the additional information section of my common app, would this be a good idea? both essays are meaningful to me, but if you have any advice on how to choose between them please share.  \nQ. 2  \nif i were to go through with the submission described above, can i edit my additional information section before submitting it to other schools? or is my commonapp locked after my first submission?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry if this is confusing!",
