In real life, would you really quantify someone's people skills based on academic numbers? Would you say out loud: \"Wow, a 4.0 GPA? Do you ever get out of the house?\" \n\nSecond, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores). Yet, they're both going to be evaluated, and people shouldn't be discredited for having a strong GPA or strong test score.\n\nI really hope this didn't hurt/offend anyone. I'm truly grateful this subreddit exists and have gotten great advice from you guys.",
