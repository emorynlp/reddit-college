  "text": "On Carnegie Mellon's website, they say\n\n> If you're applying as a first-year student, we require two letters of recommendation: one from a high school counselor and one from a teacher. While we\u2019ll accept a third recommendation from a teacher or other recommender, we require our committees to consider only two recommendations in the decision-making process.\n\nWhat exactly does the last sentence mean? If I decide to submit three LORs, will they randomly select two? Or will they just use the two best ones?\n\nMy bad if this is a stupid question lol",

The members have a limited amount of time for each candidate during these meetings...and it' can be very difficult on time, energy, emotion, and hearts! Can read 2 (any two) or 3.",
