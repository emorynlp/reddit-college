  "text": "i plan on applying to ivy leagues and t20s - and even though it makes sense to take 6/7 APs, my school neither offers courses, nor exams. i\u2019m from India. \ni want to have an edge in college applications + wanted to know if there\u2019s any such uni who accept credit for 2/3 APs\nand I know i should read each college\u2019s credit policy, but since i might not have the full list of colleges I\u2019m applying to - it\u2019d be good to know the general ones. as in how many APs, how do we get credit, etc.",

Providing AP scores where no course exists will not improve admissions chances.\n\nAs far as actual AP credit, that varies by university and can be found via Google.",
