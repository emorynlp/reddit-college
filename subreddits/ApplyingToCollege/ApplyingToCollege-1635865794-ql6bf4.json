  "text": "I'm 99% sure I'll be continuing that EC for the rest of the year, so do I put like 30 weeks, or should I put 12 weeks since only 12 weeks have passed since the start of my senior year?\n\nAlso would the AOs question me if I put in 30 weeks/yr for an activity I started in senior year? cuz 30 weeks didn't even pass since the start of my senior year",
