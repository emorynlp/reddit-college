  "text": "I had my interview for Penn today. I'm not sure how it really went, because my interview asked no formal questions. We discussed my interests briefly, but then it was basically him just talking about Penn (mostly the academic culture, traditions, etc.), with me making a comment here or there. So, I had few chances to talk about why I wanted to attend Penn or even elaborate on my interests. I'm not even sure how he will be able to write a report me tbh\n\nThe vibe was good tho, so thats a plus ig..",

      "text": "Sometimes you get a talker and sometimes you get a listener. I don't think this will hurt you as long as you answered the questions appropriately, but make sure you assert yourself if this happens in the future. The interview is primarily about YOU, so make sure you get the chance to show him/her your best self. I know this can get super awkward, but I recommend trying to turn the discussion towards you with something like \"oh, penn has great research facilities? here's a problem that i'm interested in exploring and how I plan to take advantage of those resources.\"",
