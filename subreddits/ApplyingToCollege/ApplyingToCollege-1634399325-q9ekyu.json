  "text": "On the Common App, it says my counselor still hasn't started filling out either of those forms. Should I remind them to do this, or is my counselor notified when I've submitted applications? \n\nIt's almost two weeks until the deadline, and I just want to make sure my counselor didn't forget this has to be done. I added them to the Common App back in September. Or maybe I'm overstressing?",

I sent another email yesterday regarding transcripts, so I'll just make sure to ask about the school report section on the Common App once I get a response. Better safe than sorry!",
