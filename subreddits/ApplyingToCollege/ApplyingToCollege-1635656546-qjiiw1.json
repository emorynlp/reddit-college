  "text": "My dream school is UC Berkeley and obviously they went test blind recently. Even though you can\u2019t submit SAT scores, I could study to meet the NMS semifinalist criteria (which is plausible based on my current score) and put that in the awards/activitys section of the application. I know this is probably excessive but I would like to know everyone's opinions on weather or not this would improve my chances.",

              "text": "So to answer your question, I would still study for the PSAT to get Semifinalists status. I highly doubt a test blind school like Berkeley will care since the award is directly related to a test score. But you wouldn't do it for Berkeley, there are plenty of schools that give awesome scholarships for that designation, and others who dont still look at being a Semifinalist favorably.",
