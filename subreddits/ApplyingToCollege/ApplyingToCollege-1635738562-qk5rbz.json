      "text": "Most CSUs use a system similar to this to admit students: https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/freshmen-impaction-results/index.php\n\nIn previous years the application  had a few questions about extra classes and work/leadership that were only used by Cal Poly, which has a more complex scoring system. They are very basic like hours per week of work or volunteering, participation in AVID. The people on college confidential thought they had it figured out but with SAT score no longer used I\u2019m not sure they know either.",
