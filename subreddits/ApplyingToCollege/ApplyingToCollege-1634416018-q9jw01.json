  "text": "I assume for the most part that if I plan on applying EA then all letters from recommenders need to be submitted by/before Nov 1st? And if I have a letter from someone who isn\u2019t a teacher should I ask them to send it to all my schools or only to schools who take \u201cother\u201d recommenders? \n\nSorry I think I know the answers, but I\u2019m so stressed and just want some reassurance on everything at this point",
