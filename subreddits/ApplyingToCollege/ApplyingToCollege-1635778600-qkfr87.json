  "text": "I submitted my application supplement yesterday (late, i know) so I could be considered under early action. \n\nThe app website shows green check marks next to all my material status. I just wanted to know if they usually send an email saying they\u2019ve received everything and will consider me under EA or do they just not do that??",
