      "text": "It can be something interesting if you tie it into an essay well. You could do something impactful with being multilingual EC-wise that would make it important. But from the general consensus I\u2019ve seen here (because this gets asked fairly frequently), being multilingual alone, while interesting, won\u2019t raise chances of admissions. Full English proficiency is also an expectation, not a plus.",

              "text": "Translating work (adding YouTube subtitles for independent channels, translating webtoons, etc), teaching local younger students another language (something you could potentially expand), perhaps finding a local job where proficiency in Hindi/English/Bengali would be particularly desirable (as a tutor? working part-time at a shop? I\u2019m admittedly not sure how viable that is in India), etc. I believe there are also some language-related competitions out there. \n\nWhile being multilingual alone isn\u2019t a boost in college admissions, it is useful for future job prospects in the long run, particularly in certain fields like IR. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in, learning Spanish or mandarin would be helpful as well, and you could possibly connect your interest in various languages and cultures to a desire to be involved in international relations (just an example).",
