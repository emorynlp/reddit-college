      "text": "Finance, as a major/concentration, would be found within an undergrad business program. These schools have economics but not all have an undergrad business program. So, think about whether you want to study within an actual undergrad business program or whether econ will do for you.\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply anywhere, especially before applying ED. Compare the NPC estimates from all the schools on your list.\n\nNot all the Ivies have ED (some have restrictive early action).",
