          "text": "I definitely disagree. Supplements and the Personal Statement are much more important than ECs and Test Scores. That's why you see people with not-so-good ECs and test scores but amazing essays get in. But I've personally never seen anyone with bad essays get in. Also, ECs are meaningless if you don't reflect on them and connect them to your essays in one way or another. Your essays bring you and your ECs to life. Many AOs have commented on how ECs and grades rarely come up in committees and how they mainly talk about your story/experiences/personality.",
