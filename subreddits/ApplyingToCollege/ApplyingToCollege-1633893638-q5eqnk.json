  "text": "I know a few schools require official reports for SAT scores, but I just want to clarify for AP scores since I haven't seen much about it.\n\nSo I could just self-report the AP scores, like indicating it on the common app tab (the same way as for SAT scores, for the schools that allow self-reporting for both)?\n\nThank you!",
