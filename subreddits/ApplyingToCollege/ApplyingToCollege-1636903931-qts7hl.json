  "text": "Some schools give you the option of submitting supplementary materials if you have an \"extraordinary\" talent in something, and I'm not sure what to submit. As far as my application goes, I'm interested in 5 things: politics, computer science, math, music, and art. I'm planning on being a CS major.\n\nFor things like politics, CS, and math, schools ask for academic papers and/or research abstracts. I have neither :(\n\nAs far as music goes, I briefly mentioned how COVID gave me the opportunity to learn about music in the Common App COVID essay. Depending on the specific supplemental essays of the school, I might also write about it in more detail there. So if I do that, will sending them one of my piano pieces be worth it? On one hand, it could substantiate what I tell them, but it could also just repeat information that they already know or even worsen their view of me because the music isn't up to par (in their opinion).\n\nBut art was something I mentioned very briefly and am unlikely to write about in detail in the supplementals. I've also drawn art that helped me win an international competition, so I think sending them samples of it could give me a boost because it shows another side of me that's also fairly skilled. But it's also completely unrelated to my intended major, and it might seem odd that I can substantiate my skill in art but not in CS, which IS my major.\n\nSo maybe to prevent the lack of CS material sticking out like a sore thumb, it's better to send nothing at all? What do you guys think?",
