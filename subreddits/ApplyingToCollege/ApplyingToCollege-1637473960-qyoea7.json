  "text": "Are transfer applicants supposed to be putting hs activities on apps? I see such a mix of chance me\u2019s and descriptions on here and it just feels weird to count things from hs. Example: if I won tons of awards and did a lot of band activities in hs and still pursue music in college, do I add those? Especially if I\u2019m submitting a supplement? What is considered relevant or are all hs AND college activities relevant?",
