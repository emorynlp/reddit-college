  "title:": "Deciding between prestige and employability",
  "text": "I've always wanted to attend a high ranking Top 20 US university, but I recently had a chat where I discovered that if I attend uni in the country where I hold residency, then I have a near 99% chance of immediately being employed after graduating. \n\nMy grades are solid, my co-curriculars are great, and my English ability is noted (by my school) to be well above average. I do believe I can be admitted into a prestigious US uni (maybe not ivy league, but still up there), but I had a serious look at the more important part of life after high school: jobs.\n\nIf I attend uni in my other country then my tuition will be fairly affordable, I can graduate sooner (3 year bachelor program), and a company I want to work for will sponsor me for internships throughout the uni journey. I am assured to have a job within the year I graduate. The school is well regarded still, and plenty \"prestigious\" enough for my overachieving self, but I cant help but feel as though I'm throwing away *something.*\n\nBut despite the feeling of loss, I've ultimately decided to stop aiming for the ivy leagues. I need to be a mature adult about my future life. I can't afford places like Yale or Cornell. I need a job right after uni to pay the bills and support my family (they're doing okay, but I want to provide more for them). I calculated the tuition fees and the school I'm looking at is about 9000 USD (I converted thru google) per year, and I'm eligible for many scholarships. \n\nI've chosen employability over prestige, and I've been feeling really weird about it all day. But perhaps this is for the better. I need to think about my future holistically, not just in a way that I can \"brag\" about. \n\n\n(...admission mods, have I made the right choice?)",

      "text": "If you want to live and work in the U.S. then attending a U.S. university could be useful. Or, possibly, if you want to live/work in a country where a degree from one of these schools would be more \"recognized\" than a degree from the school in your home country.  If your plan is to live/work in your home country, then not spending a bunch of extra $ to attend uni in the U.S. seems prudent.\n\nThat said, if you could get into one of the (few) schools that give financial aid to internationals, and if your financial situation is such that you would receive a lot of aid, then the cost difference might not be as large as you think.  Then again, it's exceedingly difficult to get into one of that small set of schools as an international student with financial need.",

Can put on your resume you were accepted and that is prestigious in and of itself.   \n\n\nMaybe they will give you some merit aid. Maybe you can get a job in your home country with an ivy league education (more than likely).  \n\n\nAlso pretty assumptious you'd get accepted. Maybe you'd write an unflattering essay with that kind of unawareness of tone.",

      "text": "When I was 18, a guy I met who had gone to Yale and was getting his PhD at Cambridge gave me the best advice about college:\n\n\"The 3 most prestigious colleges in America are Harvard, Yale, and the University of whatever state you're in.\" It's oversimplified, of course, but there's a lot of truth in it. The people scouring the US News rankings are 18-year-olds, maybe their parents, and admissions workers. Everyone else just knows about a handful of very prestigious schools and the flagship state school where most of the brightest students in the state go.\n\nThe same thing works internationally. In America and abroad, very few people are going to have any thoughts on whether UPenn is \"better\" than Tubingen or University of Melbourne or Yonsei.  \nIf a good school where you have residency is cheaper and offers better prospects, it makes little sense to study in the US.",

I'd much rather hire someone from Whatever State University who got a year of Co-op and worked part time than someone who just walked out of Harvard and hasn't seen the light of day in 4 years.\n\nAnd if prestige = heaps of debt, then you're just going to be a slave to your employer for the next couple of decades. Don't get into massive debt to go to college, with few exceptions. \n\n>I need to think about my future holistically\n\nThis is 100% the right answer. It's not the sexy answer. It's not the answer that makes people go \"wooooow you got into x?!\" but honestly, who cares? It's your life. You can impress people later if that's what you really want.",
