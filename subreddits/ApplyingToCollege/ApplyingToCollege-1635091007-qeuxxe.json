  "text": "My schools provide me with the option to submit a resume, but I'm not sure if I should include one since my activities section is comprehensive. I could list a few extra details about my ECs that didn't fit into the 150 character descriptions, two personal projects that I didn't mention in my activities section, and/or the online courses I've taken. Would these be appropriate reasons for submitting a resume? Do you know any examples of a resume boosting an applicant's profile?",
