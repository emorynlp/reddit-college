It just feels so rushed this year, like even though we\u2019ve been learning all year we\u2019re not prepared.\n\nObviously I\u2019m trying to prepare, but especially having taken AP Lit first semester, I just have no idea how I\u2019m gonna do. Hopefully I\u2019ll get an easy question :(",

              "text": "Idk how far you got into the class but these are my tips. Keep in mind that the AP course changed this year and I don't know what they cut (I think they cut everything before 1450 such is just sad (\n\nStudy the the industrial revolution time period, communism, and exchanges like the Columbian exchange. When I took the test, I got no questions that have to do with stuff like WW1/WW2 (although that might change now). Also be prepared to answer a question about continuity and change over time.\n\nBefore you start your dbq, read/analyze all of your documents and question and then categorize your documents into three sections (one for each paragraph). Categorize them in a way where each section has documents that will support what that paragraph is talking about. This is super important and a time saver. I ended up with 10 spare mins because I planned what I was going to say before I started writing. Adding your own historical knowledge into your dbq instead of just documents will earn you a point. I recommend that you add your own historical knowledge when you are doing an analysis of a document. \n\nMake sure that you answer the question. Ik it sounds obvious but sometimes people forget and that loses them a point.\n\nThe college board doesn't just want to know if you know historical facts, they want to know if you understand how historical events influenced things (like France taking over some countries in Africa resulted in those countries speaking French to this day). Showing that you can do this earns you a point (my teacher called it the unicorn point lmao).\n\nGood luck on the test!",

As for the technology issue, I highly recommend trying the test demo at cb.org/demo, which shows you exactly what the software looks like. In terms of actually writing the rhetorical analysis essay, just focus on using the same skills you\u2019d use for an IB commentary (analyzing language, syntax, organization, etc.) and try to apply them instead to a nonfiction passage in which you are given the rhetorical situation.",

Also from my schools admin is telling us that most likely everyone will pass, I maybe even heard that scoring is only from 3s to 5s. Best of luck to you, I take my first test this tues and then the 22nd :)",
