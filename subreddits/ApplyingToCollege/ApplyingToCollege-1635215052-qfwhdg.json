  "text": "I almost miss it. Truly.\n\nThe stress of the application, the crippling depression of senior year, all mixed with the lingering horror that you won't get in anywhere.\n\nTrust me, I've been there before, which is why I'm going to give a few pieces of advice from a college freshman.\n\n(Remember, I'm a college freshman. I literally don't know what I'm doing so take my advice with grain of salt.)\n\n1. **Don't stress about the little things**. By that, I mean, don't stress about the little mistakes you might make on your application. Accidentally spelled something wrong? Oh well. Didn't capitalize something? Oops. Made your whole entire personal statement bold? Haha. Admissions counselors won't notice unless your essays has major grammatical errors and run on sentences.\n2. Don't compare yourself to others. Ok this one is extremely hard because sometimes I still come on to this site, read the chance me's, and cry myself to sleep because I will never be as successful as some of you out there, but hear me out. Every single one of you is unique. You all have your own story, your own experiences, and your own talents. Who knows, maybe *you're* what the college needs, so **don't compare yourself to others**.\n3. Also don't be too full of yourself. Love your safeties. Stay updated, attend visits, **find schools that you actually see yourself attending** because those top schools? Sorry to say, but you're not guaranteed in.\n4. Have a good work life balance. Don't spend your nights crying over college applications. It's not worth it and takes a big toll on your mental health. Go out with your friends; you're leaving them soon. Spend time with your family; they won't see you for a long time. **Enjoy high school while it lasts**.\n5. **Stay on top of your high school workload**. Please don't neglect your work to watch college admissions videos and imagine that that would be you in the spring. While we're on that topic, college admissions videos are not representative of the majority. Remember that.\n6. Stop checking college confidential and A2C when it's December or March/April. You're gonna want to cry and we don't want that.\n7. It doesn't end after your acceptance letter. College is hard.\n8. **Apply for scholarships**. Enough said.\n\nBest of luck to everyone, I hope you all end up some place you're happy at. I have to go back to studying for midterms now (help, I'm actually dying).\n\n**Edit:** Don't stress too much about AP scores and subject tests. Literally did not submit a single one. By all means, still take them and try to do well, but if you don't it's not the end of the world.",

      "text": "Maybe it's cliche, but boy did I need to see this today. I'm totally stressed out about applications 'cause I'm stuck comparing myself to everyone else and worrying that I didn't do enough community service, or got fewer awards in HS, or so on - the only things I've got are good grades and the few things I do well, and have been worrying it's not enough to get noticed. Plus my high school experience hasn't been too hot social/emotionally, so I'm looking forward to moving on in college but still anxious all the same. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus, I just found this sub today - I'm usually a lurker but I think I'll be spending some nice time here :)",

Like saying \"If I go to Harvard i'll definitely have a good life, idc if theres a, b or c, that I don't like, its ranked #1 so i'm sure i'll like it\". Not to say Harvard isn't a good school, but I mean people don't always look for a college that would fit them, regardless or ranks or statistics. Who knows, you might enjoy your 90% acceptance rate safety more than your 15% acceptance rate reach, and end up at the same job regardless.",
