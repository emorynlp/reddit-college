      "text": "Before I began my essay, I started writing down ANY idea I had in the Notes app, no matter how cringey or dumb lol. I eventually ended up with a good few that I liked, and picked the one that resonated with me the most! It really helped to go through all the crap in my brain then I reached the \u201cgems\u201d. \n\nSomething else that really helped me was not looking at the prompts\u2026 like at all when choosing my topics. It was easier to find a topic that was important to me and described who I was . Then after I finished my first draft, I edited and trimmed the essay to make it fit a topic. Since they\u2019re so general it wasn\u2019t that hard. So maybe try writing something without using the prompt? \n\nThere are also a good amount of helpful posts in here, if I find the links I\u2019ll add them.\n\nEverything will be fine, believe me! Essay topics usually don\u2019t just appear in people\u2019s heads instantly . They often go through a lot of drafts and silly ideas before they get to their perfect topic. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find one soon! Good luck :)",
