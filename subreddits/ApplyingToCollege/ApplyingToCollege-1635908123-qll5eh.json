  "text": "How will it look to be 3 years advanced in math (starting with precalc freshman year and taking multivariable calculus senior year) if I get mostly B\u2019s? GPA is going to be between 3.84 and 3.9 overall. I had an A freshman year, had more trouble with online school last year and honestly kind of slacked off, and am struggling a bit in calculus BC this year since I don\u2019t have a good foundation from AB. I\u2019m going into stem (biology/premed) and am worried this won\u2019t look too good. I\u2019m kind of regretting advancing this much and probably should have been 2 or so years ahead instead.\n\nGuess I\u2019d just like some advice from you all and maybe some encouragement to work my butt off and get an A in math this year lol.",

A strong foundation in AB seems to be the most important thing so I would suggest brushing up on the areas that were difficult while you\u2019re still in the review portion of BC Calc.",
