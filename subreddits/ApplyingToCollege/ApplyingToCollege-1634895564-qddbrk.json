  "text": " \n\nCan I elaborate my ecas in my additional information section? I've seen an indian youtuber Shaurya Sinha to do so.\n\nI have listed my ecas pretty well and I have requested my teachers to explain about few of them more. But I definitely have more things to add because my activities section didn't cover them properly. and they are pretty important to me as well. A gist of them-\n\n\\-Reserved member of an international youth exchange program\n\n\\-A project where I am a 'listener' member. I regularly talk with one person about things that are on their mind and just listen to them\n\n\\-One of four positions in my school regarding a sports day program\n\nPlease help",
