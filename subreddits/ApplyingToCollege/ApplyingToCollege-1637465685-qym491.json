  "text": "I applied to my dream school and a few of my friends applied a few days after me. They applied for the same majors as me. I have the same or better grades than them (3.9 GPA and 29 ACT). They have all gotten acceptance letters at this point. Should I be worried that I haven\u2019t seen any sort of response from the college yet? Does this mean that I am less likely to get in? Answers are greatly appreciated as this is causing a lot of anxiety for me.\n\nSchool: University of Minnesota Twin Cities\n\nI applied via Early Action and it seems as though most people receive an answer within 1-2 weeks but I have been waiting for well over 2 months almost 3 months.\n\nAre there any steps I should take? Like calling or emailing them or anything?\n\nThanks all!",
