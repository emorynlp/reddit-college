I saw a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/afgev1/the_average_rapplyingtocollege_student_the/) of /r/ApplyingToCollege students and the average ACT score here was like a 33 lmfao.\n\nHere's a [link](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-college-admissions-scandal-northwestern-guilty-plea-20191022-wop5xa7udzhb7ouwrzeotrvyq4-story.html) to the story if you wanna read about it.",

      "text": ">just to get a 30\n\nDon't laugh at a score of 30.  \n\nIt is well above the national average and I think you'd have to search far and wide to find a college who doesn't agree that a 30 suggests a student is ready for success in college.\n\nIt may not get you into a highly selective college where they are picking and choosing from among stellar applicants, but there is nothing laughable about a 30 on the ACT.  \n\nYou can snicker over whether a score of 30 is worth $400k.  That said, if I were scheming about how to get a student that tests terribly into a more selective college, I would have to consider whether that student had other test scores that were marginal.  If so, achieving a 34, 35, or 36 would look pretty suspicious.",
