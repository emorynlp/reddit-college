  "text": "I\u2019m currently a community college student and I\u2019ve applied for the MassTransfer program, but I can\u2019t decide which school to attend. I\u2019ve gotten accepted to both, and I even got accepted to the Honors College at UML, but I honestly can\u2019t make a decision. Is there anyone that could point out some pros and cons of each school, anything would be greatly appreciated",
