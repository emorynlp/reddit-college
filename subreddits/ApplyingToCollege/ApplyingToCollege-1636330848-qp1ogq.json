  "text": "I applied to NJCU who has rolling admissions about 3 weeks ago via common app. Common app said that the University downloaded my application and 2 weeks ago I got an email from the school with My pin number and ID and such to access my finical aid and Application status on there website. My application status said \"no active applications\" So I emailed the admissions office regarding this and after asking a few verification questions, they said 3 days ago \"Your application is complete and under review by the Admissions Committee. Decision letters will be mailed within the next 2 weeks.\" But the website still says \"No active application\". So should I just wait it out or like what should I do?",
