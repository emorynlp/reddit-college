  "text": "every school seems to want leaders and idk about ya'll but I think it's pretty weird. I mean not every student can be a leader, leaders need followers don't they? Also, being a \"follower\" isn't a bad thing imo so idk why everyone seems to hate it so much. idk just some dumb rambling.\n\nps. pls don't mind my english. english isn't my first language and I rlly can't be bothered to try rn",

      "text": "There are plenty of schools that aren't specifically looking for leaders.  My middle kid and I sat through a U Chicago presentation where they said exactly what you did - leaders need someone to lead and good class has a balance between them.  What they're looking for is students who are active, involved and passionate.  Some of them will be leaders, many won't, but they'll all be engaged in their community. From what I heard at other admissions presentations and tours in the years since then, that's what a lot of the highly competitive admissions schools are looking for.",

      "text": "I agree with you about a strange fixation on leadership, but also I want you to look at leadership a little differently.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you know or follow Mark Manson, but he posted this recently on social media and I was struck by it: \u201cLeadership is doing the shit nobody else wanted to do in a way nobody else thought possible.\u201d\n\nSo, you see, leadership is about way more than being Captain High School or President Every Club.\n\nThink about all the different kinds of leadership there are. You don\u2019t have to be a specific leader at your school like a president or captain or prefect.\n\nAre you a leader in your own life? Do you make decisions for yourself?\n\nAre you a leader in your family? Older sibling? Care for grandparents? Oldest cousin who everyone goes to for advice?\n\nAre you a leader among your friend groups? Do you make plans? Are you the \u201cparent\u201d of the group? Do you control the social calendar?\n\nAre you a leader in the classroom? Do you like to be the coordinator and organizer for group projects? Do you lead class discussions? Do teachers rely on you to be an active participant?\n\nAre you a leader in your school? Do you hold leadership roles? Or do you organize without needing some kind of title. Do you help underclassmen? Do you encourage others?\n\nAre you a leader in your community? Do you help in your religious community? Do you volunteer as a tutor? Do you organize drives for causes?\n\nAnd finally, do you have a job? A job demonstrates leadership and willingness to learn and work with others and to contribute to your own financial stability or that of your family\u2019s.",

And colleges need a LOT of good leaders to maintain a vibrant community. Every club, sport, and event, big or small, needs a leader. The more good leaders you have, the better the student life is, feeding into the self-fulfilling cycle of admissions and money.",

      "text": "Well, that's because there are nearly 4,000 universities in America - there has to be some sort of positive character trait that denotes your potential as a graduate of their institution. Being a 'follower' sort of says you're going to end up becoming an average member of society, and it really sets a trend for the university being mediocre. Places at the top of the university list (as I'm sure you're looking at) don't want average people. They want dedicated people that hold the potential to be great, and that's a trait, while not reserved for leaders, is something that is encompassed easily by the word leader. \n\nAfter all, you can't be listing specific character traits you want on your university's website, or that'd be too easy and way too inauthentic after they realize they read the five-hundredth essay tailored to their preferences.",
