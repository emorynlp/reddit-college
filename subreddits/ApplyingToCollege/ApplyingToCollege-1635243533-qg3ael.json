  "text": "whenever i check LinkedIn, i like to look up incoming freshmen to different universities (mostly t20s) and i keep thinking that i am just not good enough for such colleges. it just stresses me out sm because im applying exactly where they got in and im no match for them. \n\nsame goes with these college decision reaction videos. i mean, stanford has always been my dream school and im applying there but when i see students with a 1590 + excellent gpa + amazing extracurriculars  getting rejected, it makes me wonder about why im doing this. i mean, i wont say that im too low on grades etc but these things make me feel sad about myself. idk what to do :(",

      "text": "Don\u2019t fret none. In all honesty, your personality means so much to colleges. Who you are, what you believe in, the way you think. That\u2019s most important (it really is they have personality  scores for applicants), so at the end of the day, you have to show your best self on the application and (cheesy I know) BE YOURSELF. If you have a unique passion, show it! If you do something no one else does, boom show it!",

      "text": "This is hard advice to follow, but:  don't compare yourself to other people in this way.  \n\nYou know who makes LinkedIn profiles?  People with lots to put on a linked-in profile.  You notice them because they stand out. It's not as if most people are like them, and you're uniquely worse. It's that most applicants are like you--people with a loaded-up LinkedIn profile are the exception.  That's why they stand out!  \n\nThese high-achieving persons may get into some good colleges, but they don't get ALL the spots--they can only enroll in one freshman class.",
