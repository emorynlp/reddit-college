  "title:": "As an upper-middle-class child, what exactly should my goals be in life?",
  "text": "My dad is always telling me how I need to establish a better lifestyle than our family has right now. I tell him about my dreams in journalism, in sports commentary, but he shuts it down, saying that I need to make money before I dive into passions. As an immigrant parent, he expects me to build on his sacrifices and fulfill his view of the American dream.\n\nI'm glad my dad cares, but at the same time, between him and my mom, my family makes at least $300,000+ a year. We have a three-story house with 5 bedrooms and six bathrooms. We have two other real estate properties and three decent cars at our disposal. There's never been a moment in my life when I've wished for more, and truly, I've never had to. I've never felt the need to grow up and gain even more luxury, because I've already grown up with every material belonging that I could've realistically asked for. I tried to tell my dad that it's fine if I don't reach the summits he expects for me, but again, he shut me down before I could even finish. I tried to tell him that money is not my objective in life because I've already experienced so much of it, but the words never came out.\n\nBecause of that conversation, and perhaps because the stress of college apps and my extracurriculars has my mind running in overdrive, I started wondering, what exactly is my objective for the future? I have no idea what will pull me forward for the next 50 years. I understand that the future holds endless possibilities of improvement for people who grew up in low-income families, but for me, the future feels empty. I could improve on what my family has right now, but that would require sacrifices that I don't want to make. I would have to give up time or morals, or possibly both, and that point, more money wouldn't be worth it.\n\nI could pursue my passions, but that would come at the price of stability, and I'm not sure I want to make that payment.\n\nOr, I could live the middle or upper-middle-class life that my parents have, working in some tech job that comfortably pays the bills, even if it doesn't captivate me. I would feel bored though. I don't want to stay in the same place my parents are in right now, where they just mindlessly make money while hanging out with friends and taking care of their kids. I've enjoyed that lifestyle for 17 years, but I can't imagine it will be enough to keep me engaged for the next 50.\n\nGiven that this sub of stressed-out, misguided teenagers has always been the best source of life-altering advice, I'd like to ask, A2Cers what are your goals? What will pull you forward for the next 50 years?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think you have to decide now and you\u2019ll be in a better place to do so when you\u2019re older. \n\nIt would probably help you to realize your family is actually just rich. Your family is in the top 5-6% of earners. Even if you are in one of the highest-price areas this is surely in the top 20-30% (and I\u2019d guess with the house size & 3 cars+properties this can\u2019t be 300K in San Francisco). I\u2019m not quite sure you realize how constrained your life would be by comparison on even a comfortable 80K (which is far above the average sports journalist salary btw). I\u2019m not saying just do compsci and work at FAANG - but there is a reason your parents chose the mindless job-weekend lifestyle - it comes with a lot of freedom and pleasures that aren\u2019t even available to relatively high-earning 100K households. There\u2019s a certain romanticism that comes with doing what you love but unless you\u2019ve actually been poor or middle class I\u2019m not sure you realize what that lifestyle can really entail. \n\nI grew up extremely poor (my childhood home is literally on the market for 30K right now lul), I just want a reasonably comfortable life doing what I love (academic - but that\u2019s so hard lol), I\u2019m not really above selling out though. If I can\u2019t get a researcher tenure job I could deal with mind-numbing work that has a much higher salary. My point is everyone has some indifference point. I'm not gonna be an untenured lecturer on 30K just so I can do academia, I'll sell out every time. But I'd take 90K tenure position over much higher-paying finance job. This is why we can't help you really - you have to explore and decide what trade-offs you are willing to tolerate. But you are very casually dismissing the comforts that come with your parents income and I don't think that's realistic and you need to look at what kind of lifestyle and budget you can live on in your preferred career path. Also, regression to the mean usually implies it's hard for children to replicate that high-earning success so I wouldn't just assume that's available to you tbh.",

Except that I have a mom who grew up in a lower economic family and all she walked out with (from her parents home) was education and grit to lead a better quality of life. \n\nShe makes it a point to remind me that if I follow my passions I may not be able to afford an international trip every year, fine dining every weekend, imported clothes shoes etc. And now she also tells me if she had followed her passions I would have never afforded to even dream about a US degree.\n\nKnowingly or unknowingly I took the middle path. I don't want to do cs but I don't plan to do English major either. Did you consider a middle path like double major etc? That may help you decide what you want your career to be like.",

      "text": "I'm kinda in the same situation as you but I grew up poor and we've risen up a lot so i understand both sides of this well\n\n  \nIt really should come down to also how much your parents will help you if you go down some lower-paying path. Most people ik who pursue low paying jobs have trusts/etc and so are very fulfilled with their lives. However if your parents don't have a high NW(on 300k its possible) then I wouldn't rely on help from them at all. But if they're high 7/8fig and willing to help then do whatever you want. Like seriously no point being miserable in a job you hate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the flip side, I know people who pursue shit like English and become teachers who are miserable bc of the pay. Flying in economy class and wearing target clothes fucking sucks when you are used to business class and Prada(This is a first world problem but its a first world thread). It's super hard to go back to normalness once you've experienced the high life (on a smaller scale, I didn't have an AC in California for 15 years, but now we have one and i cant go without it in)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe teacher in question ended up moving into tech bc she really wanted the comforts of her childhood. So I think you really need to think about how much you value the current lifestyle and play that into your decisions",

          "text": "> look, i sympathize, but you are NOT upper middle class. you are rich. straight up. and im saying this as someone whos fam makes 200k+ lol.\n\nNot really. The traditional definition of being rich in America revolves around the 1% (which they are far from being in). Historically, most would define being part of the wealthy upper class by not needing to work; their primary income comes from investments and capital gains. You might think it's a small difference, but it's actually incredibly significant. If a doctor had a car accident tmrw and was out of commission and could never work again, they would be destitute eventually. However, if someone from the landed capital class had a car accident and was out of commission, they'd make enough from their investments alone (i.e. by simply existing) that they would still be fine. And therein lies the fundamental difference between being a member of the wealthy class and simply having some wealth.",

      "text": "There is a stress that comes from working in a career that you are not well-suited for.\n\nHowever, I think every job has downsides that aren\u2019t apparent until you are doing them. Journalism might sound fun until you get the very boring entry-level assignment that has nothing to do with sports commentary, you hate your boss, and your story ideas always get shot down or you have to work every Friday and Saturday night covering high school games or something. In other words, I don\u2019t know anyone who loves ALL parts of their job.\n\nSo I think most parents assume you will have some job stress in any job and want to save you from added financial stress. It sounds like no big deal to live on a small salary when you are young and single, but parents envision you with a family. If the washing machine breaks and you can\u2019t afford a new one or you can\u2019t afford piano lessons for your musically-talented kid or have to pass on getting them the spendy cool shoes they really want for their birthday \u2014 well, that\u2019s when career regret could really set in.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that pursuing your dream is the wrong choice. But parents have some wisdom gained from life experience\u2014 knowing how comforting it is to have sufficient funds for emergencies and extras for your kids and knowing how expensive life is. They worry you can\u2019t make an informed decision without that life experience.\n\nSo try to listen with that in mind. It likely isn\u2019t because they think you NEED to be rich, but more that they are worried you will struggle if you are poor in ways you don\u2019t anticipate right now.",

      "text": "Perhaps I can share my perspective as an adult with children nearing college age.  In case you're wondering how I ended up in this sub, I've been lurking to try and better understand the modern college application experience, to help my kids as much as I'm able to (without being overbearing).  Apologies in advance if I'm not welcome here.\n\nFor some background, I grew up working class to lower middle class, but I attended a T20 school in a STEM major, through a combination of loans, grants, and parent's savings.\n\nFirst, I will say that, unless you're one of the very few exceptions, what you desire out of life will certainly change over time.  I said I would never wear a suit, or work more than 40 hours per week, or work a corporate job.  That ended up not panning out :).\n\nI've made as little as 35k in my career and as much as $500k+.  While you'll be able to make do with either extreme, I can say that life is much easier when you make more and allows you much more ability to follow your passion if your profession is not already that, whether it's in the present or later in life.\n\nThink long term.  Do you want to have kids and be able to afford to send them to a T20 school?  Do you want to retire early before 65?  Do you want to live a nice lifestyle (expensive dinners, vacations, activities)?  If the answer is no to some or all of these, your options open up greatly as your savings needs go down significantly.\n\nI'm not here to say that you should go for a higher paying corporate job or go into a school/major that sets you up for that.  What I will say, though, is that one option is to maximize the money you make earlier in your career, live within your means, save a shit ton of money, invest it well and \"retire early\".  It doesn't mean you have to stop working, you just won't have to worry as much about how much you're making if you want to switch to your passion.\n\nBtw, journalism is a tough world.  Be prepared to not earn much money, while still potentially having to live in a HCOL area.  I think it would be good to have a backup plan (major, profession, etc)  that doesn't involve relying on your parents to subsidize your lifestyle.",

You can see from their point of view why they have a logical fear of you graduating and being unemployed and then no means to support yourself. Ultimately, they probably want you to be self-sufficient when they are no longer around. I think it all comes from a position of trying to look out for you. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s their definition and not yours. What you should think about is, what do you want out of life in the future?  If you desire the comfort that your parents have given you, does your field of study and passion area help you do that?  If not, will you be ok not having that lifestyle?  Maybe you are ok with living in an apartment, used car, taking a trip once every few years so that you can follow a career that may not be lucrative. How many make it to sports commentary and how much money is that for those who make it at a local or national level and is that a viable career in the future, etc. Maybe that\u2019s enough. \n\nIf their requirement is you have to study a certain field for them to fund you then you may not have an option and you may have to minor in journalism. Or you could try to community college route (less expensive to free in some states) and then transfer and pay your way thru the last two years of college via loans. Then you can study and have the freedom to choose.",
