  "text": "(This is my first time using reddit so I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this)\n\nOk so basically I'm a high school senior in America and I really want to go to the UK for University. I overall have had pretty good grades throughout high school except for my second semester of my junior year (lots of mental health reasons lead to not the best grades and failing like every AP test). Due to this, I don't think I would be able to get into a lot of the universities I had originally wanted to apply to. I want to know what the best universities are that I would have a good chance of being able to get into with my stats. \n\n\\- I have a 3.5 unweighted GPA (4.5 weighted) \n\n\\- AP tests scores: World History (3); Art History (3); Biology (3); and Seminar (3)\n\n\\- I am taking the AP Stats and English Lit tests at the end of this year\n\n\\- I also plan on taking two community college classes second semester",
