  "text": "So i'm aware that UC's are fully test blind and I'm filling out my activity section right now, kinda just putting whatever I put on my common app and tweaking it for word count but then I came across a problem. So on my common app I put 'missouri bright flight' as one of my honors/awards, which is an award given to anyone with above a 31+ and I'm confused if I should put it on my UC application but they are test blind so how would that even work pls this is so stupid \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: should I put an award that I got bc of my ACT score on my UC application even though they are test blind?",

      "text": "Does not matter\n\nPSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
