      "text": "Top LACs for sure along with research universities you listed. Harvey Mudd produces a ton of math PhDs for its size.  I'd guess Swarthmore, Pomona, Carleton are all very high too.\n\nIf you look at schools that have students that excel at the Putnam competition for their size, that's probably a reasonable list.",
