  "text": "I filled out my CSS profile and sent it to all the schools that require it on my college list. I did this about a month ago.\n\nHowever on the Common App, I accidentally submitted a few applications without ticking the box that lets them know that I am planning to apply for financial aid.\n\nMy question is: If I send them my CSS Profile, will they consider me for financial aid even if I said that I wasn't looking for aid on the Common App? Which one overrides which, I guess is what I'm asking.\n\nP.S. I did email the admissions teams and told them about my situation - just waiting for a response.",
