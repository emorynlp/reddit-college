  "text": "First post here, not looking for medical or admissions advice. Just need a place to rant.\n\nI\u2019m a prospective music performance major, and the admissions process for music is pretty stressful: preliminary audition videos, live auditions, and interviews on top of your usual college essays and supplements. I was dealing with severe joint pain for weeks, which obviously interfered with mobility and my ability to practice. But I powered through, submitted my Common App for my EA and ED schools in early October, and tried to prepare for my auditions, etc when I could move. \n\nLast week I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and I\u2019m learning how to navigate life with this chronic condition. Obviously it\u2019s been a lot to deal with, both physically and mentally, especially during a stressful time like college admissions time. It\u2019s a vicious cycle: stressed about medical issues and stressed about college bc of medical issues but stress makes my condition worse LMAO my life has changed so much so quickly :( I have no idea how I\u2019m going to prepare for November auditions or interviews but I\u2019m going to try my best.\n\nEveryone told me that college apps and auditions were hard but I didn\u2019t think it was a \u201cyour immune system is going to be messed up forever\u201d kind of hard :((((\n\nReally glad this sub exists so we can all get through the admissions process together tho :,) I hope your apps are going well! Sending extra Halloween candy and hugs as Nov 1 comes near",

I\u2019ve struggled with dysautonomia for the last 3 years and the best way for me to avoid flare ups is keeping my stress levels low\u2014 which is impossible right now! College apps are stressful for everyone but it\u2019s a whole other level when your health is on the line, and it\u2019s so lonely when other people don\u2019t understand that. Wishing you the best of luck with auditions, you will get through this!",
