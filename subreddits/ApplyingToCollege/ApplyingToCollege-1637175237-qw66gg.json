  "text": "So right now I have a 3.73 uw and 3.92 w gpa. Is this \u201cbad\u201d for colleges since my uw isn\u2019t over 4.0? My friend said that my gpa is so low for the schools I\u2019m applying (Boston u, bc, Emory, Tulane, usc etc) and I probably shouldn\u2019t apply\u2026so now I\u2019m second guessing myself. \nI thought it was a good gpa but what do y\u2019all think?",
