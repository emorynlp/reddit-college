  "text": "Idk where else to post this so this sub will do ig. I just had my 2nd AP Micro test which I took with a blinding migraine. I knew I was going to fail going in, but I had already missed the first test's test day so I couldn't risk pissing off this teacher who i knew would not take it kindly as she is notoriously brutal. All in all, I just ended up with a 67 on a test which constitutes 12% of my grade. \n\nI go to a school with a 7 point grading system where anything below a 70 is an F, this is the first test I've ever failed, and I'm nervous since my school calculates GPAs on the 100 point scale. I don't know if I'm overreacting but this essentially limits my grade to a 93 at best which is barely an A- at my school. I'm really not sure what to do and idk how this is gonna effect my future so if anyone has any advice/words of wisdom it would be appreciated.",

I know I'm overreacting somewhat but with my school's stupid 100 point unweighted scale, this basically invalidates any chance I have of my valedictorian dream.",

You\u2019ll make it through! Micro is also a really great class to self study - you don\u2019t need much time to understand the content. If you need tips or resources you can DM and I\u2019ll help you as best as I can!",

Last year everyone from my school got a 5 on the AP thinking it was the easiest test even after getting Ds or worse in her actual class. I am planning to be more proactive on studying it and trying to get ahead somewhat.",
