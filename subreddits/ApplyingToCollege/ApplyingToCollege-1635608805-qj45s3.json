  "text": "So, I just received my midterm grades and there is a slight dip from the previous year grades.\n\n9th Grade: 80%\n\n10th Grade: 97%\n\n11th Grade: 95.5%\n\n12th Midterm: 93%\n\nNo one in my class has scored above 95% in Grade 12 Midterm this year. So, I was just wondering if this downward curve might have a negative impact on my application?\n\nP.S. International from India BTW.",
