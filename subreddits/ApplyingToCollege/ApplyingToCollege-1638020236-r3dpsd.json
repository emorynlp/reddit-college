It\u2019s more your own profile and to some extent, your undergrad school\u2019s ranking. Had a cousin (from NJ) who went to CMU for ug and northwestern for grad, another cousin (from Texas) who went to Wharton then JHU medschool, friends who\u2019ve done Duke\u2014>Indiana, Rutgers\u2014>Columbia med, UIUC\u2014>Columbia dental, UVA\u2014>Dartmouth. \n\nThe only favoritism I\u2019ve heard of is at the same school, say Harvard college\u2014>Harvard grad program but even then, more on rigor both of student profile and somewhat school, not like they won\u2019t let Stanford kids in bc they\u2019re from the west coast, but also they aren\u2019t obligated to let in more Tufts/BU/BC kids (though some would probably get in) just because they\u2019re from Boston.",
