  "text": "I GOT AN INVITE TO HAVE MY PRINCETON INTERVIEW AHHHHHHH!!!! I'm an international student so it means a LOT to me.\n\nMy interviewer sent me an email with some dates and I want to reply to it telling her I've chosen one. What should the email's tone be? How should it go?\n\nAny other tips (despite kissing) are appreciated! :)\nThanks in advance!",

I\u2019d say keep the email polite and concise, I wouldn\u2019t give her a rundown of your extracurriculars or anything like that, though I suppose you could attach a resume for her reference if the school / interviewer doesn\u2019t discourage that. \n\nAlso definitely prepare a few (2-3) good questions that aren\u2019t cliche / easily answered on the school website.",

If you find at any point that this time no longer works, please just let me know and I'll be happy to find another time that works for you.\n\nIf you send me a Zoom link, I'll put it on my calendar right away. I look forward to talking with you about Princeton!\n\nP.S. Is it true that the school motto translates to \"God went to Princeton\"?\n\n\\^\\^\\^ Note: the time zone is VERY important to establish if you're international. And even if you aren't.",

I generally try to stay casual to put my interviewees at ease, and I don't mind if they reply casually as long as I can figure out what they're saying.\n\nI'd recommend coming with several things you think reflect positively on you in mind. Choose one (or more) to talk about based on what questions they ask. Don't force something for a question that doesn't make sense\u2014if I ask about your favorite class, but you want to talk about a robot you built in robotics club, don't tell me how robotics club is kinda a class. It isn't. Do tell stories or add details that go beyond what you already submitted. And remember to relax and have fun!",
