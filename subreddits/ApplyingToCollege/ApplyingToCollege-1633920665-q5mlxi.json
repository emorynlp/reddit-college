  "text": "I met with my high school guidance counselor today and talked with her about my college plans. I have a 3.9 gpa and have been fairly successful in school. Still I wanted to go to community college since it is free in my city and I am not about to pay 30k a year for gen Eds. I would also be able to keep my job which I have worked my way up in. My counselor seemed distraught and said \u201coh do you really wanna go to community college, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s free\u201d. Like what? It\u2019s literally free what is there to loose. My family has also not been supportive about my choice either. It\u2019s just odd to see this stigma against community college when most of their classes are the same as university classes that cost literally infinitely times more",

      "text": "When I was younger, I would've advised against this for a different reason - transferring was a big pain in the butt, and many of my friends who took this route often ended up taking CC classes they didn't need, or losing credits in the process because what the CC offered didn't translate to the right classes that the Uni was giving credit for. However, now (and I'm speaking from a standard CC to state university perspective here, ymmv for other colleges) a lot of schools have worked together to clean up that transfer pathway so it's a lot easier for students to do 1-2 years at CC and then transfer to a 4 year. Or maybe you want to do a trade, which 4 years don't even offer! Either way, just because you're a good student doesn't mean you have to go directly to a 4 year school, especially if your ultimate plan is to go to a local college or university who has fairly simple admissions (compared to the T20s most people on this sub are trying to get into).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's your future. You know what's right for you. YOU get to decide.",

They gain no status if you attend the local community college.  So, that's why your counselor is so negative.\n\nIt's a similar thing with your family.  They aren't going to be able to brag about their kid at Fancy College if you're living at home and attending community college (which is definitely a great option for many students).\n\nMy advice:. Look on your community college's website to see if they offer a \"credit transfer guarantee\" and if so, which universities accept the credits.  I've had some friends who have lost half their credits due to the credits not being accepted at the transfer university.  Another smart thing to do is to keep a file with all of your syllabi.  Then, if you transfer to a school that isn't guaranteed to accept the credit, you have proof of the material that was covered, which can help you fight for credit transfer.\n\nMy state recently started offering free community college (up to three years) to all new students.  There's also a credit transfer guarantee program to any of our regional state universities.  So, a student who lives at home and commutes to the community college for 2-3 years and then transfers and commutes to the nearby state regional university could get a bachelor's degree for about $20k.  That's an amazing deal.",

It's possible, however, this particular school was just uniquely easy.\n\nCC may still be a fine option, but some things to consider:\n\n* It will limit the selection of schools you have to choose from w.r.t. your eventual degree.  You'll have to stick to ones that will accept your CC credits, which may rule out some you might like to attend.  (Or not.)\n* You will be applying as a transfer student, so you may not be eligible for some merit scholarships you'd have otherwise qualified for as a first-time freshman applicant.\n* You will lose out on the \"college experience\" for however many years you spend in CC, which is time during which you'd be forming relationships with other students and faculty, e.g. if you're interested in any kind of undergraduate research. If you're only on campus for two years before leaving with a degree, you may find it hard to get fully \"integrated\" into campus life before it's time to leave.\n* If your concern is money and you have high stats, then, instead of community college, have you considered simply enrolling at a 4Y university that would give you a significant discount?",
