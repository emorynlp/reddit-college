  "text": "I am a student from the Caribbean and I took CSEC and CAPE exams which are equivalent to O Levels and A Levels. So I just wanted to ask how does my counsellor report these grades on the Common App. I know the School Report is for my transcript, but these grades are not on my transcript. So is it ok for him to submit certified copies of the certificates in Optional Report 1 and Optional Report 2?",
