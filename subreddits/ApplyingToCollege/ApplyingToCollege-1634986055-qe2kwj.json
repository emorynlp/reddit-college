In 10th boards, questions were mainly focused on the ncert and previous year papers. But since the pattern has changed, I'd suggest you learn your ncert really well. Also refer the Oswaal guide for question bank. \n\nSo yeah, just focus on ncert and the notes given by school. It should help you enough. \n\nI have model examinations (practise exams for boards) going on and Im to give my physics exam tomorrow. What I suggested is basically how I learned everything. Just write down the main results separately on a paper for easy revision in the end moment, really helps. \n\n(Sorry for the long ass reply lmfao)",

Idk whether or not it was intended. \nI don't know what your application is but I guess you weren't able to do things which were relevant. And you are blaming it on the situation (projection). Am not saying that it's easy but it's not impossible either. \nPlus 5 - 6 ECs that are relevant or good are better than 10-11 that aren't.\nQuality > Quantity. \nYou gave me that kinda vibe hence I said lmao (I didn't wanna be offensive it's just the words I casually use in a convo)",
