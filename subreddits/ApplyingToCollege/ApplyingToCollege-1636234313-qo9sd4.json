  "text": "Stay safe and healthy out there; it seems each week is getting harder and harder mentally. A friendly reminder that this college process is for yourself and your own betterment in your educational journey. Sometimes it helps to have the blinders up when people talk about colleges and their accomplishments because it really is just the hunger games out here.\n\nAnyway, have a good weekend everyone. Do something fun and let's just collectively take a deep breath because the toughest part will be the waiting. \n\nPS: Can u tell I'm mentally deteriorating? This process really sucks.",
