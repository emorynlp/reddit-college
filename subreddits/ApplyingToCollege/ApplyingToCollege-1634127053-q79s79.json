  "text": "My sophomore year I got a 3 on the AP Art-2D exam. Last year though, I got a 5 on the AP Drawing exam. Should I self-report both or just the 5? They count for the same credit at all the schools I'm applying to. The only reason I might not omit 2d is to maybe show development? Idk. Thanks.",
