  "text": "I basically didn't give a shit about school since primary when I realized I didn't have to study. So I barely passed most clases and got some good grades sometimes in math or physics.\n\nThis year I finally found out what I want to do with my life so I'm grinding it out and I'm doing alright for myself (I'm not trying to jinx it). I'm currently in my last 2 years of high school doing the IB. Are my shitty past grades going to drag me down?",
