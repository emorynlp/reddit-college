      "text": "Some schools do not show scores in the PDF.\n\nRegardless, check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. However, other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. \n\nIf the college accepts scores self-reported in the app, after your app has been submitted check your admission portal to confirm that the scores were received.",

(That usually takes a couple of days to receive.)\n\nIf the scores are not in the portal, I would check around the portal to see if the college accepts scores in the portal itself, as many also do (often via a form/additional link) and then submit that way. If there isn't a way to submit within the portal, and you're sure they accept self-reported scores, then yes, email them to ask about this issue.",
