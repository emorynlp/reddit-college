Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. However, other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. \n\nIf the college accepts scores self-reported in the app, after your app has been submitted check your admission portal to confirm that the scores were received.",
