The one thing I would check is if you actually have an ability to upload a portfolio (depending on what you\u2019re actually going to show). Not sure the Common App has this capability. Additionally, some schools don\u2019t have their own tool especially if the college or department doesn\u2019t require a portfolio. I think you\u2019d use text to describe the awards and a link to a webpage?",
