  "text": "I need a lot of financial aid but I have great ECs and stats. My essays are okay I guess. If there\u2019s an applicant from another country that doesn\u2019t have as much applicants (e.g. European, African countries) that has average stats and ECs but doesn\u2019t need financial aid, do they get an advantage because they aren\u2019t applying to receive financial aid? How much does applying for financial aid actually impact the admissions process?",
