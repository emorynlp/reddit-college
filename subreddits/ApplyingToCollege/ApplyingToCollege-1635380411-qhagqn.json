  "text": "I mean help as:\n\n\\- before my essay, they help me to do the brainstorming, and basically, they help me make most of the thesis.\n\n\\- I wrote all the words by myself.  \n\n\\- They read that, rewrite it for me, but instead of just using that version they wrote, I read it and edit my own essay by myself.\n\nIs this allowed?",

(like at most 10 words, just some word choice, and grammar) And they gave me an idea of what to write, like \"You should write about your trip during your high school and then talk about how that lets you find out the friendship is important, then write a story of yourself\". Then I start write them.",
