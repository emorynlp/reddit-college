  "text": "I'm having a hard time trying to pick a major. I just don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I need to select something because the application is due next week. I wish I could try out some jobs and see if I like them. I know there are video for some careers, but not all of them. Plus, I keep getting advise like \"major in what you love\" and \"consider avaliblity and money\". Because of my situation(bio-based majors and living in California), these peices of advice are conflicting. I feel like I just need more time and more constructive advice. Do any of you guys have advice for someone trying to move pass this brick wall?",
