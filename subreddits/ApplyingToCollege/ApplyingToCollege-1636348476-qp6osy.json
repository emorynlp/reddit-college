  "title:": "MSU vs. Purdue",
  "text": "I am looking for some advice in comparing Purdue - West Lafayette and Michigan State University! I hope to go away next fall and pursue an electrical engineering degree. Purdue and MSU are two I am highly considering. I know \"Purdue is engineering,\" but I am sure I will have just as many quality learning opportunities at MSU. \n\nI visited Purdue recently and loved the campus and the people; it felt very homey. I am from Michigan, so I have been to the MSU campus a number of times. I am going to have a more formal tour of the school towards the end of this month. \n\nI was hoping some alums or current students, particularly in engineering, could share their opinions and experiences regarding either school. Thanks!",
