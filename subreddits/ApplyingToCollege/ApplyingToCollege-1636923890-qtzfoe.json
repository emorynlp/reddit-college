Coalition isn't much better in terms of being user friendly, though it at least gives space for you to write about your ecs. Why can't we all just use the CommonApp ffs UT Austin is the only school I hate more and more with the application process, and the essays are horrendous",

If you haven't already, you should put all that extra curricular info into a doc or spreadsheet, makes it way easier to fill out and check (especially if you're applying to an honors program and need an extended resume).",
