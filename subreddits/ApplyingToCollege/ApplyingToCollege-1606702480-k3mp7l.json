This has been frequently observed and documented. It happens way more than it doesn't.\n\nInstead, when you start by looking at extraordinary people, work backwards from that, and see how many of these extraordinary people were formerly prodigies, you'll not find a significant percentage.\n\nI'm not trying to say that this kid is going to end up doing nothing extraordinary as an adult - I hope for the exact opposite because I want there to be more geniuses out there, making the world better for dumbasses like me.\n\nMy point is that you shouldn't feel bad or inadequate at all when recognizing the existence of prodigies. At some point, you may find that, in adulthood, you end up reaching the same level of achievement as former prodigies, if not far exceeding them.\n\nEinstein was a late blooming child. Van Gogh started his art career late. Colonel Sanders started KFC at 65. Samuel L. Jackson only made it at age 40.\n\nPeople start finding their passions and talents at different points in life, learning at different rates. You shouldn't feel a detriment to your worth just because of this simple fact.",

You can always skip along due to how terrible secondary and primary education is in the US, but that doesn't make you a particular prodigy.",

                          "text": "Real prodigies and geniuses do exist. They are the reason why I will never pursue academic research for a living. I personally know a couple myself, and they are quite different from normal people. They pick up things faster, they understand things easier, they achieve adequacy with a lot less instruction needed etc, the list goes on. Generally speaking, many of them do end up very successful. However, just like how you don't hear about every new figure in Forbes 30 under 30, most of them just don't make for that great of a news story.\n\nFor example a 12 year old going to college will fare a lot better than a high schooler who wins the USAMO, partially because most people don't even know what the USAMO is. Is that high schooler not capable? No, I would argue that the high schooler achieved something a lot more prestigious and may very well be truly gifted. Does that make for a good news story people will read though? No. Just compare the headline \"12 year old gets into college\" with \"Junior in high school wins the USAMO\", you can easily see which one is more appealing. \n\nSo prodigies and geniuses do exist, and many of them do fare very well in their lives but many of them are also just not news material. They are genius in perhaps more impressive ways, but most are not in the form of \"goes to college at \\[insert young age\\]\".",

I have not spent time doing the reading necessary and do not have the experience to claim who is and isn't a prodigy and how extraordinary \"true prodigies\" end up becoming. In that regard, my original comments on the fate of prodigies may be flawed, provided you're entirely correct. I don't know if you are, but I'm not going to take the time to figure out how psychologists and other people define everything and what the exact statistics from the literature (if any) show, simply because I have essays to write and I'm just not that interested in this topic lol.\n\nThat being said, the core point of the post still holds perfectly well as far as I can tell. I see the existence of prodigies as no reason to quit academia - if prodigies just end up making excellence in academia infeasible for the rest of us, why is it that I so rarely come across prodigies amongst top researchers in the areas I'm interested in? Garbage metric, but why do the majority of Nobel Laureates and Turing Award winners that most of us know of not have prodigious backgrounds? Again, this could just be a popularity contest and my personal experience is just anecdote.\n\nThis isn't a great test, but I took a look at the last 4 years of Nobel physics prizes (so like 12 winners) as well as the last 12 ACM Turing Award winners and failed to find a *single* prodigy. 24 was a small, arbitrary number (which itself threw like 10 minutes in the trash lol), but I'm pretty sure it demonstrates to some degree that you definitely do not need a prodigious background to be one of the best in academia. In fact, you can have a garbage start and fail miserably and still make it.\n\nPerhaps prodigies have a disproportionate share of achievement compared to their prevalence in the general population. That may be true and I don't have any kind of statistic to demonstrate that or otherwise. But there are simply not that many prodigies relative to the massive number of greats. There are many extraordinary people in a lot of fields who had late starts and were deemed \"slow\" before adulthood.",

That was the kid I was referring to.\n\nHe has been in grad school for eight years and as far as I can tell he only has four publications (which would be a good amount if three of them aren't on arxiv), and only one in an academic journal (not to say academic journals are the be all end all, they are kind of a scam but they are also the measure of prestige in academia). Also to be fair he kind of got the short end of the stick with his advisor, but that's another story.",

It's a headstart that comes at a cost to social interactivity and leisure. Plus, he may completely change his mind on the future. Decide he wanted to do something else or decided another path was better. \n\n\nI think I worded myself wrong. I meant I don't think the kid actually needs to go to college so early to succeed. This sort of jumpstart comes at a heavy cost, that being leisure and social interaction. Most kids can be like him in terms of success. My argument was that going to college so early is completely unnecessary. \n\nHe can easily stretch out his intelligence and academia over highschool and learn on the side. To me, this kinda just seems like throwing stress on oneself for not a massive reward. Like don't get me wrong, going to college early is fine, but 12 years of age is a huge gap. 15-16 makes a big difference in both maturity and experience. Kid won't get to talk much to people in college, and won't really be able to relate to kids his own age. \n\n\nI just find it that the kid could succeed just as well and wait it out instead of skipping and skipping. Online learning is actually fairly robust imo depending on the programs used, and it could help accelerate while still keeping a slower pace. \n\nIf he wants to he can. Ain't nobody gonna stop him if this is really, really the choice he wants to go through. If he is sure he wants to go to mars/work on a mars program, that's all his choice, but as you said, a 12 year old is no where near as mature as a 18 year old.",
