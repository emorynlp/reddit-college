  "text": "I am applying to a few t20s and I have 0 actual leadership positions. I feel like I have no chance at any of them because of this and it is so dejecting.  \nHowever, I do have some mediocre ECs and was wondering if describing them to make them sound like leadership would compensate for the lack of an actual leadership position (I won't lie about any of them, but maybe just \"embellish\" the truth)? For example, using verbs like \"led\" \"planned\" \"organized\" \"operated\" to describe my involvement in clubs I'm a member of",

I feel like with elected positions or designated roles, people focus too much on that it will look \"good\" in college admissions, rather than actually wanting to improve the thing they are leading. Same goes for honors or awards. Do you really care about the thing you are doing or are you just there for the award at the end? (Yes I know having a goal is always good and an award is something plausible to strive for, but people definitely do activities just for the sake of the recognition they will receive)",
