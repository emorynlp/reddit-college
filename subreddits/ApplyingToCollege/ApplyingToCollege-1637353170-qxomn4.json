  "title:": "Will it look bad if I take regular physics senior year after taking all the other AP science classes",
  "text": "I heard colleges don\u2019t like seeing people who drop their level senior year. I am planning on taking Ap Spanish, Ap Art, Ap calc, Ap gov next year. Possibly ap physics. I have taken all the possible AP science classes in my high school - as I\u2019m planning on majoring in stem. I don\u2019t like physics and ik I won\u2019t do well in physics (the material does not match with what I do well with). I don\u2019t want colleges to think I\u2019m just going easy next year because it was pretty difficult doing all the Ap sciences (except physics) in the first place. Thoughts?",
