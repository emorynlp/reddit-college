  "title:": "I wasn't allowed to attend school but I really want to go to college- need advice",
  "text": "Sorry if this is in the wrong place- there isn't really anyone I can talk to irl, and this sub seemed like the best place.\n\nI live in a very small town in the southern part of the United States. homeschooling without regulation is perfectly legal here (not that I have anything against homeschooling but my parents have abused this law, and I pretty much have no education except what I have taught myself) \n\nTo give a quick(well not really) background on my schooling: I attended school freshman year somewhat normally and did great. However, once covid happened my parents became very fearful and scared (like believing in microchips in vaccines, Qanon, women shouldn't have an education etc). Sophmore year after my parents pulled me out of school I just decided to self-study, and using some money I made with art commissions, I took a few AP exams. My parents made no effort to teach me anything, but they didn't actively discourage it. This changed as i entered junior year, they started actively fighting me when I tried to study (I literally had to secretly do calculus in our crawl space, or else they would become aggressive). Now i am currently studying for the SAT + a test that is sort of like the SAT/GED that i need to pass in order to take duel enrollment classes (i guess they aren't technically duel enrollment? idk). I got a full score on the English section and plan to take the math one soon and i think ill do good on that one as well so i'm not particulaly worried about gaps in my actual knowledge (dont ask how i actually plan to take these classes- im still trying to figure it out) \n\nOKAY, now that thats all covered lets get to what im concerned about,, next year i would like to apply to a non CC college so i can get a bachelors in the field i want to study, I just am very conflicted on how I should go about explaining my situation... I dont want to lie, but im not exactly sure what to do...\n\n I remember reading Tara Westover's book Uneducated, and when she was in a situation similar to this she took the ACT, got a good score, and basically lied on the application that she had a great and rigorous homeschool curriculum.\n\nI dont want to lie, but im worried doing something like this would be best, that still leaves me scrambling in search of recomendation letters but at least colleges wont think I just didnt have a highschool education.\n\nIf i m honest, and explain my situation im worried colleges will think i wont be able to handle their curriculum etc\n\nalso what about my gpa? i mean i dont exactly have a traditional one-- i kinda just studied until i knew things by heart. Im not sure how i would even give myself homework or tests lol-- which i guess i could also lie about but y'know :/\n\nIf my plan to get recommendations from CC profs falls through what then? most colleges ive looked at (Even nearby state schools) need letters from 1 counseler, 1 english teacher, and 1 math teacher. My options are pretty limited especially since im not really allowed to leave the house (my parents have security systems, electric fences, cameras, lights that flash on etc so sneaking out is difficult (though i do have a few friends i am occasionally allowed to visit)\n\nOf course tuition is a concern, who will sign the loan? I think my brother possibly could but still I have no idea what im doing lol\n\n for now, i am mostly concerned with the application itself so any advice or ideas would really be appreciated \n\nalso sorry in advance if I'm not making sense or there's a lot of errors, i am not feeling well",

You probably won't need to lie, because you seem smart and more than that, you've pursued your education through adversity, which is something I believe colleges really like to see. \n\nI was homeschooled and applied to a community college based off of a portfolio of some of my work, an unofficial transcript, and SAT scores. You would probably be able to get into state schools and I would even think some higher level schools. I really, REALLY understand your situation because I've been there done that, although not to the extreme your parents are.\n\nAnd if you for some reason don't get accepted, you can always do cc for a semester or two and establish grades so colleges know you can handle college work. \n\nDo you say you took the SAT already? What's your total score if so?\n\nPlease feel free to DM me. I have lots of thoughts on this, I really believe you could get into a good college.",

I\u2019ve taken 1/2 (it\u2019s split into two parts for some reason) of a test similar to a GED and got a full score ((the test is required for my local CC to register for classes)) + I took the psat freshman year and while I don\u2019t remember my exact score I believe it was pretty good. On SAT practice tests I\u2019ve been getting 1500+ so I\u2019m hoping to be able to score similarly on the actual test.",

      "text": "I also don\u2019t recommend lying. \n\nLike another comment suggested, I also would email admissions to ask about how to deal with your unconventional education for application purposes. Being self taught makes you harder to assess, but a solid SAT can mitigate that. How did you do on APs? While self-study probably doesn\u2019t add much to most kids\u2019 apps, it does for yours since it will also be another assessment point. Also, if you sign up for \u201cdual enrollment,\u201d you might want to ask how that will be considered. If you have a GED type of test, you might get classified as a college student & might have to apply as a transfer student (which will have different requirements). It probably is an easier path to go CC to a 4 year (you can actually get LORs), but there may be schools you\u2019ve overlooked that don\u2019t need LORs.\n\nWhat would also be extremely helpful is to have your living situation documented. Your parents are very extreme, and if you can document that, you might be able to be considered as an independent for financial purposes/FAFSA (and depending on when you turn 18, consider getting emancipated), which would mean you might qualify for more financial aid. It\u2019s rare that I think a kid has a shot at being classified as independent, but you\u2019re an exception.\n\nIf your SAT practice tests scores hold up, you may have a shot at some competitive schools, the type that meet need based aid. You\u2019re obviously a self-starter & determined to accomplish as much as you have on your own, and I suspect there may be unconventional paths for you for admission.\n\nETA you don\u2019t have to be emancipated to be considered independent the FAFSA, but it could make life easier. Also, getting your living situation documented sooner vs later (emancipated or not) will help with financial aid so much & I\u2019d urge you to start on that asap.",

I\u2019ll add that the sooner you can get your GED and enroll in community college classes, the sooner you can use the cc resources to help you apply to a 4 year school. And reach out to your state\u2019s flagship university admissions office now and ask them for advice. They may be able to guide you into being accepted there.",

      "text": "You got some good answers here already, but here are my 2 cents.\n\nYour chances of going to a 4 year directly is very low, especially since you did not have a proper education. If you lie on the application, they will find out and you will be blacklisted from most, if not all 4 year universities. And even if you were able to get into a  4 year, that 4 year should have a good program for your major/field of interest. \n\nAnother thing to consider is your financial situation right now, and what your financial situation will be in the next 4-6 years. \n\nIf I were you I would leave your parents house with the help of someone you can trust. And never look back, I and my friends have suffered by QAnon followers, and it is in your best interest if you don't meet with them until their view's change, if they change. \n\nCheck out r/QAnonCasualties \n\nFrom the options that I know people have after high school, \n\nyou could enroll in a CC (most don't need you to have a GED or high school diploma before applying). And then get your GED+choose a college that you could see your self transferring to, and take the necessary credits to transfer and be an eligible candidate. \n\nMy guess is that will at least take you 2-3 years, and when you transfer to a 4 year university it will take you 2ish years to graduate with your degree. \n\nBe prepared to get a part-time job while you are in CC and in college. Sure you can co-sign a loan, but that will only cover your tuition, you will need a place to live, an allowance, transportation, a cell phone, etc. \n\nIf I were you I would move to a city that is not too expensive to live in, New York and Chicago are not your ideal cities right now since your goal should be to save money. \n\nYou are very brave for posting this, I can't even comprehend what you have been through, it must have been a living hell.

What state are you in (if you're okay with sharing)? Your public school options might be your best bet for finding a school that will work with your situation with a relatively low tuition.",

While you might not be a traditional first gen applicant, your family is not supportive of your goals and you probably have a lot of the same questions as students that are first gen. \n\nOne other thing is that admissions officers might be considered mandated reporters in your state. If you are being abused by state definitions, they are mandated to report it to the authorities. Just wanted to give you a heads up if you reach out to them.\n\nWishing you the best OP. This community is here for you!",

      "text": "I know other people have already said this, but I don't think you should lie in your essay.  In fact telling the truth will definitely increase your chance of admission, not many other people can say they were banging out integrals in the middle of the night to avoid the tyrannies of QAnon.\n\nI'm not sure how many CC credits you have currently but I'm not sure it's the best idea to jump into a 4 year University. If I were you I would take a gap year or attend a CC for a year after leaving your parents. Traversing through the college admissions process with basically no actual schooling would be pretty hard so I would take a year to figure things out.  But if you think you're ready to go to a University I guess it's up to you to decide what the best path is.\n\nThis is a crazy and disturbing story that would work for a great application essay.  I hope your situation improves, good luck in the future.",
