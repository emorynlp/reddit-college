How will making peace with the world around you (and fate, I guess) make you contribute to the community around you? I can think of a few, but you'll have to come up with those reasons yourself and mention them.",

          "text": "Hmm...\n\nI really like the first paragraph, but the essay really dwells on the concept of insignificance too much, so it comes off edgy. I think I'll keep the first paragraph about insignificance but delete the rest. \n\nThe rest of the essay can be a counterargument towards the first paragraph. But is that still too edgy? The essay prompt is \"Whats meaningful to you?\" or something, and how I acknowledge my insignificance but manage to not care about it is the truthful answer. But anything built on that concept has a %90 chance of coming off as pseudo-intllectual garbage.\n\nI honestly need a second opinion. Mind if I DM the essay to you in like 9 hours?",

      "text": "telling the admissions reader \"i am insignificant and I'm fine with that\" isn't really going to make them think \"WOW we need this student at our campus,\" especially when other applicants will be convincing them that \"I/my story is significant\"  its good to be honest with your interests and worldview and whatnot, but this is just counter intuitive for the purpose of the essay.",

I went on a Kurzgesagt binge like three weeks ago for inspiration. They managed to talk about optimistic nihlism so elegantly and I thought I could too. Guess not, it turned out to be a rant.",
