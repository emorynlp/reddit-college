  "text": "i\u2019m currently a junior and just started thinking about what type of life/environment i would like to surround myself in. towards the end of last yr i had my eyes open for ivys but junior year is so hard and i\u2019m typically a ~4.0 student whose probably getting a 3.6/3.5 uw gpa this semester (2-3 B+ in AP classes). \n\ni\u2019ve been looking at a lot of OOS public schools (uiuc, madison, gtech, unc chapel hill, uva, uwash, purdue) and was wondering how much of an impact would say 1 semester of \u201clow\u201d grades would affect someone if their test scores are above the 75th percentile? also, how do acceptance rates look for oos students for public schools? (also any other recs for public schools?)",

      "text": "1. Many public schools (even top ones) will have fairly notable differences between in-state and OOS acceptance rates. UMich\u2019s in-state acceptance rate was 47.5% last year but 21.9% for OOS+intl students. UNC-CH had a 48% in-state acceptance rate and 14% OOS acceptance rate. Be aware of these differences. \n\n2. OOS public schools often provide little to no financial aid to OOS students. If financial aid is important, be aware of this too.",

(like 35% / 17%)\n\nAnd yeah applying to OOS Flagships with no ability to afford them is an exercise in futility. Might as well target private schools - at least those will consider need-based aid.",

The in-state acceptance rate might have dramatically fallen last year with the application increases (couldn\u2019t find the numbers for co25), but apparently 47.5% was the in-state acceptance rate two years ago, as crazy as it sounds. Covid and gap years may have messed things up that year too, raising acceptance rates if you include waitlists.",
