  "text": "I\u2019ve looked through my common app essay at least thousand times for grammatical mistakes and errors. I submitted my application to FSU and USF already, which are considered safety schools based on my academics and test scores (not bragging). When looking through the essay after I submitted the application, I realized I had said \u201cin in.\u201d I am spazzing out right now and don\u2019t know if it will hurt my chances of being accepted into those schools. Luckily, I was able to fix this error before I submitted my application to UF just now, but I\u2019m scared that it might cost me for FSU and USF. Will it?",

In in just a few months time, you'll hopefully see an acceptance notice in in your respective portals for FSU & USF, and hopefully in in your UF portal as well!\n\nIn in addition, I'd like to wish you well. In in fact- I'd like to wish you the best of luck with any applications you may have in in the future. :)\n\n\\-----\n\n\\^\\^\\^ **I used \"in in\" eight times in those two short paragraphs; it really isn't too noticeable, especially for an AO who's reading tons of applications and doesn't have the time to slowly read each essay. :)**",
