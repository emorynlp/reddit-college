      "text": "Impact factor mainly depends on the subject. For ex. bio journals typically have an if of 10+ and prestigious ones being 25++, however, journals in astrophysics usually have an IF of 0.5 +/-. Although this seems very low, prestigious journals in astro at most have IF journals of 3-7. You need to look up the Q/SJR rating on your journal and see where it stands against the rest of the journals for your specific topic.",
