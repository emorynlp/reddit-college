  "text": "1. cum laude society: i mean idk if I can write 350 characters for that. it's just because my gpa was in the top 10% of my grade. so is it even worth putting it on the UC app?\n2. national merit scholar semifinalist: same as above. all I did was get a good score on the sat and the UCs arent even looking at it.\n\nbut i feel like i should maybe? what if i don't fill up all 350 characters in my descriptions?",
