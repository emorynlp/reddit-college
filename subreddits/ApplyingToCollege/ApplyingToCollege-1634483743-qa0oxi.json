  "title:": "Can I submit a different common application essay to different schools?",
  "text": "I'm going to be real: my common application essay is probably not going to be as great as I want it to be when I submit to my early action schools. This mostly has to do with the fact that I have written the vast majority of it within the last few weeks. **With that being said, I was wondering if I could tailor it and submit a different version to my regular decision schools. And if so, how does that work?**",
