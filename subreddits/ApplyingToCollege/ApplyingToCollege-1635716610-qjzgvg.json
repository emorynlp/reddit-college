  "title:": "Awaiting High School Transcript issue - Georgia Tech",
  "text": "I submitted my Common App application to Georgia Tech yesterday and received my login credentials to their admission portal today. However, the portal says that it is still awaiting my High School Transcript for my current School while the Mid-year Transcript and the Mid-year Transcript Report have all been received. The confusing part is that all these transcripts and reports were submitted by my school counselor together through Common App and the status for each of them currently shows \u201cDownloaded\u201d except for the Final Report which the counselor specifically said had to be submitted only after I received an acceptance from the college.\n\nFortunately, the Georgia Tech admission portal also has an option to upload unofficial school transcripts. I did that but the status for the High School Transcript is still at \u201cAwaiting.\u201d Will they update it automatically after downloading/reviewing it? Also, should I tell my counselor to check through the Final Report again just in case the Final Report is what the portal was referring to? At least then this problem won\u2019t arise with applications to the other Common App colleges then\u2026\n\nThanks",
