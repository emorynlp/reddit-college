  "text": "As title shown :)\n\nED results are going to come out in less than a month guys.\n\nI really do feel like some random f\\*ck boy applying to all these colleges, doing anything that it will take to get acceptances. Loyalty isn't a thing when it comes to college apps. I say I love you the most but do I really tho? DO I? Becuz I also said the same thing to 30 others and they know I did. So hard to have a mutually loving relationship these days.",
