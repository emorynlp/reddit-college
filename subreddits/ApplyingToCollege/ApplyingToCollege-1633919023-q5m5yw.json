Even then, many of our public universities are still more expensive than European ones\n\n\nPeople super-over-romanticise European schools and what \"Europe\" is like in general (ignoring that the experiences of someone raised in the UK is going to be very different from someone in Sweden vs. Spain vs. Slovakia.)\n\nFor starters, Italy and Spain might have cheap/free education but good luck getting a job. Youth unemployment in Italy is at 27% and that's the *lowest* it's been in a decade. Spain is at 33% and that's actually good compared to the 50% they were a few years back. Usually when people think about Europe, they actually mean the EU and they only mean specific parts of the EU; while Scandinavian countries might sound nice, I think it's important to remember that the combined population of Scandinavia is less than Texas, statistically you probably wouldn't be born there if you were born in the EU. The vast majority of the EU are places that a) Americans don't really ever think about and b) aren't as rosy as they seem. (Don't get me wrong, I love Spain and I love doing summers there but I would never want to live there full-time lol.)",
