  "text": "Hi I am interested in transferring to UW for the summer or autumn quarter 2022 from another 4 year school it is a flagship school for the state. I applied as a freshman but messed up my application so I was rejected. I then appealed and was waitlisted but never was admitted. My high school GPA (unweighted) was about a 3.45-3.5 and weighted it was about a 3.7-3.75. I never took the ACT or SAT because of covid so I don't have any scores for those. Because I am a freshman in college and it is my first quarter I don't know my college GPA yet. I am interested in pursuing a degree in Microbiology but I'm not set on it. Any advice for making myself a better applicant or giving me an estimate for my chances of getting in (which I know are slim because I'm not a WA CC student). Thank you!",

I guess just bank on a shakespeare level of writing for your essay I'f you havent done anything major.\n\nI'm just applying to transfer for fun the chance of me getting in is probably a generous 7-8%",
