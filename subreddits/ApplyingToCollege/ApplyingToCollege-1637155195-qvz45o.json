  "text": "ED\u2019d to Santa Clara because I\u2019ve been in love with the school since I visited. I probably could\u2019ve gone for a more \u201cprestigious\u201d college, but I\u2019m not a big believer in that. I wanna work in the Bay Area post grad and SCU has a huge presence there.\n\nI know a lot of people tend to ED at big reaches, but I was wondering if anyone (like myself) ED\u2019d to more of a target school. Thanks :)",

      "text": "While there several factors to think about for applying ED, a primary one that a lot of people ignore is: *will the finances work if I'm accepted*?\n\nAssuming that the finances work for your family, then you should absolutely apply ED to the school that *you* feel is both the best fit for *you*, when you are a solid match as a candidate for them.\n\nIf you get in to Santa Clara via ED you're going to be thrilled, right?  And you'll also have saved yourself months of work on other applications.  \n\nCongrats for going with what's right for *you*, I hope you get in!",

But he was deadset on going there, wanted a decision early, and the finances worked out, so he went with ED. Got in, goes there now and loves it. \n\nI'd bet the *average* person applying ED applies to a target/low reach. But you are also posting this on a prestige obsessed sub lol. All these Harvard EDs aren't super reflective of the average person.",
