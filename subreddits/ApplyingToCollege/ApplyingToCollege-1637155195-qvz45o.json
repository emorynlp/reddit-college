  "text": "ED\u2019d to Santa Clara because I\u2019ve been in love with the school since I visited. I probably could\u2019ve gone for a more \u201cprestigious\u201d college, but I\u2019m not a big believer in that. I wanna work in the Bay Area post grad and SCU has a huge presence there.\n\nI know a lot of people tend to ED at big reaches, but I was wondering if anyone (like myself) ED\u2019d to more of a target school. Thanks :)",
