      "text": "Agree 100% on the deadline being BS lol. I would say it depends on the nature of the issue. If you write about certain topics that have specific and easily accessible activities available it might be weird if you have no ECs related to it.\n\nFor instance, I wouldn't write about the environment unless I had a unique angle, or had the credentials to show it's an issue I *really* care about.\n\nOn the other hand, if I'm writing something about how mental health or something, having an activity related to it might be nice, but it's really more about personal experience and perspective.\n\nAlso, out of every college I'm applying to uncs supplements are the worst by far imo.",
