  "title:": "Dropping AP Psych due to teacher",
  "text": "Advice and help are needed. \n\nI'm taking AP Psychology this year and absolutely love the content of the class. However, for some unknown reason, the teacher has continuously dehumanized me, called me out in front of the class, and made me feel insignificant. I at first thought I was going crazy, but then multiple classmates have come up to me and expressed that she continues to pick on me. It has come to the point where I do not want to go to school anymore, much less enter her class. And it's definitely affecting my GPA. I know other students have dropped her class for similar reasons.\n\nMy mom is telling me to drop the class because she is worried that it is affecting my health. I'm willing to still take the exam and even take a credit recovery course at a local college or whatnot. \n\nIs that okay?  I have applied REA and EA to some colleges, and I don't want immediate rescinding. \n\nI seriously don't know what to do. And I'm terrified.",
