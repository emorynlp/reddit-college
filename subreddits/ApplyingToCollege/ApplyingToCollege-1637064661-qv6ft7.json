I don\u2019t think how this pre med works so can anyone enlighten me in this. \nIf I indicate pre med in app and change my mind after getting admitted I mean how this whole thing works ? \n\nI guess am late asking this question as I already sent few apps. But still doubtful in this. \nWill be really glad if someone helps.",
