  "text": "M,17, a bright student. I live in city X and during my HS years I wanted to go to a college in the same city to avoid the hassle of hostel life. I applied to college A, it is easily in the top 3 in my country for CS, but I wanted to go for engineering so I applied for their engineering program and got in, but now it's a decision I don't like. Turns out most people who are studying engineering here, came after being rejected from college B, that is in a different city Y. I knew college B was the top in engineering and I thought A would not be so frail in comparison, but everyone here at A calls themselves failures for not getting into B and this is making me feel like a failure too, I would have easily gotten into B, but as I mentioned I wanted to stay in the same city. I feel like I let go of an opportunity. Then there's a college C in my city, it is very very good but very expensive so only the elites go there. I applied there too and got in, but couldn't afford it and got rejected for financial assistance. \nTo summarize, I suffered financial rejection from C, never applied to B, and got into A, which is not at the top of the list in engineering and now I am completely hopeless.\n\n\n\nI have only three options now(what I can think):\n\n\n\n1- continue engineering at A\n\n\n2- Try to migrate to B after the first year at A(this is the policy), but transfers are very hard and even if my application gets accepted, I will have to pay a hefty migration fee, since B describes this as an 'unusual situation'. Also I would have to spend 1 year at a place where I don't want to be, feels like throwing one year of my life away.\n\n\n3- Transfer to CS in A(I made it to the merit list), but this would mean that I would be giving up engineering, I wouldn't say that engineering is my dream, but I always see myself as an engineer whenever thinking about the future. Transferring to CS in A would atleast make me feel successful, that hey I made it to one of the best CS college in my country\n\n4- advice from you guys?\n\n\n\nI feel lost, worthless, hopeless and a dumb kid. My life wasn't very good as it is, I suffer from my mild anxiety and now stuff might get even worse.\n\nEdit: CS and engineering are considered different in my country.",

      "text": "Both schools are top 3. How can you split hairs between the two? College decisions factor in more than just rankings. At college A, you won\u2019t have any more opportunities than you would have at college B\u2014it\u2019s up to you to use these opportunities, however.\n\nEdit: I just reread the post and it seems like CS is different from engineering at your school (they\u2019re typically the same in US). If you truly want to pursue CS, then try to transfer. Else, stay at A and take whatever opportunities you can.",

But I would always be at a disadvantage against engineering students from B and even C and I would never have the 'tag' of the best engineering colleges.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. It\u2019s easy to look back at decisions you\u2019ve made and regret them, especially when there is a lot of money involved. It sounds like you have buyers remorse. \n\nIt sounds like your goals when applying were to get into a good school and to stay in town X. You met both of those qualifications, you\u2019re not going into debt to go to college C, and you\u2019re going to be okay. \n\nSo what if college B is the absolute top school for engineering. College A is a good school and has a engineering program, which leads me to believe that their graduates do okay after graduation. Your classmates are disappointed about college B, that doesn\u2019t make them failures and it doesn\u2019t make you a failure either. Make the best of your situation as it is, look for the opportunities that sound good to you, and get involved with your program and campus. \n\n\n\nI had the option to go to the top private school in my state. I chose not to and went to a mid tier public school instead. There were a lot of reasons as to why, but it has not hindered my ability to learn, do well in school, or get a job. You\u2019re going to be okay friend!",
