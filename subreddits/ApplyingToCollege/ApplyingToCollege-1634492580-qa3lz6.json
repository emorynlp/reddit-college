  "title:": "How Can I Keep My Applications From Looking Sketchy?",
  "text": "My school situation is really weird. For my freshman, sophomore, and junior years, I was attending a small, private Christian school while taking some dual credit classes. Because of the COVID pandemic,  the school lost some of its teachers, causing them to offer fewer classes. If I continued to go there for my senior year, I'd literally have to retake classes because they ran out of classes to offer. I ended up switching to what would technically be called homeschool, but in reality, I'm taking all of my classes at my community college. I noticed that the Common App has a section for explaining why I left my old school, but I'm not really sure how my application will look with a high school for three years followed by homeschool with all community college classes. Particularly, I don't really know who I'm supposed to put down as my counselor. I have straight A's and a 35 on the ACT, so I feel like I should be able to still demonstrate academic strength if I fill out my application correctly, but I can't seem to figure out how to make my situation look less sketchy. Does anybody have any advice?",
