  "text": "With early decisions coming out soon, the stress level on this sub has spiked. People post stuff like this:\n\n>We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, jobs, etc for college and many of us...will go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try. We'll have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from T20s, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.\n\nThat got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.\n\nBut it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**\n\n# Scholarships\n\nThinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.\n\nYou might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35, when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.\n\n# Honors Programs\n\nAny state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:\n\n* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.\n* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.\n* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.\n* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.\n\n# Advanced Standing Opportunities\n\nYou know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take \"Intro to Physics\" as an English major.\n\nFor me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.\n\n# Resume and College ECs\n\nNo matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.\n\nThat stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen, or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.\n\nThat experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.\n\n# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.\n\nIf you don't believe me (understandable, I'm a high school junior; what do I know?) listen to [this guy at UCF who posted something along the same lines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ac881h/on_ending_up_in_the_same_place_as_someone_who_put/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) *Shoutout to* u/Vottle_of_Bodka *for pointing out this post.*",

I'm not too knowledgeable of CS so perhaps you could elucidate me on it however.\n\nOn the other hand, I do know about finance, and maybe it's my city but if you come from Columbia or come from a normal state school, they'll pay more attention to your internships, extracurriculars, and how you do in an interview rather than auto-hire based on university. It might be a Miami thing since here everyone is hispanic and is more respecting of the day-to-day hustle. However, having contacted lots of people in finance in south Florida who are doing extremely well, it seems that the general consensus is: your ability and devotion to reaching out to people, showing effort, and making connections that lands you any type of actual footing. \n\nSo I think this proves my point. Being the most likable person in the room and knowing all the heads of the industry is the same as being the son of a head of the industry. Equal footing in that regard.\n\nSure, more upper elites flock to these ivies and whatnot, but coming out of there for those who aren't in the top 1% economically won't let them succeed above the charismatic and more applied individual in finance who's called the bank's CEOs enough times they know when his lunch breaks are at this point.",

I went to a pretty good state school and one of my friends roommates said \u201conly Idiots go to (our school)\u201d And she acted as if she was better than everyone else even though we all went to the same school. Obviously she was just bummed out that she didn\u2019t get into a better school and was taking it out on herself and the people around her which caused no one to want to be around her and I heard she ended up failing a couple of classes because of her attitude. Anyway going to a really great school doesn\u2019t guarantee your success and going to a state school doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t be as successful as your peers who went to better schools. My moms best friend majored in engineering at Yale for undergrad and graduated with really good grades and got into Harvard for medical school and got good grades there too. She became a pediatrician but could not keep a job and has been unemployed for half a year. She lost her job because she has no social skills and isn\u2019t very good with children i expect this is because she spent her whole life pre graduation focusing on nothing but school. While my sister who partied all through high school and her state college then transferred to nursing school and graduated with a 4.0. She now is very successful as a nurse and is still able to party a lot during her free time. (She isn\u2019t happy either but for unrelated reasons). So it\u2019s really not the end of the world if you don\u2019t go to your dream school and don\u2019t take it out on the people around you if you don\u2019t.",

Nearly everyone around me had a pretty good education, but i got it in my head that I was a cut above most students.  I thought my intellect was superior.\n\nAfter my freshman year I got a personal letter sent to me by my Econ professor. He totally called me on my attitude (which was apparent to him from my behavior in his class).  He served up the biggest piece of humble pie for me to eat, basically made me understand that even if I should be at a \u201cbetter\u201d campus I was dead wrong if I thought I had nothing to learn from my peers.  And that man was 100% right. I opened my eyes.\n\nIn college, you will discover that the hard work and aptitude that got you those stellar high school grades are still very helpful, but people\u2019s natural gifts shine through more in college as academics get more specialized and ECs require more from participants.  High school valedictorians aren\u2019t going to be best at everything on campus.  High-achieving students who find themselves at a state school may find themselves \u201clapped\u201d in some courses and activities by fellow students they would have looked down in academically in high school.

More than likely, your university or state school is going to have a career fair during the fall semester. Even if you don\u2019t get any interviews its good for practicing how to talk to a recruiter and it will help you understand what kind of companies show up. \n\nIf you\u2019re doing something related to engineering, be sure to reach out to your professors to get an UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH POSITION. These look amazing on a resume and can teach you some useful software or hardware skills. The key is to be persistent and show up regularly to office hours. Make sure you ask them if they\u2019re looking for any undergraduate researchers and even if they aren\u2019t you can ask them if they know any other professors that are looking for undergrads.\n\nIf you\u2019re going more towards CS then be sure to work on personal projects and practice your coding skills by going to websites like elitecode or hackerrank. These websites provide you with a lot of practice problems that companies might ask during technical interviews.\n\nIn addition, be sure to look out for any TA positions that might open up in your classes. These are a good way to get recommendations for a job or graduate school and a good way to master basic skills in calculus, physics, CS, etc.\n\nI understand that Not every school is going to have the opportunities that \u201ctop\u201d schools have so another option is to transfer to a college of your choice.\n\nAnyways good luck to everybody!",

If some of you guys are like me where you think that you don\u2019t have any skills that you can apply to the research or you just don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough don\u2019t worry. Ive been there and it sucks but you have to be brave and make the first move to contact your professors via email or office hours and AT LEAST TRY to ask. Most professors are actually very nice and genuinely want their students to succeed even if they might be a hardass in class. \n\nAlso for internships make sure to apply to A LOT OF THEM. My friends and I have probably applied to AT LEAST 70 positions over the course of the fall and spring semesters. Remember that your first job is always the hardest to get. If you need advice go to r/jobs for some tips and motivation.",

This was me 1 year ago and long story short, I took many Ls and many Ws.\n\nHere are some concrete examples on your points:\n\n-\tYes, a state school will be able to afford to get you there. The university of Minnesota was able to make my education around 15k/yr. A private comparable school in Minnesota was able to make it about 10k. Either are much much cheaper than if I had made it into HYPSMC. \n-\tHonors college is a meh for me. It truly and honestly did nothing for me. I don\u2019t get advanced reg/advanced housing, but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a national policy. It\u2019s really your choice, but at the end of the day you get the same degree and the honors you receive would be based on Latin honors.\n-\tMost schools provide a career center and academic advising to all students as part of tuition. Regardless of where you go, you\u2019ll reap the internships and resume/interview prep if you take advantage of it.\n-\tAP/PSEO/CIS will 100% be taken easier in a state school. Though be careful, a lot of times it transfers in but doesn\u2019t cover the areas you need. For example, I brought in 70 PSEO credits and only about 40 were applied to my degree/gen eds with the rest being fluff credit.\n-\tThe rule of thumb for freshman resumes is that you can get away with putting senior year activities on there, but with preference to the new activities you become part of.",

Of course, everyone should check with theirs and make sure it's the right fit. \n\nAlso, that part about the freshman resumes is super good to know. Thanks for mentioning it.",

          "text": "To be honest, I'm a junior in high school so I can't say I know much, but here's what I personally think. Take it with a grain of salt. \n\nTransitioning from one school to another might impact your GPA in a negative way, particularly if you're transferring to a T20. They may have taught different things in the intro classes, etc, and those little incongruencies could get you tripped up. GPA is pretty important for law school, so if you've got a good thing going, why ruin it? \n\nBut here's my bigger concern: ECs. If you've been at a school for two years, you've probably gotten quite involved on campus. You'll be able to take positions of power your junior and senior years, and you'll have a tangible impact on the area. If you transfer, you're starting completely anew and basically wiping your shot at getting leadership. It's really hard to rebuild ECs at a new school, and that's going to be a big deal for whatever law school you're applying to. \n\nFinally, I'd think about LORs. Since you're already at this school and you seem to be doing well, your mentors will probably be more enthusiastic about you and your success, and thus willing to write you stronger LORs. In a new school, you'll be newer and you won't stick out as much. That'll make it hard to form close relationships for those recommendations, which are pretty important. \n\nOverall, I'd say stick around at your school and keep grinding. The admission rates may be better for the other undergrad school, but maybe that's correlation over causation. Perhaps students of a caliber as high as yours are more common at the undergrad school, so they get in more, but you stand an equally good shot.",

There\u2019s nothing *wrong* with going to a state school and for many people it\u2019s probably the better choice, but if you have a chance at one of those prestigious universities and you\u2019re willing to put in even more work and effort than what you already have, I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t want it.",

                  "text": "I understand why you'd want to attend a prestigious university, but the point I'm trying to make with this post is that there are opportunities and resources available at all schools. Remember that the budget isn't distributed evenly at all schools, particularly not state schools. Many will pour cash down the throats of their top students for them to pursue their dreams. I know people who got the college to fully fund their unpaid internships. I know people who got to do paid research under top professors at the state school over the summer and got their names on publications. Maybe that's available at T20s too, but my point is, you can find opportunity anywhere. \n\nIn terms of faculty, most T20s have bigger classes and you don't build a personalized relationship with the professor. You're just another face in the crowd. State schools may be big, but being a clear top student there means close relationships with professors and honestly, better opportunities.\n\nAs for the name of the school, I won't deny that that's a bump. But you can't ride on the name of a top school. Similarly, success at state schools means you can build a name for yourself and an impressive resume that's worth more than the name of some Ivy. I'd also argue that state schools have pretty impressive networks if you don't mind staying local, and for bigger schools (UCs, UMich, etc) they have national networks.",
