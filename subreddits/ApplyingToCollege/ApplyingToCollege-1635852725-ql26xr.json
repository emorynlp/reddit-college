  "text": "Bit of a rant. I applied to Pepperdine early action yesterday (yes ik it was cutting it close). I finally finished the supplemental and submitted it through common app. Pressed the celebrate button 5 times and went to bed feeing fine, with 3 hours to spare. Then I wake up today and find an email from Pepperdine giving me a username and password to a separate account to finish the damn application. Why tf isn\u2019t it just through common app? Now I only have regular decision. I never saw anything listed saying this. Am I the only one??",
