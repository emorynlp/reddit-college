  "title:": "After a stressful season of applications, I've withdrawn all of them and I'm not going to college",
  "text": "Its kinda click baity but its true. I withdrew my applications to every college I submitted an application to. I decided to enlist in the Air Force instead. I swore into the Delayed Entry Program just before Christmas and I've never been happier.\n\nWhy did I decide to forego college? Its not because I couldn't go anywhere or because the military was a last resort option. I have good stats (33 ACT, 3.87 GPA, strong ECs, and several prestigious awards). It wasn't because I couldn't afford college (between savings, scholarships, financial aid, and half of a GI Bill, I could've paid for college with minimal debt.\n\nI enlisted because I really wanted to. I haven't booked a specific job yet, but hopefully I'll end up in an Aircrew or Intelligence job. I am going to complete my Bachelor's on Uncle Sam's dime (thank you to all of you who pay taxes, its appreciated) and then get a Master's degree paid for by my GI Bill once I get out of the military. I can do all of that in about the same amount of time that it would take to finish six years of university (BA and MA) level education.\n\nI'll be 19 years old making a decent salary with no debt and very few living expenses, complete health care, amazing opportunities, guaranteed college tuition support, and probably a Top Secret clearance. \n\nSo I urge you, if someone you know decides to forego college entirely and forge their own path, military or otherwise, support them. Don't tell them they're throwing their future away. Don't say \"But you have so much potential.\" I'm excited about my future and the opportunity to get a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a career opportunity debt-free. I'm not throwing my future away, I'm taking a while to do what I love and reap the maximum possible benefits from it and hopefully come out ahead.\n\nBest of luck to all of you as you select your colleges and finish your apps. I love you guys and I want the world for you.\n\nBye for now \u270c\ufe0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So a lot of people seem to think that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid. I'm not. I was born on an Air Force base and I've spent the last 18 years moving 13 times, seeing my dad go on numerous deployments and too many TDYs to count. I know it takes a toll on families (my parents are now divorced) and I know its not an idyllic patriotic heaven of all benefit and no pain. It sucks sometimes. That's okay. I know what I'm getting myself into. I'm also not getting screwed over by my recruiter. My dad used to do recruiting and has helped me cut through the BS and really get what I want. I'm gonna be okay.",

Good luck to you.\n\nEdit: you're\\*\n\nEdit 2: For the love of god, Invest like 5% of your paycheck in TSP from day 1, including in boot camp, don't do the Montgomery GI bill over Post 9/11, call TSP after boot camp and switch your funds out of the G-Fund to more risky stuff and literally save as much as your money as possible. Rant over, lol. ALSO, if you decide to a stem degree, you can apply to extend for another 9 months of the Post 9/11 due to the Forever Gi-bill act. Super worth it imo, though I'm not entirely sure how that works since I haven't done it yet so maybe take that with a grain of salt. Okay now rant really over.",

The reason I bring it up is cause they kind of goad you into signing the mgi papers in bootcamp and then that means they take 50 bucks out of your paycheck for the first year in when you can just opt in later when you want, and you aren't out 1200 dollars unless you want to be.",

Your unit will specifically ban you from using that health care.

Without the gi bill there would be an extreme manpower shortage lmao. \n\nTuition assistance while inside though is complete garbage. If you have a job that isn't a complete skate fest you'll be ever be able to use it, ever. That and they keep threating to cut tuition every so often and they can kill it anytime they want. Just a matter of time before they do.\n\nHonestly it sounds like you swallowed all of the bait that a military recruiter has told you. Literally nothing a military recruiter says to you should be believed, ever. You're about to get a hard reality check. Military is garbage, that's why there's only a 5% reenlistment rate for first time contracts.\n\n Fuck the marine corps.\n\nEdit: also top secret clearances aren't that big a deal, everyone gets one.

Great to know. Glad to hear that terrorists and food are why we must continue to intervene in countries like Venezuela and Cuba and Bolivia. We must continue to spend $700 billion on this organization and increase that number year after year (while ~10% of our nation's bridges are in immediate need of repair and families bankrupt themselves trying to get treatment for illnesses).
