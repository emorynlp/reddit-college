      "text": "Oh hey!   \n\n\nI actually mislabelled one of my teachers as social science instead of science :(  \nBut mailing the common app support team works in most cases. You can ask them and they might be willing to rectify it! Maybe ask your teacher to send the mail so it's more formal that way.   \n\n\nAnother option is if your teacher has an alternate email address, that would work too!   \n\n\n\\[General Disclaimer : Just something I observed, perhaps you should wait for more qualified people :D \\]",
