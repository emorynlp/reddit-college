  "text": "For the context of how I am using it goes a little something like this: \n\n\" So I applied and made it into the \\[College Name\\] Computer Science Summer Program, where I learned practical programming and problem-solving skills. .. blah blah\"\n\nI'm a bit unsure if naming the university is a good idea since I've heard it's not received very well. Does it come off as bragging? Like I don't want to go to any other place? or is it fine? \n\nI'm applying to many other unis including the one I mentioned.",
