  "text": "My counselor submitted my UC app without my knowledge (I had everything inputted but by no means was I ready; I wanted to rewrite my essays.) it\u2019s all I can think about now and I genuinely feel like I can\u2019t get in with those essays.\n\nThey\u2019re good essays, but maybe not the best PIQs. I didn\u2019t treat them like job interview questions but rather there was some creative writing and a short anecdote. Fuck. I wanna cry. I wish I could travel back in time.",
