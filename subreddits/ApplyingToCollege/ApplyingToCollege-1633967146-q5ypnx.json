  "text": "Hey Guys, I got a question. \n\nSuppose there's who who has some pretty good EC (leadership positions in like 2-3 clubs, getting good grades in college classes which are paid, two internship and volunteer services), which were all done in the span of 2020-2021, with most being in 2021. In comparison to that, another's EC's are also pretty fire (two internships, alot of community service in India, and here in the states, and some other stuff), but they were done in the span of 2017-2021. Which would look better on college apps?",
