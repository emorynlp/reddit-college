After schools had made their decisions but before students accepted. ~20% of students opted to take a gap year, leaving those spots suddenly empty. Schools had no choice but to massively accept students off the WL to fill those slots. It led to madness where my 2020 students got into 60% + of their WL options. The UCs were like 80%. \n\nThis year, instead, schools overcorrected and like tripled their WL numbers. But this year there isn\u2019t a (new) pandemic and students seem to be accepting at a normal rate. \n\nEnd result is WL ain\u2019t paying out for shit this year. Sorry.",

The angriest. \n\nStatistically, only one of those memories will hold up as the most in your life because you\u2019ve only lived ~1/5 of your life. Aging gives your experience but it\u2019s more it gives you perspective. I had a rough time as a teen. Bad depression. But in my 20s I had my life completely fall apart due to chronic pain and illness. That sucked so unbelievably bad that it has put both my teen life and present life in perspective. It\u2019s really hard for me to get that upset about things these days, not because they aren\u2019t hard but because I have such a life event to compare them to. That whole \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u201d shit is true. What concerns me so much is knowing that too often teens let hard times kill them.",

That's why AOs tend to stress you pursue subjects you're actually inteterested in. Before seeing the overachievers here I had no idea there was a high school experience that could be more fulfilling than just doing schoolwork and then doing basically nothing at home.",

Just that without even realising it, getting too involved on this sub too early can have some detrimental effects on some people\u2019s mental health :\u2019)\n\nHope everything works out for you <3",
