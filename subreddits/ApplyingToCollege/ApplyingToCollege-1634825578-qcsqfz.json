Up to you. If you have a good number of ECs I would consider leaving it out. An alternative is to contact the internship and ask about the role and its responsibilities should you continue this fall/winter/spring. You say it\u2019s still open. Did it have to be an on-site gig or something?\u2026 Is that why you had no interaction at all? If you started up would you actually be doing work or just sit in a holding period again (if that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening so far)?",

Admissions like to see \u201cwide\u201d kids. They\u2019ve realized that focusing on narrow specialized kids wasn\u2019t actually a good thing and probably cultivated the wrong kind of student overall (let alone hamstringing kids from having a broader perspective and experience). They want to know more about you outside of school or the field. Anything and everything else helps.",
