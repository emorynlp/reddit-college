      "text": "No, you don't change your change your school in India \"in most cases\" - don't generalized these things.\n\nYou didn't mention why your school isn't giving you your predicted scores. What about 12th midterm grades? Most colleges would prefer to see your midterm grades than your predicted scores, and many students apply early without either of these.\n\nAs for your Grade 11 transcripts, they might be fine if they're consistent with your other transcripts.",
