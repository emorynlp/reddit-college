  "title:": "Will my application be counted late if my mailed transcript doesn\u2019t get there in time?",
  "text": "(Early action for the place I\u2019m applying to is due by November 1st). I already have some college credits, and one of the colleges sent my official transcripts to me by mail. If I send them to the Office of Admissions and they arrive after November 1st, but my online application was on time, will they be considered with my application or will my application as a whole be counted as late? The college is in state so I hope it would mail quickly but I\u2019m also not sure if I should mail the transcript before I\u2019ve submitted my application, so it would get there on time?\n\n(looking forward to when applying to college is over, so stressful :( )",

If it goes through you, it will surely need to be in a sealed, unopened envelope.",
