I am so happy that I don't need to write another essay or describe my ECs in a flowery way.\nI'll probably apply to grad school but at least that's more subject focused, the way I like it.",

That went for 10th grade, and this year due to covid we\u2019ve switched the schedule to start at 8:30 with zero period being eliminated. \n\nAnd from next year onward apparently it\u2019s going to be a California law that no high school can start before 8:30am. Sounds fun lol, I\u2019m gonna have to be at school till nearly 4pm though which sucks.",

It really doesn't matter as much as you think and everyone is so swept up in it that you end up spending a good chunk of your senior year applying to like 4 Ivies even though you have less than a 5% chance of getting in and have to pay exorbitant fees to go there anyway. \n\nB. Just... do more stuff. High school was a lot easier than I ever realized, and I could've done a lot more, explored a lot of new hobbies. Sometimes I regret stuff like not applying for the graduation speaker role even though I know I might've had a chance. High school should really be about... having fun, making friends, taking on new experiences. Not a constant grind.",

My life is fine now -- I know people say that \"it doesn't matter\" where you go to undergrad, which I think is somewhat true, but I still regret failing to get into the colleges I actually wanted to. For me:\n\n-Less focus on academics, more focus on extracurriculars. My GPA was great, but I had no hook, so it would be about doing stuff to \"make up a hook\" (Read: Play the game better = \"BS better\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-More focus on my application itself. Now that I'm an adult having sat through the other side of the admissions process, I can say with certainty that Jimmy and Jane 3.0s and John and Jill 4.0s blur all together. I didn't completely discount my essays, but I now realize there's a lot more value of it since \"it's your only shot\" to say something outside of your raw stats.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-Look into unwritten rules more. Maybe I was naive, but I had no idea that things like your race could HURT you. I'm not here to get into a debate about that, but it's more about being more cognizant about declaring/not declaring race and making conscious choices on your application to that effect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis sub is fascinating and terrifying to me though.",
