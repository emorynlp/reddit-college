  "text": "My school doesnt rank and if they did I'd be like number 1 or 2 and I'm mad about it bruh. Bc I'm taking ap lang and I might end up with a b in it this semester (grade deflating boomer teacher no one has an a in his class) and i dont know if my final gpa will be above 3.9UW, so I was hoping rank would help but we dont rank \ud83d\ude43 and we dont do weighted either",

If you\u2018re 1 or 2, these data points should make it obvious.\n\nFoe example, my daughter has a 5.08 weighted in the school\u2019s goofy weighting system. It doesn\u2019t rank, so no one would know where a 5.08 falls. Until they look at the profile and see a 5.08 is the top weighted GPA.",
