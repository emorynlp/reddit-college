  "text": "My seminar teacher this semester is extremely hard for no reason. I literally want to die because of his class. He's extremely harsh compared to all the other teachers, and the stuff he teaches isn't even that amazing, like it would make sense if he is a good teacher + harsh but harsh + not so great teacher is pointless. I had A's in all my English classes since 9th grade but this year Im afraid its going to be lower than an A-, dropping my GPA significantly. I'm applying ED so my college will ask for midyear report and Im nervous out of my mind. Wtf do I do!",

      "text": "A B- is a fine score. Having one or even a couple is fine. As long as your course load is reasonably rigorous and your GPA is mostly As your fine. This is especially true if everyone is getting a B in that class. \n\nAs for my experience, I submitted two Bs, mostly rigerous courses at my school( a few kids had more APS), and had some success with acceptances).",
