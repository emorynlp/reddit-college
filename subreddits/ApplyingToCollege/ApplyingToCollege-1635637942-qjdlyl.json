  "text": "My teacher finished their rec letter this morning but it requires my school counselor to approve and he is well known for not doing anything during non-school hours so he\u2019ll probably approve it on Monday which scares me because it\u2019s after ED deadline. \n\nI researched the schools I\u2019m applying to and they should still accept my application but I\u2019m really nervous that it could reflect on me negatively. I emailed him and he expectedly has not responded yet but I\u2019m just so aghhh.",
