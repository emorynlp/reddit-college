  "text": "i'm currently a soph in hs rn, and the only advanced classes i'm taking rn are honors alg 2/trig and ap world history. tbh, i'm not doing very well and i feel that i'll learn more and be less stressed out if i take regents (like state level) classes instead next year. however, my school is a high-achieving school that offers a lot of APs and honors classes, how would it look if i don't take any of them?\n\ni was originally going to aim for 5 aps in total, after taking one this year, i don't think i can handle more than one next year too :/",

      "text": "It really depends on where you want to go to college. If you are aiming for Top 25 and/or UCs above UC Riverside, you\u2019ll have to take enough AP since they get your school report and know what\u2019s offered. Course rigor plays into the admissions review. What you have right now is fine. If you took 1-2 AP classes a year and do well in all classes and have a well-rounded app, you have a shot at many great schools. Without a hook like a recruited athlete, etc., it\u2019ll be tough for T25 schools so make sure to manage your expectation.",
