  "text": "In 2020, I had to leave a really good college because I wasn't doing too well physically or mentally. I have a weak immune system and lung issues, and I thought I could tough out the semester. But, I didn't take into account the mental drain being 900 miles away from home in the middle of a pandemic without a vaccine could cause. Since I left that school, I've been able to take care of myself, my health, and my dogs. I was also able to get a vaccine, which made me much more confident in being around people and going to in person classes. I still need a bit of time to finish prior obligations, but other than that I want to return to school in the fall of '22.\n\nPart of returning to normalcy for me began with taking classes at my local community college. I ended up signing up for a few courses, but a few hours after signing up, I heard the worst possible news: my dog was going to have to be put down. I have a really strong sensitivity towards animals, and I've had this dog since I was six. I didn't have any siblings growing up, I moved houses a lot, and I found it hard to make friends, which is why I bonded with my animals so much. I'm an art student, and animals feature heavily in my work because of these reasons. I signed up for the class the *day* my dog died, about maybe five hours before she passed. I struggled so much, and ended up missing the drop out date because I really thought I could pull through, and I was encouraged to do so. This ended with me getting a withdrawal while failing.\n\nCurrently my goal is to return to either my previous school, or go to a school I was previously accepted in. In 2019, I was accepted into one of the best art schools in my country, and I'm nervous that because I took some time off in 2020 and 2021, and got one awful grade, colleges are going to look down on me. The other courses I'm taking I'm doing great in, I'm getting As and Bs. I got As and Bs for most of my high school career. In 2021, took time off to to improve my art portfolio, I ended up getting a job, and I went to counseling.\n\nI really need advice, I'm in the US and I'm scared that because I got this withdrawal while failing because I signed up for a class I didn't even want to take the day my dog passed, I'll be turned away from colleges I was previously accepted in.",

      "text": "I'm sorry to hear about your dog. That sucks...\n\nWhere would this come up, if you don't mind me asking? Do you need to reapply?\n\nIf so, this can be addressed in one of the admissions essays. If you specifically focus on how you grew from this and what you learned, it can really make your candidacy stronger.",
