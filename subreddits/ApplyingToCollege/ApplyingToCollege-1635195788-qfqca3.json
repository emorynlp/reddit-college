I can speak, read, and write it (I take it in school) but not on the level of a fluent speaker i.e. I can live in France but I\u2019ll be confused sometimes. Additionally, I can\u2019t really engage in more technical conversations. \n\nI\u2019m a U.S.-France dual citizen so I feel like it would look bad if I\u2019m not proficient in French.",
