  "text": "To give some personal context, I applied to 10 schools early. One school ED and the rest were EA obviously. \n\nI'm planning to apply to roughly 8 more colleges regular decision. I've already started writing/outlining the supplements. \n\nI've applied to 4 safety schools, 2 targets and the rest are basically reaches \n\nApplicants who have taken this approach, did it work out? Would you recommend applying to a lot of schools or not?\n\nMy logic in applying to schools is that college admissions is super random. So my hope is that if I apply to a lot of top schools, I'll probably get rejected from most of them, but I'll get into 1 or 2.",

I felt like being productive but didnt feel like making progress in my big apps like USC or NYU so what i would do instead is go hunting for a school that has my major, do a quick look into if it has one of the three things i was interested in for a school (big student body, beautiful campus, or in a big city), and then add it to my common app and naviance list and grind out my application in about an hour to two hours. i added pepperdine at about 2am and finished by 2:30. honestly i dont regret it at all because since i did ea to basically all of them that will let me and i got a fee waiver i just now get to watch the decisions roll in. its nice to know i will have a few options rather then be stuck with a school i may not want to go to.",
