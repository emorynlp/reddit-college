  "text": "So I was getting ready to put some of my brown supplemental essays into the Common app. One of the ones I have completely finished is a 150 word essay about an extracurricular that you do, so I was looking for where to put it in the common app. It's not in the main questions section of Brown's common app page, but two guides for Brown supplementals (that are up to date for 2021-2022) mention it ([https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/brown-university-2021-22-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/](https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/brown-university-2021-22-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/) [https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/brown-supplemental-essays#F](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/brown-supplemental-essays#F)). One guide says that the prompt is in the activities section, but the only thing I see there is a place to submit an online link, not a space to fill in an essay. Is anyone else applying to Brown and/or more experienced with the common app than me able to tell me where to submit this?  Or are those sources wrong and I wrote an extra essay for no reason?",
