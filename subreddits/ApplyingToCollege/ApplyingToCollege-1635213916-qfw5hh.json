  "text": "On the common app, it asks which courses you are taking this year and plan to take this year. Since its only first semester, I put down a dual enrollment course which I plan to take second semester. However, due to my schedule getting moved around, I don't think I will be able to take that course, but i already included it on my application? \n\nWill it be a big deal if my final transcript doesn't have the course which I listed under \"recent courses\"?",
