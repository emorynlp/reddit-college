  "text": "So as you know the PSAT is happening right now, and I should be here taking it right now. But I'm not. And it was because of the wildest thing that happened last night. \n\nFor some context, we live in a residential school where we stay the week. Last night we were all preparing mentally for the PSAT. Everyone was quite stressed. Then all of a sudden, **the fire alarm goes off**. There was a fire on our floor. We exit the building at like 10:00 pm and are outside for an hour until the firefighters clear everything. We go back inside at 11 and finally go to bed. \n\nFast forward early this morning, we wake up to a loud intercom at 5 am that announces \"**Everyone to the basement RIGHT NOW! There is a tornado warning and a tornado on the ground!\"** We all hear the tornado sirens going off and grab all our essentials and run downstairs. We are there until 5:45 am and finally go back upstairs, getting ready for the PSAT in two hours. We all get our stuff ready, waiting to start the PSAT exam, and then our counselor tells us that our exam is canceled and postponed to the 26th. \n\nI sorta wanted to get the exam over with, and the stress is now going to carry over, but yeah that's a story I wanted to say. \n\nWould you say there are any upsides to taking the exam later that could sorta cheer me up? Thank lol. \n\nAnyways storytime over :)",

      "text": "Oh my god that's crazy?? Good luck with your PSAT! Clich\u00e9, but my advice is to use your extra time to sleep well the night (or three) before you take the exam! Overpreparing for the PSAT in particular was an issue for me because I think the content was simpler than I had anticipated, so I think my brain was overthinking and second-guessing during every question and that slowed me down and gave me more room for mistakes. \n\nAnd remember that your PSAT score isn't necessarily an indicator of what your SAT will be! I took the SAT the August of my junior year then took the PSAT two months later and got 110 points lower (they're different grading scales, but i think my point still stands).",

      "text": "So glad that your school didn't make you take the PSAT after two disasters! The reading section is hard enough to focus on as is, and I can't imagine trying to comprehend those articles while thinking about fires and tornados (or worse, what if one article was about natural disasters?). Get some rest and use the extra study time to your advantage!",
