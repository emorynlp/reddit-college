  "text": "toxic household check\ud83e\udd2a. But fr, I miss the hours between when school ended and and my parents got home from work where I could just be alone. I also really miss driving/riding the bus and having a hot sec to myself. Even though most of the time I\u2019m on zoom and my parents are doing their own thing working from home it\u2019s really stifling. Idek what I\u2019ll do if I have to stay home for college next year\n\n\nEdit: WOW I didn\u2019t expect the sheer number of people able to relate. I\u2019m sorry so many of you guys are also having a tough time right now. This too will pass!\n\nAlso, everyone is being incredibly nice and offering really good suggestions about ways to get a brief reprieve from my household. thank you\u2764\ufe0f",

You could also try walking if running is too much for you (or run and walk if you want to try to get fit but can\u2019t run for very long). Hopefully we can get out and see people soon though :c",

I started going on walks by myself and it made me feel so much better to just finally be ALONE. \n\nplus it was good exercise, which has benefits for you mentally and physically, but sometimes even just walking without a purpose can be good for your mind as well, there\u2019s only 3 people in the house now so I don\u2019t walk as much, but it definitely helped me feel less crazy",

      "text": "I\u2019m in the same situation. I was in a college fair meet on zoom, but my school doesn\u2019t use zoom, so I have no clue how to mute my mic and everything, so I told them they had to be really really quiet, and they come in half way through the first meet, screaming at me about how I\u2019ve been on the computer long enough. They do this during classes too. In my physics class, we draw diagrams, and I love drawing, so I like to go all out and have fun with it, and they come in saying I need to be in class, and not drawing. They don\u2019t dare ask what I\u2019m doing, and when I try to correct them, they tell me not to talk back to them.\n\nI miss when I could have friends over and they\u2019d act like angels. I miss when I could walk home, I miss when I could stay at friends houses. COVID has really opened my eyes to how toxic this house is.",

Big deal /s. All i care about is getting into college i could care less about the graduation. You cant tell me with a straight face that high school make you wanna die half the time. School starting early as hell. Assholes in school. Tachers you didnt like. Classes youre only taking because theyre graduation requirements and/or colleges want them. The fucking sats/acts. Quarantine was a breath of fresh air from all that chaos for me. Downvote me if you want but deep down you all know im right.",

I by no means was expecting anything great from senior year, but it does suck to have all the small freedoms I\u2019d gotten used to in the past couple of years be stripped away, although ofc I do understand why it has to happen. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to an overpriced prom or partying or anything, but it would\u2019ve been nice to be able to do basic things like go out and get boba w friends after class, or drive home from school alone and blast whatever music I want \ud83d\ude0c",
