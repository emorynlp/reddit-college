  "text": "So when my SAT scores come out on the 19th, if I get a good score, which I hope to God I do, then I will submit my application then send my scores. Then, I need to ask my guidance counselor to check my fee waivers and send them out. How long does those 2 usually take? Also, when my guidance counselor sends my fee waiver requests, what exactly happens? Am I supposed to send fee waivers before submitting the common app orrrrr??? I'm just confused. Once the colleges get the fee waivers and accepts it does that mean I'm cleared? How will I know if they decline it?",
