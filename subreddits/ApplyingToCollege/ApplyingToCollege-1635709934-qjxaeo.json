      "text": "My sense is that a lack of rigor (\\*) is disqualifying at top schools.\n\n(\\*) Relative to what is available at a given student's school.\n\nThat is, if your school offers a bunch of AP classes and you take none of them but get a 4.0 in the classes you *did* take, you're probably not getting into any of the most selective few schools.\n\nAn open question is how schools compare the 4.0 guy from a school that doesn't offer APs (or that claims \"all of our classes are weighted\"; some private schools do this) vs. the guy with less than a 4.0 who took a ton of weighted classes at a school that has both weighted and non.\n\nStrongly suspect the latter guy gets a break.  The question is \"how much of a break?\"  Nobody knows for sure.",

          "text": "I'm that first kid. I go to a school that offers honors every year, but the ones that only count towards weighted are junior and senior year. I have most demanding rigor on my application - but it's really a joke. I don't think I've been challenged at all taking honors, it's just a bit of extra work. My school doesn't offer AP classes or exams because \"they don't believe in it.\" I definetly think the latter guy should get a break - they probably doesn't have nearly as much free time to explore activities as I do (and I still haven't done much with that time lol), but as my school says when I confronted them about your very question, they answered \"they can only compare you to kids at our school.\" \n\nWe haven't sent any kids to Ivies for years, but that is also probably because most students are not qualified test score wise either.",
