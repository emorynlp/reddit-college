  "text": "Would it be a good idea for my personal essay to write about this summer camp I work at and went to as a kid? It\u2019s really important to me and I love it so much there but I don\u2019t know if AOs will look down on it or something because I get paid to do it (although we only get paid like $250 for each whole week of supervising children). I just don\u2019t know what else to write about because I don\u2019t really have any \u201clife-defining moments\u201d or ECs that I really care about",

The topic has the possibility to sound trite if you only talk about how it taught you hard work/leadership/whatever, but it being paid is fine (although I'm not sure if you should mention it was paid for the sole reason that it'd be distracting to the essay)",
