  "text": "There's a lot of memes regarding ivy admission, such as donating a building or having a million-dollar business at the age of 16 but does/should a typical ivy applicant to have for a good chance at admission?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssuming you have a 4.0 unweighted(also how do you calculate your gpa for ivies if you are on a 5 point scale), what more would you need to do to be on par if not better than the average pool in terms of EC's and other factors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, how significant is having a good SAT/ACT score(haven't had a chance to get a good run/score due the COVID) for test-optional schools if you have taken college-level classes in such subjects(ex. for me I have taken Calc+STAT, 3 levels of ENG, CHM(although BIO and CHM2 spring), 2 HIS, 3 other sciences, and a couple of other ones  at my school but I did a couple of online college courses too)",

I only knew 3 classmates who were interested in the overseas uni process (harvard, oxford, CMU). I was a TERRIBLE student all throughout IP, so I didn't qualify for any of the specialized programs in Y5 (no cca in y3-4 to mug that kind of terrible). But yeah, I regret not taking H3 even though I qualified. Makes my academic chops extremely dubious because so many people applying ran a 86 in y5 and 90 predicted lol\n\nIf you apply, I feel initiative/leadership isn't that difficult to portray. I had exactly zero conventional leadership roles in Y5-6 (dumb and edgy), but when I was looking over my EC list I honestly think it's alright haha. Not anything groundbreaking, but better than I thought wrt. displaying initiative.\n\nDon't worry about NUS law! Think 87.5 and above gives yall a great shot at it",

Lowest score I know of is 1540 and that was under extenuating circumstances. Yeah, 1570-1600 quite common.\n* Smart quirky kids. Ranges anywhere from \\~1500 to 1600. But if they score lower than 1540, will probably retake for a higher score (and take it seriously). This crowd has the best admissions results IMO.\n* Humanities buffs. I don't know people from this group, but I'd expect a stellar EBRW to carry, so probably 1550+?",

      "text": "Two questions:\n\nWhy are you focusing on the average (unhooked) Ivy applicant rather than the average Ivy admit?  Anyone can apply. \n\nWhich Ivies specifically?  There are gradations of admissions stats/qualitative things when you move from HYP to Columbia/Penn to Brown/Dartmouth to Cornell. The \u201cfurther down\u201d you go the more blurry the lines. \n\nAnd one comment:  your best benchmark are students in prior classes and the closest peer schools your HS has in your area in terms of SES, course offerings, and setting. You know them and their relative strengths/weaknesses best. And everyone\u2019s HS setting/competitive ecosystem is different. In a suburban HS in a metro that isn\u2019t super high income/educated/talent magnet, a slightly above middle of the road for a suburban HS in that area may see the following: \n\n4 in a class of 400 have any sort of reasonable shot at HYPSM admission. \n\nAnother 8-10 out of 400 could get into a Cornell, NU, Vandy to a bit more selective. \n\nThey probably have the highest test scores. They probably are at the top of the class. But there are always a couple that you know are \u201csmarter/different/more mature\u201d than peers that rank ahead of them. So maybe they\u2019re only 16th out if 400 but the 7th best candidate in your class. \n\nThat\u2019s one general category of school in one general setting. \n\nIn another setting the list of prospects could be one fourth as deep. Or it could be four times as deep.",
