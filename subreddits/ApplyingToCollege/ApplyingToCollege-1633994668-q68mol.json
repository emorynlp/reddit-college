  "text": "My mother only works and she making around less than 26k a year. She has me n other sibling, would this be considered low income for Fasfa? I have 11k saved in my account because of buying a car? What should I do? To lower the efc or get more Aid bc I feel like this sucks when i know if I go 4 years it\u2019s going to cost 10s of thousands. Advice on what I should do? Should I just submit it with all the info or should I buy a car first then submit it? Would it be too late if I submit it in late October or November?",

You can run the calculator with different scenarios to see if your results are any different.\n\nSometimes Net Price Calculators are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.\n\nKeep in mind that many colleges require other financial aid forms in addition to FAFSA, such as the CSS Profile. Many colleges also require info on noncustodial parent income and assets.",
