  "text": "I completed my REA application on October 30, and had my counselor submit her recommendation, school profile and transcripts on the Common App. However now that I\u2019m working on apps for all my other schools (which were all already added on my CommonApp under the RD timeline), I\u2019m noticing that counselor materials all appear to have been \u201csubmitted\u201d. Does that mean that my counselor can\u2019t make changes anymore? What if I remove some schools from my list?",

It does not matter if you don't complete applications to those schools.\n\nMy understanding is that once school docs are submitted, your counselor cannot make changes but will have an opportunity to provide an update with the Mid Year report.",
