  "text": "hey y\u2019all so i\u2019m in a dilemma (kind of\u2026?)\n\n\ni\u2019ve always been a straight A student (and a student who generally gets A\u2019s and B\u2019s) when it came to math. no matter what, i always finished with an A in my math classes.\n\nuntil i took calculus bc.\n\nthe first test humbled me so bad, i failed it. i passed the second test (with flying colors, thank God), and then failed the third one.\n\nnow i have a 74 in the class. i\u2019m super worried esp with this college application stuff. it\u2019s my only C EVER and i\u2019m super worried it may get me rescinded. \n\nshould i drop to ab or should i try to get a B in the class? idk\u2026",

It used to be a C+ but I just put in some work focused work and managed to get it from a 78 to an 82 in 2 weeks, and my goal is <85 before college applications are due.\n\nI hope you\u2019re still in the class, I really think u should stick with it. A lot of colleges prefer seeing u take harder courses and get a semi-bad grade than take easy courses and get all As. It makes you more human.\n\nThat being said, with a little bit of dedicated work and practice I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do really well",
