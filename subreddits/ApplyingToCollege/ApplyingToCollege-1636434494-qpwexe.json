  "text": "When I log into University of Arizona portal, it says Awaiting status for all my transcripts (1 high school, and 3 community colleges / dual enrollment). I checked with my counselor that my high school transcript was sent and I also sent community college transcripts as well. (All the other schools are find; they have received my transcripts). The portal says to \"please see our status definitions below\", but it's not very helpful because I don't see any definitions nor details about this status. \n\nAnyone having the same issue or know what's going on?\n\nScreenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/quli9Gj](https://imgur.com/a/quli9Gj)",
