  "text": "I submitted my ED a couple of days ago to Dartmouth as well as EA to a couple of other places, and I saw yesterday that I had made a mistake on my Resume. The start month for one of my ECs was 6 months later than when I actually started it. I need to correct it because that activity is pretty important to the rest of my profile and I did it for about a year but now it shows it as just 6 months. \n\nI know I have to email the schools, but what do I say? Do I attach some sort of proof? Does this affect my chances? Please help!",
