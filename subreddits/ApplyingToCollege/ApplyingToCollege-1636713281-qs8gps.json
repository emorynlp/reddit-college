The census classification system makes no sense and minimizes hundreds of millions of people into single categories.\n\nThe best way to classify Middle Easterners would be as Asians, but that doesn't make a ton of sense because Mohammed bin Salman, Najib Mikati (the PM of Lebanon), Narendra Modi, and Fumio Kishida don't look similar at all.",
