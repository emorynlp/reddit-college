  "text": "I have everything ready except for my counselor recommendation. Is the counselor recommendation due by the regular deadline or the document deadline? Can she submit my transcript and then submit the recommendation later? Some schools I'm applying to \\*demand\\* a rec letter from my counselor, even though Gtech does not, so if i submit to georgia tech sans letter of recommendation, can my counselor add it for my RD applications?",
