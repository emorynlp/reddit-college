  "text": "\nThis might not be a related topic but I am really curious about small scholarships (500$-2000$) on Niche, Bold,\u2026 Are they real? I mean did someone really achieve scholarships? In addition, I found that they are not really strict about any requirements so how a person can qualify for them.",

To incentivize that, they are willing to put your name in their raffle that gives out some money.",

      "text": "Yes, they're real, and very hard to win .. because of the lack of requirements. The low standards and no essay scholarships are essentially just raffles meant to promote the company. \n\nWhile you still have a slim chance of winning, and earning that $ would be useful - it as an award shows nothing of your talents or merit. I think it's better to direct yourself towards scholarships asking for personal statements because those tend to weave out applicants who aren't willing to spend time to write 500 words.",
