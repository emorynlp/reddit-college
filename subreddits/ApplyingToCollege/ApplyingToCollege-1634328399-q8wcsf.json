  "text": "Hi, Y'all! I kinda need a reality check! I know Columbia is obviously a big stretch for even extremely qualified people. However, is there even a point for me to ED with a 33 SS (And yes, Columbia is my dream school loll)? (I know recs and Ecs and etc are taken into account but I would say I am above average but not crazy). Any feedback is helpful, I just need a reality check! :)",
