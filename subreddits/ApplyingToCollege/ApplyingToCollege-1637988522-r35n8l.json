  "text": "Hello, like the title says the colleges in North Carolina that I\u2019ve applied to are saying that I am an out of state resident when my residency is in state? I did my NC Residency Determination and they determined that I am a in-state resident. \n\n\nThe Nc Residency Determination gave me a group of numbers to put on all my college application so that the colleges can verify that I am an In-state resident, which I did put when I applied to the colleges. I\u2019ve emailed the colleges but I haven\u2019t heard anything back, any help with this?",
