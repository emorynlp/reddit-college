  "title:": "Why do American colleges factor extracurriculars into their decision-making process so much when colleges in the rest of the world don\u2019t?",
  "text": "My parents are from another country, and when I was applying to colleges I talked to my cousin who lived and said country and told him I needed to do stuff like debate and swim team to get into a good college. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked what that had to do with getting into college, and explained that universities in his countries only cared about your grades. Why is there such a substantial difference between the expectations of American universities and the rest of the world?",

      "text": "Grades aren\u2019t everything. Colleges want to know that you\u2019re well-rounded, participate in society, etc. Also GPA isn\u2019t standardized, and imo it\u2019s dumb to base the entirety of your admissions process in entrance exams (like is done in places like Japan and Korea).",
