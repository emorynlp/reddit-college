  "title:": "As a former A2Cer (last year), and a current UCSD student. I am in love with UCSD",
  "text": "Last year, I applied to 29 colleges, while had success with scholarship in many schools. UCSD was the most cost/benefit (quality in relative to costs) efficient school I decided to go. I wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic at first since my dream school was Harvard lol. But after been here for a while now. I share my testimony that I am in love. \n\nUCSD is not socially dead at all. Everyone is very friendly, you get to meet lots of people, make lots of friends regardless when. But especially the week before school starts, there is just soooo many things to do in La Jolla and so many activities. Same with throughout the school year, there are countless amount of activities, events, festivals, concerts, etc.\n\nEspecially with our suite system, you get to have an amazing social life and live in some of the best dorm in the nation (arguably). With an oceanview. \n\nThe #1 thing about UCSD people talk less about is the beauty of the beach, we are 10 min walk away from the beach. The sunset is astonishingly stunning, I been to lots of places, but never I have I seen a sunset this beautiful. The water becomes mirrors, reflects the sky, the sand, the rocks, you. Sometimes we have bonfire, and bunch other stuff around campus. You can go surfing anytime, paddle boarding, body surfing, you name it. And with places like gilderport, there is no other places on earth that\u2019s like UCSD. UCSD recreation offers sooo many free classes, activities too. \n\nWe have a huge campus with so many things to do all the time, close to a lot of off campus spots for food, shopping, movies, whatever you name it.\n\nOur dinning hall is quite alright, we have like 20 of them, each acting like an individual restaurant serving different food. Each isn\u2019t a different view, and we have fast food places, dinning places on campus too, even a target, or just few min walk. \n\nUCSD was the scripp institute of oceanography, so we are part of scripp too, where we have huge places near the beach, around the area, all that. \n\nThe academics here are rigorous, you will learn a lot. \n\nI will leave my thoughts on that note,\nHope you all consider UCSD as one of your top choice",

      "text": "Neuroscience Ph.D student checking in. Honestly UCSD has trained me to survive in this rigorous setting. Academics is tough but IT WILL PREPARE YOU. You learn to be rigorous in your work ethics, learn how to do research in top labs esp in the sciences and most importantly, learn to seek opportunities and suck up when things are tough. This is super important esp in med/dental/pharm/law/other science grad schools in general. There are many top private schools (Im in one ans taught classes) that spoil kids (relative to rigorous public schools like UCSD) because they cater too much to the student. Grade inflation and student care isnt bad but if you get used to being spoiled and being adjusted to, its going to be very rough down the road. Just my 2 cents, good luck to all applicants!",
