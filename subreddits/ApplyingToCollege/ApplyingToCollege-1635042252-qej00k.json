  "title:": "Question About Submitting SAT Essay score from a separate test sitting",
  "text": "Some schools I'm applying to require an official score report. I took the SAT 3 times, let's say A, B, and C test sittings.\n\nB and C make up my superscore, while I took the SAT essay in A, and got a pretty nice score (but the overall section scores are lower in comparison to B and C).\n\nTherefore, I only submitted official reports including my test scores from B and C, since the essay from A doesn't matter that much anymore and it doesn't even make up my actual superscore.\n\nOn the Common App, I was planning to just entirely not report the A test sitting (only reporting B and C for my superscore). But, it asks if I've taken the SAT essay before, which I have, but then I'd have to answer what date I took it, which is not found on the official report. I feel that it could seem weird to have something from a test date not on the official report.\n\nSo would it be fine to answer no to that question? Technically the math and english subscores I'm reporting do come test dates where I didn't take the essay.\n\nThanks so much!",
