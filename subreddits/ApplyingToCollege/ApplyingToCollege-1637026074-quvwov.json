  "title:": "Question about sending SAT scores through CollegeBoard",
  "text": "On college applications, it states that my SAT scores are missing after I\u2019ve sent them. I sent my June 05, 2021 scores on October 20, 2021. \n\nI was also registered to take the November 6 SAT, and also marked that I would have that score sent, but I decided not to take it.\n\nI emailed one of the colleges\u2019 admissions office, and they said this is probably the problem. The admissions officer said she had seen before where the College Board waits to send both scores when a student is scheduled for another one. \n\nI was going to contact College Board tonight, but their office hours are closed. \n\nDoes anyone know if there\u2019s a way I can unsend the November 6 scores (even though i didn\u2019t even take the test)? I just want the June 5 scores sent. \n\nSorry if this was a confusing question or if I worded it weirdly, I\u2019m just confused and College Board is making this pretty difficult.",

      "text": "College Board has its difficult moments. It may take until Friday (or later) for College Board's system to realize you did not take the test. If the website gives you the option, cancel or reschedule that test date to get rid of the registration.\n\nOther than that, call customer service tomorrow.\n\n(Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll.)",
