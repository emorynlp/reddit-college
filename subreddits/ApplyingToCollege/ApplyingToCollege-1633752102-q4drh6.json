  "text": "Unfortunately my high school does not require a year of art to graduate and I will not meet the requirement to apply to Cal Poly by the time I graduate. Is there any flexibility in the 1 year of art requirement? Is it possible for me to say I couldn\u2019t complete it because of COVID? I believe the rest of my application is strong and would be very mad if I was ineligible to even apply. Thank you.",
