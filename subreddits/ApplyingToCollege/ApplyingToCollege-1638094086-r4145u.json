  "text": "The financial aid checklist for my ED school indicates that they\u2019re missing a citizen/eligible noncitizen document. I just submitted a scanned photo of my US passport a couple days a ago, past the financial aid deadline of Nov. 15. I had no idea I had to upload this type of verification - is it because I was born in a different country and later became a US citizen? Has anyone else had to submit a similar document, and will the fact that I submitted this late impact my decision at all? \n\nThanks",
