  "title:": "A problem with LORs",
  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019m currently a junior in high school and as the title suggest, I need help regarding my LOR. Basically, I\u2019ll be transferring schools for my senior year (to study in the US) and I\u2019m not sure whether to ask for the LORs from my teachers this year or when I transfer next year (Almost all of my current teachers are new this year). My current teachers don\u2019t have experience in writing LORs and I\u2019m not sure if they would be able to write good ones, so I would prefer to ask my teachers when I\u2019m in the US, since American teachers are familiar with this.\n\nBut this is the problem: College applications are usually due in December, so asking for a LOR with a teacher who knows me for 6 months max doesn\u2019t really make sense. \n\nHas anyone ever dealt with this issue or have any suggestion? Thank you in advanced!\n\n(Sorry for grammar mistakes.)",

If needed, provide them with supplementary information about your extracurriculars and other things you juggle outside of their classes.  Most importantly, do your very best work for them - that's what colleges want to know about anyway, and that's what you want to help your teacher speak to.",
