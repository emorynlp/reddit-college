  "text": "\nI\u2019ve made a mistake on my applications. I indicated on the courses section of my common app that each elective that I took this year was an honors course. The elective courses in my school are weighted at an honors level, but they are not actually honors courses. I\u2019ve already submitted my applications so I can\u2019t change this. Should I email each admissions office to clear up this mistake, or would this mistake not really matter?",
