The colleges I\u2019ve applied to haven\u2019t asked for English proficiency exam scores, but I submitted mine jic. Do I need to regive it?",

              "text": "The colleges I have worked in and with generally have 100 as the baseline (but, they were very cognizant of how students acclimated with higher scores). Might be work looking through T10's to see. It really is for mutual benefit. It's much easier to read/write/comprehend \"formal English\" than to absorb colloquial, rapid speaking with many distractions. Most students will eventually \"get  it\". Same for English-speaking students!",

It never was easy for him...and I don't know exactly what he used. He practiced French...the area in Chad was all Arabic speaking. so that was that!!!",
