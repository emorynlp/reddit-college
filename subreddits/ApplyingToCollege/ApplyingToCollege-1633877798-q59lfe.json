  "text": "I have this activity that sends students who don't have access to college counselling daily emailed college admissions tips. I coded an app and set up an 5-month-long email sequence with almost 300 subscribers. How do I frame this to colleges to not seem so college-admissions focused while still communicating the activity? The tips were sourced by me from top-college students.",
