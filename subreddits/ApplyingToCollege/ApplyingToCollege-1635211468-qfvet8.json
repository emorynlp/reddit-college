  "text": "Hey, I hope everyone's college apps are going well! I already submitted all my November 1st applications and have already heard back from a few colleges. However, this process has made me start to break down.\n\nEver since senior year started, it has been hell. I've been suffering socially and mentally.\n\nMy view of a senior, based on my past experience, is a competent and relatively popular upperclassman that knows what they are doing. Now that I am a senior, I feel that I am not those qualities I both want to have and feel.\n\nThe biggest issue that I am facing is in my abilities. In my abilities, I believe that I come short on what I want to study in college - Engineering. However, I feel like I suck at physics and math, getting problems wrong, and being too defensive on the incorrect. I feel incompetent, worthless, and underwhelmed by my performance and abilities. Every day, I see my friends excel at everything better than I do and know what they are doing. I, on the other hand, have no clue what the hell I am doing.\n\nFurthermore, I also feel I am struggling socially. I have a big group of friends, but I feel that I am the worst one in the group. I also feel they think of me as a poor friend and someone boring to talk to. It's not like I can leave this group as it is too late and have nowhere else to go. \n\nWhenever I come home from school, I nearly always have these thoughts. It's also been really difficult, especially with college app season running rampant.\n\nEvery day feels like a bad day. New days repeat the same cycle over and over again. Senior year was supposed to be the best year, but I still find ways to ruin it. I'm also starting to worry about how my life in college will turn out if this year is starting poorly. I guess the best thing I can do now is keep moving forward and hope for the best :)",
