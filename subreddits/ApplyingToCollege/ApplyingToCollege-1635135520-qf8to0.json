      "text": "AO's would love to read the best you can put out; but unfortunately, they don't have the time. They get tens of thousands of applications, and if each one was pages long, the admissions process would never get complete. At the end of the day, you're going to have to cut it down like everyone else has to. Some tips that help are removing verbose adjectives and descriptors. Look for sentences/details that do not directly have to do with the \"plot\" of your essay. Try to cut down phrases by changing them to one word (as a result, -> because). Adverbs will become your bestfriend. Sometimes it can be beneficial to open a new tab and type a whole new version of the essay in which you keep the word limit in mind.",
