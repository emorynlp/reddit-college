  "text": "So I\u2019ve decided to pursuit my bachelors  in applied mathematics . I want to start next fall so I\u2019ll be 30 when I do  , I\u2019m a \ncoparent  of two but they\u2019re mother has custodial so I pay child support and get them on the weekends.  \n\n\nThough I am excited for the opportunity to pursue a career that will help me and my babies out in a great way , I am also a big ball of anxiety and confusion right now .  I\u2019m lost on what steps I should take to make this happen . And I\u2019m really scared of not being able to balance work,  school and being a dad   . So I\u2019m wondering. \n\nHas anyone gone through college the same way if so how did you do it? \n\n\nCan I apply for any kind of help as non custodial  parent ? If so what should I look out for ? \n\n\nWill the child support system penalize me if I have to take off certain work hours to go back to school ? \n\n\nHow do I handle this anxious feeling telling me I can\u2019t do it ? \n\n\n \nAny words of advice and or encouragement on the subject would be greatly appreciated.",

Good on you for making this big change and taking this step. \n\nThere\u2019s a subreddit called r/BackToCollege with a community of people like you who are returning to school a little later in life. I hope you\u2019ll find some help there. \n\nBut just know that fear of the unknown is ok and normal\u2014 just don\u2019t let it keep you from where you want to be. Your kids will be the ultimate beneficiaries of all steps you make to move forward. \ud83d\udc96",

      "text": "Hello! I can\u2019t really answer most of your parenting questions but I do have anxiety and I just want to bring some reassurance. This is a big step and a very exciting one! It is definitely normal to be anxious. I had to go back to school after becoming disabled and I was super scared how it was going to pan out. Just take it day by day and it\u2019s actually much better than I thought it would be! You\u2019re going to do great even if it\u2019s an adjustment at first, and that\u2019s ok! Good luck\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Breaking up this process into a bunch of more manageable tasks can make it less intimidating. A lot of people applying to college are 17 year olds. You're so much more mature and smarter than them. Plus many people have done the same things as you before. Good for you and I hope this works out well!",

      "text": "Firstly, congratulations on taking this big step! Keep in mind that an undergraduate degree can come with debt, and it is not the only way to improve your quality of life and that of your loved ones. This is not to discourage, but I work with students who are not stable financially, and they only worsen their state by pursuing a degree and not making significant progress due to life stressors. It would be best if you seriously considered the timing if you have not already. \n\nThe format of the program will drastically dictate the \"how\" to complete your degree. I was a parent partly through my undergraduate degree and all of my graduate program. Online courses can be a viable option if you feel that you will thrive in that environment. It takes a lot of self-motivation to complete assignments, reading and learn some on your own. However, the most significant benefit of asynchronous online courses is flexibility. I often completed coursework after my son went to sleep and even during my work breaks. \n\nAs far as specific resources for non-custodial parents, if asking about financial, I would encourage you to check out your school's financial aid website and third-party websites for particular opportunities that may fit your situation. I always recommend apply apply apply; the worst that can happen is you receive a \"no,\" but you cannot get a \"yes\" without putting yourself out there. When it comes to child support, the FAFSA does consider it, but I cannot speak to possible legal implications; I would encourage you to seek counsel from an attorney.\n\nFinally, don't be discouraged! This is a big step, and big steps can often feel very scary. This is a good thing because it is to be taken seriously! Pursue your degree vigorously and utilize all your institution's resources (e.g., career counseling, tutoring, success coaching, etc.). Most importantly, do not be afraid to ask questions and to ask for help! Higher education professionals are there to help you succeed, whether it be academically or personally. Good luck, my friend!\n\n^(\\*Opinions, advice, and content posted by \"nath\\_rid\" are that of the author and are not provided on behalf or endorsed by any third-party entity.)",
