I believe the metro area is around 200,000, but the town of burlington is around 40,000. Perfect college town b/c there's 3 colleges in Burlington, with an AWESOME pedestrian walkway shopping/eating district downtown.\n\n\\-So many outdoor activities nearby. Mountains, lakes, skiing, yes!\n\n\\-Beautiful Lake Champlain = sunsets and sunrises!\n\n\\-Very environmental-geared and very socially conscious atmosphere. \n\n\\-Gorgeous area with beautiful seasons. Fall is beautiful, Winter is a snow-lover's paradise, spring is so nice, and summer is mild and enjoyable.\n\n\\-Weed-friendly.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\-Not very diverse. I mean, it's Vermont. But UVM is actively working to promote diversity, and around 20% of students (if I'm correct) are BIPOC.\n\n\\-Overwhelmingly liberal, which is a pro to some people but a con to others.\n\n\\-Very cold for like half the year. I like the cold but I know someone who I went on a service trip with (she's from Florida) went to Syracuse and couldn't take it. She transferred to UMiami after a year LOL.",
