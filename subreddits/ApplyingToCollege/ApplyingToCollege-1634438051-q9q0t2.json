  "text": "So I'm applying to computer science, and I have good ECs, but I don't really have any awards. \n\nI'm starting USACO to try and improve my coding knowledge and get some awards, but can anyone suggest me any ways that I can earn some high level awards, particularly in CS field?\n\nAlso, if any competitions happen in the next two months that'd be good as well, since I have a hole in my school schedule so I have a lot of free time.",

      "text": "If you could prepare for and win a high level award in two months, would it really be a high level award? \n\nA lot of computer science contests need specialized practice for the specific structure of that contest, even if you're great at general programming knowledge you probably won't be at such contests. You're best bet is perhaps trying to find and participate in a few online hackathon's ig as you can code whatever you want for them, thought I don't think any very large ones are in the next two months.",

But like I said in the original comment, a lot of the more well known high school cs contest like [usaco](http://www.usaco.org) require more specialized knowledge that you can't really do without preparing for specifically, even if you're a good coder in general.",
