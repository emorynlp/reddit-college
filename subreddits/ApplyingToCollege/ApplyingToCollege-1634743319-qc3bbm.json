  "text": "I study at a fairly large private school ~1000 students per grade and there's only one career counsellor allocated for us. More than 700 kids apply to colleges in the US from every batch so there's really not much time she can dedicate towards each and every applicant. Most people in my school are super rich, not applying for financial aid etc. or can afford external 12K $  /yr career counsellors but I can't do that,what can I do?",

Thanks!",

Also, knowing her situation, \"bombarding\" with emails was never going to end up well. Have no idea what you can do for this academic year but think parents need to pressure the school for at least 8 more future counselors.",

While the junior counsellor (who doesn't know anything at all about college admissions abroad) mainly deals with the students from sixth grade through tenth, our counsellor is probably super overworked dealing with 2000 kids. I don't blame her but it's also a shitty situation to be in. My parents did try to talk to the principal but since most people at the school are rich enough to afford personal counselors, they kind of discarded their request.",
