      "text": "Acceptance rates for international students are generally lower (usually considered half the overall rate), but asking for financial aid at a need-aware college is a whole other level of difficulty from what I\u2019ve seen. If you can pay, you can mostly guarantee that you\u2019ll at least get in *somewhere*, even if it isn\u2019t a T50 college. If you need aid, it\u2019s not uncommon to get rejected everywhere. The difference is significant at need-aware colleges for internationals.",
