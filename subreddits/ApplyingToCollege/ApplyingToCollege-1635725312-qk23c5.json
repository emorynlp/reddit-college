  "text": "I'm falling in love with Uchic and since my ED1 is also a hard reach might as well go all in. I can't find its ED2 stats anywhere on the internet so I was thinking you guys might have a decent estimate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( I've also fallen in love with Tufts somehow which has completely different vibes so any thoughts on which one is the better choice for a CS major international that needs aid?)",
