Also, if you have any extracurricular interests, look into if they exist at that college so you can ask questions about that too. TBH i woke up late for my princeton interview and i honestly knew ZILCH about that school and had no time to research but i still got in. I think as long as you are able to ask your interviewer any kind of personal questions that center around their undergrad experience and isn\u2019t easily google-able you should be fine. But you should at least know what major you are currently interested in at that school.",

The interviewer will guide the conversation and you\u2019ll probably come up with questions as it goes along. Still, i say avoid the google-able questions. This is a rare chance to speak to someone that not only experienced that college but also the life that comes after.",
