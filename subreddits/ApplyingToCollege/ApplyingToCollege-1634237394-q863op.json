  "text": "Does anyone feel the same? Like, when we take time from our stressful life where we feel like an imposter, where we feel like EVERYONE is better than us, where we think we don't deserve a good college or a career, and then, we come to this subreddit where people are in the same shoe as you are, where they are as stressed as you are, where they are as exhausted as you are but upon talking to them, upon feeling like them, upon realizing you are not 'lonely', you feel like HOME.",

It's the exact opposite for me.",
