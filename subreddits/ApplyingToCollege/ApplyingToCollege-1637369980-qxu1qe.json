  "title:": "The masculine urge to decline the deferral I just received",
  "text": "Just got a deferral for a school which means I\u2019ll now have to wait 4 more months to hear my decisions. The decision is very likely going to be a no so why wait. Also not sure if I\u2019m even interested in the school so why delay so much in my head for what\u2019s likely going to be nothing. I also have a weird mindset that if they wanted me there and believed I could succeed there they would\u2019ve accepted me initially so getting the deferral made me rethink if it was a good fit. Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking this and I should wait it out in my head but the other part of me just wants the decision to be made ASAP for some reason",
