  "title:": "How do I come up with a story for my topic? Is my idea good or too cliche?",
  "text": "So I'm planning on writing about how I liked to \"maintain the status quo\" in regards to my academic life and personal life, but have started to open up a little bit this summer and senior year so far, and saying \"yes\" when offered a chance to try something new, and planning on continuing to experience new things. The problem is, I feel like I opened up more because \"this is my last year of high school, so I'm gonna do something different (yolo)\" vs a life-changing experience, which would sound better. I didn't do anything too crazy either, just started volunteering again and got a job. \n\nMy other essay idea is about overcoming my fear of failure, but that just sounds way too cliche. \n\nKeep in mind, these are both in the unfinished initial draft stage. \n\nI guess my question is, are my ideas good or too cliche, and how would I go about turning my ideas into a story that sounds good? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso am I screwed cuz EA deadline is in like 2.5 weeks please help",
