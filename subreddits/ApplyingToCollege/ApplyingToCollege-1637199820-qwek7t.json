  "text": "Soooooooo\n\nI applied to fairfield and drexel early action.  All was well, I'll Def get into those my grades, sat and extracurricular are good.  Or so I thought.\n\nI egged this kids house and got caught. I know, I'm a peice of shit it was stupid and I'm so ashamed of myself.  I'm so unimaginably ashamed.  I apologized to the kid and the mom.  The mom is pressing charges and I seem to be in trouble.  If you reading this think I'm an awful person, I understand.  I am a bad person, I have been bad these last few months.\n\nNow the reason I post this here is, will colleges find out? I'm a minor still.  Also will they care enough to deny me?\n\nThanks sm for any help\n\nEdit:  um this has kind of transcended college app sub so Ig I'll update the story.  There is a video of the owner of the house I egged shotgunning beer with a bunch of high-school kids in her own garage. I am deciding whether I should use that or not.\n\nMy mom wants to give that video to the police but I don't want to.  She is in europe right now so she can't. \n\nThis whole fucken story has been wild so far.\n\nEdit 2: I'm going down to the station today.  Wish me luck fellas.",

Very situational, and I hope you the best. We all mess up, we\u2019re 17/18 and stupid. Best wishes.\nEdit: I wanted to add that the store I stole from was adamant about pressing charges on me and taking me to court. The store clerk was so pissed off that I got diverted that he practically begged to take me to court and even wanted to sue (over a 16 year old stealing 12 White Claws lmfao). But the juvenile court kept me on diversion to try and preserve my future the best they could. I don\u2019t know much about legal stuff but I really hope you\u2019re eligible to be diverted in a similar fashion to my case, as there are quite a few consistencies between our issues.",

You can offer to pay for power washing or whatever, in return for no charges.  But here's the thing at least in my state ... charges aren't really up to her to press.  The police decide if a crime has been committed and then refer it to prosecution.  Then the DA's office decides to file charges or not.  She can be clearly willing to testify, but she doesn't get to make the call.  So, she may be claiming she's \"pressing charges\" to mean she's filing a police report.  There are plenty of areas where prosecutors just aren't going to bother with real charges for a minor on something like this.  She may know this and is just terrifying you for revenge.  Have the police actually contacted you?",
