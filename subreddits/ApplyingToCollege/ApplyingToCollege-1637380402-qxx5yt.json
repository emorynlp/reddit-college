I don\u2019t really want to go to an in-state college (MS) but I don\u2019t have a very strong resume as of right now (my academics are decent, but I can\u2019t say I am very involved in my community\u2014I\u2019m pretty shy). Any advice on what I should do?\n\nI also want to be prepared when applying for scholarships so if anyone has advice for building resumes or really anything it would be greatly appreciated! :)",

      "text": "Alright,\n\nTo start change your perspective, from your post I can tell that you see involvement as negative. That does not have to be the case. Instead of becoming involved think about it as an experience, experiences can be good, they can be bad, but all have bits of both. Instead of focusing on the bad(people) part of it focus on the good(thing you like). So you could be involved in your school\u2019s habitat club where you lead at the builds through diligent work. Alternatively try something like a personal project and get the experience of installing a piece of wood to cover the gap in the school restrooms. \n\nTake the standardized test sophomore year. It will make Junior year a bit less stressful. \n\nThe largest scholarships will be from schools themselves either as merit awards or for need. Bordering states tend to have scholarships for those from bordering states, so check websites for that. \nAs a side note as a first-gen talk to your parents about costs. It will help you better understand your situation. Vanderbilt is a great school and hard to get into but if the NPC says that you cannot afford it you cannot have it be your dream school.",

          "text": "I understand what you are staying about join clubs and I am definitely making the effort to be more involved. I want to continue expanding my interest throughout the rest of my years in high school. What I might have trouble on is personal projects where I don\u2019t really know where to begin. \n\nI\u2019m planning on studying over the summer and taking standardized testing the fall of my junior year because I don\u2019t feel prepared right now. I think fall will be fine and I truly understand why I should try to reduce stress during junior years. \n\nI will most definitely talk to my parents about financial needs. I will do research on bordering state colleges and scholarships they offer. \n\nThank you so much for your advice!! It\u2019s really helpful for me and I really appreciate it.",
