  "text": "As a student from the middle of no where, I\u2019m pretty worried about my admission chances since T10s and Ivy League schools almost always take the same applicants from the same areas (I\u2019m applying next year). I feel like its more desirable to be from one of the areas with extremely competitive high schools, high income, etc.",

      "text": "You\u2019ve got it backwards - they take kids from those areas because those areas have a lot of qualified kids with competitive stats and ecs. Which makes it harder to stand out among your peers if you\u2019re there, since they get their pick of the best of the best in those areas. (of course private feeder schools w hella resources are a different story). If your area doesn\u2019t send many it\u2019s much easier to stand out since colleges actually do want geographic diversity, they just need to accept a lot from competitive areas since a good chunk of those kids are clearly qualified",

      "text": "it depends. i'd say the biggest downsides to being from an underrepresented area are fewer opportunities, lower class rigor, and limited access to knowledgeable school counselors. however, for many schools that pride themselves on filling their classes with geographically diverse students, being from the middle of nowhere may be a good thing because you get judged in the context of your location and so you're not competing with as many applicants.",
