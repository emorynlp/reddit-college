And I think that might have been an underestimate.\n\nGreat grades aren't enough to get you into the most selective school where there is intense competition for a spot in the class. But there are a LOT of institutions out there.  Taken on the whole, a student with great grades could get offers from the vast majority. And luckily for the college aspirations of many others, many are also willing to give a shot to students without great grades.  \n\nI am sharing this because on A2C we tend to forget how many colleges there are in the U.S.",
