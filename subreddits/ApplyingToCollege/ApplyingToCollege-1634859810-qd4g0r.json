  "text": "I\u2019m a senior I\u2019m high school currently going through the whole application process. Long story short I have European citizenship and have decided that I want to do my bachelors in Europe. I\u2019ve been doing research and have several universities in mind, problem is that the major I\u2019m pursuing is a \u201cnumerus fixus\u201d - meaning that the study program has a very limited number of available spaces (I want to study International Business/ Business Administration). Anyone know of good safety schools in Europe? I have yet to find a university where the admissions process doesn\u2019t seem as \u2026 challenging? \n\nPS: I forgot to add: Not all universities who have International Business see the program as a numerus fixus. \nMaastricht University and Amsterdam University, both of which I will be applying to, do have International Business as a numerus fixus program. \n\nFor reference, I have a 4.3 weighted GPA,  have passed 3 AP tests and will be taking two more this coming May. Grades are mostly A a few B\u2019s here and there. I speak fluent German, Spanish and English with a little French.",
