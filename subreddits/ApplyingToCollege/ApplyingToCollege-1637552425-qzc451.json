      "text": "as long as you write well about it and how it impacted you/how you impacted that community, it\u2019s not dumb and would make for a very unique essay. this all depends, however, on how passionate you are about this community and if you are writing about it because you\u2019re proud of your leadership and want to share. the only time I\u2019d advise against it is if you are writing about it just to check that leadership box. but I think this sounds super cool and very amazing that you regulated such a large group!! :) (and remember, nothing is ever too niche as long as it can be explained well for college apps)",
