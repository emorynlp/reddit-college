  "text": "Hey so I don\u2019t know everything there is to know about every university.  And that is especially true for universities that excel in areas outside my area of expertise.  \n\nThat said, I like to be informed.  So I\u2019m asking: how did Northeastern go from \u201coh, co-ops, neato\u201d to \u201cbest co-ops in the whole world\u201d? They\u2019re not the only school with co-ops, so what gives?  How do you even quantify the quality of a co-op program?  Is this just word-of-mouth bias?",

      "text": "I think one dimension you can measure is how pervasive co-ops are: are they largely confined to one school (usually engineering) or are they common in other schools? Also: how many people across the university do a coop internship?\n\nYou can also ask about the opportunity cost: how long do people spend at coop before graduating and, if that extends their graduation date, how long is the extension?\n\nI know of coop programs that keep you on a strict four-year graduation cycle -- while Northeastern says \"Co-op advisors help students plan up to three co-ops while staying on track for graduation in 4-5 years.\" Five years is a lot of opportunity cost at the differential between intern and full-time pay.",
