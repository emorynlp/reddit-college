  "text": "hi, i hope this is the right place to ask this question:\ni submitted five college applications yesterday (saturday october 30) morning through Common App. as of right now, i have only received emails from two of the colleges confirming that my application was received and giving me login info to check my application status in the school portal. for these schools, the early action deadline is november 1 (and i am applying early action for every one). \n\nwhat happens if i do not get the portal login info email until after the early action deadline? All my materials should be submitted, but if something is missing, i won\u2019t be able to find out until it\u2019s too late (after the deadline). i don\u2019t know how soon after submitting the common app these emails are supposed to come, but i am getting nervous. will this ruin my chance to apply early action? should i plan to email these schools? \n\nthanks :)",
