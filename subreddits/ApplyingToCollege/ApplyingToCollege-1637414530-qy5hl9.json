  "title:": "my ed school receives 65% of their endowment from tuition. am i screwed as a low income applicant?",
  "text": "So in my Common App essay, I allude to the fact that I\u2019m a low income student. I know a lot of people say this is a hook because diversity of whatever, but I\u2019ve also seen secret confessions from admissions officers that say they\u2019ll choose one student over the other because they will pay more in tuition. Am I at a disadvantage or not?\n\nedit: the school is need blind, but does that really matter if they know i\u2019ll need a lot of aid based on my essay?",
