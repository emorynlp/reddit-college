  "text": "Time to clear a misconception: CSS or financial aid application fee waivers **DO NOT EXCLUSIVELY** cater to U.S applicants. Scary how if it weren't for u/prsehgal , I would have planned on spending loads of money on unis just for financial aid requests. Now to avail these waivers, here are the steps that you should follow (haven't really found something similar for intl' students):\n\n1. Draft an email where you can just plug in the name of the uni and you're good to send (attaching the draft I used for mine, open to use for anyone :D)\n\n>\\>>  Greetings \\_uni name\\_,  \n  \n>  \n>I'm \\_your name\\_, an international applicant from \\_country\\_, waiting to apply to your university for the admissions cycle for fall \\_year\\_. The major parts of my application are thankfully complete except one single portion- the CSS profile. Since financing my education at universities abroad is already a financial strain for my family, it would be generous of your institution to provide me with a CSS waiver and if possible, an application fee waiver too. I am not eligible to apply one through CommonApp itself because the waivers are for U.S students only. However, a lot of your alumni have advised me to contact your university through e-mail to seek the same. My income bracket is around USD \\_income bracket\\_ and is \\_active/stagnant\\_. Moreover, I \\_include family dynamics if they come into play\\_  \n  \n>  \n>Thanking you in advance!  \nRegards. \n\n2. Find the email for each uni on your list; pref., each uni has a diff set of officers that handle intl' applicants, contact them for a quicker response. If not, use admissions query emails:\n\n>some of the emails that you guys could use:  internationaloffice@harvard.edu ;  admission@emory.edu ;  ugrad-ask@columbia.edu ;  internationalteam@admissions.upenn.edu ;  admissions.ops@nyu.edu ;  financialaid@knox.edu ;  admissions@wooster.edu \n\n3. Plug in the names and info and hit send, as simple as that.\n\n\\#note: some unis and colleges don't even require the CSS or simply won't accept them.",
