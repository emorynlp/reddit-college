  "text": "is this the wrong way to categorize this activity--Camp DELTA (as \"Volunteering / Community Service\"), if it was a self-directed volunteering project? (since I didn't actually volunteer for a particular organization, so I didn't really have a description for a particular organization/program, so I just made it about the reasoning for my project).\u00a0\n\nShould I change the activity to the category \"Extracurricular\" instead?\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nOrganization, group or program name: Science Instructor, Camp DELTA (Self-Created)\n\nOrganization, group or program description: I co-created this camp to combat a lack of interactive science instruction in my nearby public schools during the pandemic.\n\nDescription of volunteer experience: Co-taught virtual science classes to local 5th and 6th graders, inspiring curiosity through simple experiments and interactive presentations. 100% of virtual participants reported increased interest in science post-camp. Hosted summer session in-person at Boys & Girls Club, impacting 30 students total. Website: [http://x](http://czhang22service.weebly.com/)xxxx\n\nGrade Participation: 11th grade",
