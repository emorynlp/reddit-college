  "text": "I woke up in the morning and had a headache. It'd been happening all weekend and I already missed school the week before so I decided to go to class anyway. Anyways, I sit down for my math test and everything just FLARED. I couldn't think or focus. I just filled in all of the easy problems and sat with my head in my hands. I ended up leaving at lunch because it got so bad. Found out today I got a 50 on the  test, and my chances at a scholarship are potentially destroyed.",
