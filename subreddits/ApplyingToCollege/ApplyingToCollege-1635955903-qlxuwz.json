      "text": "Those are all good schools. What are you interested in for a major? What kind of area do you want to live in? Queens is suburban NYC so you could jump on a train and be in Manhattan or Brooklyn in 30-50 minutes. If you like the idea of the restaurants and shows big cities offer, that might be your choice. May have fewer students living on and around campus though. And NYC is still recovering from the business impacts of a big chunk of the population leaving in 2020 due to covid so there are fewer cool things and those are a bit more expensive- should be back within 5 years though. \n\nUO is in a real college town and the name is recognized around the country as pretty good, especially for liberal arts. I had it in my college list decades ago. People we know who are STEM oriented seem more focused on OSU, which has a growing reputation and similar town. Both are an hour or two by car from Portland (small growing city), 4 hours from Seattle (city now feels bigger than downtown San Francisco) and an hour from a beach like the one in the Twilight movies; a lot of those movies was filmed in Oregon. Public transportation won\u2019t be as convenient as NYC since most people drive everywhere but if you mostly staying around campus you can walk, bike in good weather and take a bus for trips to the cities. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about Tulsa, but it\u2019s a nice, small midwestern city. My daughter\u2019s friend went to school there and liked it, but she was from the local area. \n\nAnywhere you go on that list you should have solid teachers and classes, and an all-American adventure. If you can\u2019t visit maybe try to look at videos that show the campuses and towns to get a better feel for which you think you\u2019d like.",
