  "text": "How do I stop being so anxious? I keep waking up thinking about how my EA results are pretty much already set in stone once I submit my last few supplementary materials. The December 15th results will be the difference between grinding for the rest of my year and finally getting to relax, and I know a scary number of people who EA'd to the same school and I'll feel awful if one of them gets in and I don't. My stomach hurts. Any advice?",

Work in the yard (parents will be thrilled)...trim, rake, mow grass for the hopefully frickin' last time this year! Instead of the car, ride a bike...far. You need to get outside of this suffocating bubble. It is not healthy...and you are not helpless in this dance. Just got off the phone with my daughter who is a college counselor for a small, progressive school...\"Mom, no one gets hysterical around here but me!\". I think she has shepherded them well.",
