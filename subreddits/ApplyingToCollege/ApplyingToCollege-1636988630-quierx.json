  "text": "how the heck do I go about submitting my transcript and letter(s) of rec to the UC schools as an out-of-state applicant? I don't see a spot on the actual application detailing this. My counselor just said to request them through naviance, but would I just be sending in one transcript to all of the UC schools?",

      "text": "PSA, just to try to reach any lurkers who are not yet aware: public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
