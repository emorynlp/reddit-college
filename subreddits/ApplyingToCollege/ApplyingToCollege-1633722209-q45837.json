  "text": "So I was applying to a university, I am planning on transferring by fall 2022. \n\nThe application asks what degree I am planning to get from the community college (I think it\u2019s asking for the community college degree) but when I see the options for the associates I don\u2019t see the one I\u2019m looking for, the one I need is under Bachelors. But there also another option that just says Diploma, should I pick diploma? \n\nAnother question I have is, the application asks when I start my first semester at the community college, I started in fall 2019 but failed all my classes, so I restarted in spring 2020 and passed, should I put fall or spring on the application (even though I failed fall)?\n\nAlso idk if this one will be properly answered but how do I see my transcript because my portal won\u2019t load to show me my transcript. \n\nThanks",
