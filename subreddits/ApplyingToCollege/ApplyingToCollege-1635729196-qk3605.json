  "text": "My whole essay is in a montage style where I use my car as a big metaphor to show different values of mine. I think I did a pretty good job of writing the actual essay but I don\u2019t really know how to write the hook. I was thinking I could write about when I actually got the car, but my parents bought it and I feel like the story would just seem very privileged. Any ideas on how I could start this kind of essay that wouldn\u2019t seem super obnoxious?",
