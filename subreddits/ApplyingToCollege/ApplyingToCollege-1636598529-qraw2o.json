  "text": "Im an immigrant staying in Canada. I wasnt much aware about SAT or ACT dates and centers, and by the time i looked at it, for December test there was just one center in my area which was 400kms away so that was out of the question. Now the next one is in March there are no tests available before that and applications have to go by Jan mid. Even though its not required for Canadian Universities but I still want to give it a shot. So is it possible that I can have any chance of my March scores being accepted?",
