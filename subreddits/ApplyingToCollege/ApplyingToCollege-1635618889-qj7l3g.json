      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. \n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. Most private universities have no problem accepting scores that arrive a few days late. Order now. I don't think I'd send them an email.",
