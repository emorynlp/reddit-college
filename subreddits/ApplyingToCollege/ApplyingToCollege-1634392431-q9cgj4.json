What does the website say?\n\n>Trinity is need-aware when reviewing international applications, which means we take into consideration a student\u2019s financial circumstances when making admissions decisions. Applying for need-based financial aid places you in Trinity\u2019s most competitive applicant pool. **For students enrolling in the fall of 2019, the admit rate for all international students was approximately 13%. Admission is even more competitive for students who demonstrate significant financial need.** Applicants who can contribute at least $35,000 USD per year towards their educational expenses are the most competitive for admission.",

They clearly don't know how much of a disadvantage it is for international students seeking aid. \n\nOn the flip side, their website and blogs are actually super helpful.",
