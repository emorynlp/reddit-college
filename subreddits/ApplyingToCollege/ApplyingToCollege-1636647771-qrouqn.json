  "text": "like ik it\u2019s obv a good school, but the area is so unsafe, the essay prompts are literally the worst, and besides maybe econs other t10s and t20s seem to be on par academically? \n\nno hate at all obv, just trying to understand if i\u2019m missing something bc 50% of the people on this sub seem to be ed-ing there (and basically the entire other half are ed2-ing)",

      "text": "Maybe because it is the only UC in the mid-west? Kidding aside, other than it\u2019s mime-worthiness, it is a top school in mid-west. And most applicants from Midwest would apply there and folks from east & west coast who want change of scene and not study near their home,  might also do. Main thing, those who are on Reddit do not reflect the general student population. Some frequently post giving the appearance of popularity.",

In my case, I\u2019m extremely interested in their law school (post undergrad) because it peaks the interest of employers around the nation. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that applicants are interested in the potential connections/brand/and t10 education, and are willing to overlook the inherent risks/faults that attending Uchigaco may bring.",
