  "text": "if a college doesn\u2019t give me enough financial aid for me to be able to attend can i ask them about it?? for context, a school is only giving me my full pell grant and nothing else, but even at that my cost of attendance is still 40k a year, is there any way to bring this up to them??? like i\u2019m kinda stuck with what to do because i really want to go there but i cannot if that\u2019s the price tag for me. they\u2019re also the only school that hasn\u2019t given me any aid apart from my pell grant :((",

      "text": "Is the school a public university in another state? (PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no *need-based* financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.)\n\nDoes the school promise to meet full need?  (Most do not!)\n\nDid you follow all of the school's instructions for applying for need-based financial aid? (Many generous schools, especially privates, require additional forms to complete the financial aid application, such as the CSS Profile.)\n\nRun the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) \n\nGo to the college's financial aid website and look for information on a financial aid appeal. There might be a form on the website.",
