      "text": "i kind of have the same problem - what ive heard is that it doesnt really help you, but if you play your cards right you can maximize your \u201cappeal\u201d to the AOs by showing passion/leadership/willingness to commit in your ECs, regardless of if they fit your intended major. play to your strengths and try to connect them to the major. \n\nor you could also apply as undecided, but that comes with its own pros and cons (AOs wont be able to see off the bat what field(s) youre interested in, i know the tufts admissions blog has a post about applying undecided) \n\nso in the end, its your call, whatever you think makes your application as cohesive and appealing as possible",
