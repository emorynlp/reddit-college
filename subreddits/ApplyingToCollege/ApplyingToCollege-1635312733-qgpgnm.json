  "text": "\\^Title. I am researching STEM programs to apply to and came across MITES and MOSTEC, but it appears that those programs are primarily intended for minorities and underrepresented groups, whereas I am an unhooked Asian male, nowhere close to low-income, and am in a decently competitive area/school. In this case, is there even a point in applying? Does anyone from my demographic actually get in?",
