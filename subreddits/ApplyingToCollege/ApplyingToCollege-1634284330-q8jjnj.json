  "text": "hey everyone!\n\nI've been grinding out my personal statement in anticipation of that dreaded Nov. 1 deadline. I'm stuck between two drafts I have so far -- \n\nnarrative about growing to be more vulnerable using my experience going to a public bath in Korea (jjimjilbang) - In this draft, I talk about my experience going to a public bathhouse and detail getting the infamous in loofah mitt scrub (until you confront a repulsive patch of curled gray threads of your own filth) until everyone is pink as mice (suggestion to vulnerability) and the men from all walks of life that come to clean themselves. i talk a little bit about how i hid myself/was very cold to others (not vulnerable) and how I've learned different things from different people in vulnerable conversations (businessman, \"gangster\" with tattoos\", the elementary school boys). I feel like  even talking about something from another culture like a public bath could turn some admissions officers away, so I'm super conflicted on this one.\n\naquascaping (the craft of arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks, stones, cavework, or driftwood, in an aesthetically pleasing manner within an aquarium) - In this draft, I talk a little bit about the actual process of building an aquarium and how I built a fish tank for a rec center for children with intellectual disabilities/how I felt like I was able to connect without words with a girl who had down syndrome. I'm struggling the most to come up with creative metaphors for values/things in my life within an aquarium (i.e. maintaining proper chemical levels, plant growth, rule of thirds) so it feels like it tells less about myself and more about a funny quirky hobby i have. I've heard that writing about a (unique) passion and extrapolating that to parts of yourself/values is generally successful and non-controversial, which makes me feel like i should invest all my time into this albeit how non-personal it feels right now.\n\nthank you for reading this, i should go to bed lol\n\nif you have any input, it would be TREMENDOUSLY helpful!",

For the first topic, personally, I think it could be even better if you explain this experience for 1/3rd or a maximum of half the essay  and then dive deeper into how that experience of yours has consciously, or sub-consciously shaped your experiences in the ways you interact with people.\n\nFor the second topic, if it is feeling impersonal, I'd say just think deeper about it. See what conclusions you're getting to in that essay and see how they have manifested themselves in your life. I mean, one hallmark of a good essay is that you learn something new about yourself in the process. \n\nHonestly, I could see you linking how that experience of yours in a public bath in Korea allowed you to be open with the girl in the rec-centre. But you know yourself better, so think think think and write something that you feel is true to yourself.",
