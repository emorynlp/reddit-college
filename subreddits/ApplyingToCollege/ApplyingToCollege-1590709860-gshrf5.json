  "text": "This man is a literal living legend. He has literally every video possible for math, chemistry, and physics. Some of his lessons will line up so conveniently with your school, **you'll think he was a previous alumni.** \n\nHis videos are so informative it's actually batshit insane. He will have **every** damn example an evil teacher will throw at you during a test. When I say this man covers everything, I mean it. He never assumes anything and always reviews concepts very briefly if you may have missed them. He will never let go of your hand when it comes to teaching you.\n\nYou will literally never have to open your textbook because of this man. Check his videos out. They helped me ace most of my math and science classes throughout high school\n\nEdit: my badddd I meant to write \nTHE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY TUTOR",

Reach for something good; whether you reach it or not doesn't matter as much as whether you've become a better person in this process. Doesn't make me like the quote any better tho :((",
