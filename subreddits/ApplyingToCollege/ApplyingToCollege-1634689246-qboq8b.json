  "text": "I've heard that some schools require official transcripts along with an application, while others only require official transcripts for people who get accepted. How can I tell which is which? I've taken some courses at my community college that aren't on my high school transcript, so I need to know which schools to send them to.\n\nMy current list is:\n\n* UCs\n* CSUs\n* ASU\n* UIUC\n* Georgia Tech\n* CMU\n\nWhich schools need transcripts with your application, and which ones only need it once you're accepted? Thank you!",
