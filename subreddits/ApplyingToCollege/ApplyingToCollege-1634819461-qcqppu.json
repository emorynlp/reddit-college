  "text": "I loved you. I loved the idea of you. I applied to ED'd Bowdoin. Applied to: Amherst, Hamilton, Grinnell, Colby, Colgate, vassar, you name it. I put my all into your applications... You said test optional has no say in my app... that was a lie...all of you rejected my ass and said well \"another college would love to have you.\" and YES another college DOES want me here. That college is MF UC BERKELEY. so take that small  LAC's with a big research school feel. I go to a real big boy research school and Im gonna get published someday, with the #1 chemistry school in the whole world, and no, UC Berkeley does not have limited resources, no berkeley is not \"cutthroat\" yes its stressful as hell sometimes, yes its fucking hard as hell, but the amount of opportunity I get is amazing. So THANK YOU to the 10+ LAC's who rejected me. I am at a better place now, and if ya'll ever shit on Berkeley ever again.. I'll come for you \n\n&#x200B;\n\njk but like literally a AO that came to my hs from brandeis literally started shitting on Berkeley and said that brandeis is better than berkeley in terms of research, and said that brandeis is a supportive community and way better than berkeley. BRO this place is the most supportive place- more supportive than my god damn HS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyways not to shit on LAC's at all- I just thought I had a better chance because I was a stem major, but yeah. DO NOT CLOSE YOURSELF OFF TO ANY OPTIONS!!!! \n\n GOOD LUCK EVERYONE AND GO BEARS \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to kind of rant / share my story.",

      "text": "So Brandies shitting on other colleges is not new? One AO from Brandies literally said in an info session that need-aware is far better than need-blind for those who need aid because AOs have to otherwise \"guess\" the EFC of applicants and admit them likewise. A total shitshow. The info session was a very big turnoff because they were just trying to prove how they were \"unique\" or \"better\" than other institutes (hint: they are not). \n\nThe interview I had for Brandies was super awesome though. The interviewer (also an AO) was super nice.",

They can infer with a high degree of accuracy who needs aid from the rest of your app. I could make a table of  $80,000 or so full cost need blind, meets full need schools showing: 1) % of FT students getting need based grants and scholarships and 2) the average award. \n\nThen I could add a couple of need aware schools. Without looking, 99% of people on here couldn\u2019t pick out the need aware schools.",

              "text": "True.\n\nComing to the conclusion that need-blind is somehow less benificial for students needing aid is wrong in my opinion. I highly doubt the ones reading the application (in a need-blind institute) care about how much aid an applicant needs. That's the job of the financial aid office. \n\nIf someone tells a group of people to accept the most qualified students for a college, they're going to do exactly that. They won't try to fit the whole class to a specific budget because that doesn't concern them.",

                  "text": "It really depends. In some cases being need aware can actually be beneficial to applicants and diversity as a whole. \n\nSchool A: 41% receive grants. $62,000 per award\n\nSchool B: 45% receive grants. $53,000  per award. \n\nBoth schools cost about the same and have similar selectivity. B\u2019s Pell eligible base is 4 points higher. A is aware in this case. B is blind. Both claim to meet full need. A is accepting more than 9 out of 10 of the need applicants school B is. So it\u2019s not like A has slammed the door closed on applicants in need. Actually, the door is 90% open. A also does a better job of reducing cost and keeping lower SES students out of debt. Which is better?  It\u2019s kind of hard to say. B is better at accepting students with need but A is more generous to those students and overall (grants per total FT students). \n\nAll schools have a grant/scholarship fund they dip into. AOs can infer from the rest of the app who requires need. All schools can define \u201cmeet full need\u201d however they wish. AOs are also human. They can place their thumbs on the scale just slightly on applications where it can reasonably be inferred an applicant requires need and they end up accepting just a few more students than a need aware school anyway. School A doesn\u2019t seem to be rejecting many applicants that the need blind school would accept. There is no transparency around the process for schools claiming need blind admissions. How do we even know they are need blind other than the statement that they are?  I\u2019m in the baseball hall of fame by the way. \n\nThis is the problem with the need blind tag. It\u2019s also why the college board big futures site did away with the need blind tag. There\u2019s no way to prove it and it really doesn\u2019t matter. What really matters is how many students get in and what the average award is at different income bands. Because those are numbers and claims are much more difficult to fake.",
