  "text": "So, October 23rd ACT score came back today. I got a 32(yes I know it\u2019s not that bad). \n\nThing is, I have already taken the SAT and I got a 1490, but the idiot in me decided to select score recipients for the ACT before I took the test(wanted to save some money).  I got my ACT back and I don\u2019t want to send the score because I feel like it will negatively affect my application. \n\n\nWhat should I do here? Or more accurately, what can I do? \n\nIs there a way to remove colleges from my recipient list or can I cancel the score somehow?\n\nI appreciate any advice you all might have. Good luck to all my fellow rising seniors during app season!",
