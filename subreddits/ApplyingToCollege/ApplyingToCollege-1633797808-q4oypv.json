  "text": "I feel like essay really shows my voice, and it's more casual than the essays that are on google. I don't use very big words or make my essay be complex, but I do write it in an artful way if that makes sense. Is there anyone else who struggles with this?",

This essay isn\u2019t an academic one but a personal one \u2014 you want to show the AOs your voice and your character. Using complex words for the sake of sounding more professional or like an academic paper can remove the humanity of the paper and, if used too frequently, make it very hard to read.",
