  "text": "On the BU site they say that though they\u2019re test optional this year, students who get their scholarships usually have an act score of above 33 and sat of above 1500. I\u2019m an intl and I have a 33 on the act. Should I apply test op or submit this score? Also do they care about which major you\u2019re applying for when they decide whether or not to give you the scholarship?",
