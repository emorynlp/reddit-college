  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a senior and I had a q abt Harvard vs Dartmouth. I\u2019m not sure if I should REA to Harvard or ED to Dartmouth. I\u2019d definitely have a higher chance of getting into Dartmouth just bc Harvard is Harvard. But I also love Harvard so much more (location, academics, overall vibe). I feel like Harvard is the place for me but I don\u2019t want to waste the ED if I\u2019m probably not going to get into Harvard and would have a better shot at Dartmouth. \n\nOn the other hand if I were to get into Dartmouth ED I\u2019d be ecstatic but I\u2019d also be wondering if I could have gotten into Harvard. What should I do?",
