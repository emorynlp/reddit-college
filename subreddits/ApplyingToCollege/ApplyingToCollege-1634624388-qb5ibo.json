  "text": "As I am typing this, I am currently sacrificing the time I should be using for my Rice Supplemental Essays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRice University is my dream school, to say the least, and much like many other posts I've read on here, I am scared of failure and being extremely overwhelmed. I applied to Questbridge but decided that I won't rank colleges since I want to ED for Rice, so that means I have to shorten that 800-word essay to a 650-word essay and perfect my 3 supplemental essays.   \n\n\nI've been reading and watching so many blogs, videos, and articles of Rice supplemental essay examples, and I've been extremely depressed reading/viewing them. They are always so poetic and vivid and such exciting stories/narrations that are depicted in their essays. I feel like I am also poetic and I have character but it's just quite frightening and scary to see others have way better essays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy stats and EC's are below average for Rice (won't be submitting SAT). So I feel like my odds are already quite low and this makes me feel that my essays need to be EXTREMELY unique and different from the crowd in order to compensate for my low chances. However, I'm also scared to make an essay that is completely far-fetched. I need my essays to be BETTER than the online examples, but they aren't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in a situation of condensed pressure. Not in terms of time, but in terms of my chances versus the stakes that are being held. I recently moved to Colorado (after 1st semester of junior year) so I lost my chances of getting into a UC school with in-state tuition, and the Colorado universities aren't that great. So it's either Rice, Colorado schools, or an expensive UC ticket price (I am low-income). I might apply to schools like Boston or USC just to push my chances, but no school is more perfect than Rice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs anyone else feeling extremely inadequate with their supplemental essays for their dream school?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone reading this wants to help or read my supplemental essays and give me advice, I'd gladly appreciate it since I am in need of unbiased perspectives.  \n\n\ntldr; feeling like my supp essays aren't good enough and worried about the possibility of not getting into my dream school and ending up at mediocre school.",
