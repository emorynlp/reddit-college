  "title:": "Applying to Rice ED (12 days left) Panicking",
  "text": "As I am typing this, I am currently sacrificing the time I should be using for my Rice Supplemental Essays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRice University is my dream school, to say the least, and much like many other posts I've read on here, I am scared of failure and being extremely overwhelmed. I applied to Questbridge but decided that I won't rank colleges since I want to ED for Rice, so that means I have to shorten that 800-word essay to a 650-word essay and perfect my 3 supplemental essays.   \n\n\nI've been reading and watching so many blogs, videos, and articles of Rice supplemental essay examples, and I've been extremely depressed reading/viewing them. They are always so poetic and vivid and such exciting stories/narrations that are depicted in their essays. I feel like I am also poetic and I have character but it's just quite frightening and scary to see others have way better essays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy stats and EC's are below average for Rice (won't be submitting SAT). So I feel like my odds are already quite low and this makes me feel that my essays need to be EXTREMELY unique and different from the crowd in order to compensate for my low chances. However, I'm also scared to make an essay that is completely far-fetched. I need my essays to be BETTER than the online examples, but they aren't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in a situation of condensed pressure. Not in terms of time, but in terms of my chances versus the stakes that are being held. I recently moved to Colorado (after 1st semester of junior year) so I lost my chances of getting into a UC school with in-state tuition, and the Colorado universities aren't that great. So it's either Rice, Colorado schools, or an expensive UC ticket price (I am low-income). I might apply to schools like Boston or USC just to push my chances, but no school is more perfect than Rice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs anyone else feeling extremely inadequate with their supplemental essays for their dream school?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone reading this wants to help or read my supplemental essays and give me advice, I'd gladly appreciate it since I am in need of unbiased perspectives.  \n\n\ntldr; feeling like my supp essays aren't good enough and worried about the possibility of not getting into my dream school and ending up at mediocre school.",

      "text": "Hey! What I say would help is to take the pressure off of yourself. Right now, you are concentrating too much thought into getting it perfect first try, which makes you unable to actually write things out. Have you considered that there may be a bias in people who share their essays online? These people may be especially proud of their vivid and poetic essays (and they may be a very creative type) and are more likely to share them online. A lot of essays are not poetic, vivid, or have exciting stories/narrations. Yours don't have to be either.\n\nLast year, I was in your position with the common app essay. I read so many examples and felt the need to write a first draft that perfect, one that emulated those online. But as the weeks went on, and with a final week to the deadline, I had to stop reading other people's essays. I wasn't getting anything out of them anymore, and it seems like you aren't too. STOP reading other people's essays. What you see are the final drafts, not the unpolished first, second and third drafts. Besides, different people write in different ways. Your writing style may not be the same as those you read in the examples. Focus on yourself, and put your own voice into the essay. The purpose of the essays are not to outdo other people, it's about YOU. What do you want Rice to know about you? A good essay doesn't need to be poetic; it just needs to represent you authentically. So think about it. What about you is most important for Rice to know?\n\nFinally, please don't devalue your in-state schools! These are good options to fall back on. I recently visited UC Boulder last summer and it was actually a really beautiful place with many opportunities from what I can tell. Even if they're not the best of the public universities, there are still many things to be liked about them.\n\nGood luck with your essays!",

I will be focusing on my own authentic voice, I need to depict that in a raw and refined (contradictory but you get the point lol). I will try not to devalue my in-state options and they will not deteriorate me from my ultimate dream of becoming a Physical Therapist. Thank you so much!!!!",
