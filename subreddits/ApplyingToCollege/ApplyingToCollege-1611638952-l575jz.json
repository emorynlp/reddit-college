  "text": "hi besties, today i\u2019m gonna vent to A2C cause y\u2019all are like my friends (but actually listen) \n\nanyways the tea is that my parents hate me. in fact they hate me so much that they transferred my 529 savings plan for college to my younger sister \ud83d\ude19\ud83e\udd2a (i\u2019m using emojis to cope). the *reason* was because I have severe anxiety and they told me I was unfit for college \ud83d\ude0e\n\nlol my parents and i never had the best relationship but this was a bit uncalled for. i guess i really can\u2019t be mad at them because it\u2019s their money, not mine, but yeah i\u2019m kinda stuck in this position right now where i\u2019m forced to go my local CC or go into an incredible amount of debt. \n\ndon\u2019t know how to end this post but umm cherish your parents?? be nice to them so they don\u2019t take your college savings fund??\n\nedit: wow guys thank you for the support \ud83e\udec2. i didn\u2019t think anyone would read it. i\u2019ve been thinking some more and my local CC isn\u2019t that bad, (the first lady, Dr Jill Biden, teaches there) and i do have decent grades(all As) so if I keep it up I might get a scholarship?? i\u2019m gonna work a job this summer to save up & apply to scholarships. either way i want to get this bag and leave \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nalso side note my parents are relatively rich (100k+ salary so idk how fin aid is gonna work if they refuse to pay their contribution). i think i might do a CS degree so i can pay off loans relatively quick but either way going into debt rn is not my best interest because it looks my family is not gonna financially support me.",

The professors have time for you, there\u2019s a ton of people you can talk to about what major you may want to study, it\u2019s easy to change majors and take the classes you\u2019re interested in...community college is awesome. Just make sure you have a plan and get your AA or enough to transfer in 2-3 years so you don\u2019t get stuck there too long. Your degree will still say your 4 year college, it\u2019ll just be half price and no one will know.",

Like, if he only has 20k I need to know that so I can figure out how to cover the rest of tuition. He won't even give me an estimate. He says its enough that I \"dont need to worry about it\" but he's a boomer, back when he went to college it was like 5k a year. I honestly don't think he knows how expensive college is, going by how outdated his veiws are on other elements of college (doesn't know about the new SAT, thought you needed to apply junior year for early decision...etc). And I mean, I know my parents sfinancial history, they arent, and have never been, wealthy. No way they have so much saved i can go to any college and \"don't need to worry about it.\" That would have to be at least 600k for my sister and I combined. \n\nAnd thats not the only reason I'm suspicious. He's very elitist, and when I talk about colleges that are less than t50 he always says \"I won't send you to a college like that.\" But like, thats vague, do you mean you won't pay? Or....but he refuses to have a sit down conversation about my future and this college fund, or specify what he means by this statement. Theres other reasons im distrustful as well, but I won't get into it because it's a long story and involves a lot of my personal family buissness",

As in you are receiving payments for your disability, based on your parents income?\n\nI would apply for it now if you haven't already. Doing so as a minor, will use your parents social security contributions, instead of forcing you to work decades to earn enough on your own. You have until age 20 I believe, but no matter what your parents say.... Apply for it anyways with your doctor's. You will be protecting yourself for your entire life, by being able to use your parents social security credits. (This absolutely dose not take anything away from your parents. All it does is uses their info, on your account like quarters worked full time, and contribution amounts. You having SSDI does nothing to their Social security payments in retirement.\n\nOnce you go to uni there are hundreds of different accomodations for those with disabilities, and social security disability payments will help cut costs.\n\nI would suggest talking to: your school counselor, social security department, and one of the future schools you are applying to.\n\nAs for your parents, if they believe you are unfit for University, have they applied for social security disability for you, if no, why not? Have they made contributions to a disability savings account for you? If no, why not? What do they expect you to do for earnings? You probably can't work at McDonald's... So what do they expect (just listen)? If they suggest taking care of you for the rest of your life, ask them about what you will do after they are dead? Is there funds that are yours, or will they simply be given to a sibling at some point without consulting you? \n\nI would leverage your position as much as possible. You have more power than you know, especially in a conversation with your parents.",

      "text": "OKAY SO I KNOW I'M QUITE A BIT LATE TO THIS POST SO SORRY but holy shit. First of all, sure, it may be their money, but good god, don't fucking hoard money over people emerging into adulthood \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41. It's traumatizing and fucked up to not support children and yank the rug out like that (my family is gonna support a small amount that has decreased slowly but surely, and have straight up told me debt and loans are inevitable, so I feel ya)\n\nCommunity college is a great option as many people have said, as it allows you to take housing out of the equation and get credentials on your way to a larger school, but I haven't seen people talking about out of the country schools yet. Depending on your anxiety, the toxic environment, and resolve to get tf out, I would also suggest applying to a school abroad (the main issue is plane tickets + language in the city, though most speak decent enough english). Non-english speaking countries like France, the Netherlands, and Germany often don't require pre-existing knowledge of their native languages to study though, and certain schools outside of the UK have a large percentage of both English speaking students and students from around the globe, so you're all in the same boat in a new country \ud83d\ude05. It's significantly cheaper overall as well (roughly +/-8000 euro depending on the school and scholarship, with some being completely free), and it's made even more cheap by the three year degrees I think like 90% of european schools have. It's a great option imho if you'd like to REALLY get away and want the independence as well. (Also, some abroad schools are degree area focused, so it's a fantastic option if you want to immediately go into your preferred workforce after graduation and go into it quicker, plus, application dates tend to be due more towards mid-spring to summer, so there's a ton of time). Most schools also have solid housing assistance as well.\n\nI'm not the best source for this though! There's others like \"Beyond the States\" or \"College Apps Abroad\" which are FAR more reputable than me\n\nBest wishes though! Good luck! I believe in you!!!",

Medication can help too of course if your doctor thinks it would be a good part of your treatment, but you need the therapy too.  \n\nI don't know what your parent's motivation is for taking away promised funding at this point in the college process, but I hope that if you do have anxiety you are on a path to being able to overcome the challenges that will come with living independently at college.",

I know it may be hard to see right now given what just happened, but I just wanted to let you know that you will always be fit for college as long as you want to go. I'm unsure if this helps, but I like to think that there's a path for everyone and that you will eventually find your way onto a solid path, with or without your parent's financial help. \n\nI come from a pretty privileged household, so I can't really offer advice on how to handle your family situation, but I do really hope you get out of it as soon as possible. I hope you have a good support system, but if not I guess you always have A2C! \n\nOn a final note, because I feel like your parents haven't said this to you in a while, I just wanted to let you know that I am proud of you, and that even though you're just a stranger, I would love to help pay for your college education and everyone else's. There's no reason that education should be as expensive as it is in the states, and it's heartbreaking for educational opportunities be taken away from deserving people due to financial circumstances. The college application process is incredibly draining, and for you to have made it through, especially while struggling with mental health, is something to greatly commemorate.",

      "text": "I am sorry that this happened.  It must feel like a statement of low confidence in you.\n\nHere are some facts (all written with the assumption that the fund in question is indeed a 529):  They didn't really \"take\" or \"give\" anything.  Most likely the 529 is in your parents' name.  Legally they are allowed to use it for any family member's educational expenses. To do that you do need to officially add someone as an eligible  beneficiary, but it doesn't make that person the owner of the fund--it just means your parents can use it for expenses associated with that person.\n\nFor example, in my family we have a 529 fund that we *talk about* as being \"my son's\" but in fact it belongs to us.  The statements come to us, we are the owners.  My son is listed as an eligible beneficiary, but my spouse is also listed (he went back to grad school and we used some of it for that) and if we wanted to add me or my niece or anyone else, it's just filing a new form.  End of story.  And none of those filings make the fund anyone else's.   \n\nSo a couple of takeaways from this:  Your sister doesn't control the money (just like you didn't control it when you thought it was reserved for your expenses).  Your parents could easily still use this to fund your education expenses down the road if their attitude changes, or their assessment of how college will go for you changes.",

      "text": "Idk if you have a therapist but I have two friends who faced a similar issue: Their parents all of a sudden decided not to pay for their education cause they thought because of their anxiety it would be wasting their money. The gag is, both of their therapists said the cause of their severe anxiety was their PARENTS. One of them busted her ass and didn't listen to any of the empty promises her parents offered her to stay home, got a scholarship and peaced out. She's happier than she had ever been and she said majority of her anxiety disappeared in her first two weeks. The other one took his parents offer of a car and a \"separate living space\" and is now worse than I have ever seen him. He's got terrible depression on top of the anxiety and fluked out his first semester of CC. Thankfully he wrote a letter and the CC let him back in but he really isn't doing great now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't to say that CC is bad, but if your anxiety is being caused by your parents, then staying home and doing CC isn't a great option. Go to a 4 year and if worse comes to worse then start a semester later in the spring to save up from working and apply for more scholarships (many people forget about that option). Online Customer Service jobs once you turn 18 pay pretty well too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry you're having to go through this rn, I hope it all works out for you :(\n\nEdit: Also, wanted to add that you could get loans only for your first year, universities offer scholarships for students already enrolled and there are plenty of private scholarships that are only available to sophomores or above. Paying off 1 year of debt instead of 4 is much more manageable.",

Just an idea.",

And even so, I think it\u2019s odd to have children if you can only love them if they are in a certain way. If you can\u2019t love your children unconditionally, don\u2019t have kids.

I also have a shitty parent, and I know some very helpful hacks for financial aid. ***PLEASE look into dependency override***; if there is a history of abuse, neglect, or absence, you may be able to waive their information at certain financial aid offices. Also feel free to PM me!\n\nEditing to add: if your parents are the cause of your anxiety, as you mentioned in another comment, and you have a therapist or counselor who can verify that, you could make a pretty good case. I did the one-parent equivalent, and my top choice school just told me that they aren't considering or asking for my father's finaid info.

My dad was all about raising me with tough love . He did pay for my education, but he swiftly cut me off as soon as I finished and I was struggling with nowhere to live with a boyfriend he didn\u2019t like. I finally got rid of the boyfriend, got a great job in Sf and got my act together , but it was only with his pure act of tough love  bouncing me out of his Russian hill apartment onto the streets that I was able to pick myself up and grow my business to the point where I am now the owner of a successful company , homeowner etc. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to understand why parents do it. But tough love sometimes is the way to train us to ultimately be successful in life . At 50 years old now, I thankfully look back on when he booted me out when I was 22. \nAlso something tells me you will come to this post when you\u2019re 50 and will be a happy , upper tax bracket earner. I wish you all the best in life .",
