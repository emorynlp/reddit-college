  "text": "Hi!! I'm planning to submit an art portfolio to Brown university with my early decision application and it says on the website that it's due on the end of the 4th but I only see regular decision, transfer, and questbridge options when I log into slideroom through Brown's link. Does anyone else have this issue?? Or suggestions? I've emailed them before but the responses take a while, understandably ig. \n\nThanks!!",
