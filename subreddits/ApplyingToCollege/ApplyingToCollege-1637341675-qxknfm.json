  "text": "I know this is a weird question but i\u2019m applying for bioengineering/bioinformatics/computational biology at the UCs and my academic subject is extremely specific and obvious to that. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m just writing what the college wants to hear but my interests are pretty hyper specific and that thing I\u2019ve done to further that are essentially just \u201cworking with biological models.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m worried about this but I am, i feel like I should\u2019ve wrote just about biology in general. Idk. I just don\u2019t want to sound formulaic and make it seem like I\u2019m trying too hard to get into that exact major (even tho i do want to get into that exact major and nothing else).",

I\u2019m in the top decile at my school based on UW gpa. Many ppl are v competitive here though and the top kids have 2-5 more hrs/aps than me. I also think UCSD has a bioinf pathway under biological sciences so i\u2019m keeping that as my alternative. Also our school offers 22 APs or something  \ud83d\ude33",
