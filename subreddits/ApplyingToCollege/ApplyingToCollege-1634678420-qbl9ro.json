  "text": "Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated\\~\n\nSo here are the scores:\n\nSAT: first time 1520, second time1490;; superscore 1530\n\nACT: 35 overall, but my reading breakdown is lower at 31\n\nWould it be better to submit both my SAT score and my ACT score, or to only submit the ACT bc it is better?  \n\n\nThanks!!",
