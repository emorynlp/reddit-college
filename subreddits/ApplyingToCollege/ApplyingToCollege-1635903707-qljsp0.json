  "text": "I sent my scores to UPitt and Drexel around 2 weeks ago and it still says pending and N/A for the scores being sent. I\u2019m apply EA to Drexel and I dont know if there\u2019s any grace period for scores and I\u2019ve emailed CollegeBoard about it, no response. I don\u2019t really wanna switch to test optional but i\u2019m afraid i\u2019ll get moved into the RD pool. Should I sent rush scores to Drexel and Pitt because I only have a week left for Pitt to get my scores and Idk what\u2019s going on with Drexel because my scores haven\u2019t gone through.",
