      "text": "It's definitely advantageous; schools love to say \"X percent of our incoming class is the first in their family to attend college.\"\n\nIs it going to get you into Harvard with a 2.5 GPA and a 14 ACT? No.\n\nIs it a demographic factor that colleges want to attract to their college to improve their equity and stats? Hell yes.\n\nBest of luck. :)",

          "text": "Thanks a lot. I have great grades and a decent SAT score. And yeah... decent ECs as well. At first, after being at this sub for a few months, I was so scared that I won't get into a good college. But now that I realized better that First-Gen is \"hooks\", it made me more optimistic than I used to be.\n\nThank you again :3 Good luck with your app :>",
