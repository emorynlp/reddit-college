I\u2019m in ib programme in school (did not take chem tho) and have good grades and want to apply\nto top stem colleges . I get credit for the score at almost all of them but I do not want to share my score as it may look bad in application. So can I just not self report it in common app but then show my score later when I get into colleges?",
