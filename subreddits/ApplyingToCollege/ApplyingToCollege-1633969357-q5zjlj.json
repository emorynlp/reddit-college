The problem is that this scheme tends to leave such students lacking fundamental base knowledge which is extremely important.\n\nUsing myself as an example; I have BS with a major in Geography and minor in GIS. I could have had three additional minors in History, and Ethnic and Gender Studies, and CS had I applied for them (due to class overlaps). I didn't because at that point, it would just be pedantic.",
