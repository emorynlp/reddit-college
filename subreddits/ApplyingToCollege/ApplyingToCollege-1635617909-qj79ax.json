  "title:": "Should I write about Columbia's Core?",
  "text": "For my supplements: \n\nI'm a bit torn as I've read/heard many argue that it's cliche, overused, and highly predictable. However, I've also seen students who write about the Core (in a personalized manner of course) have successful results. Columbia puts a giant emphasis on its Core as its premier, distinctive educational factor.  \n\nThe \"Why Columbia\" supplement is also only 200 words now instead of the usual 300 words so I have to be even more concise. I've written a response that I'm honestly happy with, but it makes no mention of the core. I do cite specific examples (courses, campus ECs and orgs) that I love about Columbia, but I'm afraid that omitting any mention of the Core will hurt me. I could probably string together some lines that are personal enough to my specific application about the Core, but that would mean removing some other lines about Columbia-specific activities I hope to partake in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated since my app is due Monday lol...",

      "text": "It's usually a good idea to MENTION that you're aware of and appreciate the rigor of Columbia's Core program, but I definitely wouldn't recommend writing an entire essay about it.\n\nColumbia knows that the Core program has eaten a few souls over the years, and acknowledging that you know how demanding it can be at some point in your application is pretty important.",
