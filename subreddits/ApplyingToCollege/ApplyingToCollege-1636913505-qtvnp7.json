      "text": "We have a very very high research output. We're 1 of 7 US universities to send instruments into space and 3rd most funded school from NASA. I'm actually working on a satellite that's due to launch in 2023!\n\nI think the high acceptance rate with the low graduation rate really holds the engineering program back in terms of ranking and perception. But the quality is definitely there",

      "text": "They\u2019re an absolutely massive school so they don\u2019t have to be selective. Acceptance rate is merely a function of class size to applicant pool; it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything more than that. ASU has a mission of educating the public, and they choose to do so in large numbers.",

      "text": "It\u2019s an area in which they have invested and made a priority.  You similarly see \u201celite\u201d universities low in the engineering rankings because they don\u2019t prioritize their engineering programs (T10-overall Chicago isn\u2019t ranked at all).   \n\n\nUC-Boulder is similar - 85% admitted but a slightly higher USN ranking. Or Purdue - 67% admitted but T10 engineering (though engineering admission rate is much lower than overall.)",
