  "text": "I am so confused and need help. I applied to penn state through the common app with a finance major and I\u2019m not sure if this automatically applies me to the school of business as other schools like UW Madison do. When I look up applying to the smeal college of business it says \u201cpreferred application method is through MyPennState account\u201d and I\u2019m not sure if I can apply to the smeal college of business the way I did it or whether or not I have to now apply again through my penn state account. Anyone that can help PLEASE help.",
