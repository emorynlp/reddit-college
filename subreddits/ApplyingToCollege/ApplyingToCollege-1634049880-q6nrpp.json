  "text": " \n\nHello all. I am fairly new to reddit, so I apologize if this is considered off topic or anything. I am just wondering about a question I had concerning the self report scoring. I have taken two SATs this year, one in April and one in May. I had sent the one in April after sending the test to some colleges (two of which I am applying to), but apparently I did not do the same with the one in May (according to the SAT website). I am wondering if I self-report the second score (which was better) if these two colleges would think I was lying about my self report scores since they have my previous test but not this one? I want to do a self report so I can save some money not having to pay to send my score to multiple universities. Again, I am sorry if this is off topic, I am just confused about this whole process. thanks",
