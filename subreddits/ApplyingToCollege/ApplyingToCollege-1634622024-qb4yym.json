  "text": "FUCK THIS CLASS YO\n\nFor reference most schools offer Physics E&M and Physics Mech as 2 separate 2-semester (1 year) classes, but oh no no no NO my school does BOTH in two semesters meaning we learn everything in HALF the time, and this shit is actually hard. Like worst class I\u2019ve taken ever. Worse than BC. Worse than APCSA. Worse than ur mom. And I cant even drop cus that would make me a pssy. So I wont. \n\nBut still yo this class sucks nuts",
