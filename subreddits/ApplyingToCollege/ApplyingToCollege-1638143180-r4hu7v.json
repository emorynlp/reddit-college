  "text": "I'm an artist, and I've spent countless hours working on my various art projects, but I'm not applying for an art-related major. That said, given that art is arguably my most dedicated EC, should I submit a portfolio (for the schools I can upload additional documents for)? Would it help me despite my selected major?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the vast majority of my art has been done solely as a hobby. I haven't won any major awards, nor have I had my art displayed in some prestigious gallery.",

      "text": "It's a good way to show that you aren't just all-academics! It's another dimension in your application that can help make AOs see you as a more 'full' person (for lack of a better term.) Submitting one definitely doesn't hurt, especially since you're not going to take an art major. Source: literally the same situation here haha",
