  "text": "I'm applying to a lot of out of state schools with stat ranges well below mine in the hopes of getting scholarships.\n\nWould submitting my FAFSA, and hence asking for need based aid, somehow affect my chances of getting merit based aid? I don't qualify for enough need based aid, and I'm worried they'll just give me that instead of any scholarships, since it's a smaller amount.",

Because I haven't really seen any mention of this on the applications I have filled on the CommonApp.\n\nAlso, do you think the FAFSA hurts my chances of getting merit based aid?",
