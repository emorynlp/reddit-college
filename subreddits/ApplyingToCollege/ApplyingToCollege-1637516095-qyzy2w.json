  "text": "So I took some high school level courses while I was in middle school like Algebra 1 and Spanish 1, and they show up on my transcript. Because I took these courses in middle school I essentially have to report them in the other courses section, but Commonapp doesn\u2019t let me add the school I want because it\u2019s not a high school.",
