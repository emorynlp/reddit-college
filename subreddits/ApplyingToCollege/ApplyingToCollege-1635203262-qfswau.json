  "text": "is it really bad if the first quarter of my senior year i get a b/b+ in ap calc ab and ap lit? i\u2019ve never gotten a b before but this yr has been the hardest for me by far, also my school only puts semester grades on the transcript so i could get it up by semester but this quarter i\u2019ve been struggling, how much does this matter? also i\u2019m planning on majoring in poli sci and i have an A in ap gov so does that make a difference",
