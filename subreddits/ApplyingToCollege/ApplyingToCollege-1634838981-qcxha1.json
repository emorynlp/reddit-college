  "text": "My school has no alumni because my class will be the first class to graduate, and we needed a school profile to send to the colleges through the counselor. so, I worked with help of other students on making it and it took me time and effort to finish it. My question is can I mention that in the activities or not? I feel like it may impact the school negatively, so what do you guys think about it?",
