  "text": "Our interview was supposed to start at 8AM Hongkong Time, which is 7AM in my country. However, due to a misunderstanding of the time zone conversion, I mistakenly thought the starting time is 9AM in my country. I ended up being UNKNOWINGLY late for the interview, and the alumnus had to call me.\n\nI said sorry to her immediately in the call, and also apologized to her for my mistake in the post-interview thank you letter. At the end of our interview, she said something like \"there'll be so many opportunities on offer for you in your area in the future, no matter which college you'll go to\". She also replied to my thank you letter: \"College is such a special experience. I hope you will cherish it wherever you may be.\"\n\nI'm freaking out and wondering whether her sayings are an indication of a bad impression or even a rejection from Penn. What do you guys think?",

      "text": "My friend is an interviewer for Harvard. He told me that the students he has met are just amazing and way ahead of where he was at that age. And yet none of them have ever gotten in even though he wrote glowing reports. He chalks it up to the urban California competition levels and legacy status influencing those spots. He was a rural Midwestern applicant and in that part of his state few people were interested and prepared to apply to an Ivy.\n\nI\u2019m sure he writes letters like this to discourage people from getting their hopes up too high",
