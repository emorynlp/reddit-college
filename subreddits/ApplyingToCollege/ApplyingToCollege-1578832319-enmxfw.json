I know juniors, and even sophomores, in my school who put off fun opportunities with friends and relationships because they're already focusing on post-graduation plans. Though that can be wise sometimes, don't let college become your life. You might not find the thing you want to write your essay about until weeks before the deadline, anyway! Start early so you can give yourself an easier time later, but don't lose sight of what's really important in life (friends, family, self-care, hobbies, stuff+people you love).",
