  "title:": "What Should I Do To Get Accepted Into a Top College?",
  "text": "Hello! I am a freshman in high school, and I am currently trying to find more things to do that would help me get accepted into a top college, like MIT. I have been reading articles online, and there\u2019s so many things that it says I need to do, and I feel overwhelmed. Could someone give me a straightforward list of things I can do to get into a good college?",

      "text": "You've probably already seen these, but anyway.\n\nFrom the MIT website: [https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/)\n\nIf you haven't already read this, I think it's worthwhile: [https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying\\_sideways/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)\n\nIf you're dead set on grinding away for top colleges for the next four years, then go with the lists in other comments. It's good to have top grades, challenge yourself, pick ECs and stick with them if you can (commitment), etc. \n\nTake the time to explore new hobbies and passions, figure out what drives you, find subjects that are so interesting that you could talk for hours about them. Passion can be a big thing in college apps, especially if you really pursue it beyond the classroom. Plus, it may help you stand out more than the students with perfect academics. \n\nWhatever you do, just don't put yourself through 4 years of hell if your only reason for it is to get into a top college. It's not worth it. Don't do things that you're not passionate about just because you think that they'll look good for colleges. It's a lot of pressure to put on yourself, and at the end of the day, even if you cure cancer, there is absolutely no guarantee that you'll get accepted into a top college. There's no perfect checklist or formula for acceptance (even though there are things that may help). \n\nSo, enjoy your time in high school, challenge yourself and prepare for college, but don't base your entire high school existence off of it. It's not an easy process to navigate, but you'll find your way. Good luck!",

      "text": "The standard stuff:\n\n1. Get very good grades.  Don't need a 4.0, but the closer the better.\n2. Take the hardest classes.  You don't need any specific number of AP classes, but if an AP option is available in one of the five core areas (language, math, science, social studies, foreign language) then you should probably choose it over the non-AP option.\n3. If you're planning to study STEM then take a lot of math, physics, CS, etc.\n4. Do really well on the SAT or ACT.  Esp. on the math section.\n5. Be the kind of student whose teachers will write him/her a superlative recommendation letter.  Note: this always entails more than just getting a good grade in the class.\n6. Do the \"most impressive\" stuff you can outside of class.  That *could* mean \"winning awards\", but it doesn't have to.\n7. Learn to write interesting essays that cast you as the sort of student MIT would like to admit.  Prerequisite to the above: understand what kind of student MIT is actually looking for.",
