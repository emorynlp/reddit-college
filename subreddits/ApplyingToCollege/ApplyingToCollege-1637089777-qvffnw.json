              "text": "when you apply ED, you sign a contract saying that if you get in you will go to that school. if you get in and decide not to go, it may negatively impact you getting into other schools or you may get rescinded by another school you chose to go to instead of your ED school. This is more flexible if your ED school doesn\u2019t meet your financial need. When you apply EA, you don\u2019t sign a contract like this. if you get in, you don\u2019t HAVE to go. If you apply to EA AND ED schools this could happen:\n\n- you get into EA schools and your ED school. of your acceptances, you must go to the ED school.\n\n- you get into EA schools but not your ED school. of your acceptances, you can pick where you\u2019d like to go",
