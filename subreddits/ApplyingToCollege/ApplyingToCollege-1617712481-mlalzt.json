  "text": "For most of the time I've been on A2C, Dartmouth has been one of the most beat up on schools here.  \"The mascot's a keg.\"  \"Have you seen the problematic Google doc on diverse students' experiences?\" \"Middle of nowhere.\" \"Fake ivy\" \"ion wanna attend your bum-ass school.\" [OK, just checking, that last one was a different school.]\n\nAnd now the steady drip, drip, drip of 79 days waiting for an acceptance has washed all that away.  One simp and their dedication elevating  Dartmouth to the point where thousands are asking only one simple question.  Will they?\n\nDartmouth should admit Dartmouthsimp for that reason alone.",
