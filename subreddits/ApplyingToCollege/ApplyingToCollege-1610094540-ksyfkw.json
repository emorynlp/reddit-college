  "text": "This girl from school invited me over to her house for a study session. I\u2019ve had all the same classes with her for the past three years (we\u2019re juniors) but she\u2019s quiet, and we\u2019ve never really talked. I was surprised when she asked me over, but I accepted to be nice.\n\nWe were studying in the living room and I had to use the bathroom, so I went down the hall to find it, but took a wrong turn into her bedroom. And you wouldn\u2019t believe what I found. Right when you open her door, there\u2019s a bulletin hanging on the wall with the names of the top 10 students in our grade (we do class rank and I\u2019m in the top 10, and so is she). That itself isn\u2019t all that creepy I guess. Maybe it\u2019s some weird sort of motivation thing. \n\nBut she has a bulleted list beneath each name of weirdly personal information. Under mine, she had \u201cPlays basketball, involved in FBLA, interested in UChicago/Northwestern, strong in English class, weak in math class, multiple state level awards.\u201d I was just shocked and super shaken up. I didn\u2019t even know she paid any attention to me at all. Like, I was seriously scared. It reminded me of something from 48 Hours. I made an excuse and left quickly afterward.\n\nIs she dangerous? Like, is this some short of hitlist? Is she planning to harm me?",

Without more information on her life we will never know which is more likley but these are the only 2 I would ever entertain as the reasoning behind. Hopefully when she goes off to college she gets both her choice of school and good friends. Highschool is hell, looking back on it I wish I had taken the opportunity to diversify my friendships with diffrent people. I was too preoccupied with partying and staying in my circle, while fun and memorable, probably not the healthiest of options in building friendships.",

Part of making friends is to show interest and retain information about the other person, and if you don\u2019t naturally do that, you make write those things down in profiles that would look super creepy to an outside observer. I\u2019ve had to do that myself because my working memory is shot, but I want to remember to check in on friends with sick relatives or major events going on in their lives. Think a line of names with notes like \u201caunt is dying\u201d next to them.\n\nI get why you\u2019re shaken and I\u2019d probably be shaken too.

Leave it at that.  Do not involve the school unless she says something specific about harming you or someone else.

To be honest, I think most people mentally have a record somewhat like this of the \u201ctop dogs\u201d at their school, like \u201coh x did y or has z SAT score\u201d. It\u2019s natural for people to compare themselves, and noting down what the other competition have done to understand how you stack up kinda makes sense. Of course doing it physically with pictures is pretty creepy, but maybe she\u2019s a bit of an arts and crafts person? Maybe her parents make her do it (when my uncle was in school a lot of the kids had spread sheets of the test scores of other kids to see how they stacked up)?\n\nIn conclusion, is she an axe-murderer?

All my AP/honors peers had a \u201cwell rounded\u201d balance of school, extra curricular clubs/sports, and volunteerism. I started my junior year feeling absolutely shell shocked because I had NONE of that. Guidance from teachers and counselors couldn\u2019t give me proper advice on how to get myself \u201ccollege application ready\u201d \u2014 so I quite literally looked up to my peers who had Ivy Leagues on their dream schools list to figure out what I could do for myself. I was super embarrassed to feel behind my peers so I was quiet in my observations. I don\u2019t remember formally writing anything down like what this girl has written here, but it definitely reminds me of the list I had in my head of the smart, successful kids in my AP classes. \n\nI wish I was braver at the time to admit I was having a hard time keeping my head above the water, and I was jealous that my peers could swim so seemingly easily. \n\nShe sounds like she\u2019s anxious about college or fitting in to me. If it had anything romantic/hateful on it I would consider that a huge red flag to a scarier issue. But this is your life, remember to trust your gut.",

This more reads like a lonely girl who has zero social skills and wants to understand what makes her classmates (especially those who she shares the top 10 with) \u201cnormal\u201d and successful.  That said, it does seem she\u2019s crossed some lines in gathering information about you (and others) without their knowledge, but I\u2019d wager to guess that\u2019s just a symptom of her being an intelligent person who is extremely socially unintelligent.\nTake this with a grain of salt as I obviously have no personal involvement with this, and I could be completely wrong... but I doubt you\u2019re in any danger of physical harm.  You\u2019re just the subject of a study of sorts, granted a strange one, and if you have concerns you can either voice them to her directly or (if you\u2019re really feeling uncomfortable) a trusted faculty member.  \n\nRemember to be kind above all.  Don\u2019t ostracize this person for this weird quirk.  Think of it this way:  if she isn\u2019t a danger to you or others, you\u2019d just be further alienating an already alienated girl.  If she *is* a danger to you or others, you\u2019d be poking the bear.  If you truly believe it to be malicious in nature, you need to go to an adult to get this person help.",

Not only was everyone tryna subtly (and not so subtly) get the deets on everyone else, but they also would often write it down. I remember poring over/speculating other peoples stats with my classmates, us included. Even now the ones I\u2019m still in contact with will mention stuff like stalking each other\u2019s linkedins casually.\n\nLol it\u2019s just weird to me that this isn\u2019t normal I guess.",

      "text": "I suspect she's just kinda weird and has notes about other successful people in her sphere as a way to try and connect with them and improve herself. It seems cold and calculated, and maybe it is... but some people aren't as naturally casual and easygoing when it comes to connecting with others. Maybe she's also just more dedicated and strategic about her goals. \n\nIf all the notes were simply observations about your interests and strengths, I would t be sketched out... weird? Yeah, a little. But not scary. \n\nNow, if it was stuff like negative things in your personal life that you could see somebody using as leverage/blackmail, like if you had a family member addicted to pills, or got a DUI recently, or weird interpersonal relationship stuff with classmates, then THAT would be serious cause for alarm.\n\nwhen I moved into my first house that my girlfriend and I bought a year and a half ago, I introduced myself to a lot of my immediate surrounding neighbors in the first week or so, and proceeded to go home and make a little file that was just a lot of high-level/general notes about each house around us so I could better remember things about the people who I now lived near. It was just stuff that came up in the first 2-5 minute chat we had when I introduced myself... Stuff like their name, their spouse's name if they had one, if/how many kids or pets they had, etc... I noted who had a spouse that worked from home full time so I could know who would be around most of the time if ever something strange happened or there was some kind of emergency. My across-the-street neighbor is a woman in her late 50's/early60's, and I know she has a few siblings that live in town, that her husband travels a lot, and she lives in the house with her elderly mother. They have a daughter in college who sometimes comes by and parks on the street, etc... \n\nit's good to know things about people around you even if you don't really socialize with them a lot, and it can be hard to keep track of stuff like that. I think my generation (I'm 28) and younger generations have become very disconnected from each other in our immediate real surroundings/communities. Neighbors use to be largely your friends, or at least people you spoke to regularly in passing. Seems like now it's rarely the case. I'm trying to just be more connected to my neighbors even if not by being well acquainted... your classmate's behavior seems like the sort of behavior that successful businesspeople and politicians practice when they have many faces and contacts that they have to be able to navigate professional relationships with in order to get ahead, but don't know any of them all that well on a personal/friendship basis to be able to do so naturally.",
