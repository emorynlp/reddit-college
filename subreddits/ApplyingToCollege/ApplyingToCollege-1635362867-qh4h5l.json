  "text": "Just randomly remembered lean on by Major Lazer yesterday... Ah, what a time.\n\nIt was one of the first English songs I had heard...

I'd just randomly open YouTube and search \"lean on\" and then listen to the catchy song whose lyrics I didn't understand while watching the white girl and the Indian women do some weird dance... I don't know what exactly I miss but I miss it a lot...\n\nP.S. Yes I assumed all those women were Indian. I was dumb.",
