  "text": "I submitted my ED application last Saturday on the 30th and I'm still stressed. I was hoping I could just put it out of my mind until like at least December, but I keep checking my portal for like no reason. I'm worried I'm only gonna get more attached to my ED school, and then more disappointed when I most likely don't get in. Does anyone that's been through this process have tips? Will this fade in like a week, or is it just stress until the decisions come out?",
