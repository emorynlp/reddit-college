  "text": "My earliest deadline was November 1 and it\u2019s now November 25 and none of my recommendations are in. Is it okay if they are in late? I\u2019m nervous af. One of my teachers emailed me asking when the deadline is and I didn\u2019t see it until today and the other teacher is still working on it because I didn\u2019t tell him the deadline. Am I fucked?",
