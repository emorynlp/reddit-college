  "text": "I\u2019m sending in my scores for colleges but I\u2019m not sure if I can self report or if I need to send in an official report. Some don\u2019t require until enrollment, but at the same time they don\u2019t consider it or it\u2019s not official unless you send in the official (paid) report?! I don\u2019t want to waste the money if I don\u2019t need to, but I want my scores considered. \nAm I alright to self report or do I really need to submit an official report?",

      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. If the college accepts self-reporting in the app or portal prior to admission, then self-reporting is fine. For colleges that accept self-reported scores, you would only send the official report if you are admitted and decide to enroll.",
