      "text": "If im not mistaken, there is a section of the common app that wants you to talk about how covid affected you (if it did at all). In the additional information section you could write it there as well. Imo just be direct. You dont need a fancy essay about how you overcame family financial difficulties, death by pandemic, etc. state it straight up. They want to know how to adequately judge you based on ur circumstances\n\n\"I had issues maintining my focus during school because of my family's financial situations. I've made up my schoolwork since then, have tackled a new job to help with finances, but it had still heavily affected my performance during junior year.\"\n\nBut please correct me if im wrong",
