Those who apply from underrepresented countries do have an edge as universities like to see diversity in their applicant pool, but that definitely doesn't mean you're a shoe-in or have high chances if you don't meet some sort of academic threshold based on your circumstances or you have little to contribute to the university's student environment.",
