  "text": "I'm writing my common app essay on starting my own business, the challenges I experienced and what I learned, but now I don't exactly know what I should write about in my supplemental essay for UPenn. I want to go into business, so should I talk about another experience that sparked my interest in business? \n\nShould I even talk about starting a business as my common app essay or should I change my topic?",
