They won't increase space which will lead to intense competition all around the board.\n\nby the way I am starting to see a lot of sophomoes in my ap bio/ap chem classes. im a junior and this wasnt normal",

Wicked smart people come here to brag. And no, I don\u2019t think 1600s will become average as wealth inequality and lack of resources in many areas of the us and the world exists. Also even with sufficient resources many simply will not get perfect scores.",
