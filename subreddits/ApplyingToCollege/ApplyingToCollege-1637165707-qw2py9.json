  "text": "So I THOUGHT I was signed up for the November SAT, but I was accidentally signed up for the fucking LSAT - the LAW SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST. I'm so fucking pissed because UC deadlines are coming up and I have NO TEST SCORE UNDER MY BELT! If it means anything, I got a 179 on the LSAT which is the 2nd highest score possible, I only missed 1 question, and this is without any prep at all. NOW I KNOW WHY MOST GUYS IN MY TESTING ROOM HAD PROMINENT, THICK AND MANLY FACIAL HAIR AND SOME WERE BALD, AND THE WOMEN HAD PURSES AND HEELS AND SHIT. I WAS SITTING THERE WITH MY NINJA TURTLE PAJAMAS CONFUSED AS FUCK.",
