  "title:": "Tell me every reason not to apply ED to Amherst",
  "text": " I'm an international junior who is kinda falling in love with Amherst, but still has my doubts about applying ED. My intended major is econ, I've got decent stats(1590 on the SAT, 95%+ my whole life) and good enough ECs I guess?([https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances\\_for\\_economics\\_international\\_student/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances_for_economics_international_student/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \\-more details)  \nAmherst is one of my top choices because:\n\n1. It's need-blind\n2. Has great graduate placement\n3. I like the idea of a small school where you can form deeper relationships with everyone, and everyone seems to be sharing anecdotes of how close the students are with each other and the professors\n4. No grad students, so no TAs and better research+ internship opportunities\n\nBut I'd like to have a balanced viewpoint before I make the decision to apply ED(Plus there's always the \"what if by some crazy stroke of luck, I get into like, Harvard or something? Will I regret my decision then?\"). Applying ED would probably boost my odds significantly(I've been told they fill a third of their class with ED), but still. What do you think are the absolute worst things about amherst which I need to keep in mind before making a decision?",

      "text": "First, I love Amherst, but you wanted negatives. \n1. Winters are pretty cold. Snow melts, re-freezes and covers the walk ways (I fell a lot). Snow piles up and turns brown and dirty. I was a California kid showing up in Massachusetts, so the weather was a big shock.  \n2. Pretty small and can get clicky. \n3. Not a ton to do in Western Mass, so social stuff is really focused on campus.  So the social scene is off-campus house parties with bad beer. Doubt it has changed much, but ask around. \n4. Not a real sports culture, so you don\u2019t get as much school spirit around games.",

          "text": "1. This might be a bit of problem for me too. I've grown up in a desert lmao. But this would probably be a problem on most of the east coast?\n2. Oh I've no problem with small. My whole grade has around 55 students, and I live in a small town where you can get to any place in town in around half an hour.\n3. I'm not planning on drinking and going to wild parties, so that shouldn't be a HUGE problem.\n4. I'm a pretty athletic person, but I don't follow sports like football(I ain't calling it soccer. Just...nope.) or american football which I assume are the major college sports in the US? I'm more of a martial arts, basketball, shotput person. So.....shouldn't be a big deal either. But thanks, I'll ask around.",

              "text": "I read your Chance Me and I must say that Amherst would be very lucky to have you. As a parent of two Mammoths...I can't give you negative things about applying ED, IF you truly think Amherst is the school for you.\n\n1. Yes there is such a thing called Winter. There is also Spring, Summer and Fall...and the campus is beautiful during each season. During Winter a favorite past-time for students (and quite a few people from the town) is to sled down hill. FYI, my favorite season is Fall...I was there just this weekend and the foliage was beautiful.\n2. Amherst the town is definitely not New York (or even Boston). But it isn't in the middle of corn fields either. With UMass nearby (and Smith, Holeyoke and Hampshire) there is a lot happening - concerts, trader joes, even a Tibetan restaurant.\n3. Some kids drink, others don't. Neither of my kids have felt pressured to drink, smoke or whatever. But I do hear that it is available for those who do.\n4. Mention Williams...and you will immediately get school spirit.\n\nAll kidding aside, both my kids absolutely love Amherst. I must warn you that the academics there is pretty intense. However, the culture is very collaborative. The faculty is very good and the alumni are amazing. The president of the school is LGBTQ and the community is pretty supportive.",

Another person also posted how after admittance to Amherst, they checked their file and their need was mentioned on the top of it, which means the AOs saw it too while deciding whether to admit them or not.",
