  "text": "I accidentally put \"Ms.\" instead of \"Mr.\" for my dad's title in the family info section...\n\nHow grave of a mistake is this? My biggest concern is conveying inaccurate information about my parents' gender (though, I did designate my dad as \"Father,\" and the Ms part was only in front of his name). \n\nI unfortunately already submitted my ED app. Is this something I should contact my ED school about, or do you think they will recognize this as a typo?",
