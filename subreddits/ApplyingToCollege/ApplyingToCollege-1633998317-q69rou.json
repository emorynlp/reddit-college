  "text": "Some kid asked me how I was still in geometry as a junior. At my high school you typically take geometry as a sophomore. But due to the very fast pace of my class last year, having little consistency (thanks COVID), and a then undiagnosed mental health condition I failed geometry.\n\nI tried to recover the credit over the summer. But the fact that you didn\u2019t have anyone physically teaching you caused me to struggle again. This year I\u2019m in a slower paced geometry class and am on track to pass for the semester with a B. \n\nI had to take the longer route, and I struggled along the route. But I will still get to my destination.",

I often find myself losing motivation, so it\u2019s inspiring to see someone like you who is so motivated to get to their destination. Best of luck in your studies! :)",
