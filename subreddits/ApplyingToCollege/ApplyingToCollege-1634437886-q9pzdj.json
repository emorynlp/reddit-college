              "text": "While HEOP as a whole program has pretty specific income requirements, individual colleges can also prioritize what they're looking for in students. Generally you'll need to be a good student who will add to the college community in some way. I'll also add that, in my experience, it's actually sometimes difficult to find students in our applicant pool who meet the HEOP income requirements - so if you do meet them, you'll have a bit of an advantage.",
