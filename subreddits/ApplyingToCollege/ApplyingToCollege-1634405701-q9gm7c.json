  "text": "I\u2019m a low income URM attending a private high school on a scholarship. I took the PSAT today. All of my friends were bragging about how their parents lied and paid doctors so that they could be given extra time. Meanwhile, me and people who are being honest are working our asses off and struggling to finish the test in time. This whole system is just so unfair.",
