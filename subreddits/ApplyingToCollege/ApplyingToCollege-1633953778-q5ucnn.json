  "text": "Hey guy, I'm a long time A2C member. It's been almost 2 years that I've been on this sub now but I took a break in the middle after decisions came out. I applied to colleges in January and got rejected from almost every single one and waitlisted at the rest. That really put a damper on my attitude towards college admissions but I wanted to give it one more shot.\n\n\nI had applied to 30 schools varying from 5-25% acceptance rate and since I didn't get in last time, this time I'm looking for some more reasonable colleges that aren't just Ivy's and T10s but still have a good Stem/CS program. I unfortunately need close a full ride so my prospects aren't the greatest to begin with :/ but I'm ready to give my all into one last attempt\n\n\nI have a 95/100 gpa (Top of my class but only 85 students so ehhhh), 33 ACT (retest scores incoming) , lots of club leaderships and student government roles, and I do Debate, MUN, quizzes and Dramatics as my main ECs that I have some regional and state level honors in. Any colleges that you reccomend? So far I've found UMiami, Colgate, and Kenyon as targets and Case Western, Tufts, Emory, Notre Dame and Cornell(ED) as reaches. Anyone have any advice?",
