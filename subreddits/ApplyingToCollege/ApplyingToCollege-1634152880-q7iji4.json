  "text": "I know you probably have so much more to do then read my super long post, but I\u2019d really need some support.\nIt\u2019s kind of a reflection on people who cheat, so a very common topic we can say.\n\nSooooo for the past five years of high school (I\u2019m not from the US) I did my best not to cheat. It was my moral, and even if people got better grades I tried my best to stick to it. It was very important to me to maintain some kind of \u201cintegrity\u201d (if we can call it like this). \nI was 100% sure that people who cheated wouldn\u2019t have gotten far, and so even if my friends sometimes got better grades than me, I really did my best to stay very far away from cheating.\nBut then online school started with covid, I began to be very sad all the time, we had, like everyone, too much work to do and I didn\u2019t want to do anything. It was so hard for me to watch all of my friends (they became more and more) cheat and get good grades (even if my teachers knew they were cheating) and I was studying so hard to get my usual grades (which were very very good but like some people did the same thing with no effort at all). \n\nIn particular, I wanna talk about one of my friends. Yes, he is my friend. I don\u2019t hate him for what he did. I don\u2019t want to make fun of him. I always respected his choice. Because in the end it was his choice. But I don\u2019t understand what happened.\nSo this friend of mine cheated on basically every test. Teachers knew that he cheated. Some of them saw him cheating, some of them didn\u2019t. But no one never said anything that counted. They said normal things like \u201ccheating is bad\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t cheat\u201d. He is a smart guy and he is very friendly, so teachers even kind of admired him.\nOn my part, I didn\u2019t care. I studied my things (as it should be, I know) and I really couldn\u2019t care less. \nBut then covid came. All of my other friends begin to cheat even more, and then teachers couldn\u2019t know who was cheating and who wasn\u2019t. So even if I didn\u2019t cheat, they could think that I was actually cheating. But that was still fine for me, because in my mind I knew I didn\u2019t. \n\nThis was until, one day, one of my teachers, after asking this friend of mine a question, and after his correct answer, she said he was so brilliant and he was the best student of the class (she said he was a \u201cmodel student\u201d). If you\u2019re wondering, it wasn\u2019t a super hard question.\nThis broke me. Really, it broke me. Maybe it was the covid situation that made me sadder than ever, maybe I was just tired of everything, but I couldn\u2019t understand how a teacher could tell to a person who cheated on all the tests that he was the best of the class (I can assure you she knew he cheated because one day she asked him how he could cheat without being caught).\nFor five years, I did my best in everything, I had been the model student, the best of my class, and then this guy (to whom, again, I\u2019ve nothing against, he is my friend! I just don\u2019t understand the behavior that teachers had towards him) is being told that he is so smart and so perfect (and I can confirm that the teacher was 100% serious when she said it). Why? Why? He was never punished for his cheating. He really is a smart guy, so he managed to get away with everything and pass every single class. \n\nNow, he told me that he got into one of the most difficult universities departments in my country and will proceed like nothing happened his university career. \n\nWhy? \n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWill he win a Nobel prize? \n\nHe is charismatic, clever and he is able to seduce people whenever he wants. He could win a Nobel prize. \n\nPlease tell me what you think.",
