  "text": "submitted ED yesterday and now i\u2019m rethinking everything haha\n\nmy ECs and personal essay are VERY aligned with my intended major, but on my supplementals for some schools i definitely went for different angles & didn\u2019t necessarily talk about subjects that align perfectly with my major/career path, is this ok???? at the time the essays felt genuine and right because i didn\u2019t want to seem like a machine with only one interest, but now i feel like they will make me seem underqualified esp. watching all these college videos of people\u2019s crazy good supplementals :((((",
