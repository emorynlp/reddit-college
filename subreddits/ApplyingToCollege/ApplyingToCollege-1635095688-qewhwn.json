Am i okay in assuming i don\u2019t have to because they aren\u2019t the IB subject tests, but the full diploma?",

The above doesn't sound as though reporting is a requirement, but also see the college's application instructions for internationals. There is also a category for Senior Secondary Leaving Examinations, if that sounds relevant to you.",

I suggest poking around in the testing section, playing with drop down menus and types of tests, to see if any of the tests you are thinking about are mentioned anywhere in the testing section.",
