  "text": "Okay so let's say I got accepted to a college I applied with early decision. But my senior year grades decreased heavily due to a school change (moved to a rich community as an immigrant). How would that affect admission to the college?",

          "text": "I mean there are multiple reasons. First of all, we moved from a very diverse community to a very rich and non-diverse community, if that makes sense. I am the only immigrant at my school or one of very few. I don't think I should be compared to these students. Secondly, I am not used to changing schools at all. This is my second school change ever in my life. The first one was when I came to United States at 8th grade and my grades were bad at that time too. Third, I have no time during school to meet with my teachers for help. Fourth, some of my teachers ignore my help emails, even though my school is listed as an A grade school. Fifth, the homework turn-in is extremely confusing for new students, and I got no help. Sixth, I started the school a week late so that had some impacts too. There are probably more things but these are the things that came into my mind.",
