  "title:": "What should I major in if there\u2019s no bioinformatics/biotech major?",
  "text": "If i\u2019m applying to a school that does not have biotech/engineering/informatics majors, what should I apply for? I doubt I can apply for CS because my personal statement is very bio related (literally about microorganisms). Should I apply for Microbiology, biomedical engineering (but that\u2019s more mechE), regular bio (particularly hate this idea lol), molecular bio? Could I double major in bio and CS? (I plan on getting a Masters too) Please help!! \n\n\nFor reference, I\u2019m specifically looking at a couple CSUs.\n\nEdit: I just found out CSUs don\u2019t take Personal Statements. This makes things even more confusing for me.",

It can be ChemE, MechE, EE/CE, or CS in nature -- often many of these in one department.\n\nIf a school doesn't have BioE, biotech, bioinformatics, or computational bio (or even biostats) -- that is, the subjects you want to study -- maybe don't apply there?",

              "text": "Hard? So long as your grades are very good, a masters would not be too hard to get into. However, you will be in the mix with all the cut-throat pre-meds, so I wouldn't count on good grades coming easily or even with mild difficulty. Given that, I would say it is likely to be hard.\n\nYou would also have to go to grad school because a bio degree by itself is not valuable in the job market. (You'll teach high school? You and everyone who opted out of med school. Oh, and you'll need a masters.)\n\nCal Poly SLO has biomedical engineering. Maybe look into that? But I wouldn't apply to CSUs just because they are targets. If they don't have what you want, they're irrelevant. Also, you could look at doing CC and then the TAG transfer to a UC.",

You can actually cook up a statement on how you can use CS knowledge to unlock biological discoveries. \n\nIf you are considering CS because everyone else is doing CS and it is not actually your interest, then yeah, your line of thinking is probably correct.",
