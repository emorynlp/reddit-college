  "text": "I grinded my common app essay and I feel it is really great. But at this point I\u2019m burnt out of this college prep stuff, my supplementals are decent but I really just don\u2019t have the willpower to spend hours upon hours perfecting them like I did my common app essay. Do they count towards a large portion of your admissions chances? (College in question is Hofstra University)",

      "text": ">Are supplemental essays really that important for a not super competitive school?\n\nIf your grades/scores are *much* higher than the median applicant (taking major into account), then your essays probably won't matter much.  It's possible they might matter for entry into an honors program or for competitive scholarships.",
