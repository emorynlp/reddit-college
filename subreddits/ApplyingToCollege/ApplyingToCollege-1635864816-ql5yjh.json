  "text": "Please double check your college portals (for those that require official score reports) that they have recd your SAT reports. Six weeks ago I ordered scores to be sent. I received email and verbal confirmation from College Board that they were but noticed on college portals scores not received. On College Board site, scores sent page is blank but was told \"that happens sometimes\" . Called AOs, no scores received. Three calls to customer service has gotten me nowhere except put on a list for \"upper management\" to call me back. No call back and my social media posts to CB were deleted.",

Luckily, we decide to switch to ACT in March and he got good results for it. \n\nACT is definitely a better testing agency when it comes to scheduling, testing and sending score! His ACT score was send on the same day that we request, and the university got it the next morning!",
