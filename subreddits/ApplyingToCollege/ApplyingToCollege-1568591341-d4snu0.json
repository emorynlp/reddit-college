(some of this data if from last year so it might be outdated, but it gives you an idea)\n\nA lot of schools only require the common app , have **no application fee**, and have **no supplements**, for example:\n\nColby College \nConnecticut college \nWhitman College (free if you apply before I think December)\n\nSome more schools have no supplemental essays:\n\nHamilton college\nMiddlebury college \nNortheastern University \n\nAmherst college accepts a graded paper instead of an essay. \n\nAll that Vanderbilt asked was to describe your most significant EC so it\u2019s like not really an essay. \n\nAnd some more are free to apply to and have just one or two stereotypical essays (e.g. \u201cWhy this school\u201d)\n\nCarleton College\nReed College\nVassar College. \n\nAnd of course, the UCs only use once system, so if you apply to one you can just pay to apply to more with virtually no extra work.\n\nSo presuming you apply to every school that I\u2019ve listed plus three UCs, that\u2019s 14 schools with one CA, three supplements + Vanderbilt and Amherst, and UC essays. \n\nIt gives you a lot more options, with honestly not that much extra work. \n\nWhereas if you apply to Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia (just **three** schools), you\u2019re already writing more essays than my 14 school plan.",

Senior year has hit me like a brick. But from what I\u2019ve heard, second semester should be easier without the stress of college apps and standardized testing. I\u2019m really hoping it is better next semester. If you\u2019re like me and really stressed and scared, you just have to remember that it will be done in a matter of time. Besides, the stress and workload builds character and makes you grow as a person. We got this seniors.",

All of my teachers prior to highschool, and even in freshman year, told me freshman year is the hardest. Yeah sure, you are trying to figure your way out, but junior has much more things you have to prepare yourself for. You start looking at colleges, and determine what your choices are, and you have to choose the best one for you. But for some, most people anyway, we don't know yet. Then you have an insane amount of homework, and for the cherry on top, you have to get service hours. I am not complaining, for it is something we all have to go through, but it is scary. Unlike your two underclassmen grades, freshmen, and sophomore year, junior year focuses on what you are going to do for college. Any way, I hope all the best in this year if you too are juniors. Same goes to all high schoolers. This time is rough.",
