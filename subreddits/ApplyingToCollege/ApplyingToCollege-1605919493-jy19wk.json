Almost every exam has gone a lil' something like this since last year: \n\nTest questions get leaked hours before test --> people go into test knowing most/all of the answers --> the results are flooded with fake 1500+ scores --> scores are cancelled and everyone recieves a refund --> repeat until CB was finally fed up and halted the adminstration of all SAT tests and subject tests, at least for the 2020/2021 academic year.\n\nYeah but I don't think they'll bring them back afterwards anyway.",

The posts also don't really add that much to the general discourse, besides a series of \"Thanks!\" and \"Good job!\" in the comments.\n\nIf anything, I could agree with a megathread; otherwise, keep it to r/SAT. Just my opinion, though.",
