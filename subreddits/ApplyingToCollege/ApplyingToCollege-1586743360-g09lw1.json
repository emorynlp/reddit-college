  "text": "Today I got to tell my grandpa I got in off the waitlist, and he\u2019s really excited. He went to Georgia Tech himself (and so did his dad and my dad) and it\u2019s one of the few things he remembers these days. I\u2019m also one of the last grandchildren he remembers so it was really nice to tell him I got in! Congrats to everyone else who got accepted too!",
