  "text": "To be clear, I'm in the normal applicant pool not early action. I basically got a letter saying they're gonna put me on hold and evaluate my admission at a later date once I post transcripts of my grades later in the year. Is this.... basically just them telling me I'm only getting in if they don't have any students that fit the criteria better?",
