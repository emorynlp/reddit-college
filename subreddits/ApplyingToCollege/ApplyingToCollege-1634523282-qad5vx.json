  "text": "My school offers absolutely no extracurriculars and I cannot stress this enough. There are no clubs, nor are there any ways to make one. ( I\u2019ve already tried. The debate club didn\u2019t work out. ) We have no athletics, no newspaper, no academic teams, no campaigns, and no student government. It\u2019s pretty dry around here. My school also goes year-round so I can\u2019t do much in the summer. This isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t have any extracurriculars. Outside of school, I write programs, play Dungeons and Dragons regularly, and volunteer at a local dog shelter, among other things. I also plan to intern senior year.\n\nI, however, doubt if I will be able to stand out in college applications with my resume. Will colleges take the situation at my school into account during admissions? I don\u2019t plan on applying to any highly selective schools though my dream school is a moderately selective public ivy.",
