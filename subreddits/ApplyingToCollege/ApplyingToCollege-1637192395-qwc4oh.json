  "text": "- So. I applied REA to Notre Dame. I sent them my october progress report (basically like report card for october grades) at the beginning of November. I had a B in spanish at the time and A- in Calc (unfortunate because I wrote about my long path to improvement in math and wanted to show a high A)\n- Now my school is finalizing the November progress reports, and the spanish B has changed to an A, and the Calc A- has changed to an A\n- Notre dame deadline was november 1, and they write on their website that the deadline to submit additional documents is November 15\n- I can still upload materials in my portal and my counselor could send it electronically. Should I send in the november progress report, or does it look bad that I\u2019m turning in something after the deadline?",
