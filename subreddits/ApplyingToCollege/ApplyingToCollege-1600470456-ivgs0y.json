It\u2019s cliche to say it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re accepted, but it\u2019s really true, you will find a community like yourself no matter where you go because college admissions is a game. If you don\u2019t play the game correctly, you may not get accepted but that says NOTHING about who you actually are. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s tons of people like yourself who may or may not be accepted to Harvard or some shit but who are still attending all sorts of college so you\u2019ll really fit in and be successful anywhere. A stellar student at a state college who does research, or is top of the class, or gets into the honors college is going to shine in life just as much as a kid at Harvard who\u2019s overloaded with work.
