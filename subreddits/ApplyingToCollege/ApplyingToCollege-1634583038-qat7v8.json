  "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore at Harding majoring in social work. I got accepted to both universities, and I\u2019m torn because I like Nashville way more than St. Louis. I want to go to law school, which is why I think I need to go to SLU (they\u2019re social work program is also like #51 in the country), but I think I might be happier at Belmont, although their program just doesn\u2019t compare. Advice?\n\nETA: I have also been accepted to Lipscomb and am considering their law, justice, & society major.",

      "text": "SLU is definitely the better school in this case. In addition to the social work component, they have a large regional medical center where many of the social work students cut their chops. There is also much better network of name recognition via like minded Catholic universities around the country. That said, to some extent this depends upon where you want to practice law/establish regional ties. \n\nThere is a lot of good holistic advocacy legal work going on here n St Louis at the moment spurred in part by to Ferguson. Do a news search for Arch City Defenders and read up on them in the NYT, etc. SLU law grads. \n\nI will say that I am not a fan of the SLU campus from a physical perspective. Question:  what concerns you most about living in STL.\n\nOne other thing:  both are Christian but Belmont and SLU are completely different vibes. Belmont is no Liberty or Cedarville, but it will be more religious and conservative than Jesuit SLU. Depending upon your religious/political views, you may prefer one to the other.",

      "text": "I would advise you to go to the school you want in the location you want! How's that for an uncommitted answer. For law school..and remember how many students change their paths...your GPA and LSAT score are virtually the most important criteria. There are activities and community liaisons everywhere. Being rather partial to Nashville (my son and family lived in East Nashville for 20 years. He was Special Factotem to the Mayor...did fun things!) I am thinking that there is so very much to do with all of the colleges ( may have a consortiem sharing?). you will not lack for stimulation academically or socially. Having been to STL in years, but my xperiences with Jesuit education is the best. You have terrific choices!",
