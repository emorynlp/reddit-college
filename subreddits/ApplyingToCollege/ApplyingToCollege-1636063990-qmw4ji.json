  "text": "Hi everyone! I know the FAFSA rewards money on a first-come-first-serve basis. On Oct 1, I submitted the FAFSA with 7 schools connected to it, but I'm now realizing that one of those schools might not be for me and I want to apply to a different school. \n\nBut if I add a new school to my FAFSA now, will this count as a separate submission and risk yielding me less aid? If my FAFSA shows up as being submitted on Nov 4 instead of Oct 1, there's less grants (money that I don't have to pay back) to be allocated for me, right? Can someone confirm/deny this?",

      "text": "Most aid isn't first come, first serve - that's a misconception. Some aid can be (state grants and the FSEOG program come to mind), and because there's no downside to applying for aid early it gets encouraged to submit as soon as you can.  But pell grants don't run out of funds, subsidized loans don't run out of funds, and for aid from schools what matters is usually their own priority aid date.\n\nAdding new schools isn't going to change your eligibility or reset dates - it's just going to show as Nov 4 for the new schools you add.  You could actually remove the old schools if you aren't correcting anything else and you are worried about them getting new info and it screwing up your date somehow.",
