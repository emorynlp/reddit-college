  "text": "The MIT checklist was added today but it says that they did not receive my second teacher recommendation. However, when I open the \"Manage Recommendations & School Report\" section it says submitted for each one. It says the first teacher recommendation was received on 10/29/21. On the \"Manage Recommendations & School Report\" the dates of submission are 10/22/21 and 10/29/21. How can I tell which recommendation was the actual one submitted and what should I do about it?",

      "text": "I have this same exact issue. I think I\u2019m going to email MIT just in case, but I narrowed the unsent recommendation from the checklist down to one of my two recommenders and asked him to resend the letter. I narrowed it down based on the confirmation email date I received from MIT when the letters were initially sent. One of my teachers sent it in earlier than the other and the date submitted on the checklist reflected that. You can also match up the dates from the manage section to the checklist to see which teacher\u2019s letter didn\u2019t go through.\n\nI\u2019ll update on what MIT says though.",
