  "text": "I didn't realize that Collegeboard MAILED the SAT scores...  I figured once I clicked send they would send them digitally and that would be the end of it.  I submitted my applications on Oct. 31 and sent my scores on Nov 1st.  I didn't think anything of it until I read on the collegeboard website that they mail scores.\n\nMy 1370 on the SAT is really a high point in my applications, do you think the colleges will accept the scores if they come in after my application and after the deadline?  Or will they consider my application without the scores?",

      "text": "I would call the admissions office for the schools you're applying to tomorrow. My SAT scores were sent on Friday but still weren't showing up on my portal. The admissions office just asked for the order confirmation and said ok. Another one said they give leeway until Friday for stuff to come in. Either way, just call and ask.",
