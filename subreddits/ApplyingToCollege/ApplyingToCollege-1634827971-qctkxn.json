      "text": "Schools have neither the time nor inclination to do a \u201cdigital background check\u201d on applicants.\n\nThink about it this way. if they spent 5min looking up each of 50,000 candidates, that\u2019d be 250,000 minutes\u2026 4,166 hours\u2026 520 8hr days\u2026 104 5-day work weeks.  That\u2019d be one person working full time for TWO YEARS just to do one application cycle. To pack that all into a Nov 1- April 1 timeframe would require 8 full-time staff members doing nothing but cyber-sleuthing.\n\nBest case, they\u2019ll Google your name and maybe look at any social media that is obviously tied to your real name.  But they won\u2019t even do that. (If they do, it\u2019s probably because they already have some doubts about you.)\n\nSurely they have no NSA-type tools to match you up to your finsta account, etc.",
