I'm not positive about A, since our school only has Principles, then moves on to IB CS, but I assume that this is how it's structured, given that my kids took AP principles and there was very little to no programming during that course.",

A high percentage of students take this in 9th and 10th grade.\n\nCS A is specifically a Computer Science/Programming course, more aligned specifically with STEM careers. It\u2019s more heavily weighted to Juniors and Seniors.\n\nCSP isn\u2019t a prerequisite to CSA, but it\u2019s useful to take both.",
