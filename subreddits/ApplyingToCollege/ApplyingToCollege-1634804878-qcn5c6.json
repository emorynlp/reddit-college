  "text": "Hi I am a high school senior amidst the application chaos that many of us are going through right now. As I've reflected on all my ECs I realized how much time and energy I spent to get a volunteer research position (idk if i can say where so I wont). I technically haven't even started because the process has been so long. I been emailing and connecting with people since last June/late May for it. Can anyone let me know if it was worth the time for this and generally how helpful will it be for apps? Also how to make it look best on my application?",
