      "text": "The CS program in the past has not been great, but they hired three new professors who were instructor/lecturers from UNC Chapel Hill, Georgia tech, and Brown. Since they just joined QB last year and finished a funding campaign not so long ago, they have been trying to leverage up the quality of programs across every discipline. \n\nThe best programs at Denison; traditionally, has been bio, chem, physics, poli sci, econ, theatre, History/English/Journalism, Phil and Data Analytics.",
