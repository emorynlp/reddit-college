  "title:": "Does Stony Brook practice yield protection?",
  "text": "I have a 35 ACT and 102.97 GPA (taken/taking 14 AP + 1 college course), as well as decent ECs (lab internship, nursing home volunteer, job, few school clubs and sports, but only 1 leadership), good awards (AIME, NMSF), fairly solid essay (which my AP lit teacher praised) and LORs which I surmise won't be terrible (but I can't judge). I am aplying to their applied math and statistics major on a pre-med track (ik, very unusual).\n\nMy high school sends lots of kids to SB every year since I live in the area, but I am kinda worried that Stony Brook might deny my admission either because my stats are to high or because admissions is (likely) more competitive this year.\n\nDoes stony track demonstrated interest and do yield protection?",

SBU is an excellent STEM University (for God's sake  Jim Simmons used to teach there)\n2. SBU is excellent value for money\n3. SBU is conveniently located - not too far from NYC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut ... SBU's campus is kind of dated and marginal, no college town to speak of ...  many commuters ... so the good comes with the bad.",

Isn't SBU RD Only? And it's not rolling admissions AFAIK ... so 1/15 is the deadline?",
