  "text": "A UVA prompt asks me about a quirk that I have and I just wanted to know if me never cutting my hair counts as a quirk. Its part of my religion to never cut my hair so I've never cut it but I can't decide if its a quirk or not. Compared to students at my high school I think its a quirk because I doubt there are that many people who can say that they have never cut their hair. Please let me know your thoughts.",

          "text": "right but a lot of people who believe in my religion also cut their hair so basically its an option but its better to just not cut your hair. Like its said in our religion that you can believe in it even if you cut your hair or do whatever the hell you do. Like there is no discrimination in our religion against people who don't believe. So its part of my religion to not cut my hair but its also a choice. So I want to mention that its part of my religion and I have always had the choice but I never did cut my hair. The link below provides the information below it.\n\n[https://www.sikhcoalition.org/about-sikhs/faq/](https://www.sikhcoalition.org/about-sikhs/faq/)\n\nHOW ABOUT PEOPLE WITH CUT HAIR WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS SIKH?  \nAll initiated Sikhs are required to maintain uncut/untrimmed hair. But, as in every religion, there are people at different levels of observance and commitment to their faith. Everyone is on their own personal journey. Some Sikhs may cut their hair, but that does not exclude them from the Sikh community.",

I guess you're right but I was talking with my parents and they also believe its a quirk cause its a challenge to not be influenced to cut your hair when everyone around me does it. I'm also probably one of the few students who have a full out beard. I swear I could pass as someone who is 21. My point is that I still think I can count it as a quirk. Especially since its a choice.",
