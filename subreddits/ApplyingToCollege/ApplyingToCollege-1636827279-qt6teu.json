  "text": "Hi. I thought that I should write some kind of a form for intent to enroll. So I logged in to my IU account through the intent to enroll form to submit some form but it said \u2018thank you for chosing indiana\u2019 and below that it showed a payment link. I never thought that just by logging in would complete the intent to enroll form. I was so surprised and thought that just by clicking that log in button I already have made my decision. So surpised, I closed the tab and I did not send the enrollment deposit yet, but does this mean I completed the enrollment form and still have committed and saved my seat? I still have many decisions to come out. Will this be a serious problem for other university decision???",
