  "text": "Per request of my classmates, I\u2019ve read some of their essays. And god damn, stop complaining about your suburban middle class life. I had a guy tragically describing how he was so good at math but then he slacked off during COVID and \u201coh lord! How disappointed he was with himself!\u201d kind of thing. Quote \u201cI was so disappointed with myself, so I started actually studying and grasping the concepts of pre calc.\u201d \n\nYour life doesn\u2019t have to be tragic, you don\u2019t need to be in the trenches or have stage 5 cancer to get in to college. There are people who are far more unfortunate than you, so your whining to the AO\u2019s will seem overdramatic for the least\u2026.\n\nYour depression doesn\u2019t make you stand out, virtually everyone will talk about it. We all get upset about our grades slacking, but not so dramatically???",

Yes, many people are whining over really common issues that colleges are well aware of, but also, your very real problems are not made smaller by someone else's seemingly bigger problems, I don't approve of trying to excuse every single minor flaw in your application, but if covid or something else had a big impact on you, write about it! even if it may seem small in comparison to someone else.",
