  "text": "Happy Tuesday Early Bird Applicants!\n\nThe first major early app finish line has passed, and I know you\u2019re all ready for a break and a deep breath! So\u2026. You did it! You successfully completed and submitted your first round of early applications. So, so, so many high fives to all of you!!!\n\n**Some REAL IMPORTANT basic advice:** \n\n* Make sure your supplemental essays were submitted. Check Rice and U of Richmond for sure. There might be other schools where they don\u2019t automatically submit. Check your pdf that was sent to the colleges. If they didn\u2019t submit, don\u2019t panic, just do it right now.\n* Most colleges have some kind of grace period for your supplemental materials, so don\u2019t freak out if your transcript and other materials aren\u2019t there yet (Not all though, so you need to check that on the college\u2019s website).  \n* Don\u2019t go back and reread your apps over and over \u2014 you\u2019ll find typos and little mistakes. You\u2019re human, and humans make mistakes. \n* **Don\u2019t panic** \u2014 they know mistakes happen. They happen every year.\n* But, if you do happen to find something that\u2019s driving you batshit crazy or that really must be fixed, read from the college how to best update your application \u2014 usually, it\u2019s on the portal or by email, but you\u2019ll need to read the specific directions from each school. \n* If the college doesn\u2019t say or you haven\u2019t received portal info yet, you can send an \u201cOops\u201d email and see if that works. Here\u2019s how I suggest writing an \u201cOops\u201d email.\n   * Send it to the general admissions email address and a copy to your regional admissions counselor if there is one. \n   * Use good judgment about whether to send or not. For a typo or two or three, I\u2019d leave it. Read above about their knowing you\u2019re a human. Not a perfection machine.\n   * If you totally uploaded the wrong info or copied and pasted the wrong essay altogether an \u201cOops\u201d email might be worth a shot to you. \n   * Attach the update in a PDF. Make sure it has the full name you used on your application, and the title of the piece you\u2019re skiing them to replace (Personal Essay, Activities Section, Additional Info, Supplemental Essay (add the prompt), etc). \n\nNow --- It\u2019s time to let those early baby apps fly! You\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into bringing them about and nurturing them; you have to let them go do their thing and make you proud.\n\nSo what's next? Even after your apps are in, though, you need to be sure you're covering a few things. \n\nThere are a few things you need to be taking care of -- even those of you who\u2019ve submitted all your applications and you think you\u2019re done :)  Be sure to:\n\n1. **Open every email from all the colleges where you've applied**, and click on all the links. This is where they will share important info about your application with you.\n2. **Check For Your Portals**: Most colleges have some sort of portal set up where you can upload any info you might need to share with them or they can send you messages. It can take from a few days to up to a week before you get the portal, and not all colleges have this, some just use email, but you should still be on the lookout for portal information from all your colleges, and once you receive it, sign in and keep your login info handy! Be sure to check your promotional, social, spam email folders. The portal emails often get stuck there. Provide any info colleges say they still need. **Know that it can take up to a week for supplemental materials to be submitted.** Add these columns to your spreadsheets so you can keep up with who needs what. Check your portals regularly, but not obsessively :) to make sure they're not missing anything. That's how colleges will communicate with you.\n3. **Update Naviance/Cialfo/Maiai/Scoir/Your School Counselor:** Make sure you have checked that you\u2019ve applied on your high school\u2019s application platform or method they use (and for the early admissions option if you haven\u2019t done that). *(If you've never heard of Naviance, Cialfo, Scoir, etc, it probably just means your school doesn't use that platform for applications, so no worries there)*\n4. **Follow up with your School Counselor:**  Make sure that all is good there and that y'all are on the same page and you've done everything they're expecting of you. Make sure they have a list of all the colleges where you\u2019ve applied early and everything they need from you.\n5. **Check-in with your Recommenders:** Send them a brief email to let them know you\u2019ve applied to your early schools and how excited you are and how much you appreciate their helping you on this journey. This can serve as a gentle reminder that they might need to send along your LOR and you can see if they need anything from you to facilitate sending letters if they haven't yet done so. Be sure to send them a handwritten thank-you note at some point this fall.\n6. **Check for Interview Info:** If your early colleges offer interviews, be sure to be on the lookout for emails, texts, and voicemail messages. Check all your email folders, search the word interview, look in your junk text messages, set up your voicemail with an appropriate message, and make sure you have space to receive those messages.\n7. **Interview:** Do the interview. Stay tuned for a post this weekend about virtual and in-person interviews :)\n8. **Send Test Scores:** If you haven\u2019t yet submitted test scores (if you are submitting test scores) and the colleges require official scores, do so now -- even for your regular decision schools. Don\u2019t wait and give yourself that stress.\n9. **Ask Questions**: Consider reaching out to your regional admissions officers at the colleges where you're applying to say hello, introduce yourself, and ask any questions you might have. It\u2019s ok to reach out to them with questions you can\u2019t easily find via google or on the website. Ask questions of the general admissions office, ask questions here on A2C, and ask questions of your high school counselor. Of course, always read the websites, directions, and use google, but don\u2019t be afraid to reach out and ask -- especially if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. \n10. **Engage with the Colleges:** Keep engaging with the colleges. Reach out if you have questions. Go to info sessions and virtual tours if you haven\u2019t already. Check out interesting things to you on their websites. Read the school newspaper. **Open every email,** respond if you can, and click on those special points of interest they want to share with you!!! This is where they share important info with you.\n11. **Recharge your Batteries:** get outside, read a book, do yoga, have a dance party in your room, take long walks, hang with your family or friends, have a little bit of a Netflix binge, or meditate!!\n12. **BREATHE:** You did it! You\u2019re officially an early app badass and a college applicant! \n\nIt\u2019s getting real\u2026\n\nTake care. Be well. Reach out with questions. I look forward to continuing to hearing from those of you who like to reach out to me -- let me know how it's going -- or if you have questions!\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc99 AdmissionsMom\n\ntl;dr: It\u2019s all important info. You need to read it. \ud83d\ude0a",

I was wondering do I really have a chance of getting into the university because of the fact that I will require 60000 USD financial aid while the average financial aid for international students is 25k and only 10% of international students receive financial aid. JHU is need-aware for international students and so the amount I require as financial aid will be considered to assess my application. Based on all this, do you think I have a chance of getting in? Please give me an honest answer. Thanks in advance",
