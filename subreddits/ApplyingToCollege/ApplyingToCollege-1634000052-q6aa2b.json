  "text": "Guys I need to pick an ED school like yesterday. My parents are pressuring me to ED somewhere and I want to, I just don\u2019t know where. Pls don\u2019t say don\u2019t ED if you\u2019re not 100% sure, because I don\u2019t really care where I end up as long as it\u2019s a good school- I can pretty much fit in anywhere. Hard stats- I have 3.9 UW 4.9 W and 1430 SAT. I want to study finance or business analytics. Also I live in Northeast, and would prefer to be in that area\n\nSome contenders are:\nEmory, Tufts, Notre dame (REA), and Boston College\n\nThing is if I apply ED I want to actually have a shot of getting in, so a school that actually gives an ED boost would be best. I want a school w a collaborative, tight knit culture. Please please give some suggestions, and please don\u2019t say I shouldn\u2019t ED anywhere; I\u2019m not going to have regrets; I just need to pick a school where I have a decent shot but is still prestigious (as my parents don\u2019t want to pay 80k for a subpar school)",

      "text": "Tufts doesn't have a Finance or Business Analytics major, so that's crossed off for ED.\n\nYou want to stay in the Northeast, so no Notre Dame & Emory for ED.\n\nBoom, you're left with **Boston College**.\n\n\\^\\^\\^ Extremely simple and bare way of minimizing schools lol. But BC matches your criteria of being in the Northeast, having a Finance major (and Business Analytics as a concentration), and having a collaborative, tight-knit culture. Their business programs are also very well-regarded. Your GPA, coupled with your SAT, are within range for BC.\n\nKeep in mind that BC values service and leadership, so if you're stuck choosing an essay topic, you could start brainstorming with service and leadership and go from there.\n\nBest of luck. :)",

I'm not sure about the rest of your application, but if your 1430 (which is certainly not a bad score!) is any indication, it'll be very, very difficult for you to get into absolute top schools which your parents would agree are worth the money, even more so than for the average applicant to those top schools. You could always ED somewhere like Penn, which would definitely be worth the money due to Wharton having super strong programs for your major, but you'd have to keep in mind that the chances are very slim.\n\nEdit: Also, do you know why your parents think NEU and BC wouldn't be worth the money? Both are great schools and are T50s.",

      "text": "Id say that in terms of the easiest acceptance rate for ED/EA among the schools you listed it would be BC as the easiest (\\~40%), then Tufts (\\~25%), then Emory (\\~23%), and then Notre Dame (\\~22%). Also keep in mind that the school (besides ND) is a school that you have to commit to if you get accepted, so choose your school wisely in case you might have any regrets later down the line. \n\nIn regards to finance/job opportunities, Notre Dame is the best among your 4 schools, with Tufts being the worst ([https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/comprehensive-undergraduate-target-schools-tier-list-2020](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/comprehensive-undergraduate-target-schools-tier-list-2020)). Notre Dame is a target/top semi-target and gives you the most opportunities, Emory and BC are middle semi-targets that focus mainly on regional job offers, and Tufts is a low semi-target (even more regional-based). I'm not sure about the culture but I'm guessing all of them except Emory are pretty good; I heard that Emory students don't have any school pride so it might not be that great there.\n\nSince you're not picking schools to go to and rather focusing on schools that are good and give you the best chance, I'd recommend Emory or BC based on your stats. I'd give you about a 55% chance of getting into BC based on your stats, while Emory or ND might be a little bit lower than the acceptance rate I listed above. Tufts I'm not sure about.\n\nIf you want more advice about this kind of stuff, feel free to pm me, or search it up on Wall Street Oasis, which is a forum similar to A2C but is more business centric with some people that actually know what they're saying lol.",

When you adjust for applicant pool quality it\u2019s really difficult to determine which ED choice is the most likely to generate an acceptance. \n\nThat\u2019s kinda why I tossed out URochester. They have good econ/stats/finance programs, the admissions bar is a bit lower and they usually fill 40% of their class ED. 23 classes to complete all business school core requirements and the double major in both finance and business analytics. \n\nThe big advantage w WashU is that it\u2019s less selective ED compared to peers of similar overall admissions selectivity and it offers better aid than the other schools if the OP\u2019s family is at a level where they \u201cmight\u201d qualify for some aid. If the OP\u2019s family is really in that range, I could see WashU giving 10 grand while many of the others would not. The net price calculator would help there. \n\nOther thing I\u2019d note:  OP, there are some very different schools on this list. If you don\u2019t have a strong preference in terms of school culture, that\u2019s fine. But ND/BC are pretty different than Tufts.",
