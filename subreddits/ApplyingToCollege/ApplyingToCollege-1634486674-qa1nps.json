  "text": "I am planning to apply Trinity College (Connecticut), it only has Early Decision option. When I use the net calculator it says you need to just pay 25$ and that is awesome for me because of my financial situation. But, is there a chance that I got accepted but don't get %100 financial aid? Because if this happens, I cannot afford more than $2K dollars. OR when I got accepted I receive %100 financial aid at the same time. This is an important question for me because it will be a binding application if I apply.",

      "text": "I see from your other comment that you have e-mailed them about it. Honestly, I would just have a meeting with the financial aid office if I could (through zoom). \n\nRemeber that NPCs are *NOT* accurate at all for international students and colleges will try to get more from you than $25.\n\nI know people who had $0 shown as EFC when using the NPC but ended up paying atleast $2-3k. So, I would highly recommend you request a meeting with the financial aid office to determine your aid. Even after the meeting, there is no guarantee that your COA will be less than $2k.\nThe NPC does not ask you even 10% of the questions you'll be asked in the CSS profile and even then, NPCs are meant for US citizens. Did you notice a \"pell grant\" in the breakdown of the financial estimated package (the results of the NPC)? You won't recieve that. That grant will probably roll over to the institute or go as loans (Pell grants are generally $5k per year). So you won't be able to afford it if the institute decides to roll the Pell grant to the loans section. \n\nAlso, it's always far better to apply RD if you're an international student needing aid because colleges will consider it unreasonable if you back out from a ED agreement because you couldn't pay $2-3k more than what you were expecting. \nSo, for example, if the COA after aid comes out to be $15k in the admissions letter and you had e-mailed/had a meeting with finaid office and they estimated a far lower COA like $0-$2k then you can understandably back out from the agreement (because the difference is like ...  $10k which is huge). \n\nBUT if your COA is like.... $0 determined by the NPC and cross verified with fin aid office, they ask you for $3k in the admissions letter, and you back out from the ED offer, they'll probably consider it unreasonable which will bring unintended consequences which MIGHT lead to no other college accepting you (IIRC, colleges send notices to other colleges and universities about an applicant if that said applicant backs out from an ED agreement unreasonably).\n\nAlso keep in mind that some mandatory health insurances run at $2k which is *never* included in the financial aid package. So not being able to afford more than $2k already puts you at a VERY risky position to study in the US.\n\n*It's only wise to apply RD or EA to colleges if you need aid.* \n\nYou should only ED to T20s (generally HYPSM.... Although they generally don't have ED but rather have REA) because they have $0 EFC guaranteed for students below a certain income level (generally $60k). Trinity College has no such scheme.\n\nPS: Typed on my phone so there might be some error in this answer (like grammatical mistakes, typos etc).",
