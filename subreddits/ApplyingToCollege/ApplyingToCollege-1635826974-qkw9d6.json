  "text": "When does Yale begin to inform people on interviews for REA applicants.  Does it usually happen after the deadline.  I submitted about a month ago and still haven\u2019t received an interview request so I\u2019m just assuming that they don\u2019t start to offer them until after November 1st.  Also I know that I might not get one but I heard most so.  Also please comment below once your Yale interviewer does contact you!",
