      "text": " Okay, so hear me out before you downvote. I'm gonna explain to you why it's a bad idea (and why Sal Khan should stick to his wonderful trade of education) by taking you through all of Collegeboard's faults:\n\n* They cost so damn much for everything: The SAT costs a lot, sending scores costs a lot, APs cost a lot, the CSS costs a lot, yet, even if you took into account all the staff compensation, it wouldn't give much room for significant price change.  \n\n   * A Khan exam would be worse. It would require new infrastructure, both material and systemic and that would cost a fuckton of money. They were already running drastically low funds just running their relatively simple system with less infrastructure requirement. They would need to either charge a massive lot more than collegeboard or rely on a big big donation.\n* Their test promote inequity: You cannot have a perfect test. Tests will always have tips and tricks and rich kids will always get to know them first as well as always have more time to practice and more support when they do. That is unless you create a natural aptitude test (virtually impossible), and even if you did, it would invalidate hard work and promote biological inequities.  \n\n   * Sal Khan will not be ale to fix that for you. It will have a hard time even coming up with SAT-standard exams and will go through many trails and errors, meaning compatibility with colleges will not be very promissing.\n* Their customer service sucks massive ass: Customer service is expensive. Even Microsoft and amazon (big cash companies) have understaffed customer service.  \n\n   * Sal Khan would need to charge even more money to maintain a decent customer service.\n* They're nearly a monopoly: If you hate the collegeboard, you don't have many alternatives for something that'll basically dictate your life and it fucking sucks.  \n\n   * If the Khan exam manages to actually succeed financially without charging massive fees (possibly through donations) and actually are half-decent, it would destroy collegeboard and ACT's markets and make the Khan exam the real monopoly... Don't forget: Sal won't live forever and if the company devolves, we won't have any options.\n* Their reputation is just bad: Yeah, collegeboard done fucked up a lot of times and their reputation is terrible.  \n\n   * Khan Academy has a good reputation but it won't take long for it to lose that after a couple of fails. Mind you, the test industry is not one that is forgiving to fails, especially since such fails will dictate students' lives.\n\nSo what should we do then?\n\nWell, I think Khan Academy is perfect the way it is and Sal is on his way to revolutionize education world-wide with personalized education and other crazy stuff. I think they should focus on that and not enter the lose-lose industry that us standardized testing. Colleges should be more recognizing of testing inequities and stop treating tests as an IQ test. The government should subsidize the collegeboard and ACT to provide cheaper tests for everyone and maintain a strong customer service.\n\nWhat do you think?",

If some kid in rural Africa who had to mine cobalt for 10 hours a day scores a 1300 on the SAT, do you think colleges will view it the same as a US billionaire's child scoring a 1300? Obviously not!\n\nCollege Board is a not-for-profit, not a non-profit. Fee waivers are definitely not stingy and cover kids that are covered by various forms of government welfare. Refunds are small as they should be becuse you're taking up someone else's spot. Test centres get booked rapidly and full refunds create an incentive to prebook every possible date. In fact, there's full refunds during Covid and every single test centre near me got completely booked out for this year (I'm international). Thankfully my school is a private test centre. I did the same thing and booked out six subject tests for May and June in case my school gets booked out too.\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that Dinosauce was College Board. It could have been a kid dropping subtle clues that he was College Board. It's a common tactics to drop clues in such a way where the other person is convince that you're not intentionally dropping them because of their subtelety.",

We need to do add all details to show that we have put in our efforts, and are not merely doing it for fun. THIS IS SERIOUS!\n\nBut before we take any steps, invite everyone to a discord.

The problem isn\u2019t the college board or ACT (though they suck) it\u2019s that a single standard to evaluate really only works when everyone is given the same opportunities to succeed. To the point that that hasn\u2019t happened in the US any standardized test is going to inherently reflect the inequities in the education system which is a major issue because colleges especially public ones have a very thin line they can tread with \u201crecognizing circumstances\u201d and discrimination. \n\nThat said I recognize the value of standardized tests and Sal Khan is a chad so that would be kinda hype but unlikely given Khan academies current partnership with college board.",
