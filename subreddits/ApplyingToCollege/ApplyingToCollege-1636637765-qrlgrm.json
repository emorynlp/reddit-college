  "title:": "Penn State VS Arizona State for Engineering?",
  "text": "Hi, I am an international student and was accepted to both universities.\n\nI am not sure which one to go for engineering as it has both pros and cons. I like PSU\u2019s prestige in engineering, great alumni connection, while ASU\u2019s location, climate, and that it's ranked No. 1 for innovations in the US.\n\nOne of the main factors for me is location and opportunities. I'm not too fond of isolated places in the middle of nowhere, as they are genuinely depressing. I know that I will like ASU with its atmosphere, but not sure about Penn State.\nHowever, I am not sure which one offers better opportunities in terms of internships, maybe co-ops for internationals, to get more experience in my major.\n\nTuition of both for internationals is ofc pricey, but there's not much difference (PSU is a bit more expensive), so price tags are not a significant factor.\n\nAppreciate any of your answers. Thanks.",
