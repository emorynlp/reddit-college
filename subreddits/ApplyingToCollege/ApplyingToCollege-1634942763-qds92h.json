  "text": "i had my first college interview today, and i was super excited because it\u2019s one of my favorite schools! i logged onto the zoom link a few minutes early and when i got in, i couldn\u2019t hear anything. literally nothing.\n\ni logged off and tried rejoining but i still couldn\u2019t hear. luckily my interviewer could hear me. she was a student and she was so sweet. i felt so bad, she had to type her questions into the chat and then i\u2019d speak my answers.\n\ni think besides that it went well! she liked the same things as me, and i just got a rly nice email from her. but it still kinda sucks :(\n\nshoutout sarah, ur a real one",
