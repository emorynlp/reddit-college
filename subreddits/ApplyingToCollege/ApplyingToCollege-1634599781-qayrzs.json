  "text": "Location: anywhere BUT Florida. Seriously. I do like the seasons but growing up on the East coast I do want to go west! \n\nSize: small to medium. I\u2019m not fan of huge schools, I learn better with smaller classes etc \n\nI have 5 ECs\nI am a High honors student \n\nGPA: 3.73UW AND 3.92W GPA. Not the best but after ending freshman year with a 2.00 UW I was able to bring it up:)) so I\u2019m happy with it. \n\nCurrent SAT: 1290. I\u2019m retaking and plan to achieve a 1380-1450 if that helps at all.",
