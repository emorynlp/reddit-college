  "title:": "Supplemental LOR Dilemma",
  "text": "Apologies if this has been asked before, I tried looking for the answer and couldn\u2019t really find anything so I\u2019d appreciate any input :) \n\nFor a school like Yale where they clearly outline on their website to only send a supplemental LOR if it adds a new perspective, is their any downside if it\u2019s doesn\u2019t or will it just be disregarded? \n\nFor context, I run a decently successful nonprofit and for the past year have been mentored by a leading industry professional in the same space after approaching his team. I have worked with him on projects for my organization and joined his worldwide advisory board as well. His letter speaks to the work we\u2019ve done and his views on how I will make my mark on the industry/inspire positive change. \n\nIs this a different perspective enough or unnecessary? I think it would help legitimize my nonprofit and speak to my career and potential. Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, I come from an area where no one really is knowledgeable about college apps so I don\u2019t have anyone to ask.\n\nThank you!! \u263a\ufe0f",
