  "text": "It\u2019s been a about a week since UC admissions were open and I have little to no idea what to write about for the 4 personal insight questions. I\u2019ve been looking for advice in youtube videos of people that have been accepted and they seem like they have accomplished everything. I really don\u2019t know how to compete with people like them since I don\u2019t have any big achievements.",
