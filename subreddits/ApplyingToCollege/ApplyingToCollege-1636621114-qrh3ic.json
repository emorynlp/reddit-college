  "text": "So one of the questions for my application process is on what specific leadership role did I take and how that impacted things. \n\nIn my paragraph I talked abt how I helped coach the girls basketball and had a important role with strategizing individual practices for each of the girls. And how this paid off cuz their performance and mentality got better. ( ofc I said this in a formal manner.). However, is it inappropriate or informal to add \u201cI am very proud of my girls :)\u201d? \n\nLike I really and proud of them and their progress and love how close I was with them. But is it appropriate to add that? Also I can\u2019t paraphrase that to be more formal because i reached the word limit",
