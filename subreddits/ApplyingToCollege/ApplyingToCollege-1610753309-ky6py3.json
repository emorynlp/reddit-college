  "text": "Seriously though there's a reason why that school is so highly ranked for engineering, and it's especially hard to get into as OOS. I know many people who've gotten into UCB, UCLA, UW, UIUC, Gatech, Umich, USC, etc and didn't get into Purdue(or got their 2nd choice majors). I get that you've gotta flex during app season but during decision season it's best to stay humble like Lamar.",

Because of this, for calc 1, 2, and 3, the average grade usually hovers around a C+. The problem with this is that over time, Purdue has attracted increasingly competitive students, causing the effort and ability required to achieve a good grade to increase as well. This seems obvious, but when everyone around you has scored in the top few percentile on the SAT and ACT math portions, the courses become incredibly competitive.\n\nOther departments at Purdue understand that many engineering students are likely to do well, and allow for a greater portion of students to get A, B, and C grades. Purdue Math\u2019s grading system, combined with the requirement to have a C- in these math courses to proceed in engineering and decision to make this year\u2019s exams be free response with no partial credit, make the department notoriously difficult.",

The problem is that the majors everyone wants (mechanical, aero, biomedical, etc) accept much smaller groups than other majors at Purdue. Thus, it\u2019s easy to be accepted at Purdue, but not easy to get into your intended major. To go back, those who perform best get their first major choice, and the remaining few spots are put up for those who did not meet the \u201cGuaranteed admission\u201d requirements. So while they accept more students, it is likely there is a population who did not/won\u2019t get accepted into the major they wanted.",

I\u2019m a fucking moron lmao), 3.8 UW 4.7 W GPA, decent EC\u2019s (nothing impressive but I did several of them for all 4 years of HS), and serviceable essays. As far as I know, my LOR was very good, but I can\u2019t say for sure bc I waived my FERPA rights. \n\nThe OOS tuition is 28k a year (and international is about 30k), but if I go I\u2019ll only have to pay 18k bc I got the Presidential scholarship (10k a year). There\u2019s an even better scholarship for \u201cexceptional academic achievers\u201d that\u2019s 16k a year, but I\u2019m pretty sure only domestic students are eligible for either. Compared to the other schools I\u2019m applying to with 70k/year tuition, Purdue is an amazing cost-effective option. Good luck in RD! Sorry if this was cumbersome to read",
