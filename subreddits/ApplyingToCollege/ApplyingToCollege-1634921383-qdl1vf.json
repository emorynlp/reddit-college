  "title:": "Why Would Someone Turn Down Harvard?",
  "text": "Harvard's yield is not over 85%. This is the highest in the nation, and considerably higher than second place Stanford (79.9%). Yet, that still means that 15% of admits turned Harvard down. Why is that? Harvard is the most prestigious college, the most selective college (so seems like a waste to turn it down), and offers the most financial aid of any college (so anyone should be able to afford it, if they can afford any school).\n\nAny ideas? Granted, the people who can get into Harvard are probably the smartest people in the world and have reasons for turning it down.",
