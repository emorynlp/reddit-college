Email your college counselor, as well as the admissions counselors (or offices if you don\u2019t know the specific admissions officer) and explain what happened, providing the correct information as well. Make sure to include your application numbers from the specific school portals. \n\nI did this exact thing for SCU and it was fixed within the day.",
