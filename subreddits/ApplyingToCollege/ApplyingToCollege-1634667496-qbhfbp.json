  "text": "I am planning to do so. I think I am a competitive candidate and also International Student. My family earns around $4K in a year so their contribution will be near to $1K or probably 0. I think Williams is the best for me because of their financial aid program covers so many things. I hope there won't be any reasons for me to withdraw from the agreement except for financial issues. I saw that colleges allow you to withdraw if you can't provide the amount of money that they want from you.\n\nIn this situation is it wise to apply ED to Williams College or not? If it's not, what will cause that?",

I don't think they are going to want a FC over $1K because they basically cannot and that's obvious. If the, I am going to have to withdraw from the agreement. \n\nYes Williams is my clear choice because of their financial aid packages. My #1 is Harvard actually but it is so much competitive for me. So I'm moving on with Williams for a decent Liberal Arts education.",
