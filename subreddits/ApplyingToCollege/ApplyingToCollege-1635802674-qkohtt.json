  "text": "I'm applying to Penn State EA. I'm considering applying to the honors college, but I'm not sure if I want to because they have so many essays. On common app, there's an option that states you want to apply to the honors college, but at a later date. If I choose that option, am I allowed to decide later that I don't want to apply to honors college? Am I forced to apply?",
