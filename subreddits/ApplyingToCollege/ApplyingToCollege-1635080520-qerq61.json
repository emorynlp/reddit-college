      "text": ">I want to start an architecture firm after I graduate\n\nHow long after graduation?\n\nDon\u2018t architects need to spend like three years doing an internship after graduating?\n\nEither way, I\u2019d think a business minor would be best for someone who wants to run a business.  Basic skills like accounting, finance, marketing, etc would be critical to a small business owner. Econ is a social science and a bit theoretical vs practical for a small business owner.  Entrepreneurship always seems a bit \u201cout there\u201d to me; I could be off, but seems more for people who want to start some business but not sure what. You want to start an architectural firm.",
