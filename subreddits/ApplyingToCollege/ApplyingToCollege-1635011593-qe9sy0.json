  "text": "I'm finally saying to heck with it and using my anxiety disorder diagnosis to my advantage. Will colleges be told that I got my ACT score through testing accomodations (like extended time) and will that affect if I'm accepted or not?",

      "text": "No, they will not know.\n\nKeep in mind there may be more to getting extra time accommodations than a mere anxiety diagnosis. Look carefully at the ACT website to see what is involved. If you don't already have extra time accommodations at school, getting them for standardized tests can be difficult.\n\nIf you do not succeed in getting accommodations, also try the SAT, timed at home, to see if you like it better. SAT has more time per question than ACT, although the questions may be less straightforward.",
