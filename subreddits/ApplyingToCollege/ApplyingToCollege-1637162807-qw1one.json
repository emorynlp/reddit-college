      "text": "You would need financial aid of some kind.  Loans, for some weird reason, are included in the definition of \"financial aid.\"  So to make this work, you would need $50k in aid per year whether that's grants, work study, scholarships, or loans.  \n\nAs an international student, this is going to be quite difficult.  There are only 7 colleges in the US that are need-blind for international students and guarantee to meet 100% of demonstrated need: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, Curtis Institute of Music, and Minerva Schools at KGI (note those last two are a little different, so do your research). Every other college is going to consider your ability to pay when evaluating you for admission or won't guarantee aid. That doesn't mean you can't still get in and get aid, but it makes it far more competitive. Of course, because of this, those 7 schools are also incredibly selective and difficult to get into as an international because literally millions of top students from around the globe would love a six figure education for free.\n\nYou may also find some valuable information in the following links and the /r/IntlToUSA sub in general.\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/guxvib/paying_for_college_is_hard_heres_a_guide_to/\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/f7e03h/helpful_resources_for_international_applicants/\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/dcf9hz/three_of_the_greatest_resources_available_on_ed/\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/aztnqz/heres_a_good_resource_for_finding_scholarships/\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/96ahq5/the_best_us_schools_for_international_students/\n\nColleges usually allocate more aid to domestic students for lots of reasons - costs are higher for internationals, outside funding (especially government aid) is much more limited, and they have their own institutional goals. Here are two great resources to see how much aid you might expect and which colleges offer generous aid to internationals.\n\n1)  https://www.ivyachievement.com/2019intl/\n\n2)  https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources.   (See the last link on the page)\n\nThese show information on ED vs RD as well as the number of international students, the percentage of the student body that is international, the percentage of internationals receiving aid, the average aid award, and the college's policy on awarding aid to internationals (need-based only, merit-based only, both, or none).\n\nThese two resources are the biggest gold mine out there for international students who need aid. They can help you find colleges that you might not have considered but could give you a significant award making education in the US a real possibility. It also goes beyond the standard 20-50 colleges that all of the other international students are hammering with applications and requests for aid - potentially increasing your odds significantly of getting in and getting aid.\n\nA few other important things to note:\n\n1)  If you are a US Citizen or permanent resident (green card), you are not considered an international student.  If you attend high school outside the US, you will be evaluated by an admissions officer who is familiar with your country's educational system, but you will be considered domestic.\n\n2)  If you are undocumented and living in the US, you really need to check out the amazing resources College Essay Guy has.  \n\n[Recent Blog Post](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/undocumented-students-college)\n\n[List of resources and posts](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/tag/undocumented+students)\n\n[Podcast Episode](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/podcast-stream/how-to-advocate-for-undocumented-students)\n\n3)  If you are an international student living in the US, Pomona will be need-blind for you.  If you're a top performing student, you owe it to yourself to check them out because it's something of a unique opportunity.",

Unless you have an amazing external scholarship from your government, no Uni will be giving you a scholarship worth 40k USD per year. There will be no way except to request fin aid.",
