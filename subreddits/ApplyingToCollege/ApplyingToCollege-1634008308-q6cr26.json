  "text": "I don't know if anyone already know this, but making your computer read your essays out loud will actually help you to locate your errors. What I've been doing is basically is to download my essays (on google docs) as pdf and have the computer read it for me through edge's \"Read aloud\" function. They have made the voice sound rather natural instead of having a monotonic voice. The prerequisite is that you have to change the default PDF viewer app as Edge, which is a bit annoying.\n\nHowever, since most people are using Chrome or safari, idk if you are willing to sign into your google accounts on edge, go to your docs, download it, and then have it read it. For those people using edge already, it's quite helpful. Interestingly, there are different accents you can choose from and they sounds surprisingly on point.",
