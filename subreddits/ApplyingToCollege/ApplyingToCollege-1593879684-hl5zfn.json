  "text": "so i'm an international and i originally had a list of 12 schools i wanted to apply to, but my parents had a look at the list and were like \"you're too good for johns hopkins and carnegie mellon\" and i was like \"excuse me, do you know that they have literally the bEsT courses in the world?\" and they were like \"just go to yale\"\n\njust go to yale.\n\noml lmao.\n\nso i had to shave like half of the schools off my list and now i'm only allowed to apply to, like, t5s in the states.\n\ni do have a safety though, it's the school in my city, but it's almost a \"if you go to that school you're disowned\" kind of safety.\n\nasian parents SIKE",

Unless you have legacy(for top 5 maybe multiple legacy) or ur parents are super rich who have donated buildings etc, no one, and I mean no one can guarantee entrance to T10 let alone top 5. Also you are international from Asia so it's exponentially harder for you to get into these colleges, no to mention with the current Covid/political situation, there might be even harsher quota on international asians. If you really want to come to US, applying to just top 5 wont cut it. Also tell your parents American admission is very random, so the best strategy is to shotgun and apply to ALOT of schools.",

My parents made my brother only apply to the top 10 us news colleges simply because he had \u201cgood stats\u201d (3.9 uw gpa, 4.5 weighted, 1510 SAT) because this worked for my dad. He got into Columbia and Cornell with stats worse than my brothers so he assumed it would be easy for him (without considering the fact that admissions has gotten so much more competitive?? Back when my dad applied Columbia had a close to 35% acceptance rate....) and I got in a huge argument to defend my brother, since I\u2019ve been through the process and knew how competitive the process is nowadays esp for an Asian male. My brother ended up getting rejected by every college he applied to (incl the UCs which are our state schools) except for one of his \u201csafeties\u201d which he will be attending. If I had not argued with my parents to apply to that 1 safety, he\u2019d have no where to go right now. I know it\u2019s hard to explain to your angry Asian parents but do this for your own good, pay a bit more to apply to a few more safeties.",

Someone like that will ace honors CC classes and probably get into all UCs next year as a top student at a CC rather than one of many at a school like Mission.\n\nAnd he can use TAG to have a guaranteed admission to one school/program, with some limits - LA/B/SD don\u2019t have TAG (though they have other programs) and CS/business are only TAG options at some schools. He could do UCI honors to honors and TAG UCSB and have an 80% shot at UCLA through TAP. \n\nAs for the rest, https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major",

I\u2019m for sure he\u2019d ace cc courses! But my parents literally will never in a million years accept cc as an option. We have a family friend who\u2019s son went to cc and transferred to UCB. Despite knowing that, my parents always say the most terrible things about the kids who go to a cc. This has made my brother himself look down on ccs. When I have kids in the future I\u2019m for sure gonna encourage them to go to a cc, especially since we live in California and have an amazing cc system. I went to UCB myself and have lots of friends and classmates who transferred from cc so I know how great of an option it is.",

Unless you have a long legacy, money, or some ec that truly stands out on a state/national scale, the chance of you getting in to a top school(ivies) is mostly based on luck.",

For anything T25 or or above (and probably even lower) good stats are only a qualifier to even be considered rather than an advantage. It really is a dice roll for a lot of us. \n\nMind you this makes sense because if you look at how asian culture treats grades. For some they might get like 8 hours of tutoring on sat/sun and like 4 hours of extra tutoring on each and every weekday (A tutor place i know of literallly provides breakfast and lunch on weekends for students because they expect their students to be there from like 8 am to like 5pm. With that its not really surprising that a lot of asians have good scores which makes it way harder for us to get in.\n\nNow onto T10s, well heres the thing. Very few who isnt an athelete recruit or a massive donator will apply with stats under the interquartile range will apply. This means that literally everyone has good stats and with all of them having a sub 10% acceptance rate this means its still extremely hard to get in and if you look at the stats for top universities, being over the average would at most double your chances to 20% which is still really unlikely.",

      "text": "U need to apply to more schools than just the top fives. The chances of u getting in a top5 school aren't exactly high (not trying to dishearten u, but it's just facts). Even if u have a 4.7 GPA with a 35 on the ACT and a bunch of EC's it's not guaranteed that ur gonna make it in. Just let that sink in w/ ur parents. If ur application is that good w/ the 4.7 GPA and whatnot, apply to a good safety school like University of Michigan or Vanderbilt or something along with those terms. But DO NOT just apply to the top5's, ur parents will still love u wherever u go. Anyways I hope this helped u in some way, I'm Asian as well and have been thru this process so don't get stressed about it. Ur hard work will pay off in the end :)",

      "text": "My guy, this is a dangerous situation.\n\nEspecially with the current COVID situation it\u2019s just not very plausible that you\u2019ll get in, considering you\u2019re international. This goes for practically everybody regardless of stats/ECs.\n\nAlso, t5s will be INCREDIBLY expensive if you\u2019re not rich, and financial aid is a lot harder to come by as an international applicant. Even if you were to get into a t5, I\u2019m not sure it would be worth the monumental cost.\n\nIn this case, what I\u2019d recommend is applying for a lower ranked state school but trying for financial aid. Although, based on your parents\u2019 reactions, they may be opposed to this (GHHH). You\u2019re a lot more likely to get into a lower ranked school such as state schools that are looking for people like you. You can get pretty good financial aid if you\u2019re lucky, and that will ultimately be a lot more important in the long run. Just apply to ones that are generally better than your safety one.\n\nI say this because my mom got a full ride as an international student from China to a US university. That university was Ohio State, not some super prestigious uni (she did apply, got rejected). She was a pretty outstanding applicant for context, top of her district/city, and one of only a few people in the world to get a full score on the TOEFL exam (not many ECs because China didn\u2019t emphasize those). Even so, she got rejected from prestigious unis BUT got a full ride to Ohio State, and she\u2019s successful today. But if she didn\u2019t apply to that state school, she would still be in China and wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford coming to the US anyway. This was in the 1990\u2019s, when admissions were LESS competitive than they are now.\n\nI\u2019m saying this because coming to the US is no small feat, especially through the admissions system, and getting in through the t5s is just not a realistic option unless you\u2019re a miracle of a human being. \n\nFIGHT WITH YOUR PARENTS if it means applying to a state school and having a better life and college ultimately. Asian parents aren\u2019t unreasonable (I think) if you just have a reasonable discussion with them and explain it how it is.\n\nAlthough I will say the US kinda sucks right now so maybe it\u2019s alright.\n\nAnyway, best of luck!! I wish the best for you :)",

      "text": "Lol my Asian parents want me to apply to T5's too but I think it's a really really bad idea bc there's objectively almost 0% chance I'd get into any T20. I already have a list of like 18 schools that I like and are great for my major and that are feasible to get in, but my parents want me to shotgun for ivies. I feel like if I were to do that I'd get rejected from every college except maybe my state school, which would be a lot worse than just applying to some of the 18 schools that I actually have a chance at. My parents are very concerned that I don't want to apply to ivies and they suggested I get a college counselor but I don't think they understand that no counselor can help you get into ivies if your chance is genuinely 0%.",
