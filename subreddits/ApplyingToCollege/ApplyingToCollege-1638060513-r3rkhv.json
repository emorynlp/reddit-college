I was admitted to all UC's I applied to during my application cycle (UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCI, UCD, UCSB, UCSC)  and am more than willing to help out in any way I can! I'm also here to dispel any myths you may have heard so please feel free to ask anything you may be curious about!\n\nA little about me:\n\nI'm a junior at Berkeley currently studying Molecular & Cell Biology with an emphasis in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and a minor in Data Science. I'm also on the premed track for those who may be interested in what it's like to be premed at Berkeley.",

This was one of the things that I was worried about coming into Cal as well however I was pleasantly relieved to find that the classes are not nearly as badly curved as I had thought. There are some professors that are particularly known for having bad curves for their classes but most professors for the classes I've taken have had very reasonable grade distributions overall. As a vote of confidence, I've been more than able to maintain a strong GPA here.\n\nAnd yes I've been able to fit all my required classes within 4 years easily, I would even be able to do 3 years theoretically.",

If I were to put a blanket statement on it though, I would say that cal students, in general, are very ambitious and (at least in my experience), everyone is always working hard to accomplish some goal. \n\nIn regards to toxic productivity, I feel like it can definitely be easy to fall into a habit of working too hard / not managing time well enough to maintain a great work-life balance. I wouldn't really say this has anything to do with berkeley itself but has more to do, again with the fact that the student population is very ambitious and the opportunities to pursue / get involved in at Cal are endless. Ultimately though, I've personally been able to maintain a solid work / extracurricular profile while also making time to have fun with friends / be in a relationship !",

The campus is super beautiful and there are a ton of great food hubs that are a really close walk away. \n\nIn terms of school, I like that I'm surrounded by people who genuinely want to succeed and do things with their lives. It motivates me to hear what others are doing and I feel like I'm all the better for it.\n\nFrom my experience so far, nothing would have stopped me from attending berkeley. One thing though that I personally haven't had to deal with is that enrollment times for classes are given entirely by a random lottery system so sometimes people can get screwed over and not immediately get the classes they wish to take. Overall though, IU would say like most people eventually are able to get into the classes they need to get into / want to take if they stay on the waitlists long enough but it can be an issue for some. Thankfully I haven't experienced this myself.",

If you apply to a major within the college of Letters of Sciences (which includes MCB), you are evaluated the same as all other people who applied in that college and eventually when you are admitted you will be admitted as undeclared-L&S until you eventually declare your major after finishing the required prerequisites. This applies for all majors within L&S, including CS. So no L&S majors are impacted while you apply but some are harder to actually declare then others once you're in the university.\n\nAlso its a myth that UCLA is better than UCB for premed. They both send the same % of applicants per year to med school (\\~55%).  I went to UCB because it has greater research opportunities and is stronger academically, both overall, and in areas of science im interested in",

Also UCLA has a very large campus population but its physical campus is the smallest across all UC's and I prefer the Bay Area to LA.

I'd say somewhere around 50 - 75% end up sticking with it; some get weeded out but most decide it isn't for them (usually in freshman / sophomore year).\n\nI'm not sure I remember everything but I'll list out what I do remember:\n\n* \\~500 hours total volunteering, 2 presidential volunteer service awards\n* Shift leader of local hospital volunteer program\n* Won award from large global voluntary health organization for fundraising events as part of one of their teams (raised \\~$15k in 7 weeks)\n* 6th place overall at the World Final Stages of an International problem solving / arts competition after my team and I got first place at the regional and state levels.\n* Around 300 hours wet lab research at a T5 research school.\n* Worked a job through my senior year\n* 50 hours shadow orthopedic surgeon (only in clinic)\n* 5 AP's Junior and Senior year\n* Cultural Dance Club at school (don't remember if I included in this in app) and no other club involvements\n* Had a very large familial responsibilities that often times inhibited my ability to do other things outside of school. Emphasized this in my application in the \"is there anything else you'd like to tell us\" section\n\nI think that was most of the important stuff iirc",

However they are very responsive and will guide you with what you need to do. I'm not too certain about how much \"support\" they provide with the medical school application process but I wouldn't imagine its a lot. Berkeley is also one of the schools that doesn't do prehealth committee packets to send to med school so the counselors are definitely more hands-off as compared to some other universities (which has its draw backs and benefits). \n\nIn regards to connections, I think you'll get as much out of that as you put into it. I've been pretty proactive about seeking out opportunities and using those who I've connected with to try to reach further opportunities and so I've happened to stumble across some pretty great potential opportunities. \n\nThe amount of advising you get will also depend on your major / what college you're in. If you're in a smaller college you'll get more advising straight from freshman year. Otherwise you'll only be assigned an advisor once you declare your major in the college of L&S.",

If you are in the college of chemistry, the college of engineering, or the college of natural resources, there are integrated programs for the specific colleges that make it even easier to find research. Otherwise if you're in the college of L&S (the biggest college), there are still a variety of programs that are poised to get undergrads into research, the biggest being URAP (undergraduate research apprenticeship program) in which hundreds of projects ranging across many many different fields are posted at the beginning of each semester and you can apply to try to get them. \n\nFor me it was as easy as establishing a rapport with a professor I took a seminar with and joining his lab soon after",
