  "text": "Basically my school has a program where you get internships at a hospital and a nursing home. I don\u2019t have a precise start and end time for the internships but I know we did approximately 9 hours a week. Secondly there was no pattern between the hospital and nursing home rotations, it was random. So would I put in 9 hours a week with an approximate start and end date for both the internships (I want to put them in as separate internships)",
