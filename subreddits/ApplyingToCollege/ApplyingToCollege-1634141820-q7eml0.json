  "text": "I'd really appreciate any advice on this.\n\nSo there's this one section where they ask in which year house was purchased and what was the value at the time of purchase. But we bought land and our house was constructed (Indian Dad's crazy obsession). What should I fill then??\n\nThen in the same section, there's a third question asking how much value of the house do we still owe. I'd assume I'll have to fill the amount of loan left.\n\nBUT, in the end of ISFAA, there's another question asking how much money we owe to financial institutions and the reasons for them too. So should I mention the house loan here or in the upper section or both places???",
