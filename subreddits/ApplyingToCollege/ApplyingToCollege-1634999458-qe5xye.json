      "text": "ahh so bad \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI rehanded in my 4th version of my common app essay to my teacher (after my 2nd version got roasted by him + peer editor and then my 3rd version ended up being total ass and will never see the light of day) and he said to rewrite that shit AGAIn for monday lmao. \n\nAnd then I have only 1/3 (or I guess 3/5 since there's those \\*hidden supps\\* in the other sections smh) supps done for my MIT app, so that should be a fun scramble this weekend. AHHHHH. Thankfully my school counselor had me reduce my EA list to 3 schools so I only have to do the UB honors college essay  after I'm done w/ MIT's app now (thank you Northeastern for no supps!!!). \n\nalso can my teachers just fucking chill for one second \ud83d\udc80 we got this tho gl!!! o7",
