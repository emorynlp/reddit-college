  "title:": "Does my personal essay have to be in a formal, typical essay structure?",
  "text": "I'm really in crunch time and cannot for the life of me write a decent, formal common app personal essay that I'm proud of. However, I did some abstract, not grammatically correct sort of long poemish stream of thought kinda thing. Would that be alright? I can clean it up, make it more cohesive etc., but I don't really know what impression that would make on admissions officers...... should I take this risk? Or am I an idiot? High key losing my mind right now. Thanks!",
