  "text": "What should I do? My dream school is in Canada (Concordia University) and is an 18hr drive from where I live in the US. I  really like this school, it's in an amazing city and it's where I really can see myself thriving at for university...but whenever I mention it my parents are like \"oh well we probably won't let you go that far\" which I hate, I mean shouldn't it be my choice? And I know it's far, but it's not like I'm trying to go to a different continent or something. \n\n\nAny advice? I should be feeling excited about this college but whenever I think about jt now I just feel :(",

      "text": "Are they helping pay for it? If so I think they get a say and can obviously tell you how much they think they can contribute and maybe put conditions in place. It probably feels a little unfair but college is really an expensive investment and most parents will try to push you towards colleges and majors they think will fit you and pay off. We may be wrong, of course, but we generally have your best interests at heart while balancing overall family finances. They may feel that you aren\u2019t ready to be that far away from home yet as well. Homesickness is very real. Hit my daughter hard just 5 hours away. \n\nCan you look up costs at that school and compare them to what it would cost at the schools they have in mind? And maybe look for scholarships - there are actually quite a few for study abroad. If you can show them it makes financial sense they will consider it more seriously. \n\nMaybe also figure out what you like about that school and then look for other colleges with those features. And really consider value for money and the return on investment. College can cost as much as a house or about the same as a car, depending on your choices. Unlike a house or car you can\u2019t resell it if you don\u2019t like it. You can transfer, but there\u2019s no refunds on classes and dorms for previous semesters. \n\nIf you or your parents are spending a lot of money be sure it\u2019s a place you feel happy and can get some skills/knowledge likely to pay off over your career.

I know I'm going to get homesick, everyone gets it but it doesn't negate my desire to go to this certain school. I see what you mean tho, but if I don't like the school I can always transfer to a school closer to home",
