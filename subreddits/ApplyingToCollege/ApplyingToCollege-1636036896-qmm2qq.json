  "text": "So, I'm the parent, and my kid is starting the application process.\nThey've applied EA to 5 schools, but they feel like they need a few more and I kinda agree. Based on the stats below, what would you suggest? (We live in NJ, fyi and love that TAG grant)\n\nGPA 3.3 Weighted (disastrous freshman year, we moved and the transition sucked. It was explained in \"Additional Circumstances\" area. GPA has been 3.4 + every year after.)\n\nMostly College Prep classes, a couple of Honors. \n\nBiology Major (torn between Pathologist Assistant and Mortuary Science, so starting as general Bio to cover both bases until decided.)\n\nMeh EC's\n\nThey've applied to:\nMontclair State,\nMonmouth University,\nKean,\nWilliam Paterson,\nSUNY Canton (they have a Mortuary Science program, so would be a smooth transition.)\n\nWe're not rich at all - aid is going to be a huge factor. They'd be a first generation college student.\n\nKiddo is LGBTQ+ and wants a campus that's welcoming.\nWould prefer to live on campus.\n\nI don't think Rutgers is attainable and they don't seem interested in it, tbh. \n\nThey seem to be most interested in  Montclair.",

      "text": "Stockton, also in NJ.\n\nPenn State has a lot of campuses, they have a good rep and solid foundation too.\n\nUMass Amherst is also a good school.\n\nWinston Salem in NC.\n\nMercy College in NY.\n\nWhen I say good, I meant that they have a solid foundation so if your son ever wants to transfer out to a great school like NYU, RPI, Fordham, UNCs just to name a few, or even Ivys like Princeton (1% acceptance rate for transfers), it doable. He just has to find people to help him do well academically.\n\nPersonally, I'm not an academic student too. However I considered those schools and think the student life will stay fit me. I am international, so my experience is limited, but my school send the majority of students to T50s, so I understand a lot about basic info on colleges.\n\nThanks for helping your kid out!",
