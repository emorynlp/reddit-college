      "text": "as soon as possible- look up what each of the schools you\u2019re applying to requires if you want financial aid, and when you need to finish it by. you\u2019ll need to complete the fafsa and might need to complete the css profile. usually the deadlines for sending these in are way later than the college deadline (like in february) but sending them in asap (even before you submit your applications) can help get you more aid.",
