  "text": "I\u2019m applying to a competitive scholarship at a school I applied to and one of the essays is a personal statement. The reviewers for the scholarship have access to my commonapp but they primarily look at the actual scholarship application. I really like my commonapp personal statement and I really don\u2019t wanna write a whole new personal statement (I have no fucking idea what I\u2019d write about). Plus the application is due nov 1 so and there are other essays in the application that I have to write by then. My current plan is to kind of change up my personal statement so it doesn\u2019t look like I copied and pasted and just use that. Is this okay to do or should I write an original essay for the scholarship?",
