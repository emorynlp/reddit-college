  "title:": "hi could someone pls help me with the following columbia essay:",
  "text": "A hallmark of the Columbia experience is being able to learn and live in a community with a wide range of perspectives. How do you or would you learn from and contribute to diverse, collaborative communities?\n(200 words or fewer)\n\nI don\u2019t think i understand it. Should i give a past experience short intro? Or give examples of student organisations that i want to contribute to? Or say how my past experiences have shaped me?\n\nFor some reason this is really messing with me. Any help would be appreciated",

      "text": "1. How do you. For this part, talk about something you're doing right now. Laundry listing is one way of doing it, but you could also run a quick focus on your top 3-4 community based ECAs. Transition into a specific opportunity at the uni.\n2. How would you. For this, talk about projects you aspire to take up, specifically ones which would go well with something already ongoing at the uni, or a problem that's really significant there. Also, do mention if there's anything similar to what you wanna do already based at the uni!\n\nThis is basically a twisted community contribution essay with a tint of why us. Be specific and don't sound braggy, and you should be good!",
