The campus, which started classes more than two weeks ago, did not provide figures for how many students are still seeking housing. But before classes began, as many as 5,000 students who had applied for housing could not be accommodated, according to a spokesperson.\n\n[https://edsource.org/2021/thousands-of-uc-students-struggle-to-find-housing/661082](https://edsource.org/2021/thousands-of-uc-students-struggle-to-find-housing/661082)\n\nWorth googling UCB housing generally.

Some have a pretty industrial vibe with outside dark concrete stairways... old, too many people in small rooms... Some are up to a mile from the actual campus. The biggest group is 3-4 blocks from campus. The distance makes it harder to use the cafeteria during the day.  All of this taken into account, the youtube videos we\u2019ve seen of dorms don\u2019t really look too bad. At the end of the day my daughter is still applying...",

However, I think it\u2019s more reasonable to pay attention to extremes, like a D-, especially when I\u2019ve heard similar concerns from unrelated sources. Several people independent told me that Berkeley\u2019s dorms sucked ass. And I haven\u2019t seen too many D- ratings appear on the more highly selective colleges\u2019 \u201creport cards\u201d on Niche. So when I saw that it made me wonder what\u2019s going on. I live on the east coast and won\u2019t be able to visit California so I wanted to know from folks who had been there first hand.",
