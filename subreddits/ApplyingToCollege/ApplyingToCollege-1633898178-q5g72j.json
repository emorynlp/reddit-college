  "title:": "My recommender keeps spelling my name wrong in emails",
  "text": "So I'm applying to this program and my recommender has been spelling my name wrong in just about every email he's sent to me (for years). I never corrected him because he's a kind old man, but now that I think about it, would it be kind of a red flag if he ends up spelling my name wrong in his rec letter? \n\nHe's already submitted it, but I can either stick with it, choose not to use it, or ask him to resubmit. Thing is he's known me a lot longer than my other recommenders and probably has more to say so I'm not sure what to do. \n\nIf anyone can offer me advice, thank you!",
