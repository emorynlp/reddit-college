These are also very different fields.  I wouldn\u2019t make life choices based on that data point.  Do what you\u2019re passionate about.",

Most schools admit to school of engineering in general, even if you are given the opportunity to indicate a preference on your application.\n\nUIUC is the only school I know of that admits directly to your specific discipline.  May be others. UC schools I think, but they\u2019ve never been on my radar screen so I have no specific knowledge.",
