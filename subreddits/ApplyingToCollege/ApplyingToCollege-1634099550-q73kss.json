  "text": "I go on r/chanceme and people who I think are 10 times better than me, with brilliant ec's, and tons of positions, are said to have a 0 percent chance at Harvard. While on here, it's a a bit more mild, and a bit less stress-inducing. People say that normal good students get in, but there's always that little bug at the back of my mind telling me they're not realistic. And then you have my parents who think a 4.0 uw, 4.7 w, 1570 sat is an auto-admit at HYPSM.\n\nWhat is it really? Because I'm getting tired. And I don't know what to do anymore...",

      "text": "Harvard, for example, grades every aspect of your application from 1 to 6.\n\n>In order to score an academic 1, an applicant must be a \u201cpotential major academic contributor\u201d with \u201csumma potential\u201d and \u201cnear-perfect scores and grades.\u201d It also helps if the high schooler has \u201cnational or international level recognition in academic competitions.\u201d  \nThose who earn an academic 2 typically score in the mid-700s or higher on the SAT \u2014 or 33 or higher on the ACT. An academic 3 denotes an applicant with \u201cmid-600 through low-700 scores\u201d on the SAT or a 29 through 32 on the ACT.\n\nAs for extracurriculars,\n\n>In the extracurricular category, a 1 denotes \u201cpossible national-level achievement or professional experience.\u201d High schoolers can hope for a 2 if they serve as \u201cclass president, newspaper editor \\[or\\] concertmaster.\u201d  \nAn athletic 1, meanwhile, indicates the student could compete in his or her sport \u201cat the national, international or Olympic level.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/29/how-to-get-in-to-harvard/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/29/how-to-get-in-to-harvard/)\n\nAlso looking at Stanford and Cornell's admissions process, it became pretty obvious how the T10s choose who to admit and reject: you see, high standardized test scores and GPA is somewhat of a prerequisite for your application. (Of course, being low doesn't mean you're automatically rejected, but you can't deny that you're at a  disadvantage.) Since every applicant has high standardized test scores and a high GPA, students are separated by the more subjective parts of the application--the ECs, LORs, essays...\n\nI also think a lot of people forget how important the essays can be. A student with a subpar application can be instantly admitted with the right essay, as testified by the countless AMAs, blogs, and podcasts done by admissions officers. Of course, this is very rare, but it does show how impactful the essay portion is in your entire application.",

Are they a good match for you? \n\nIn my experience the students who get accepted to the most crazy highly rejective colleges are: \n\nsuper intellectually curious \u2014 they go way beyond school expectations (grades might even suffer a little) and test scores. They read a lot \u2014 just for fun. They do projects and research on their own \u2014 just for fun. \n\nThey\u2019ve won multiple National and international awards \n\nThey have strong leadership \u2014 both within school and outside school. They are looked to as a leader in some way. \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be organized or a title tho \n\nOr they have extraordinary life experiences and have overcome lots of hardship and still managed to thrive (major trauma, family hardships, worked 20-30 hours a week and still exhibited intellectual curiosity)\n\nall you can do is present yourself on your very best day. Let them know who you are and what your strengths are and how you\u2019ll contribute on their campus",
