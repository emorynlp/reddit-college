  "title:": "CWRU SAT scores not showing in application PDF",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI just submitted my CWRU application through Common App and was looking through the PDF to make sure everything looked right. Under the \"Testing\" section, it says \"there are no scores to report\". I know CWRU is test-optional this year, but I did select that I wanted my SAT score to be considered (as it's one of the stronger parts of my application). I believe it's a problem from the university's end, because my friend who also applied saw the same thing, and the other colleges I'm applying to have the scores in their PDFs. I emailed my local dean of admissions but haven't heard back. \n\nAny advice on something else to do? Or just wait and hope they will fix it? Thanks.",
