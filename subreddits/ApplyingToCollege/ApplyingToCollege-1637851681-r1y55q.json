  "text": "\ud83e\udde1Whether you\u2019re from Houston or Hong Kong, Bay Area or Brooklyn, Delhi or Dallas, Kathmandu or Kazakhstan \u2014 or from any other of the many cities and countries across the world our community comes from, I\u2019m grateful for you. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c I appreciate your engagement and your questions and your messages of support. It means a lot to me to know that my words and messages have meaning and that they are helping\nothers learn more about college admissions and how to work through and handle the stressful parts of what can be an anxiety-provoking process. \n\n\u2764\ufe0fMultiple studies have shown that incorporating a practice of gratitude in your life can help you focus on being in the now and help you deal with the downs and ups that life inevitably brings. So, I try to make a daily practice of thinking about how lucky I am and thinking about the good parts of life \u2014 no matter how small. But on Thanksgiving, we take time as a family to think about and share what we are thankful for as we sit around our table.  It makes the day about more than turkey and stuffing and football.  It becomes about family and gratitude and sunshine and health for those of us who have good health. \n\n\ud83e\udde1 What are you thankful for today? It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big. I encourage you to take a minute or two and think about what an alphabet of gratitude would look like for you (that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing around our table today). \n\n\ud83d\udc9c So today, I\u2019m thankful for all of y\u2019all.  I\u2019ve been sharing my thoughts here about college admissions for over 6 years now and y\u2019all make it more interesting and meaningful to me.  What about you? Ice cream? Music? Snowy days? I\u2019d love to hear from you! \n\nHappy Thanksgiving if you celebrate! \n\nxoxoxo AdmissionsMom",

It's incredible to know I'll always have someone in my corner even when I don't deserve it.  I'm still amazed by her every day - the new things I learn about her, the feeling of waking up next to her, the brilliant insights and help she gives me - it reminds me that there are few things in life that truly matter, and she overwhelms all of them.

Existence can be a tiresome burden sometimes, but I am so thankful to exist in a universe where love, life, and art exists \ud83d\udc99\n\n(Special thanks to you, admissionsmom! I remember you mentioned something about how how journaling and being more intentional with gratitude can lead to a happier life, either in a Reddit post or your book. That has stayed with me throughout this whole year!)",

We really appreciate you and everything you do for this community.\n\nI am really thankful for the best present I've ever received, which is time from the people that I care about.  There's nothing better I could ask for nor could I ask for more.  It was given to me by friends, family, my closest friends, people I've loved, and also strangers who offered their great generosity and compassion to share a moment with me.  They've all made an impact on me, and many have influenced the philosophies and identities that I hold, and I want to remember them today because the compassion they gave me is a debt I owe all of them that I will never be able to pay back.\n\nTo everybody who celebrates Thanksgiving today, Happy Thanksgiving!  I hope you all get to rest well, spend quality time with friends and family, and get some great food to enjoy.\n\nHave a nice day!",

      "text": "Wow...I can\u2019t thank YOU enough for giving out so many tips and info on how to apply to university. You have no idea how helpful they are to me.\n\nI\u2019m a first-generation student from a single parent family who isn\u2019t financially well-off. When I started applying to universities in the United States, it was pretty much a shot in the dark. I had to go through much of the process by myself- choosing unis, writing up my applications, down to filling in the certificate of finances and CSS profile for finaid. My mum and relatives aren\u2019t able to offer much help because of the language barrier, we have virtually no connections to the US, and they were pretty clueless about the admissions process. (I can\u2019t stress how much I\u2019m grateful for them still, I know they are doing everything in their power to help me go abroad despite not having the opportunity to obtain a good education. Their support is heartfelt, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.)\n\nI feel like I\u2019m taking a leap into the unknown. The stress, the uncertainty...it weighs down heavy on me sometimes.\n\nBut I\u2019m lucky to have been born in the age of the internet, which has become a major source for accessing all kinds of info related to college for me (and it\u2019s free!). Without an online community like this, I can\u2019t imagine how I could even get to learn about this type of information. I\u2019m thankful for the generous folks like you out there, who are levelling the playing field of college admissions by sharing your resources with everyone, and your kind words reassure me that everything will be okay from time to time. Please know that I really appreciate what you\u2019re doing for our community!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
