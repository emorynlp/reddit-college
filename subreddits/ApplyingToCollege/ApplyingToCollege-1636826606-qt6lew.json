  "text": "Anyone else trying to navigate the UC Application as an out of state applicant? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\n- Are we meant to select \u201cnon-honors\u201d for all classes other than APs, even our Honors classes? It appears that the HL category is ONLY for approved in-State (California) honors and AP classes and out of state AP classes. It feels weird calling my honors classes \u201cnon honors\u201d but doesn\u2019t that appear to be what we are required to indicate? \n\n- How are out of state students supposed to select from the course categories on the left side drop down menu when those are based on the approved California list that doesn\u2019t apply to out of state applicants? \n\n- why is there no option to indicate that my high school uses + and - grades other than to select \u201cother\u201d? The \u201cother\u201d field doesn\u2019t even give enough room to explain this!\n\nI have read the pdf Guide and the website cover to cover. They sure don\u2019t make this easy for out of state applicants.",

You can also look up to see how a CA HS classifies the course.\n\n3. UC does not consider +/-. A-,A,A+ all are considered as 4.0.",

Maybe they will get around to it someday, but I guess they have bigger problems to contend with. Like finding housing for thousands of Berkeley students!",
