  "title:": "Is It a Bad Idea To Attend a College With a Bad Reputation?",
  "text": "In regards to schools like Arizona State or the University of Alabama, are the degrees from   \nmajor \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation? Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools and why are the graduation rates so low? I feel like if I graduate from schools like this I will not have as much respect from employers compared to other schools and even if I graduate with a good GPA, I will still receive skepticism. Should I avoid these schools?\n\nPS: Even though schools like ASU are receiving high rankings and recruitments for jobs are increasing, I still hear a lot of negative stuff about the school and it seems as if the bad reputation isn't going away any time soon.",

      "text": ">are the degrees from major \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation?\n\nTwo reasons, neither of which has to do with those schools being \"party schools\":\n\n1. Their student populations are legitimately not as strong as the student populations are more highly regarded schools.\n2. In the case of Alabama, anti-Southern/anti-conservative bias.\n\n\\#1 can affect how you're prejudged on the basis of your degree, to the extent that's worth worrying about.  Regardless of how capable you actually *are*, some people will assume if you went to Harvard you are \"Harvard material\" and if you went to Alabama you are \"Alabama material\".  It's a useful heuristic, but heuristics only go so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools\n\nThe median graduate is (in theory) not as smart/capable as the median graduate from more highly regarded schools.  Note: the +1 sigma or +2 sigma graduates may be just as capable as the median graduates from much more highly regarded schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and why are the graduation rates so low?\n\nRelative to top schools, a school like Alabama admits many more students who are 1. weaker academically, and 2. poor, both of which decrease the likelihood of completing a degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I feel like if I graduate from schools like this I will not have as much respect from employers compared to other schools and even if I graduate with a good GPA, I will still receive skepticism.\n\nAt some employers, yes, but it becomes much less important if you 1. get a graduate degree from a more highly regarded school, or 2. accumulate some work experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Should I avoid these schools?\n\nOnly you can answer that question.  While there are drawbacks, schools like Alabama and Arizona State often have one huge advantage: they're inexpensive.  The question you must ask yourself is:  how much are you *willing to pay* for the advantages of a more highly regarded school?",

      "text": "Money and connections really help you get your career going; often neighbors or family are how people land early internships and first jobs. If you don\u2019t have those you\u2019ll have to hustle harder and a more prestigious degree can help. But the schools you listed are state flagships. They are not \u201cbad schools.\u201d You can launch almost any career from there and not have student loans crippling you for decades. Once past that first job it doesn\u2019t matter where you went to school or what your GPA was. Seriously. There are only a few industries where attending a top tier school gives you a real longer term advantage.\n\nWall Street firms like to recruit at Ivies because that\u2019s where you find a lot of smart people with connections to rich potential clients. Management consulting firms recruit at T20 schools because they have to use consultants\u2019 resumes to attract big clients and college background can be a signal of ability. And in academia often the top researchers end up at top schools and then their doctoral students flow down to lower ranked schools (they can later move up if they do impressive work). It\u2019s more the connections to a research network than the diploma that get you into grad school, so you can totally connect with a professor at ASU who trained at Yale and get a great rec letter that gets you into Yale for your master\u2019s. Or you can move from Yale to MIT. But it\u2019s about impressing faculty, not your institution. That might honestly be easier at ASU. \n\nFor most other career fields, your major and skill set - and if you have them, connections - matter more than whether you go to a top 20 college. Luck is a factor too. But I\u2019d look more at what the track is for people at that school in your major. There are plenty of ASU and UCSC CS majors working in Silicon Valley. Rutgers trains a lot of HRM students who go on to become HR managers at big international firms in NYC. BYU has a great track for accounting majors into the big 4 and some computer network management major that\u2019s one of only a handful in the country and those grads are placed into high paying jobs super fast. Think about what you want to do next and find a cost-effective college program that will prepare you for that.\n\nMy daughter, a UCLA alum, feels like she was lied to by her teachers and her parents. She is a hard worker and a go-getter but that degree didn\u2019t magically open any doors she couldn\u2019t have with an ASU degree and maybe a friend who already worked in the company. Her friends from UCLA mostly went on to grad school or attended boot camps/other training, partly because they weren\u2019t trained for specific kinds of jobs the way her CSU friends were and struggled. And once employed you get promoted based on your work and job skills. College doesn\u2019t really help all that much.\n\nAs a parent I overestimated how much of an impact school rank would have - probably because my career was in finance, consulting and academia. Hey at least we didn\u2019t take out loans for it.",

It\u2019s more important to look for strong programs for your interests than to look at a school as a whole- for example, ASU has an incredible journalism school and a very well respected engineering school. If those are your interests, you\u2019ll have a solid looking degree. The reputation of ASU is from the 90s and it\u2019s similar to the reputation of schools like USC from that era.

      "text": ">Are the degrees from\nmajor \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation?\n\nNo, not at all.  You'll see this once you get out into the real world.  Sure, there are some industries where your undergrad school matters more, but mostly it's just not that meaningful because companies hire people, not undergraduate brands.  Where you went is merely one data point on your resume.  What you've done, the skills you've cultivated, the connections and network you've built, and the other strengths you present will absolutely dwarf the name of the school you went to.  And after your first job out of college it only becomes less significant.  Do you think any company ever cares where you went to elementary or middle school?  No?  That's about how they will view your entire educational background after you have about 10 years of work experience.  At that point, what you've done is WAY more important than where you went to school.\n\n>Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools?\n\nThey do.  Check out each of these school's career services sites for lists of literally hundreds of job postings.  If you go to their career fairs, there are dozens of companies showing up to do recruiting - heck I used to go to those (mostly at state schools) to recruit when I worked for a Fortune 500 in corporate finance.  It's just not as noteworthy as the crazy recruiting investment banks / management consulting companies do at T20s, so people don't hear about it as much.\n\n >Why are the graduation rates so low?\n\nA much harder question.  There are a lot of reasons.  A lot of it is that state schools admit a lot of people who aren't going to put in the effort required to succeed.  Many of them are leaving their embedded support system and can't make it on their own because they can't or won't hold themselves accountable.  Some of it is that people start college and decide it's not for them or they can't afford it.  Top schools only admit highly qualified students and most of them have vast financial backing on top of it (or they receive massive aid from the school), so the top colleges have the deck stacked in their favor when it comes to graduation rates.\n\n>I feel like if I graduate from schools like this I will not have as much respect from employers compared to other schools and even if I graduate with a good GPA, I will still receive skepticism. Should I avoid these schools?\n\nI don't think that will be the case, especially if you're a top student.  Most large universities have amazing resources and those are not distributed evenly among their students - not even close.  The top students get the lion's share of internships, research opportunities, special courses & programs, co-ops, professional connections, funding, and more.  The top students at state flagships will almost certainly be brighter and more accomplished than the average T20 grad simply because of the numbers.\n\nFinally, there are negative associations with top schools too.  When we were reviewing applications at that Fortune 500 I mentioned, we turned down all three Ivy league candidates we got during one round because they just seemed so pompous and full of themselves - almost like they expected to have a better opportunity than working for us or that they viewed us as a last resort.  This company literally stopped recruiting Ivies after that and focused more on top state schools like UVA, UNC, and Georgia Tech.",

      "text": "> the degrees from\nmajor \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation? \n\nWhile obviously not as big of a party school vibe as places like ASU or Bama, there are plenty of elite schools that have their own \"party\" school vibe. Tulane is known for that, Vanderbilt also has that rep, Penn's nickname is the \"social Ivy\" for its party vibes. I mention these because they are all perfectly respected despite that reputation (which is to say that being a party school isn't the issue.)\n\n> Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools and why are the graduation rates so low?\n\nAre you comparing them with their peer schools or with top schools? Because I've never seen anything that suggests that Alabama or ASU's earnings or graduation rates are absurdly low. ASU, UTK, Yeshiva (for a few schools that are similarly ranked) all have roughly the same graduation rates. They're obviously going to lower than places like Cornell or Duke, but that doesn't mean they're bad schools. \n\n> PS: Even though schools like ASU are receiving high rankings and recruitments for jobs are increasing, I still hear a lot of negative stuff about the school and it seems as if the bad reputation isn't going away any time soon.\n\nI think their reputation fits around how well they do. They're a solid school for most careers. Most people aren't gonna be impressed, but it's not like it's a degree mill either. And I feel like you're confused; here, you're saying that they have good rankings and their recruitment is getting better but earlier you say that they don't get much recruitment. The reality is, outside of a fairly small caste of people for which college is about pedigree, most people go to college today for career reasons. If you have reason to believe the recruitment is good (or you are satisfied with it at least) at those types of schools, who cares about what type of pedigree it confers upon you then?",

                      "text": "It\u2019s doable for sure. I have some friends from undergrad who are current McKinsey/ Deloitte etc,.. employees, though I should mention they all are now there after their first or second stops out of college! \n\nM\u2019y biggest advice for learning how to stand out of the crowd when you\u2019re not at one of the big Target schools, is to do everything under the sun at your college. In undergrad, I was head of a few clubs, did every case competition at my school, worked career fairs, worked for the dean of my college, did internships\u2026 by the time I graduated undergrad, I had a more robust resume than do most post grads. You just have to hustle more and dedicate more time to making yourself marketable, and teaching yourself more. Look at getting certifications while in school, teach yourself R or Python or SQL or database management, work on projects related to those fields that you can talk about in interviews etc,. There\u2019s so many things you can and should be doing regardless of school to stand out. And me and my friends did all of those things! \n\nAs for getting to Harvard out of ISU\u2026 I got lucky. And in truth, just about everyone getting in there has a little bit of luck. But I had a ton going for me by that point. I was a financial analyst for a large Midwestern bank for a bit and then moved to a government job, then to an actuarial science job, all the while having a ton of side projects before even applying to Harvard. I had done all of that by the time I was 25, so I just had more under my belt than most my age which helped. Also wasn\u2019t an MBA! Different program there. \n\nKind of rambly I know but I\u2019m still jet lagged and can\u2019t form thoughts on my phone well haha. M\u2019y best takeaway for you, is that as cliche as it sounds, working insanely hard will get you to those same positions as Ivy leaguers, and the work you\u2019ve put in to get there will allow you to succeed faster than your peers in those roles. \n\nFrom day one, at whatever campus you end up at, find investment clubs and case competition programs, and statistics courses, and get close with professors, and join social clubs, and meet people\u2026 you\u2019ll be blown away by just doing those little things will help you. After a year, apply to officer roles within those clubs, talk with your professors if they have friends still in the industry that they would recommend you to! Compete in case competitions and crush them! When you do those things, you become an employers dream anywhere you go, regardless of where you\u2019re from, i can promise you that!",
