  "title:": "Is It a Bad Idea To Attend a College With a Bad Reputation?",
  "text": "In regards to schools like Arizona State or the University of Alabama, are the degrees from   \nmajor \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation? Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools and why are the graduation rates so low? I feel like if I graduate from schools like this I will not have as much respect from employers compared to other schools and even if I graduate with a good GPA, I will still receive skepticism. Should I avoid these schools?\n\nPS: Even though schools like ASU are receiving high rankings and recruitments for jobs are increasing, I still hear a lot of negative stuff about the school and it seems as if the bad reputation isn't going away any time soon.",

      "text": ">are the degrees from major \"party schools\" usually less respected due to its reputation?\n\nTwo reasons, neither of which has to do with those schools being \"party schools\":\n\n1. Their student populations are legitimately not as strong as the student populations are more highly regarded schools.\n2. In the case of Alabama, anti-Southern/anti-conservative bias.\n\n\\#1 can affect how you're prejudged on the basis of your degree, to the extent that's worth worrying about.  Regardless of how capable you actually *are*, some people will assume if you went to Harvard you are \"Harvard material\" and if you went to Alabama you are \"Alabama material\".  It's a useful heuristic, but heuristics only go so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools\n\nThe median graduate is (in theory) not as smart/capable as the median graduate from more highly regarded schools.  Note: the +1 sigma or +2 sigma graduates may be just as capable as the median graduates from much more highly regarded schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and why are the graduation rates so low?\n\nRelative to top schools, a school like Alabama admits many more students who are 1. weaker academically, and 2. poor, both of which decrease the likelihood of completing a degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I feel like if I graduate from schools like this I will not have as much respect from employers compared to other schools and even if I graduate with a good GPA, I will still receive skepticism.\n\nAt some employers, yes, but it becomes much less important if you 1. get a graduate degree from a more highly regarded school, or 2. accumulate some work experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Should I avoid these schools?\n\nOnly you can answer that question.  While there are drawbacks, schools like Alabama and Arizona State often have one huge advantage: they're inexpensive.  The question you must ask yourself is:  how much are you *willing to pay* for the advantages of a more highly regarded school?",

      "text": "Uh, I'm going to have to reject the premise of your question\n\nASU and Bama might be known as party schools (so are schools like Bucknell and Colgate), but that absolutely doesn't mean they have bad reputations overall (edits blow for specifics)\n\n>Why don't many employers want to recruit from these schools\n\nThis presupposes that employers *don't* want to recruit there, and I'm going to need to see some evidence to support that \n\n>why are the graduation rates so low?\n\nAre 67 and 68% graduation rates \"so low?\" I don't think so, but that's a subjective term ([their graduation rates are also above the national average, not to mention that a fair chunk of their non-graduating classes are probably transfers, not dropouts, but I don't have hard data on that)](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40)\n\nAlso, just based on the rest of your post, I think you're really overestimating how much employers care where you went to school or what your GPA was (which is totally understandable). This is A2C, where everyone is GPA and T20 obsessed, but you've gotta realize that once you get out of college, people stop caring about that stuff *real* quick",

Bama grads do about as well as most other schools. It's what you put in, not the name of your school.",
