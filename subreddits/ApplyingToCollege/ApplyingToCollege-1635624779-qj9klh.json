  "text": "Hey everyone, just curious if anyone out there who has or is applying to Georgetown is encountering the same issue as me.\n\nSo I was looking at my application proof PDF for Georgetown EA and a few of the checkboxes that should be filled are not. For instance, for one of my listed activities it does not have the years that I participated checked down, even though I am certain I did so.\n\nI found a few threads from a few years ago discussing a similar glitch, but I am curious if anyone else was seeing this issue.\n\nThanks!",
