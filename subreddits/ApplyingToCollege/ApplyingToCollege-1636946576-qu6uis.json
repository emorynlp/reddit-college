  "title:": "Musician curious about applying for universities (context in main post)",
  "text": "I'm a prospective music major who hopes to do a double major with some sort of science (most likely biology) in college, so I'm applying to universities (which offer programs in both academics and music), instead of conservatories for just doing music. That being said, I have to do 2 different applications for most of my schools, since many require me to submit prescreening, music resume, etc but also all the generic commonapp stuff and supplements for each college.\n\nMy question is, if my double major plan doesn't work out and I get rejected from the music schools at these universities (which is likely - music is competitive and I'm expecting the worst at this point), can I still be accepted/enroll in the non-music parts of the university? Or does it depend on the school?",

      "text": "I think it does depend on the school. NYU for example has a very selective music school but you can list multiple schools so if you don't get into your first choice, you can be considered for another. \nSome other schools have less strict/competitive music schools where you can even just take interdisciplinary classes or choose to double major after you get in the school. I think, Vanderbilt allows this specifically but most Liberal Arts oriented will allow this or schools with a non-competitive music program.",
