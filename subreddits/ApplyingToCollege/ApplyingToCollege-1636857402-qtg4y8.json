      "text": "Most colleges that use common app only look at the super score since ppl self-report just superscore. Also submitting sat score is a huge boost if u fit into the sat score ranges of schools that u applying so if ur score fits u should definitely apply. Actually, even if ur score doesnt fit into the score range of schools u applying, 1530 is already good enough and not submitting that score is just a dumb move so u should submit",
