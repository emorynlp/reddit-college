  "text": "\nSo I took my very first SAT for the first time on Oct 2nd, and I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t study amazingly. Today I checked my scores and I got a 620 in reading (which I had to rush in very heavily for the last 10 questions and completely guessed) and a 400 for math. \n\nThe only school I\u2019m applying early decision to is Penn State. My cumulative gpa is a 2.8 from a very bad sophomore and freshman year, but got consistent As in my Ap classes junior year. My 1st senior year marking period ends November 4th but early decision is November 1st. Would they still get my transcript for this year if I send it in after then?  I\u2019ll email them but wanted to know anyone\u2019s experience.",

      "text": "Yeah that\u2019s really tough. A low SAT these days always means you can go test-optional, but that\u2019s a disadvantage on its own at most places, and normally works for people who already have a great GPA w EC. That GPA won\u2019t be doing you any favors in the test optional field either. Best bet would be to retake and try to get 1400+",
