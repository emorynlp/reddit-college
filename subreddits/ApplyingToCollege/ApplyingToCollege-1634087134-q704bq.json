  "text": "My Dad is horrendous with pronunciations, he gets really confused between the UCs and USC, is always confused about which one is public and which one is private. He gets particularly confused between UCSC and USC and now calls all the UCs \"USC X\" eg. USC Berkeley, USC Davis, etc.\n\nThe only schools he consistently knows how to pronounce are the ones that have a major city in their name + college/university (eg. Boston University, NYU).  \n\nI don't even know what came out of his mouth when he saw Ursinus College on Naviance.\n\nWhat's the weirdest pronunciation you have heard of a school and the story behind it?",
