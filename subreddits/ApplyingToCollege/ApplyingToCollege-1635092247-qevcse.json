Some Stanford essays require great thinking and completing the entire app in 7 days is not very wise. \n\nEspecially when REA has no boost compared to ED. Rushing an app in 7/8 days vs taking your time for RD is not very smart if I\u2019m being honest. You would have a better chance RD with a thoughtful and intricate app unless you are very confident in ur essays so quickly",
