  "text": "I wanted to submit my application for UCF early, and didn\u2019t understand that the night of Nov 1st is the deadline, and not Halloween for some reason. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that everyone is rushing to get them done now, but I panicked and submitted mine when I shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nBasically my issue is that the app asked to \u201cplease respond to two of the prompts\u201d for the personal essay. I had one statement written that I could use so I started writing the other, and hit the character limit. I didn\u2019t add the second bc I didn\u2019t have enough time (or at least I thought I didn\u2019t) to edit them to fit both, so I ended up submitting the application with one statement instead of two. \nTbf\u2026 it was a pretty good statement. But I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s going to ruin my chances of being accepted. Does anyone know how much it matters? I am just a senior pretending that I know what to do for college when evidently I don\u2019t, I am constantly confused and would appreciate some clarification. Thanks!",

      "text": "You haven't missed the deadline.  Why not just ask the admissions office to accept the two statements?  Finish them, email them, and ask them to accept the two statements instead of the one you submitted.   \n\nIf you just simply explain that you made a mistake (without overly apologizing) it can show a certain level of maturity.  Just ask them to accept the statements you email to them.  It can't really hurt you.  Don't put yourself down in your communication with them.  Just simply explain the mistake you made, and ask them to accept the two statements instead.   It can't really hurt to do this.  Good luck with it.  I hope you get in.   (This is my view as someone older who has worked in business).",
