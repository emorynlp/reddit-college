  "title:": "Northeastern Portfolio to submit or not to submit",
  "text": "So in the Northeastern common app I checked off that I intended to submit a portfolio because I have a bunch of art to show. I submitted my app and only after did I realized the portfolio requires its own 500 word essay and basically a whole other application. I don't know if its worth drafting a whole new essay (but I still do have 4 days for it). Would it be bad if I just didn't submit a portfolio even though I checked it off?",
