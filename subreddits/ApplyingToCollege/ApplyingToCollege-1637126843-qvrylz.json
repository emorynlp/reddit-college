  "text": "I had a couple questions about Columbia\u2019s required reading prompt, which allows for 75 words and reads as follows: \u201cList the titles of the required readings from academic courses that you enjoyed most during secondary/high school.\u201d\n\nFirst, should I include author names in this list? My instinct was not to as it says \u201ctitles,\u201d but I had some friends who applied that disagreed.\n\nSecond, would it look bad not to use all of the available 75 words? I listed 12 books/passages that I enjoyed, and can\u2019t think of any more that I genuinely appreciated personally, but that only got me to 39 words. Is it worth it to have a shorter list and give up room so long as I\u2019m being honest?\n\nThanks!",
