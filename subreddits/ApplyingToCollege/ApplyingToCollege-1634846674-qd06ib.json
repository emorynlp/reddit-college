  "text": "Asking for a friend:\nHe is an international student, and he got a recommendation in Arabic from a teacher who doesn't know English. The question is, will the AOs accept it if he gets the recommendation translated from a certified translation company? \n\nIs it also an option for him to translate it by himself or what will he have to do in this situation?",
