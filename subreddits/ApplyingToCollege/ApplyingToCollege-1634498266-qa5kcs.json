      "text": "It will depend on region of the world, where a given country\u2019s expats tend to go for what field of study and the occupation of an individual.  Short list: HYP, Cal, CalTech, Stanford, MIT, JHU, U Chicago. Maybe CMU and Georgetown too. All of these schools are either the absolute most selective or they are extremely well known for one area that might be incredibly important in a given country. Example: I\u2019d imagine Georgetown has a very strong rep in developing nations in Africa due to international affairs along with Harvard.\n\nOther schools may be \u201cbetter\u201d than some of these schools, but looking at a long list of occupations/fields (law, business, engineering, medical research, CS, other STEM fields, public policy, international relations, general PhD pipelines, etc) the leaders/most \u201cfamous\u201d tend to be found at these schools.",
