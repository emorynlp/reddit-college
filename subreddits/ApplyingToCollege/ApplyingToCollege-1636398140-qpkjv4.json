  "text": "hey besties. im a high school senior applying to schools this year, and due to extreme mental health conditions (double hospitalization), my grades and gpa have suffered tremendously. like, i had a 3.8 uw gpa beginning of junior year, transferred schools and got sick, and now my gpa is sitting at a 3.07. yikes, right? however, im intelligent. just mentally unwell. \n\nmy current act composite (September 2021) is a 32, with 35s in English and reading. im currently awaiting October 2021 test scores. \n\nassuming I improve (or even just keep my current score), how much can high test scores compensate for a low gpa?",

      "text": "totally depends on the schools u are applying to. T10 to T20 won't let u compensate a low gpa with a 32 act unless u have phenomenal ecs or some personal qualities. Other schools wouldn't have as much if an issue",
