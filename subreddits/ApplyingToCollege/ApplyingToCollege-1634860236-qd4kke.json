  "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in but I\u2019ll go ahead and ask: I\u2019ve always wanted to apply to a HBCU and Howard is the one that best fits my requirements for college, but the recent student protests and discoveries about poor living conditions have me kind of nervous. Would anyone who is knowledgeable about Howard recommend applying for  Fall 2022? Or would it be best for me to scratch this off my list. I must note that I am a stickler for good quality campus facilities, which Howard apparently doesn\u2019t have.",
