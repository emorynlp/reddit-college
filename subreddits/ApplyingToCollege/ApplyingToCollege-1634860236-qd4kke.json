  "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in but I\u2019ll go ahead and ask: I\u2019ve always wanted to apply to a HBCU and Howard is the one that best fits my requirements for college, but the recent student protests and discoveries about poor living conditions have me kind of nervous. Would anyone who is knowledgeable about Howard recommend applying for  Fall 2022? Or would it be best for me to scratch this off my list. I must note that I am a stickler for good quality campus facilities, which Howard apparently doesn\u2019t have.",

      "text": "Hey! The people on this sub are pretty prestigious (and lean more towards PWI) so no wonder the comments you got. I just wanted to let you know that the dorm Howard was protesting about wasn't even one that most students on the campus claim, it's like their \"ew that dorm.\" Dorm. The rest of them are pretty good.\n\nHoward is a great choice overall. The connections you get from going to the school are amazing also! Apply there. It'll be fun. You learn a lot about Black history & culture and frankly it feels better when the environment is as inclusive as an HBCU.\n\nI'm not saying this as an alumni or a person who is recruiting or anything.. I'm literally also a senior in college. This is just some things I've heard from alumni and students and wanted to share. I love Howard and didn't want other to be turned off",
