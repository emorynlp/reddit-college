  "text": "I'm applying to a state school that anyone can get into but I'm trying to maximize my scholarship money.\n\nfor the ACT I got 29 composite, 28 math, 33 science, 28 english, 26 reading, and 6 writing(I don't think they care about the writing score)\n\nfor SAT I got a 1320 total with 610 reading/writing and 710 math.\n\n\nI'm not sure which to submit, my counselor said to just send both but based off the equivalent chart it says my act is much better",

      "text": "Schools will typically use the highest score you send them. So you can send both and they\u2019ll just use the ACT, which is slightly higher per the official concordance.\n\nNo school that I\u2018m aware of superscores across tests, but your SAT Math is better than the ACT Math.\n\n I suppose you can send both, on the off chance they notice the higher SAT Math and give yo  some advantage for it. It\u2019s unlikely, but it won\u2019t hurt anything. Other than the cost, of course.",
