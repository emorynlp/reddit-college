  "title:": "I tried to kiss my interviewer! Are my chances ruined?",
  "text": "I (17 m) had my Yale interview today. The interviewer (25 f) was smoking hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me \u201cthe look\u201d left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn\u2019t even remotely about Yale\u2014just random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It\u2019s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?\n\nTL;DR: Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.\n\nEdit: I just emailed my interviewer and both thanked her for the conversation and apologized again profusely. Not sure if there\u2019s anything else I can do at this point. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: The fact that people think it\u2019s a shitpost is only making me realize more and more just how much I\u2019ve fucked up...",

That tells me way more about you than hearing ask questions about Yale.\n\nThe interviewer was doing her job, and he took that to mean he was interested in her, and made an advance. Are women allowed to do their jobs well without being hit on?",

He deluded himself into thinking this woman was into him from what I'm betting was a fairly normal interview.  \n\nThat kind of self delusion is often found in the kind of predatory creep who can't take no for an answer because he's actually convinced himself you want him.  It's honestly one of the worst types of creep because he's usually a confident and well liked dude.    People will rarely take you seriously when you bring up his creepiness because he's actually very charming.  \n\nI wouldn't call op predatory, at this time, because he really sounds like a dumb kid that's watched to many TV romances.  I think what a lot of people are trying to put their finger on though is why this behavior is kind of disturbing.  I think the self delusion and the risk that op could become a predator if he doesn't correct that mindset is what's giving people pause.",

If he gets admitted, everyone will have made a major lapse in judgement, and increased the risk of predatory behavior on campus considerably. OP will never ever get admitted.",

She later got an alumni interview and she did try to hook up with him but backed out when she realized he was a skeezy married guy. \n\nIn the show, Blair was desperate to one up Serena so she kissed the interviewer and later they had a cat fight outside of the house of an important Yale admissions officer.",

I admire your self confidence but it doesn't need to bleed onto others in this fashion because now it can make her uncomfortable at her job wondering if the next guy will act in the same manner and making sure she comes off more cold and distant next time so this doesn't happen.

      "text": "Im going to assume this is real for the sake of discussion. I\u2019m risking being downvoted, but I just want to say.... please learn from this experience something more than \u201cMy life can be fucked up by letting my desires get ahead of me.\u201d Learn empathy. \n\nClose your eyes and pretend you are this woman. You\u2019re 25, have spent years working hard to get into and graduate from Yale, and now have been trusted enough by Yale to be part of the decision making process. You also happen to be physically attractive, which means all of the above achievements have required navigating a social minefield. You\u2019ve probably had potential mentors who tried to get in your pants, classmates who cared more about your figure than your mind, professors who wrote you off as a pretty ditz. Yet you just worked harder and achieved anyway, navigating each situation as it came along. \n\nNow you\u2019re sitting across from a 17-year-old guy who wants to go where you\u2019ve gone. There\u2019s a joy you get from being the one who is interviewing for once, and you probably remember how nervous you were in his shoes. So you try to set him at ease, encourage his insights, laugh at his jokes. Then he leans in to kiss you. \n\nA million thoughts exist at this point. There\u2019s the initial shock, a tinge of panic, and then maybe a feeling of disappointment that *even a 17-year-old* can\u2019t see you as more than some sexual object. You might wonder if you\u2019ll ever get respect in your field when somebody so below you on the career ladder can\u2019t even respect you enough to avoid sexualizing one of the most cut-and-dry professional situations in existence. You feel anger and annoyance and dread at what this means for your future. \n\nThen you feel empathy. You feel bad for this kid, remembering what it was like to be a scared bundle of hormones. You remember the idiot hubris of being 17 and thinking it\u2019s ok to kiss somebody just because you want to. You remember how many awkward stumbles you made at his age, how much you feared the future, how hard it was to learn to control impulses and live thoughtfully. And when he sends you an apology, you have to decide whether anger or empathy will direct your response. Will you teach him a lesson by preventing his entrance to Yale and potential assault on other women at that institution, or will you give him a break and hope he learns a lesson on his own?\n\nShe chose empathy. She\u2019s given you a gift of a second chance. So please learn from this woman and in all things you do going forward, place yourself in another\u2019s shoes. Does that waitress want to flirt or is she just trying to put you at ease so you enjoy your meal and tip well? Does your date want to hear about your amazing talents or discuss a hobby or movie that mutually interests you? Does that drunk girl want to have sex or be taken home safely? \n\nThis woman showed you a generosity of spirit that you can learn from. Be just as generous with the men and women you encounter going forward, and you\u2019ll have a happier life for it.",

      "text": "I think the interviewer \"not holding it against you\" is weak on her part, if true. As a woman, I'm ashamed by that email response to you. What you did is a version of what happens in workplaces, schools, etc., across America. Her WTF reaction shows how wrong you were in your interpretation of her. \" she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me \" does not mean someone in a professional setting wants to have sex with you. I wish she would have told you that there are consequences, and imposed consequences for what you did. You were so extremely and loathsomely wrong and that setting was so outrageously inappropriate. \n\nYou say you are a dumbass, not a sexual predator. What do you think is the difference between a dumbass and a sexual predator? You pursued someone sexually in an off-the-charts inappropriate environment in a way that, in most environments where you would do that, they would be harmed by your actions. It goes way beyond being a dumbass. She should have imposed consequences because clearly the repercussions of acting this way -- not the repercussions for you getting into Yale but the repercussions to people like her, be it her self-esteem in her role or actual career prospects if it happens in a workplace, all over the country and world -- did not sink in for you. \n\nThis will be downvoted because Reddit is a teenage boy's safe space but fuck everything about (a) what you did, and (b) the fact that you are so self-absorbed to not realize you were a sexual predator in this setting. You assure us you were not a sexual predator? Your lack of self awareness makes it even worse. What is a predator? You sought someone out sexually, and actually acted on that, in an environment when you should not have, in a way that tends to be harmful to the recipient. \n\nWhether or not she said so in an email when you awkwardly put her on the spot, how do you think this will affect her confidence as a Yale interviewer in the future? Her very feeling of safety and respect in the Yale community? Her self-esteem around being respected in professional settings? Her overall  feeling of safety and predictability? \n\nYou do not show anywhere that you understand the impact of your actions?\n\n\" Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a  kiss. It\u2019s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for  college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread  the situation too, as she immediately shouted \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d as I  was doing so. \"\n\nHow does this kind of language sound anything like what a predator says? This is almost word-for-word, \"I can't help myself, I grab them by the pussy.\" How can you read what you wrote and not have understanding that those are the thoughts, words, and actions of a predator?",

Do you see how that's extreme? \n\n Not only that, you decided to be offended for this woman and I think that's a real problem. You called her email \"weak\" and said you were ashamed that she's the same gender as you. Don't you think that's sexist? She's a grown woman, she can handle herself. The interviewer graduated from Yale for god's sakes, I'm sure she can manage without your condescending and sexist criticism. She told him no, and it's up to her to decide how uncomfortable he made her and how she will review him. She doesn't need a stranger to come to her rescue and tell her how she should behave. \nIt's farcical that you think this woman is scared from this event. Do you really think he damaged \"her feeling of safety and respect in the Yale community\"?\n\nCan you explain to me how the grab them by the pussy comment from Trump is \"almost word-for-word\" what he said? I only see one similarity, and that's where he says he misread the situation and was overcome by his desire, and that's a bit of a stretch. Trump comments were specifically about him touching unwilling women regardless of what they want. OP was dumb enough to think she was willing. That's a huge difference and I'm worried that you can't make the distinction. I also can't imagine how you think that leaning in for a kiss is on the same level as grabbing someone by the crotch.\n\nWhat OP did was inappropriate and he is a dumb ass, but do you really think we need to worry about him assaulting women? Would you really label what he already did as assault? You're out of touch if you think yes. Your response is blown out of proportion and relies on recycled political arguments that are quick to label men predators and at the same time assume that women are delicate flowers. Ultimately it's unhelpful to everyone involved.",

She seems to be giving him a free pass that he doesn't deserve and, in turn, letting him know this his behavior wasn't \"that bad.\" It was. And, yes, he was predatory. To assume that she was giving him \"the look\" and that she would welcome sexual advances in an interview is delusional and creepy. Maybe she actually did think he was cute, but that doesn't translate into *kiss me now during this inappropriate time.* Sexual predators are always justifying their actions with \"she was asking for it, I could just tell\" and \"I couldn't control my urges lol.\" The amount of disrespect he showed his interviewer is gross and I'm wondering how he behaves in group projects/work settings around other women.",

Now this is stretching into it, but the fact that she was able to say \"no\" before he kissed her leads me to believe he didn't try to force anything.",

You have an awesome story now, at least, depending on how you tell it, and there's a lot to learn from this mistake. \n\nOne thing. Even if she was interested, don't kiss someone within hours of meeting without asking \"Can I kiss you?\" Some people move slower than others, or send out 'interested' vibes when they're really just trying to be polite, so communicating before acting on attraction is a must until you're 100% sure they're interested. If a woman laughs at your jokes and talks to you at length, that's in the realm of being friendly and is not a 100% indicator of interest. Be sure before you act. \n\nAnother. Never make moves on someone when they're at work or doing their job. They have to be there, and they mostly have to be polite and professional.\n\nAt this point, all you can do is learn what you can from the fuck up, and do what you can to salvage your college/career plans. Hopefully you applied to other colleges, and at least after this interview, your other interviews are unlikely to go worse.",

Learn to respect people's boundaries, and learn to ask about them before making some attempt at what would be considered crossing said boundaries.",

So I'm gonna give you some personal advice. \n\nWe all make mistakes and all it takes to make another one is a single lapse of judgement. When shit like this happens, we dwell on it, we want to examine and pick apart everything we did wrong just to tear ourselves apart. That's alright in the short-term - that's how you learn after all - but after a while it becomes unhealthy. Accept that you fucked up and move past it. There will be other opportunities to succeed. If it's ever brought up again, acknowledge it but you've already beat yourself up over it. Don't allow it to defeat you.\n\n\"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\" -MLK \n\nSo get out there and land another interview dude!",

Misreading signs and going in for a kiss that is then immediately stopped once the other person says something IS NOT SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARRASMENT. Jesus fucking Christ.\n\nEdit: and before anyone says it *IM* aware that professional settings are not places to hit on people. Clearly OP was not. He's 17. I doubt he thought much about it. But, when informed that he was in the wrong, he stopped, and apologized. He clearly feels pretty bad about it. I'd say he's learned the lesson. All of us made dumb mistakes in our teens, especially regarding attraction.",

Give yourself a break. You're only 17. But if you're going somewhere like Yale, please be much more conservative or you will surely get in trouble.",

I don't blame you tho, if she really was hot and you were really going at it with that conversation it was in the spur of a moment decision. What I don't understand is that she didn't kiss back? You're story made it seem like she was into you. Well, I think it's for the best that she didn't kiss back. Think about what would have happened if you were to pass the interview and get into Yale but it broke out that you kissed your interviewer and potentially escalated things from there? Not to mention you are a minor. All I'm saying is just pray that she disregards what had happened with that kiss and you still are able to get into Yale considering you worked hard for it. I wish you the best of luck my dude.",
