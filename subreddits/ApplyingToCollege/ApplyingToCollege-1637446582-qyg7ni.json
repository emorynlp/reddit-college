  "title:": "My Duke Alumni Interview + Question",
  "text": "Hello! So a few days back, I shared a post here about my Duke alumni interviewer being not actually an alumni of Duke. I argued that that could be the case because when I googled his name and looked him up on LinkedIn, I saw someone whose alma mater was a different school and is now attending Princeton to do his master's. After sitting for the interview with him, he was indeed a different person, like many pointed out. He's c/o 2020'; I was just confused as to why he didn't have a LinkedIn account. Anywho, all in all, the interview went well. I'd even say pretty well. He was very nice and talked about his experience a lot. Gave me a lotta time to speak. The most important take from my experience is that the interview could go a million different ways. I spent two days getting ready for the interview, and I never consider it that he'd be a lil late then ask me \"How are stuff going?\"! It really hit me, at that moment, that these interviews are really just conversations, not a job interview or just a verbal jeans for me to regurgitate my common app. Now, to my question. After talking for like a few minutes, he asked me if I could turn off the camera and just speak. He said the sound quality is not that good (prolly cuz of shitty internet connection). Oh and we were on Google meet btw. That caught me off guard; I thought that he didn't want to see me because A) I was wearing a long sleeved tee or B) it was unprofessional on my part cuz I was on my phone. It never occurred to me to notify him that I don't own a laptop and have to use my phone. Do you think I shoulda dressed differently? Or perhaps it was actually because my audio was crap?",

      "text": "Had my Duke interview recently as well. Was fine,~ 35 min. To your question on attire my dad requested I put on a button down shirt saying it was appropriate. Don\u2019t think it matters unless everything else screamed unprepared. As for the phone, I had to use iPad and again my dad made sure it was set up correctly regarding picture,audio. Phone may definitely have some limitations. I contacted interviewer prior to interview stating if connectivity was an issue it was because I lived rural. I don\u2019t see any harm in contacting after interview to briefly say thanks and btw \u201c I used the phone due to X and appreciated you( interviewer)working with the technology I had currently\u201d",
