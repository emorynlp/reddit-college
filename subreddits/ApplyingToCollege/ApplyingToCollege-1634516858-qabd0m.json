  "text": "I have like a 1350 SAT, 4.08 weighted GPA, and they're mad at me for not believing I have a chance at Princeton. LIKE HUH? They're saying they got into a bunch of ivies with the same stats, but times have changed. Literally no way. I told them my dream school is NYU, and they were sooooooooo mad. And I told them I should go test-optional for computer science, and they're even madder. Are anyone's parents lowkey clueless?",

If Princeton is NOT your dream school (Like if you genuinely don\u2019t want to go to Princeton, and would be disappointed going to Princeton over NYU) then purposely tank your application (just in case your parents are the type to pressure you to go if you get in) but it probably won\u2019t be necessary thanks to Princeton\u2019s crazy acceptance rate. \n\nStop wasting time and energy trying to convince your parents, you don\u2019t need that stress.

I have a 34 on the ACT (1520 SAT equivalent) and a 3.92 UW (no weighted as school does not offer APs or official dual enrollment). They sometimes question whether I'm doing well enough to get into schools like Rutgers or Ohio State. I am OOS, but I think I could probably get into those two. \n\nMy dream school is Virginia Tech, and they always remind me not to get my hopes up in case I get rejected, which is good advice for many things, but they aren't super selective even if they're a really good school. I love it there though, and that's what matters, not prestige.\n\nNow on the other hand they tell me I'm  not Ivy League material both academically and socially, which is probably right since I'm not a strong student (expecting bad LORs) despite good stats. I also have a hard time making and keeping friends close. Still applying to Cornell, Penn, and Columbia because they look dope. Maybe Harvard too for the meme.\n\nEveryone at school is the complete opposite. It's a sleepy little town in West Virginia, small school of 200 tops, and virtually nobody tries for Ivys. We have no guidance or admissions counselor. Many folks think that I'll definitely get in, and I am really tempted to say that things have changed since 1965-1975 when they were applying, but I know they're just being kind.",

My mom grew up in Italy, my bio dad only went to high school, my stepdad was a drop out.  I just knew my parents couldn\u2019t help much less pay for any test prep classes. I ended up in Junior college for a couple of years and with my older sister\u2019s help applied to 4 in state colleges. I got into all 4 and ended up choosing one that was within driving distance to my home. I guilted my parents into paying for it, I spent way too much of my spare time taking care of a disabled younger sibling. I still came home on weekends to help them out. My parents liked the idea of college but they didn\u2019t really understand what it entailed since they never experienced it themselves. Times have clearly changed and now I have a son about to graduate from high school. We will support whatever school choice he makes. Luckily he knows what he wants and where he wants to apply. He will most likely go to junior college first and then transfer to a Canadian college or University.",

I don\u2019t know your splits, but a 700M 650 EBRW today scales to about 1190 around the time they likely took the test.  GPAs are probably also inflated about 0.2 to 0.3 pts vs then.

The vast majority of applicants would love to have your scores. But a lot of the grief you guys get is because mom or dad remembered a 1350 was at/above the average for all schools outside of HYPSM+ CalTech back then. Mid 1200s was what it used to take to get into schools like ND, Georgetown, WashU, Vanderbilt, etc. so they\u2019re likely fixating on the scores/GPA without context of how the scoring has become easier AND admissions have also become more selective. But it\u2019s not the same test and it\u2019s not the same scaling anymore.",
