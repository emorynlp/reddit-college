      "text": "Just be yourself. Be prepared to answer general questions like tell me about yourself, why school, what are you passionate about, what are your hobbies, etc. Most important thing is probably your delivery. You want to find a way to keep it light-hearted and conversational (responding to what the interviewer is like in the moment), but at the same time you should have a few key distinguishing principles/qualities that you highlight when you are speaking. The biggest 'mistake' people make in interviews are just answering the question stiffly (not providing details and anecdotes) and not showing enough personality (passion + fun side). Best of luck!",
