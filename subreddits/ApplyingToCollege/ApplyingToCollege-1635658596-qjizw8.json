  "text": "For reference, I\u2019m not saying that my gpa is horrible, I just saying that in the ivy league applicant pool (which im in), it will be relatively low\u2014especially considering that Im a international student. \n\nMy freshman grades weren\u2019t good but I have an upward trend in my gpa, except for the first semester of my junior year, resulting in a weighted 3.93 (skl doesnt do unweighted). \n\nMy parents were separated for three months during the first semester of my junior year, and my mom was really having a difficult time. I had to focus on my family, and my grades suffered. \n\nShould I mention this on my app? Or will I be discredited because my freshman grades were already bad to begin with? If so, where do I put it and how do I word it?",
