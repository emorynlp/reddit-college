  "text": "I found step-by-step guide can be more useful for students who are having hard time brainstorming and making an outline of their essay. Here's a step-by-step guide on writing \"Why this major\" essay. Hope this helps!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is \u201cWhy this major\u201d essay?**\n\n\"Why this major\" essays go hand-in-hand with \"Why us\" questions. This essay gives you an opportunity to extend on the \"you\" aspect, delving deeper into your passion in the field you\u2019re applying to. What specific experiences led to your decision to study a certain area of study? How have you explored your interest in the field? This is one of the more straightforward prompts. What you say will matter more than how you say it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 1. List the moments that made you  interested in the major**\n\nEvery college essay needs a story. And every story consists of a specific event. In a \u201cWhy this major\u201d essay, your topic should describe <strong>the events that led you to your interest.</strong>\n\nContrary to popular beliefs, it doesn\u2019t always have to be experiences from your high school extracurriculars - it can be anything that  happened a  long time ago\n\nAlso, it does not have to be a \"life changing\" moment - having a life changing moment at  the ages of 18-19 is uncommon, and admissions officers  are also aware of it. Just be genuine, and  describe what actually happened in your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 2. Put the events in a chronological order**\n\nMake an outline with the events that you have listed in the prior task. Summarize each event in a sentence. Make sure your sentences are connected to one theme: **Your passion for your field of interest.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are two examples of the outline:\n\n\\[Kim\u2019s Outline\\]\n\n\\- I come from a family of  average middle-class U.S. immigrants but we had to move back to our home country due to the 2008 global economic crisis.\n\n\\- Since then, I have  always been curious about why economic issues happen and why my family was  affected but weren\u2019t able to do anything about it\n\n\\- I've been part of the economics club in my high school and I want to continue to study economics in college.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Bong\u2019s Outline\\]\n\n\\- When I was in middle school, I spent a lot of time studying math\n\n\\- One day, I submitted my homework to my math teacher. Afterwards, she called me to talk to her after class.\n\n\\- She said that I had so many drawings on my note that she couldn\u2019t read my answers\n\n\\- I wasn't aware of that, but it was true. Then I realized what I really enjoyed   was drawing.\n\n\\- Since then, I have practiced drawing in  sketching pads and have watched painting videos on Youtube\n\n\\- I was the captain of the arts club in my high school and now I want to major in  arts in college.\n\nFrom the global economic crisis to the drawings on math homework, every single event that impacted you can be a great college essay topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 3. Plan your future with the major**\n\nHow are you going to broaden your knowledge and passion in your field of interest in college? What's your career plan? Displaying your passion through a detailed plan of how you want to develop your interests will differentiate your essay from other applicants.",
