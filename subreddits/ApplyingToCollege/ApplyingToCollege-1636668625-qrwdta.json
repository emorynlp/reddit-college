  "text": "We get a grade for band in our school, therefore it doesn't technically qualify as a EC or something I can put on the activity list for common app. It appears on my grade transcript. Should I email colleges directly about this to take it off? I don't want something like this to be the reason I get flagged and rejected. It's my 9th activity in importance so its not very influential to my application.",
