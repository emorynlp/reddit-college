  "text": "All this fucking work...piles of god damn essays, stressing over LORs and transcripts, and demonstrated interest, spending hours fine tuning applications, all just to go to the same state school everyone in my high school is going to. Yeah I\u2019ll probably get into a few other schools but imma need a fat scholarship to make it financially viable. Sometimes I feel so burnt out and wonder if it\u2019s worth going through this whole process just to probably end up at a state school. Honestly this applies to my whole high school experience. Was it really worth grinding for those As in classes I don\u2019t give a shit about if I\u2019m just gonna go to a state school I could\u2019ve gotten into with a 3.5?",

Why are you doing that?\n\nOne counterargument:  even if you wind up at your state school, you may *pay significantly less to attend* it than if you had not done all that hard work during high school.  You may also be admitted to an honors program you would not otherwise have been admitted to, which can enhance the experience of attending said state school.",

All of the top schools are pretty different environment-wise and prestige only significantly matters for becoming a professor, lawyer or a politician. Just seems like a waste imo. Paying extra to go somewhere that isn\u2019t as good of a fit for a tiny percent boost when applying for jobs (assuming you don\u2019t plan to go to graduate school)",
