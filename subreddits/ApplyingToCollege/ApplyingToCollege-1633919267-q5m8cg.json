  "text": "my school operates on a semester basis with one midterm per semester where we get report cards of our grades in the middle of the semester. on the actual transcript, there's only the final grade for each semester, nothing about midterm grades.\n\nI'm currently failing my math class (only two assignments have been entered, both of which were tests I completely bombed) and possibly gym (scheduling error led to absences) -- will colleges see those grades? or will they see up to the last completed semester (spring 2020-2021)?",
