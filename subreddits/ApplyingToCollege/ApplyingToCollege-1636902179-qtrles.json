  "title:": "stanford interview in 1 hr AHHH",
  "text": "Oh my god my interview is in an hour!!! I can\u2019t believe this day has come already. Hopefully it won\u2019t go too bad and best of luck to everyone else :)\n\nupdate: it went really well! my interviewer was super nice and prefaced the meeting by telling me about what she has to fill out at the end of the interview (basically just how I am as a person and any additional information about myself).\n\nthe whole thing lasted for around 1hr and 20 mins and we mainly touched on my experience transitioning to boarding school (I'm an international student), what clubs I'm involved in, other activities outside of school, why stanford, and what my fav class is. she then let me ask her questions for the last 30 or so minutes and she shared a lot about her experience at Stanford. \n\nshe ended the interview by saying how this whole application process is a crapshoot and how I shouldn't be too hard on myself when I receive my results. so really, don't be too nervous for your interview because they truly want to help and are super nice :)\n\ngood luck everyone!",
