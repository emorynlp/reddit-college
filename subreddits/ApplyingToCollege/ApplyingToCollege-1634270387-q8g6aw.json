  "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a quick question about CMU's ACT policy. I emailed a counselor there a bit ago and they said you needed to send all ACTs you have ever taken in your life. I have taken 5 (one being when I was in 7th grade). Does this mean I need to send all 5, paying $80 total to do so? Or could I somehow send my super score which has 3 of these tests and then the other two separately?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso since I am EDing there and haven't sent the scores yet, is it too late? Or is there still time for them to receive my scores officially from ACT?",
