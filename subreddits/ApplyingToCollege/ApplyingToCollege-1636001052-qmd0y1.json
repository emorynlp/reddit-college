  "text": "1. If I\u2019ve requested a college transcript to be sent electronically through Parchment, will it show up on my portal that they\u2019ve received it? (Should I just wait it out a few days or upload an unofficial copy through the portal)\n\n2. Will additional LORs submitted through the Common App appear on the portal like the teacher recs?\n\nI ask all this because they\u2019ve said they\u2019re \u201cunable to provide email acknowledgment for any non-required materials.\u201d Just want to make sure everything went through.",
