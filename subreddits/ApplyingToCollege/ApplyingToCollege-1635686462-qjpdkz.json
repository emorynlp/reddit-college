  "text": "Hi I only know about Berea's supplement essay recently. It requires me to mention the following aspects \n\n1. An overview of your educational and life experiences;\n2. What you plan to do after completing your education;\n3. Why you wish to return (or not return) to your home country;\n4. Description of ways you have positively impacted your community.\n\nHave anyone done this before. How details should you dig into details and which part should I focus on most and why don't they ask what i'm going to do in berea?\n\nThank you in advance!",
