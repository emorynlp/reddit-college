      "text": "Most universities in the US prohibit resident freshmen from bringing a car to campus.  \n\nMost universities in the US have done a very good job of providing everything a student **NEEDS** on campus, or within public transit distance from campus.  \n\nA Parking pass for your car on campus might cost anywhere from $300 to $1,000.  \n\nOff campus parking might cost about the same.  \n\nAt $25/each, $500 buys you 20 Uber/Lyft rides.  \nHow many trips to \"Real Walmart\" do you need per semester?  \n\n\"Little Walmart\" is probably on the bus line.  \nLearning to use public transportation can be a bit of a culture shock, but most universities have negotiated free or really cheap use of public transit for students.  \n\nAn unlimited bus pass might cost you anywhere between $0 and $100 per semester.  \nWith ship-to-store anything you can get from \"Big Walmart\" can be delivered to \"Little Walmart\".  \n\n*(In case you haven't experienced one yet, Walmart is putting compact, student-needs-focused mini-stores on every campus in the US, or as close to campus as they can negotiate.)*",

I have never seen a student have a car on campus and think it was worth the money, hassle, or ineffectiveness for getting around campus.\n\nInteresting move by Walmart. Target has also gotten in on this: the Target at UCSD is fantastic. In larger cities, I know IKEA has sometimes run shuttle buses to universities near the start of the school year.",

What is it worth to you, and what would our piece of the action be?
