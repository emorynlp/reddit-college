  "text": "The head teacher of 12th grade chemistry (i had th same teacher for 11th)\nThe non-head teacher of 12th grade physics (i has the same teacher for 11th)\nThe head of teacher of 10th grade physics\n\nPlease advice. I feel the head teacher of 10th grade physics might have the best LOR. Do AOs care if the teacher is a head teacher or not?\n\nHead teacher basically means the head of the subject dept.",
