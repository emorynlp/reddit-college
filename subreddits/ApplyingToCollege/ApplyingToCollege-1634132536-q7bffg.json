  "text": "So a lot of people have these crazy extracurriculars but I've wondered how exactly you emphasize or explain them in your common app? Other than the portion for 10 activities (which already limits how much you can explain about an activity) the only other place you could do it is the essays and obviously it's not a good idea if your essays are used to brag. So how do y'all flex your ECs in your apps?",

      "text": "well for the stuff I\u2019ve done that\u2019s had tangible impact on the world I can list the corresponding metric/proof and it\u2019s self explanatory. the line between award and ec is blurred for some of my ecs too so it can be easier to just explain and list them in the activity section. Generally I think it makes sense to keep the awards section to clear state/national titles and then have the more context/recognition based awards in the ec description",
