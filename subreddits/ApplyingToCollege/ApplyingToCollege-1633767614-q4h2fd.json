I have worked hard for the past years and got a nearly perfect GPA and other tests, but now I question whether those numbers really matter.",

      "text": "I think a large portion of them are international students who are applying for aid, thus, they have a completely different criteria for admission. Being an international student, even winning International gold medals or founding a successful startup is not enough to guarantee T20's. \n\nSo people (including myself) hold them to a much higher standard than domestic applicants. I have seen more \"godlike\" applicants get rejected from every single college in the US than similar applicants who got accepted. So I don't think that their comments are misplaced. If you are a domestic applicant, you can just ignore those posts about intl students tbh, your application process will be much much easier than them.",

The \"advice\" or \"predictions\" are utter bs.\n\nIf you're so concerned about your \"chances\" then you're much better off browsing through r/collegeresults. Not to say that the posts on there are 100% genuine (likely quite a few exaggerations), and well college admissions is very subjective anyway, but you can get a feel for the baseline of raw stats (GPA, tests, ranks) and ec's (clubs, leadership positions, competitions, internships, etc) for specific schools or specific majors.",

The only thing you should care about is whether the college thinks you are good enough, and there is no way you will know that. So if you have the money, or you have a waiver, just apply!!! People with way worse stats get in and people with way better stats get rejected. All of what happens to others or what other people think about you doesn't matter.",
