  "title:": "Still haven\u2019t decided my ED/REA school.",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to decide between Brown, Yale, Grinnell, and Swarthmore for months, and recently I somehow got the idea to consider Stanford, too. I have no clue how i\u2019m going to decide. I love the nature of the tiny LACs but I\u2019m worried their CS curriculum and course offerings won\u2019t be sufficient and that i\u2019ll have trouble getting a good job right out of college (a concern I don\u2019t have at all about the Ivies+Stanford). I think my app and stats are alright enough to give me an okay shot at any of them, but I do think an ED to one of the LACs would give me a better shot, obviously. The deadline is coming up (obviously) but I am really struggling to make a decision. Any pointers would be appreciated (especially people in CS at any of the listed schools). Thank you :)",

I do understand that this is mostly because stronger applicants tend to apply more frequently in the ED type programs, but I would consider myself a fairly strong applicant.",
