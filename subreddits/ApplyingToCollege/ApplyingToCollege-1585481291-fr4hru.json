  "title:": "A message to future international STEM applicants, particularly Asian students",
  "text": "Admittedly, I'm using a throwaway account.\n\nI'm currently an international freshman student at a certain college in America. I wanted to share some (unasked-for) insight for future international applicants who are interested in STEM.\n\nFirst, my stats. I want to emphasize that I have no intention to brag about my accomplishments, so please don't take this the wrong way.\n\n(To keep my anonymity, most stats are kept vague but are written so that the gist is understandable)\n\nI am an Asian male looking to major in a certain field in engineering.\n\nGPA:  4.0/4.0 (Constantly in the top two throughout all my years of high school, which is one of the top three high schools in my country. We need to pass multiple tests to enter our high school.)\n\nSAT: 1560/1600, first try (not that that means anything)\n\nSAT 2: 800/800, 800/800, first try (Math 2 and a certain science subject test)\n\nExtracurricular activities *(Most are kept vague to preserve my anonymity):*\n\n* Invented/Discovered a certain new thing under the mentoring of a university professor, published paper and accepted to present at an international conference\n* Won national competition in a certain field. The twist was that other than me every other participant was a  college student pursuing their masters degree in the field\n* Captain of a high school team competing for a certain well-known international contest\n* Won in multiple national contests related to my field\n* Started multiple clubs at my school, and every club has won a national award of some sort\n* Recognized and was provided full-ride scholarship grant by my country for the four years of my college (excuse my passive voice)\n* etc.\n\nMost professors in my country who are in my field of interest knew who I was from my research and I've been interviewed for a news article too-which isn't an extracurricular, but I want to emphasize that my application can probably be considered to stand at a very high level.\n\nEssays:\n\nIn my senior year, I've written 1216 essays (This includes short 100 word essays all the way up to the common app). I know; it sounds like BS, but it's true.\n\nInternational students *WORK THEIR ASSES OFF.* I remember living on an hour of sleep and spending a constant five to six hours every day writing and rewriting essays for a whole year. I had everybody I knew (including a relative who has experience with college applications/essays) and consultant professionals check my essays.\n\nAfter a grueling 1216 essays I was confident that my final products were the best I could produce. My common app way my revision number 83. I did everything I could, paying attention to each and every word in every essay, and admittedly submitted my application at 11:58 P.M. All my essays were perfectly at the word limit, which doesn't mean jack sh\\*t but yeah.\n\nSome parts I could've improved were my SATs and my submission time; I definitely could've spent more time grinding out practice tests to aim for a 1600, and while it's said to not have an effect on college decisions my submission time was probably a bit too close to the deadline.\n\nAgain, I'm not here to brag.\n\nAnd now my results.\n\nOut of the 21 schools I applied to, I was accepted to three and wait-listed/rejected by the rest. Yes, I applied to Ivy league and so-called \"T20\" schools. I got into one Ivy league school (No, not HYP) and two other very awesome STEM-focused schools who were kind enough to give me a smile of acceptance.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, here's my message to the fellow future STEM international applicants.\n\n* The whole admissions process is \"unfair\" and biased in countless ways. Why? I'll explain in the following bullet points. But I guess that's just how life is.\n* Asian + Male + STEM, especially CS, ME, or AE = You're going to have a very hard time.Yes, being female will increase your chances of getting into a better school; this is very clear from admission stats. I'm not trying to undermine the accomplishments of the accepted female students and saying that they've achieved less than their male counterparts; I'm saying that with the same/similar level of stats, most colleges will probably choose the female applicant. I'm also implying that yes, the \"each and every person is special!\" is BS.\n* Contrary to popular belief, yield protection does exist.\n* This is probably well-known already, but international students need to achieve WAY higher than the average student in America to obtain similar results, i.e., \"We consider each application without regards to race and ethnicity\" is obviously BS.If this was actually true, American colleges would be flooded with international students, particularly from China and India, but in that case, where would domestic students go?In other words, the international applicants from competitive backgrounds are most likely VERY, VERY smart. One person I know who goes to MIT is a math genius; not just the \"typical international math Olympics gold medalist,\" I'm talking Von Neumann-level of genius. Dude literally solved the hardest problem on the math Olympiad in under 15 seconds.That's the competition you're (or rather, us international students are/were) going up against. And one thing that tends to go unseen is that it's VERY, VERY difficult to even do an extracurricular in most Asian countries, whereas in America opportunities are abundant and handed out to students who want to participate in them.Colleges need to have \"diversity\" in their student body; they can't just admit every qualified international applicant (Which, in my opinion, is fair. Every country has colleges international students can go to, and American colleges are technically for American students in the first place). Your race/ethnicity/family income are all (uncontrollable) factors in your college application. Even if you're super good at what you do, if there are tons of others with the same conditions then you'll have a less chance of getting in compared to somebody who has \"achieved less\" but has unique uncontrollable characteristics. Accomplishment itself is a very relative factor.This is one reason why you shouldn't feel disappointed in yourself when you don't get accepted to a certain school; you were qualified-perhaps even more qualified than a portion of the admitted students-but you were waitlisted/rejected because of something you can't control. At my school, I hate to admit that around 70% of the people here aren't the shiny, omnipotent Ivy league students people think they are.\n* As a STEM student, you aren't only judged by how smart you are. As in, you can't just be good at the technical stuff, unless you're so good that you're number one in the world and nothing else matters, even your grades and SAT. You must create an image of yourself where you're also good at things like PRing and the humanities, your \"compassion and care for others\" in your application in some way. I believe this holds true for the future, when we apply for jobs/positions too.This does go against the traditional  \"follow your true passions\" BS, but like explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion.\n* This follows from the previous point, but if you want to get into a good school you are most likely better off pursuing something that sounds good on an application than your true passions.This is the reality.In my case, I was lucky enough to have my real passions work out for me at the end. I've continued my research in college, and things are working out quite well. But chances are most people won't be as lucky as I was.Sadly, you just can't write about your hobby of gardening unless you've obtained a really prestigious award which shows your \"artistic skills.\"\n* The vast majority of students from international countries who are applying as a STEM student and were accepted to HYPSM have an Olympic Medal or something close to that.No well-known international/national awards? You only have a slim chance of getting into T20s, and even if you do have a prestigious award, you still may not get in. In my case, everybody around me was shocked to learn that I didn't get into HYP. Again, I'm not trying to boast.\n* Essays are very important for domestic students, not international students. Of course, there are outliers but in general your extracurriculars are what get you into T20 schools. But if you are willing to bet on that sliver of a chance where you're going to be that outlier, you're most likely in for a big disappointment. I'm not saying to give up and not try;  I'm saying to not aim too high and expect to prove reality wrong. Unless you're Einstein, it's probably not going to happen.\n\nMy point is, to all the Asian international male students who are looking to major in a field of engineering: I'm sorry, but most of you won't get into your top choices, especially if your top choices are Ivy League-level colleges if your extracurriculars aren't at a godly level. The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive.\n\nFrom my personal experience and what I've heard from others, this is the harsh truth.\n\nEDIT: This post is by any means not to discourage future applicants. However, such applicants should keep in mind the competition you're up against and expect the worst from your best results.",

      "text": "> most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion. \n\nThis hit home damn.\n\n> The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive. \n\nDon't know India, but one of my friends from China recently got into Harvard. He's literally the first person from his city who made it since ten years ago. His awards are not only stellar, but also diverse (like math gold medal, CS gold medal, literally invited as a guest of TED talk, finalist of *multiple* academic contests in China). Stats even higher than those of yours. I'm very, very proud of knowing him, and I knew he has a solid chance at T20, but I'd never, ever expect him to get into Harvard. He is mostly likely to remain a legend in his city for years to come.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that, bold assumption as it sounds, if he had been an American he'd BLASTED his way into an Harvard without anyone doubting him. But in China nobody really dare to put up high hopes on anyone to get into Harvard. I know another Chinese student as brilliant as him but she got rejected by all the Ivies, from Cornell to Yale. It's random, and heart-breaking.\n\nYou post is exposing the ugly truth. Good luck in your future endeavor, man. You're an achiever.",

I remember when I applied, the people who applied to American universities with me would never check a Yes for requiring financial aid, because despite some schools saying that they're need-blind, they're not. So most applicants just say \"No\" for now and hope for the best, which obviously has gone very astray for some people I know.",

But then after taking CS courses in college, I started to go down that path as well (switching majors within the college of engineering is straightforward). Now I suck at CS, and I do below average in many of the courses. But I get to fail Big-N tech interviews while many others don't even get an interview to begin with. \n\nSo, pro tip: don't talk about CS (unless you're one of those CS gods), there's other cool shit to talk about. Get into a school with a good CS program, you can always take those classes. Y'all are unique people with unique passions and personalities. You do care about something and have a drive to change the world c'mon.",

      "text": "I am curious as to why the desire for international students to study here is so great? Do you have a limited number of good universities where you live? Or, is the desire part of a longer term plan to eventually become a citizen? Is a very long and frustrating road ...\n\nThe biggest problem, once you are admitted to a college, is the visa issue. You can only stay in the country while you are in college. If you want to get a job after you graduate it\u2019s almost impossible because employers can only hire people with particular, hard to find skills AND work visas are limited and  issued thru a lottery. Even worse 5 or 6 tech companies get the majority of them. 99.9 % go to managers/executive level as their skills are hard to find. \n\nSo now what ? Graduate schools are creating thousands of new \u201c Stem Degrees\u201d to meet new visa requirements set by our government for international students. Most are just cash generators of $60-150,000 for a program that takes 12 months to complete. After graduation you can try to get hired but again the competition from this pool of candidates faces the same visa/lottery issues. One extra year of education doesn\u2019t over-qualify you for any job especially with no work experience. You can get an OPT job for 2-3 years if you can find one but I have seen kids work for no pay or maybe $20 hour with no benefits to stay here ....so now they return back to China heartbroken and angry after spending a fortune their parents $$\n\nCatch 22 for sure. \n\nNow what ? Phd - 5-7 years at lousy pay( $40,000 a year )  and living in crappy rooms in expensive cities. Long hours that feel like servitude in academic environments that have few professor jobs that lead to a real tenured professor job ( real power but not great pay $125,000 annual average ) and declining in numbers as they are expensive for pensions etc)  So you get a new visa but where does it lead ? What job ? The controls on visas crush all hope. \n\nIf you are very, very lucky and do get a job at Facebook or Google you will be hired at below market rates with the hope and promise \u201c we will sponsor you \u201c guess what ? You can\u2019t leave because no other tech company will hire you since you are already in the system waiting 3 -5 years minimum for a green card - it\u2019s a quiet agreement that is well known. the company owns you. Lots of subs dedicated to these folks. \n\nSo after spending $75,000 plus expenses for 4 years for undergrad. 1-2 more years plus another  $75,000 more for masters degree and then applying for a PHD program and not even knowing you can get a job is it worth it? No family around, new country, new culture. What is the dream about ?\n\nI have heard it is much easier to go to Canada because they need to add to their population and they have a few very good schools so why not go there? \n\nHope I am not angering anyone by asking these questions but I am trying to understand what drives international kids and their parents to pursue this long path that seems to end up a large majority of kids finally returning to China or India after spending so much time and money. They feel like failures. It seems so sad to  go through this.",

It's not Tsinghua, it's Harvard. And most T20 schools are located in America, if not England or Swiss.\n\nMost Asian parents (I was lucky to have parents that allowed me more freedom) care about prestige. They think that by saying \"I go to Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford/MIT/Columbia/etc.\" their children will be guaranteed a stable life wherever they go.\n\nHere's an example: Say two people want the same position at a French university. Which one will most likely get chosen?\n\nA) \"I graduated from Harvard/Yale/Princeton.\"\n\nB) \"I graduated from Tsinghua, the best university in China.\"\n\nThe name brand is what gets person A the position, which while I do know is never the case (Obviously, graduating from a top university can never guarantee a position) most Asian households believe otherwise. Because that's what happens in Asian countries; you went to a good university? You must be a good applicant then! That's just how it is.\n\nPersonally, I wanted to study abroad because top American universities had the money and facilities to conduct the research I wanted. I actually wasn't even planning to apply to universities abroad; I was offered a free ticket to the best university in my country, but I declined it to apply to American universities. Why? That university doesn't allow students to conduct undergraduate research, which is true for most if not all Asian universities!\n\nI'll admit; although I do have a future dream, I haven't yet thought through how I would carry my plan out. And like you said, I might not even be able to stay in America despite my \"efforts,\" but the fact is that America is \"Where dreams CAN come true.\"  In the country where I came from, it's just not possible to do what I want to do, but in America, I at least have the chance to get what I want. For some Chinese students, I think this holds true, but take my comment with a grain of salt because I'm not from China after all.",

The sad, sad truth is that international admits, for the large part, are from well-off families and over 90% of the time from private schools. They were the ones who could afford to pay for heavy consulting fees, expensive extracurriculars, tutoring, and offer as many resources as their kids would need. The discrepancy between a low-income student at a public school, compared to a well-off kid at a top private school, is incredibly insane. As a public school student, it could be heartbreaking to see throughout my years there, the stunning amount of sweeping rejections to an unequivocally insanely qualified group of kids (I'm lucky enough to attend a highly ranked public school; most kids at my school are not at all rich). If you are low-income seeking a better education in America with finaid, and unless you are absolutely the best at what u do, unfortunately, you will never make it",

But it\u2019s like saying a college in France should accept more people from China just because they have better achievements. In the long run, that makes sense for the college right? They should always accept people who have higher chances of being successful? But really, they should prioritize giving opportunities to their countries\u2019 students. Why? Bc it\u2019s their frickin country. Personally, if I was a hardworking American high school STEM focused senior who knew that all the spots in top colleges were being taken away by international students, I would hate it because the college admissions process is already flawed. I would wonder why my country prioritizes other countries\u2019 students more than their own. But that\u2019s just my opinion. I\u2019m not downgrading any of your achievements.

Rejecting 99% of their applicants improves their prestige. Accepting the financial 1% improves their administrator paychecks.

      "text": "I'm Indian so I'll speak on an Indian students pov.\n\nIn every asian household there is a misconception that prestige matters, if you're attending HYPSM your life is stable and you're destined for succes(which is obviously not true but that's what most asian parents believe, infact even few of my friends who didn't apply to colleges in US dont even know Dartmouth is an ivy and is a fantastic school), this results in Asian students to be more competitive as they have always been told to chase prestige.\n\nReason why us indians apply to US (STEM) : China and India have the world biggest population, and India has a huge youth population. Every year in india 1.5 million students appear for Jee examination (national entrance examination for entrance to India's  engineering universities) and 1.5 million appear for NEET ( national entrance examination for medical colleges), plus hundred thousands more in the commerce, humanities and arts field. The competition here is huge.\nThe IIT's are the premier indian engineering institutes (think Ivy's of India but it's only stem and it's public), there are 16 IIT's india out of which 10 were established after 2004. Therefore these 10 colleges even though have the name IIT, they are not that brilliant and do not have that same prestige as the original 6 IIT's, and here in India only for STEM field prestige matters, so therefore your only targets can be these 6 IIT's+ a couple more private universities. \nThe admission to these IIT's is solely through the JEE examination which is nothing but a 3 hour paper with 75 questions 25 physics, chemistry,math each. That's it. \nGet a rank of about <5000 in jee and that's it you're admitted to the top 6 IIT'S. <5000/1.5 million. Are you fucking kidding me. Hence people start preparing for these exams since 5/6th grade. So yeah it's extremely difficult.\nNow the average salary of an IIT graduate is $19,500 (if you graduate from another less prestigious university it's less); putting it into perspective, imagine an American student, works his ass off his whole life, and is a  top 5000 student in his country, graduating from HYPSM earning roughly $60,000 (GDP & PPP relation and all that crap, basically earning $20,000 in India is same as earning $60,000 in US). \nNow even if you're not a HYPSM graduate but you're a CS graduate from a T20/T30 school your average salary will be $100,000.\nNow, there are no undergrad research opportunities in IIT, infact there are no research opportunities in the whole of India. \nAlso there is global diversity in US colleges, in India there are hardly any international students\nThese University are ranked 300,400 in world and we don't need to talk about ranking of US colleges, do we.\nEverything has its own pros and cons. Living in India had its pros and cons and living in the States has its own pros and cons, but I believe everyone will agree with the fact that the quality of life is better in the States than India.\n\nI feel these are the reasons why us Indian apply to colleges in the States for STEM",

      "text": "Hi! Female international asian STEM applicant here! I read your post and thought some points were a little bit too exaggerated- though that\u2019s not to say that your experience is invalid. Of course, I\u2019m very familiar with the cutthroat competition that international students (especially asians) face when applying to US colleges. But you do NOT have to be a maths genius, publish a book in your field, or win national awards to be accepted to T20 or Ivy League schools.\n\nI\u2019m also from a top5 international school in my country, so I know damn well how stressful it is to compete against these super bright students within my own country. Having a full 4.0 gpa and a sat score above 1400 is NOT optional- it\u2019s a necessity if you want to be competitive enough to even be considered for T30 schools (unless you have hooks/exceptional ec\u2019s). \n\nMy stats fall within this range, with pretty average ec\u2019s and even more average essays. Yet I\u2019ve been admitted a T20 school and at least 3 more T20 schools for my major, which is a STEM. I\u2019ve been accepted to all T30 schools I applied to. I got 1 reject and 1 waitlist overall. Keep in mind I did not apply to any Ivies and all my apps were RD (which I would advise underclassmen reading this to just do ED or EA, since your chances of getting in would be much higher). There are at least six more people from my grade who got into a T20/Ivies. Given that only 30 or so people applied to the US at my school, this number isn\u2019t low at all. Other top international schools with significantly higher US applicants are even more successful than mine- at least 10 students from each school got into T20/Ivy. I can assure you that they aren\u2019t geniuses at all. They\u2019re just very RICH and motivated students who happen to be kinda of smart. \n\nAnd I emphasize on rich BECAUSE that\u2019s a great advantage. I won\u2019t get too much into it, but basically these kids pay +20k and sell their souls to professional college counselors (that imo should be illegal. Is it even legal?). There are large and super profitable institutions specifically catered towards this kind of service. Excuse me for saying, I might just be bitter\u2014 but  whatever authenticity or sincerity their essays had going on would have been stripped away. Some applicants weren\u2019t even bothered to start a first draft on their own- they leave it to these institutions to do it for them. Yet college AO\u2019s eat it up. I think it\u2019s just wrong (ethically) to hire a professional to formulate, rewrite, and perfect your essays. \n\nSorry for the long post.\n\nTL;DR: international asian students that get into T20 schools aren\u2019t always geniuses. Many hire professionals for +20k USD to basically write their essays for them.",

It's undeniable that getting into a Ivy+ university is a crapshoot. But if they had to go to an expensive American college that's not very famous in their home country (ie., won't help them enough to justify the cost, if they do decide to return home after college), then they might as well stay home and get a much cheaper education there (while shooting for American grad schools, if they still want to come here). \n\nRe: the rest of your comment: \nLet me clarify any misunderstandings about my financial aid situation. Going to MIT is cheaper than going to a community college, and I don't have to worry about transfer applications. I would have been totally okay with going to a cc and transferring, but in my situation, I saw no tangible benefits to doing so. (Though there's nothing wrong with community colleges, it's undeniable that they provide different experiences and opportunities than a lot of 4 year colleges.) At MIT and most other Ivy+ schools, there are also successful alums, and you can also do PhD research as a freshman and get coveted internships. And you can do all of that more easily than at state flagships, based on my friends' experiences at those schools, probably because of higher opportunity density (opportunity/student). \n\nKeep in mind that the cream almost always rises to the top. The students you mention most likely did well not because of their school, but in spite of it. Honestly, while you say some helpful things, a lot of your comment (and rhetoric in general) is so excessively antagonistic towards Ivy+ schools and people from them that your advice is clearly biased and often not helpful. (Seriously, feeling happy whenever you know something that someone from say, MIT, doesn't? Ok lol.)\n\nObviously, where you go for undergrad doesn't dictate your future. I too know lots of accomplished people, including surgeons, engineers, etc, who didn't go to HYPSM+ universities, and some from backgrounds like the guy you describe. \n\nBut there are legitimate reasons why people want to apply to and attend those schools (and why people might not want to go to school in middle America). The problem is when people have their sights set so strongly on Ivy+ schools that they risk their mental and physical health to do so.",

I am an Asian male from an international school who's going into STEM (granted my major is mathematics, so it may be less competitive than engineering, etc.) but I don't have any national awards, and 0 math competition awards (I never enjoyed competition math. I think I had the capability to do decent, though, although definitely not at the IMO level). I applied to ~7 schools in the US, with an ED to UChicago. And I got in.\n\nI say this not to brag, but only to demonstrate that I got into what's considered amongst the top 5 math departments in the country, with peanuts for awards (and very few extracurriculars). I realize how this might seem as the exception rather than the norm. However, a lot of the other admitted international math prospies also had similar (if *slightly* better) backgrounds. All I had going for me were relatively strong essays and great grades.\n\nAt the same time, I realize UChicago places disproportionate emphasis on their essays, but I still do not see other T20 schools being excessively more selective for math.\n\nMaybe other STEM subjects are more selective. I don't really know. But other people I know who have applied to STEM T20's from my school (including several international Asian males) have got in without \"national awards\" and \"one hour of sleep a night\". A strong work ethic, demonstrated interest and a stroke of luck are all that is needed. There is no need to spread so much apprehension regarding admissions for our demographic.",

By international school, I mean an international school in one of the countries you mentioned, and I am a passport holder of another country you mentioned (both \"Asian countries\"). I agree that most people going to T10's have pretty good stats and achievements. But maybe our definitions of \"pretty good\" are quite different, since to me pretty good doesn't really apply to national awards, etc. I'd consider those stellar. But yeah, every T10 admit does have impressive stats, and perhaps I downplayed some of mine in my original comment.\n\nBut I still don't think your post is a 100% accurate. If you are an international Asian male going into STEM, hoping for T10's/T20's, you're gonna have to work very, very hard. But do you need multiple national awards, and 10 revisions for every college essay? I sincerely doubt.",

The sad fact is that these schools are hopelessly overburdened and receive tens of thousands more applications than they can possibly admit. \n\nThat said I have lived in California and paid a very high tax rate for decades. I have literally paid hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxes into the system which is subsiding the cost for all who attend these schools. \n\nThese points combined leads me to the opinion that at least here in California, we should only accept a small percentage of students from other US states into our California colleges, and sadly zero international students. There is simply too much demand and the very families who are the primarily funding for these universities are not able to attend. \n\nI am literally paying for some or perhaps a large portion of the education of students who do not live in our state and, yes, those of you who are not even a citizen of our country.\n\nComing to school here in the USA should be seen as a privilege and not a right. Please realize that those of us who are working and paying taxes here should indeed be given the first shot at having our kids receive a college education with the money we are paying into the system. \n\nAs is, unless your California high school senior is performing at some astronomical and truly exceptional level as OP has opened up with, we residents of the state we are paying for have no hope for our kids to attend these schools either. \n\nI\u2019m not a racist but a realist. There is simply too much demand here to even serve our California state residents, let alone adding thousands more from other countries.\n\nAll this said, I really do wish you all well on your college journey and commend you for the amazing effort you have dedicated to preparing yourselves for the future. You WILL be successful and your value is so much more than the rejection letters you have received.\n\nNever give up, never loose hope, and never stop learning and reaching higher. \n\nSigned,\n\nA discouraged but not defeated Dad in California.",

This is directly, me. \n\nBut money aside, the sheer volume of people that want to come to the UC schools excludes a great many of native California students who would enjoy and deserve to attend then. I think that state schools should give the highest priority to their own tax paying populace first, out of state transfers second, and in an imbalance of supply and demand, exclude international students.",

Thus, it's sorta a trade off - are you and hundreds of thousands of other Californians willing to pay even more additional money to send your children to school so other Californians can enter as well? \nFor most universities, the answer is to keep on having international students to subsidize citizens. UC schools are very similar to UBC (British Columbia) in this regard. As a Canadian citizen, I personally would not be willing to pay higher fees just so the university would be near entirely domestic. Additionally, the quality of the campus/students may (this is a contentious point but just calling it as it is based on average SAT scores, etc) go down which has an impact on profs, etc.",

One guy from Delhi told me that everyone gets up at 6am and sleeps at 12am and in that gap is either school or prep classes. They even do prep class hw while commuting to school. That is for sure more grind than I put into high school (even though I had ECs and a pretty intense course load). So your typical well-rounded \"good\" Californian public school student, would have a pretty likely chance or getting in and \"only\" has to pay $14,000 /yr for tuition. Your typical intl student usually went to some elite boarding school and has to somehow foot out $45,000+ a year with no aid. It's fucked, but California has hundreds of thousands really good students they need to matriculate before they would look at the intl stack. If not for UC, a lot of my friends from working-class/lower-middle backgrounds would not get the opportunity to get ahead.",

If you are in a similar position as me I would still apply (just in case) but don't EXPECT to get in and apply to schools that you like and aren't as competitive",

In a lot of countries if you don\u2019t go to the top universities you don\u2019t get even anywhere near the opportunities you would have. However this is not true in America. There are plenty of state schools,  lesser known privates and even a lot of community colleges that do just a good as job if not better than your ivies or HYPSM. However these applicants only apply to HYPSM and often get screwed by the inflated field they go up against and they lose out on opportunities. If you are the person OP is describing consider many different schools before applying to make sure you find the right one.",

Have I ever won anything for that? Nope. I just showed genuine enthusiasm for stuff I like to do. Despite the article you sent in the post, I STRONGLY BELIEVE Genuine enthusiasm trumps all in admissions. my dad used to work in admissions for a small private school so I kinda do have insight on how that works.

To prove it: this year, there's a girl in my country who got full-ride for UChicago (but very \"normal\" extracurricular) and a bronze IMO medalist got straight up rejected (not even deferral). A few year ago, another girl showed up in the news, who is also accepted to UChicago, relying mostly on her essays. Okay, you may say it's because they're girls, but in my country, the only person accepted to Rice with full-ride this year (CS) is a boy.

They brought out my passion in sciences, humanities, and a deep longing to go beyond to understand them at an even deeper level. They were unique not only in the ideas but also in general on the topics they were written. \n\nMy LOR's: undoubtedly very very strong. My teachers with experience of over 30 yrs explicitly wrote that they hadn't seen a student like me in their careers. And my school comes among the top 5 schools in India with crazy competition to even get in. ( not to boast but I mean what more can you ask?) \n\nI absolutely agree with you regarding the colleges' claims on testing each applicant equally without bias which is total BS. \n\nNevertheless, I have to live with what I have got however bad the situation is. I can only endeavor to put in more efforts in future and hope that I find what I am looking for in college. \n\nI hope that everyone regardless of whether they made it to their dream schools or not will succeed in college and find what they are looking for in terms of education, career opportunities, and a great community to be a part of.",

Sure, like you mentioned, they may have done a few extracurricular activities for the sake of studying abroad but they were dedicated towards what they did and wrote good essays. Nothing more. I know a guy from my city who was absolutely fantastic with academics but did only one extracurricular activity related to the performing arts- he got into an Ivy League early decision for STEM.\n\nI know another kid who got into UPenn. He wasn't an Olympiad winner. He didn't win a national award. He didn't have a perfect SAT score. He wasn't the CEO or Founder of a non-profit. He still got into UPenn for a hyper competitive engineering degree.\n\nYou don't need to be a Nobel Prize winning scientist with tons of science awards and accomplishments.

Put a nail in it if your ask for financial aid- how exactly did you afford all those achievements, travel, competitions, and tutors to help polish your essays if you have no money? Pay for your own education because colleges want as many full paying customers as possible so they can give it to the poor kids and not use their $40 billion endowments ...\u201d colleges are a business and need blind is a myth they need you to believe to keep receiving applications and fees. \n\nHeck, the first Obama daughter took a \u201c gap year before showing up at Harvard \u201c the second couldn\u2019t get in and is at Michigan. It is very tough to get into the top schools but when applications are over polished and kids are submitting essays that dozens of people have reviewed for hours they fly thru the air and go into the trash. \n\nWork hard, be genuine - it will get you farther than a lot of kids on this post . I suggest you need to do LESS and look more like a student than a professional college application manufacturer. \n\nWrite excellent essays because you are a kid with bright ideas that reflect your interest....and tell everyone how you want to change  th world. spending months hours writing 1000 essay sounds like a mental illness and a waste of time - take up a sport- hire a coach and get recruited - now that will give your application lots of looks because you are not like every other Asian kid stuck in a lab.

However, I must disagree with what OP said about essays for internationals. I personally think that essays are just as important for domestic, as for intl applications. It might seem like ECs are more important for intls, but rather, I think, ECs are much more harder to bring to a certain admissible standart for intls, and thus, the illusion more work needed=more importance might arise.",
