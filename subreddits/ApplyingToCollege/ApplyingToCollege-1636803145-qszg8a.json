It was SUPEERRRRR chill and if you're freaking out about yours I understand cuz that was me an hour ago, but just take a deep breath it doesn't count for much, just imagine the interviewer is one of your parent's friends and they're just asking you about your future plans and life experiences. All the best to everyone. \n\nIf you have any questions I'm happy to answer.",

I had nothing too crazy, no research or anything but I'd say my EC's were decent. \n\nIf you haven't found something that you're passionate about and love doing that's fine, you still have a year's time and you don't have to do anything extraordinary, just find something that's fun to do and stick with it. No single EC or test score can get you into a T20 so just do your best is all I can say. I'm kinda glad to be done with the process, although I don't have the most amazing application, I've made do with what I have and the rest is up to the admissions team. \n\nIf you have any other questions pm me!",

          "text": "hey!\n\nmost of the questions were based on my answer to the \"tell me about yourself\" question. He asked me about my family, the sports I like to play (cuz I mentioned sports), what I do in my free time, what I've learned from my grandparents, and a couple of other questions that were personal to me and my situation. Since he lives in my city we also spoke about my school and why I chose to go there, we also talked about India and some universities in India, and obviously spoke abt Stanford as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nofc there were some standard questions that he asked- what would you do with 10 million dollars, who is someone whose career path inspires or motivates you, tell me about a challenging or stressful time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit may seem like a lot of questions but they all just came up in conversation and I just pretended I was talking to a friend and just answered everything as honestly as possible. All in all, he knew nothing about me beforehand and so I spent most of the time talking about my personal experiences that made me the person I am because that's what he would write in my report and so I wanted to talk about things the admissions officers didn't already know about me from my application.  \n\nhope this helps!",
