  "text": "# How to write UC PIQs?:\n\nTopic should be clear and straightforward comparing to your other supplemental essay or personal statement.\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n1. **Check to see if there is any prompt that is identical to essays you\u2019ve written for other colleges.**Colleges often require extremely similar prompts from students, whether it is intellectual passion or contribution to communities. Skim through all 8 prompts, and see if you\u2019ve written a similar essay for Common App or other universities in the supplemental essay section. That way, you can limit the time and effort you put into each essay and instead focus on polishing a few outlines that you use for multiple applications.\u00a0**If you\u2019ve found an identical college essay, summarize it into a few points and rewrite it into a 350-word response.**\n2. **Are there keywords of each prompt that stand out to you?**Each prompt contains keywords, which we listed down below for you. Read through the keywords and the questions they entail, and see if any of them catch your eyes. Do any of them remind you of experiences you want to delve into?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step-by-step guide to make an outline for each PIQ\n\n\\*Note: This guideline is designed for students who need to build their outline as quickly as possible. If you are running out of time, try the exercise below.
