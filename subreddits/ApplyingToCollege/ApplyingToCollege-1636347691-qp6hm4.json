But is this need to be on academic background section? Because I just added schools I went to. Could you please reply if you know anything about this?",

              "text": "It's better if you get a copy of your transcripts earlier, as then you won't be in a rush to get them. For most universities you will need to unofficially upload the transcripts.\n\nI am not sure about the summer programs, as I could not find anything relatable on the JoinUofT portal. For other universities like Waterloo and York, they just ask for the High School Transcripts....It would be better if you email your universities regarding this....",
