      "text": "I personally feel like EA is better for a couple of reasons. The first one being that it gives you the freedom of getting it out of the way so you can concentrate on the rest of your senior year. And also gives you time to look at each schools aid offers and decide without feeling like time is running out. \nI also think that it's possible that EA gives you first crack at merit aid, but I have no idea if that's true..I just feel like if it's first come first serve, it's better to be early than not.\n\nNow if doing EA comes at the cost of not feeling fully prepared, then you have to do what's best for you.",
