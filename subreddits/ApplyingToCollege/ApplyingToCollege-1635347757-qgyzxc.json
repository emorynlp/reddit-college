  "title:": "What Are The Easiest Majors To Apply With? And Is Choosing A Different Major For Application Then Switching When Accepted A Good Idea?",
  "text": "You could have a 4.0 with a 1600 and still get rejected because your major is computer science. I don't want to study cs, I'd like to get a degree in business administration but that's super popular as well. I was wondering if I should apply with a different major then switch if I'm accepted. If it means anything, I live in California and will only be applying to UCs and CSUs for financial reasons.",

Especially CS, engineering, business, and nursing.  At many schools switching into these majors is specifically prohibited... for just this reason.",

      "text": "Agreed 100 percent what the others are saying. Apply for the major you want \u2014 especially if it\u2019s one of the impacted majors like cs, engineering, or business and you won\u2019t be happy in any other majors. Don\u2019t apply expecting to transfer majors. It\u2019s often more difficult than transferring colleges. \n\nBut if the college is more important than the major, spend some time looking at the unimpacted majors and come up with some that interest you and that you think you\u2019d like and can see a future in.  Just don\u2019t expect to be able to transfer into the impacted majors",
