  "text": "Currently a junior looking to boost her resume and possibly get rid of some student debt -- for background, I'm from California, I've done a few community service projects related to STEM, I have some leadership experience (nothing super impactful but like clubs at school), and I'm interested in going into biochem.  I also don't have any coding or engineering experience (there's a lot of women in tech stuff but uhh none of that is relevant here...) and I'm not a URM, except the woman in STEM thing (not even sure if this is really URM though because biology/biochem has a pretty good ratio in comparison to physics and engineering).\n\nOh also I've won a few small/local poetry contests and I write a bit (school newspaper, published in a few online lit journals)",

      "text": "Some general thoughts on paying for college:\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\r  \nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves***. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
