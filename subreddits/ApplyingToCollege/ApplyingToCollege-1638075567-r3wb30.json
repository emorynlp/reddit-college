  "text": "hi guys. i\u2019m going to be applying next year and there are unlimited fees the college board requires for various things. \ncan someone tell me if there\u2019s any sort of scholarship provided on the basis of ECs? and probably my grades? not just from the common app portal - but even otherwise. \ni\u2019ve not taken any standardised till YET, so please don\u2019t suggest the ones which require these scores.\nthank u!",
