  "text": "I took one honor junior year and two honors senior year in an award winning rigorous school. Totally completely regret that I wasn\u2019t confident enough in my abilities to stand up to parents and guidance counselor who didn\u2019t want me to take APs or more honors. My highest reach school is Purdue undecided for spring semester. I know they look less at GPA and more at course rigor. Is this a dealbreaker?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re screwed without APs at all. From someone with the exact opposite situation, I don\u2019t think APs really enhance my application that much. Those types of courses just go to show that you chose rigor in your coursework, but if your school is known to be rigorous than your rigor will show. I saw your comment about your 1520 SAT, so I think colleges will definitely see that you\u2019re smart regardless of the amount of APs you took. Definitely report that SAT score. And try to be confident. Not many schools offer a million APs so colleges aren\u2019t expecting that. Hope this helps:)",
