There's not much precedence to go off of, but I'd bet it would help with T20 admissions at least a bit so long as you look relatively well rounded and not like you spent every waking moment studying. Anyways, it's very uncommon for me to be truly super impressed with someone on a2c, but I am now. I bet AOs will also be impressed. \n\nJust out of curiosity, how _did_ you prepare? Lots of studying, really good teacher, lots of lab experience/internship? All of the above?",
