  "text": "I can't. Like I literally can't. I've been trying to write mine since late July and I still don't have a 1st draft done. Well, i had one, and then I reread it and it made no sense so I scrapped that one. \n\nI want to write about a challenge and ik what to write about but there are SO many things that contributed to it and I just don't know how to word it IN LESS THAN 650 WORDS. Whenever I starting writing I randomly get off track bc suddenly this idea sounds better or I try to weave in too many things and I end up with something that just doesn't make sense. \n\nOr I'll write something but it ends up being just a timeline of events and people I've met but nothing really about me \n\nI have to turn this in IN 2 WEEKS and on top of that I have to write another essay to send in with it.... \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I'm lost and at this point I don't even really to go to college anymore",
