      "text": "ETA this was supposed to be a response to the transfer statistics comment, but there is still info pertinent to OP.\n\nTransfers are a completely different case for the UCs. Transfers are expected to have fulfilled the foundational classes and GEs that one would normally complete in the first couple of years of college. They have to meet the requirements of the major at entry, something that\u2019s not typically required of entering freshmen who often come is as undeclared or pre-majors. Impacted majors are a huge exception, obviously. \n\nHere\u2019s text from UCLA for freshman admits:\n\n\u201cYou can declare a major, or apply as undeclared, on your UC application form. For freshmen applying to a major in the College, **your choice of major will neither help nor hurt your prospects for admission. In fact, a large number of freshman applicants apply as undeclared**. The UC application allows you to choose an alternate major, but we only guarantee the review of first-choice majors.\n\nFor students who chose a major outside the College in one of our professional schools, check with the school to see if a supplemental application or any other action is required. The professional schools are:\n\nSchool of the Arts and Architecture\nSamueli School of Engineering (no supplemental application required)\nHerb Alpert School of Music\nSchool of Nursing\nLuskin School of Public Affairs (no supplemental application required)\nSchool of Theater, Film and Television\u201d\n\nBold my emphasis",

      "text": "yes, absolutely. I can't find the data but it can be a *huge* swing. there's no data I guess because your application isn't a major declaration, but you can see the [transfer statistics](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major). these will differ from the freshman statistics because transfers are required to declare, but it's almost certainly the case that it affects admittance.",
