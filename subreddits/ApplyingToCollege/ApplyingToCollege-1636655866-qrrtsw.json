      "text": "     Toured Wake recently. One of the nicer campuses. Lots of amenities,food,rec center. One of the aspects that was worth noting is they stress small class sizes as do many schools but gen Ed required courses can be 150+. The other aspect is a new facility downtown that I believe is medical focused however science and some non STEM courses are taught. This does require a transit ride which at require logistics with schedule and some downtime on a bus. If your interested in similar vibe but all together in NC I\u2019d consider Davidson. Actually is within walking distance( right within town actually) and has a lot of restaurants and coffee shops with same rank if you will of Wake but more New England LAC feel",
