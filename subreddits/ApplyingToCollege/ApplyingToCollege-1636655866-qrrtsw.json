      "text": "     Toured Wake recently. One of the nicer campuses. Lots of amenities,food,rec center. One of the aspects that was worth noting is they stress small class sizes as do many schools but gen Ed required courses can be 150+. The other aspect is a new facility downtown that I believe is medical focused however science and some non STEM courses are taught. This does require a transit ride which at require logistics with schedule and some downtime on a bus. If your interested in similar vibe but all together in NC I\u2019d consider Davidson. Actually is within walking distance( right within town actually) and has a lot of restaurants and coffee shops with same rank if you will of Wake but more New England LAC feel",

      "text": "There is one main campus. If you are not a STEM student, all your classes will be there. There is also Wake Downtown, where a lot of labs are located (however, a lot of lectures & labs also still take place on the main campus; the chem, bio, and physics departments all have their own buildings on the main campus). There is a shuttle that runs frequently (I think every 15 min?) from main campus to downtown, and it is a short ride.\n\nThe downtown facility is really nice--it was completed in 2017 and has a really open modern vibe that is different from the main campus. It's located across the street from a park and walkable to other things downtown, like coffee shops and restaurants. All that said, you will mostly be on the main campus (Reynolda Campus)--all dorms, dining halls, the student center, rec center, etc. are there, so other than the possible lab or class at Wake Downtown, you'll have everything very close together on main campus.  \n\nNot 100% sure what the 3rd campus you're referring to is--the Charlotte Business School Campus? That is only for grad students, so as an undergrad, you won't be going there. Wake also has properties in DC, Vienna, London, and Venice that students can study at.",
