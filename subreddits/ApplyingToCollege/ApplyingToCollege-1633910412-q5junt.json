That's a **very** reach-heavy list; only things there that could reasonably be safeties are Pitt and UMD, and only things there that could reasonably be targets are Northeastern and maybe Michigan if in-state. Get some more targets and maybe one more safety.\n2. Just BTW \u2014 you're aware that a decent number of those are state universities which provide little/no aid to OOS students, right?",

It becomes a numbers game at that point and your odds of getting one or more acceptances grows with the shotgun approach. Pick a couple of safeties that you would actually attend if needed and shoot for the moon.",
