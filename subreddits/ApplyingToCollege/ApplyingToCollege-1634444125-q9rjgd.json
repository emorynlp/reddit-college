  "text": "So I just recently sent my SAT score report to colleges I'm applying to today. I have an early admission deadline on November 1st and I'm afraid they may not process in time. Same goes for sending transcript (I know I'm a lazy procrastinator) So do these documents need to actually be processed before the deadline, or just sent?",

      "text": "Two weeks is enough time for SAT score reports to be sent from College Board to the college. But, also check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster.\n\nTranscript time will depend on your high school. Order asap to be kind to your high school counselor.",
