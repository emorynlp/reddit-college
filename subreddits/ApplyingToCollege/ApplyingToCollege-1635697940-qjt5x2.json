      "text": "The pickings are slim.  The most well-regarded schools for Computer Science are well-regarded overall and, consequently, don't have to throw money at NMFs.  As others have said, best options are probably Southern Cal (half tuition), Texas A&M (tuition) and Northeastern (variable).\n\nI find Texas A&M distasteful for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of its CS program, but your mileage may vary.  Some people love Northeastern, but it strikes me as pretty meh; people like it because of where it's ranked, and it's only ranked where it is because it gamed the eff out of the rankings.  Same is also true to some extent for USC, but at least it has the benefit of broad national name recognition (and is located in CA and sends lots of CS grads to Bay Area employers.)\n\nUniversity of Minnesota also an idea.  Gives $10k to NMFs.\n\nOhio State also an idea.  IIRC they don't have many scholarships \\*specifically\\* for NMFs, but they do have a number of scholarships in general for OOS.",
