  "title:": "Question to Reddit Community: When do you send in your college transcript and how?",
  "text": "Hey A2C,\n\nI don't think I have gotten any clarification about this but was wondering. If you have taken college classes at other community colleges around your area and have received grades from them (e.g Principles of Macroeconomics - A), when do you send their transcripts in assuming that you listed them down in your additional information section on the Common App?\n\nLet's say you applied early to Stanford, Harvard, or Yale and never sent them these transcripts -- would they think that you were missing documents. On my portal, it says that my college has everything, but I never sent these, and I am confident neither did my counselor.\n\nIf I am supposed to send transcripts, would I have to order official transcripts to be sent from like [parchment.com](https://parchment.com) to each university, or can I just compile unofficial transcripts and then send it to the college's admission office email.\n\nThanks, guys!",

      "text": "Hi! I'm not sure how it is at every school, but I took a college class during my junior year and reported it on my common app. Only one of my application portals asked for the transcript, so I went onto the website of the college where I took the class and filled out a request form for a transcript to be sent to the college that needs it (Reed). I emailed the Reed admissions people because I applied early action but knew that the transcript wouldn't get to them by the deadline, and they said it wasn't an issue. So I'd say that if the portal doesn't say you need to send it, you don't need to send it - but if you're worried about it, email the colleges you're applying to check.",
