I\u2019ve never had to do an interview in the college application process but I do plan on applying to medical school in a couple of years and there is an interview component for that. The med school application fees are already crazy expensive and travel costs to go to your interviews just add on to that, not to mention the applicant is usually still in college and would have to miss classes, which is not ideal. Keeping college/grad/professional school interviews over zoom would be a lot better for everyone.",

I'm definitely going to have a beverage handy. Interviews are awkward and stressful on both sides.\n\nJust be nice to people, be ready to talk about why you're there, and don't lie. Never lie. Almost everyone I reject for behavior fucks up one of those, usually the first or last one.\n\nGetting a drink is a good idea. Get something that helps you stay calm, usually tea or water is a good pick. If it's a long interview maybe ask if they have juice: it's good for your throat and the sugar will help keep you from getting tired. I stay away from soda because it makes me burp and that's distracting.\n\nAnd seriously, never lie or be dismissive of people. As a product design lead who's also a reasonably experienced developer, I often get introduced as \"one of our designers\" to see how engineers or ML scientists treat \"non-technical\" people. I can't count anymore how many have tried to fake jargon their way through the interview to avoid answering questions, or had a \"why am I talking to this guy\" attitude. \n\nBe polite and interested in everyone you meet while you're there, and it'll put you above like half of applicants out the gate.",
