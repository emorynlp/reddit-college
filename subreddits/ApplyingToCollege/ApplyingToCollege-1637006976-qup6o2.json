  "title:": "Seeking EC Advice (CS/Math/General)",
  "text": "I'm a junior in High School and I have recently started exploring this and a few other college related subreddits. I have a really good grades and test scores, but I've noticed that a lot of people here have ridiculously impressive ECs. Mine however, are quite lacking in comparison, consisting of pretty much just volunteer hours, school clubs, and sports. I'm seeking advice on how to go about improving this. \n\nI have solid experience and knowledge about computers and programming, I've been doing it for years now. I've developed a variety of code projects, but I'm not sure how I could turn this into something I could mention. I've been thinking about looking for a local tech company to see about an internship, but haven't completely figured out how to go about that yet. \n\nI also excel in and thoroughly enjoy doing mathematics. I know there are competitions and such but am not sure how, if I even could, get involved in those.\n\nAny recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
