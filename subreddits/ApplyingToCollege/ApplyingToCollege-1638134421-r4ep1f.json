  "title:": "MIT EA Financial Aid Deadline Ouestion",
  "text": "On MIT's Financial Aid website they list the deadline as November 30th for EA applicants. Does this mean if I file both FAFSA and CSS (send IDOC stuff too) by this date, I have met the deadline? Or do they need to receive all aforementioned documents by the deadline? \n\n[Deadline Link](https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/apply-for-aid/deadlines/)",
