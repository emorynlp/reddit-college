  "text": "So I have progressively increased my GPA over high school from 3.5 freshman year to 3.7 sophomore year to 3.9 junior year unweighted. Now I\u2019m a senior and my grades are unfortunate as I have a B in 4 classes (3 APs and English) and an A in only 2 classes that aren\u2019t as weighted. I\u2019m applying to UMich in-state early. Are these grades going to negatively impact my decision by a lot?",
