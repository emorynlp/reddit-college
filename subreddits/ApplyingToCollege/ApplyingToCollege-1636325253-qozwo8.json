Especially on a 100 pt scale where there\u2019s more room for variation, some high schools may have grade deflation where 94 is a top 10% gpa, whereas some high schools may have grade inflation where 99+ is a top 10% gpa. Generally, aim to be in the top 10% of your class unless you attend a feeder school. \n\nMy high school (not Canadian) graded on a 100 pt scale and I would say for T20s, people at my school generally needed a 97+ overall gpa.",
