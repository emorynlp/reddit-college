      "text": "In short, you don't need to decide right now. You can major in anything and be admitted to a top law school or to med schooll; the main difference for med school will be completing premed course requirements. Admission to top 14 law schools is almost entirely college GPA plus LSAT.  You can decide later if you want to attend law school, even after college graduation. You need to have high grades for either med school or law school. Go to college and get the best grades you can.",

      "text": "Make sure to at least pick a school where they care about the humanities. That way, when you finally make the decision, or you have enough freedom from you parents, you can do what you want. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake I did, which is to love humanities, but never take it seriously because everyone discourages it or says you're going to be poor, and then pick a school like CMU where it's infested by STEMlords (I did Econ though). I hated it and transferred out after freshman year, and now I'm doing political science (I like the theory stuff more than the social science part) and English lit.",

You start with a clean slate before law school. (Family member went to Northwestern Law, finance major. BFF was a philosophy major. Other BFFs who went to Med School majored in Spanish, Theology, Government, etc) So your life for the next 10 months isn't a firestorm...go along to get along. I'm never in favor of lying... it's too complicated to keep lies straight. Just be very non-committal. The two preconceptions can just take a holiday.",
