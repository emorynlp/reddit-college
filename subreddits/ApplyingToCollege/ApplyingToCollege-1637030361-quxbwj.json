  "text": "today I had a college interview (ONLINE which is x100 more scary). as the interview progressed, i got hotter and hotter; by the end, i was a TOMATO. \n\nalso, it felt pretty short (\\~40 min) and everyone is telling me that they had like hour-long to two-hour-long convos with their interviewer. i just feel like i answered the questions without necessarily making it a super interesting convo. \n\nat one point, i answered something and she was like \"but how??\" and i explained it better but the fact that she even had to ask makes me VERY nervous. anyway, thanks for reading this rant because my family and friends are tired of hearing it. comment if you think i totally botched it...\n\nalso, does anyone know how important the interview is??",

This haunted me every now and then but my counselor always says it's not a huge part of the interview and usually would only help you (unless you fricked really bad and kissed your interviewer like the Yale dude) so now I am kinda over this.",
