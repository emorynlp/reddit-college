  "text": "My comment got a lot of love so I thought I\u2019d share my plan for any rejection letter. \n\nI want to frame all my rejection letters so when I\u2019m wildly successful I can laugh at all the schools that decided they didn\u2019t want my fat alumni checks. \n\nBecause schools only spend a few mins on our app, it\u2019s so easy to overlook someone good and take someone bad. I want a constant reminder that I was not in fact the fuck up, but rather they are for rejecting someone who can get the same success they offer somewhere else.",
