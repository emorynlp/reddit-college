I had a lot of issues during college struggling with my identity between something I don\u2019t mind that\u2019s useful and something commonly ridiculed as useless that actually taught me what passion felt like. \n\nUltimately the best solution is to find a way to make both a part of your life, and even career! I think if you find out that you\u2019re good at economics then you should major in that, and while I\u2019m not part of any of those three fields, I definitely think it would be possible to, say, look at economic trends through the lens of sociology/anthropology or vice versa, just like it\u2019s possible for me to be philosophical in my work as a therapist.",

Find a happy midway through. Don't compromise but reassess and reevaluate. Read up some books.
