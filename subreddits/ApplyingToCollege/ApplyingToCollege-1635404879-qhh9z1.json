  "title:": "Value of Amherst College CS degree",
  "text": "Okay please hear me out. I am an international student applying to Amherst College for CS major. I chose a liberal arts college for a science major because my interests are varied. I want the flexibility of the open curriculum.\n\nBut after hearing my decision, my family is emphasizing how much of a mistake it is to take a BA degree instead of a BSc. They say my salary will be tremendously low and I might not even get a placement after graduating from Amherst in CS. So, is it true?\n\nLanding a great job and package is not my final goal, but it is a crucial intermediate stage for realizing my dreams. So, I need a job with a good initial package.\n\nSo, what should I do? I really want to attend Amherst College, but I also don't want my lack of judgment on this to scrutinize my future.\n\nThank you for your help!!",

Where as a BS is more focused on CS. \n\nBoth will still give you the skills necessary.\n\nGo to the college page and looking at the program class requirements for both degrees and see which one suits you more.",
