  "text": "I briefly talked about band (how the community changed me) in my personal statement but it was only about 1 - 1.5 paragraphs long, and there's a lot more I want to talk about bc it's such a big thing to me. So I want to write the rest of it in my ec/community essays, but I keep seeing people advise NOT to write about something you already wrote in your personal statement bc it makes you sound one-dimensional :/",
