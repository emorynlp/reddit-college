  "text": "This might be a stupid question, but I figured I\u2019d ask anyways. One of my parents has a physical condition. Their doctor said that they shouldn\u2019t lift anything heavy or over time it could make their condition much more serious. Because of this, I pretty much always accompany them grocery shopping, since they can\u2019t lift the heavy grocery bags and stuff. I spend probably upwards of 3-4 hours a week accompanying them grocery shopping, and also lifting various things for them at home. Could I put this down as an EC?",
