  "title:": "Is going to therapy a good EC for T20s?",
  "text": "Hey everyone. Going to therapy has been one of my longest EC\u2019s (started in middle school). I also attend almost every meeting so it displays my loyalty and consistency. I also volunteer to pay a portion of my therapist\u2019s paycheck every month, so it would also be considered community service, charity, and volunteering. Would this look good on my common app if I want to go to a T20? Thanks in advance. i am also planning on bringing it up in my essay where i will be separating each of my traumatic experiences into 7 paragraphs",
