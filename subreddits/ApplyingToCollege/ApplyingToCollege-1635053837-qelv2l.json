  "text": "So there\u2019s two sections and I\u2019m a bit confused about the difference between the two!\n\nThe first one states \u201cPlease use this space to describe how COVID-19/natural disasters has affected you\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the second section: \u201cProvide any additional information you wish to share\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t these both the same thing? The entire additional info section asks the applicant to explain family circumstances, etc so I\u2019m confused as to why there\u2019s two sections seemingly asking the same question?",

If you have more ECs you couldn't fit in the ten slots, you could talk about that. If you've dealt with financial or mental health problems which affected your grades / ECs, you could include that. You could also talk about anything you would want the AO to know about you which isn't reflected in your application",

You could also talk about the mental pressure etc",
