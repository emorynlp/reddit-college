  "title:": "Should I answer the \u201care you LGBTQ\u201d question honestly?",
  "text": "Some of the schools I am applying to, like NYU, ask on their application \u201cdo you identify as LGBTQ+?\u201d I am gay but I\u2019m a little worried about answering that question. I know they aren\u2019t legally allowed to discriminate against me for that, but I feel awkward having to answer that question at all. What business is it of theirs? What are they doing with that information? If it won\u2019t affect my admissions chances, why do even they ask? I guess part of my paranoia comes from me living in a conservative area. I know NYC is a lot more tolerant than where I grew up, but I\u2019m still worried. In the meantime I\u2019ve checked the \u201cprefer not to answer\u201d box, but I realized that\u2019s probably as good as outing myself anyway\u2026 am I worrying over nothing here? Should I just answer honestly and move on?",

Gender identity is important, so I understand that, but why ask about students' sexual orientation? I mean, if you think about it, Duke's sexual orientation essay is really just asking seventeen-year-olds to write about who they like to fuck. I don't mean to diminish anyone's experiences or cause harm (I identify as LGBT myself), but I don't really see why colleges need to know that I think girls are hawt and guys aren't.",
