  "text": "i know this is a stupid question. or it\u2019s not even a question, more just a vent. but ahhhh, my OCD is strong right now and i guess i just need reassurance\n\nlong story short, i got into basically all of my dream schools last spring (harvard yale princeton pomona and columbia). i chose princeton based off of my partner, who\u2019s now my ex, as they also chose a school in NJ. i feel so dumb for letting something as fickle as love decide my school for me.\n\nanyways, i\u2019m a freshman now and i can\u2019t help but feel that i should\u2019ve chosen harvard. my whole family also tells me i made a big mistake. my family members are all immigrants and they only really knew about harvard before they came to the US, so i don\u2019t know.\n\nthis post is dumb as hell, i realize, and it must be annoying to see me even complain about this. \n\ni guess my question is, is choosing princeton over harvard that crazy/unbelievable of a decision in your eyes? a ton of people don\u2019t believe that i even got into harvard because they can\u2019t fathom someone choosing princeton instead. i probably wouldn\u2019t get in if i reapplied but should i try and transfer to harvard?anyways. i\u2019m gonna go to sleep now",

      "text": "Yeah, it was stupid to choose your school based on proximity to your then-partner, but it\u2019s equally stupid to choose based on minute differences in perceived prestige. Instead, you should have visited both and considered the many differences between the two schools to decide which was the better fit. It\u2019s too late to do that now, but my point is that there are valid reasons to prefer Harvard, but yours are not.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on campus for half a semester now - surely you\u2019ve made some friends and joined some clubs and are starting to feel at home (and even if you haven\u2019t, you probably will by the end of the year). If you were to transfer, you\u2019d be starting from scratch and would have to get entirely new friends and social stuff going, and that\u2019s much harder as a sophomore. Not to mention the academic issues of switching.\n\nEven if it made sense for you to transfer, it\u2019d be almost impossible. Harvard accepts only about 12 transfers per year, and most are military or atypical background people - they have no good reason to take you.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find trustworthy statistics online, but somewhere around 23% of cross admits choose Princeton over Harvard, so although you\u2019re in the minority, you\u2019re certainly not alone (I have several friends who chose Pton over Harvard too). Yeah, in popular opinion Harvard has a slight edge, but in  USNWR it\u2019s the other way way around - these metrics aren\u2019t really rooted in anything of substance.\n\nIf your family members have only heard of one college, that says less about the quality of that one college and says more about how little they know about colleges in general. The vast majority of Americans have heard of Princeton and are similarly impressed by it, and no potential employer is going to not hire you because you didn\u2019t go to Harvard (unless they went to Harvard themselves). What your family thinks is irrelevant - you should be considering what employers/academics will think, and none of them will care.\n\nI\u2019m a Princeton junior, so obviously I\u2019m a little biased, but I know Harvard wouldn\u2019t have been as good a fit for me - that\u2019s why I chose to REA to Pton. If you want to discuss your personal situation or get any specific advice, feel free to chat. Don\u2019t waste time second-guessing yourself - you\u2019re at one of the best universities in the world; enjoy yourself and take advantage of what it has to offer.",

      "text": "It\u2019s dumb to choose a college based on where your s/o is going, but the good side is Princeton is just as good as harvard, if not better in some areas, so there was really no wrong choice. Your family most likely doesn\u2019t know anything about U.S. colleges if they only know harvard, so you shouldn\u2019t listen to them anyway",
