  "title:": "NYU Stern Full Price or Fordham Full Ride?",
  "text": "Hypothetical question - I most likely get a full ride to Fordham because I\u2019m a national hispanic merit scholar, but I also really want to go to NYU (both for business). So, hypothetically, if I were to get a full ride to Fordham and get accepted into NYU without aid, which one should I pick? I would be able to pay for all four years of college, but my parents still need to put another kid through college in two years and my brother is at Vanderbilt without aid right now.",

          "text": "It isn't a huge deal for admissions at the really selective schools - it just means you nailed the PSAT.\n\nThere are some specific schools that offer great merit aid for it though, so it can definitely help with affordability. You would have some decent safe options like Fordham or ASU offer you a full tuition scholarship, and there might be a few that offer a complete full ride.\n\nLook at schools that make big scholarship offers for national merit scholars - they often make similar offers for the college board national scholar programs too.",
