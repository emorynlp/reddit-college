  "text": "I might have messed up a little bit by accidentally implying to my recommenders that I just made a club in 12th grade when I really made it in 11th. Idk if they put it in the loc, but if they did I\u2019m afraid they might have said that i made it this year. Is this a big thing that will get me rejected from brown? Or will they move on and just assume I didn\u2019t have bad intentions and just made a mistake.",

Even if admissions noticed the inconsistency, they may guess that either the app or recommendation had a mistake. Regardless, there is nothing to be done about it now. Don't worry about it.",
