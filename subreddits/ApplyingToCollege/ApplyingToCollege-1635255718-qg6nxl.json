  "text": "I emailed asking for a fee waiver and he said yes but stated that they did not give full aid or whatever. How do I nicely tell him my parents have set a college fund for me and that if I were to get in I could pay for it. I asked for a fee waiver because my family is lower middle classs so I wanted to relieve the financial burden a bit.",
