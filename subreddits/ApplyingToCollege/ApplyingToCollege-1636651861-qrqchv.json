  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nDo you think it's fine if I have ECs that are not related to my major? I think my ECs are pretty outstanding (national champion, junior Olympic team member), but they are not directly related to my major because it's more of a sport/hobby. Also, my ED school doesn't admit based on major. \n\nThanks",

It's fine to have interests other than the thing you plan to study.",
