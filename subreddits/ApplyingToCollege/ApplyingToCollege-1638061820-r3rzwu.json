  "text": "(These are for the UC applications)\n\n5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. **How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?**\n\nI previously wrote an essay about how my dad's death made me value my life and the lives of others more highly, and I adapted it *(albeit very narrowly)* into the 350 word count, and I think it works as an essay, but I don't really know if it answers the question.\n\nI'm not sure whether I should use the essay here, because although I do think it's one of my best, it's still somewhat off-topic (not academic at all), and I don't think there are any other UC personal insight questions that it answers better either.\n\nIf it shouldn't go here, is there anywhere else that it could go?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.**\n\nI answered this question with how I was terrified of programming for the longest time without trying it, and also bees without ever being stung, then I got stung and it was fine so I said fuck it and tried programming and loved it and now want to major in it, and I also have no idea whether that works for this question at all.\n\nI thought it sort of worked when I was writing it because it's a psychological barrier that affected me but now I am panicking because that sounds like total bs. Could *this* one go anywhere else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually stressed as hell because I have no idea whether they'll even accept either one, and the deadline's literally the end of November so if I have to write entirely new essays I'm just boned.\n\nThank you for reading.
