      "text": "Villanova is a private school, so \u201cout of state\u201d should have no bearing on scholarship eligibility or amount. (Unless perhaps they have some specific PA scholarships.)\n\nThat said,, Villanova costs far, far more than Penn State. So, don\u2019t look at scholarship amounts, but rather net cost of attendance. You could get a $25k scholarship to Villanova\u2026 and it would still cost more than Penn State.",

      "text": "Keep in mind that Villanova is a reach for admission. Unless there's much more to the story, I doubt 3.85/1420 will get any *merit scholarships* at Villanova. Also, if I recall, merit at Villanova involves separately applying for them with additional essays, so look for that after you apply.\n\nVillanova does, however, offer *need-based* aid (being a private university; whereas Penn State will not offer need-based aid to an out of state student).  Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nPenn State is not known for being a good value out of state.",
