  "text": "I'm in the 10th grade, and want to attend university for either mathematics or computer science. I have no coding knowledge, and I am pretty good at math. I have no extracurriculars. I'm wondering what type of things schools look for for these majors. Like what kind of extracurriculars and things like that.",

      "text": "All the usual stuff helps. For math/CS specifically you want to take all the math you can, take the CS AP exam, try to score highly on the math section of the SAT/ACT specifically, then, if possible, do some activity that\u2019s CS/math related. Some ideas:\n* tutor others in math/CS\n* AMC/AIME\n* state competitions if your state has them\n* robotics team if your school has that\n* National competitions like Google code jam, etc\n* doing personal projects, eg a website, mobile app, etc\n\nNote that the above are really only necessary at the top cohort of schools. Beyond those, good grades, course rigor and high test scores are usually enough.",

      "text": "As advanced math as your school allows with a minimum of pre-Calc. Try and go for 5 decently strong ECs. 1 personal stress reliever so something like D&D club where you commit time and have fun. Two social clubs, something like Model UN, Student gov., or Habitat. And two focused clubs, these are clubs that help you write your \u201cwhy this major\u201d essays. So think STEM club, Science/math Olympiad, math team/club, or something else.",
