  "text": "My sat is 1340. The average for my dream college is 1270. But the score breakdown for my scores puts Reading and Writing at 750 (well above their average) and math at 590 (At the lower percentile of their average SAT scores. \n\nIf I declared I want to major in History, nothing math related in the slightest, would they maybe give more weight to the Reading and Writing score?",

      "text": "They might. I would definitely submit 1340 to a school where the average is 1270 even with the lower math.\n\nMost schools don't report average, but rather the middle 50 percentile range. Where are you getting the data, the class profile on the admission website (which might refer to admitted or enrolled student data), or enrolled student data that can be found in the Common Data Set or at [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/) ? Right now, class profile data may also be class of 2025, which was test optional most places and accordingly skewed high. CDS and the College Navigator site is currently class of 2024, which is what I'd use to determine whether to submit.",
