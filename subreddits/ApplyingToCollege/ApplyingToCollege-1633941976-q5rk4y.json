  "text": "No one here applies to US, so common app and recommendations is something no teacher here ever does. \nI have my recommendations but they\u2019re sent from a personal email (our school doesn\u2019t have a school system email so they have to use personal ones for common app). \nI\u2019m afraid colleges will think I forged my letters because it\u2019s a personal email. Do they try and confirm it? Send them emails? Call them? \n\nI would like to know that so I can give them a heads up regarding possible confirmation emails or calls.\nThanks!",
