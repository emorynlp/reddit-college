(It might be closer to 60% haha due to some preexisting conditions I've had but at this point I'm past the most dangerous parts so I'm going with 90%)\n\nAccording to the whole 2 websites I looked at, none of the class of '25 ivy league class acceptance rates were higher than 10%.\n\nOn average you live 30,000 days. Most of us are 16-18 which translates to 5500-6500ish days used so far. This is a lot of time but, somehow you're still young and haven't experienced much.  \n\nPeople say that you need 10,000 hours to become a master of something. If you spend 8 hours a day doing it none stop, it would take 3.424ish years, kinda like the time a highschool gives you before you need to apply to college. Congrats to all my seniors for being so very close to masters of high school. (Y'all a2cers definitely spend more than 8 hours a day on high school)\n\nFreshman, put your all of your effort into a few niche things. Be the best at them. The more things you try and do, the less time you have for each thing. It's much more impressive to be only the president of environmental club but have your 4 years of work lead to your town to divest from fossils fuel companies than it is to create a new club every year.",
