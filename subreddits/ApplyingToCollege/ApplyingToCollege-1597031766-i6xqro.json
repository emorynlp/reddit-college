  "text": "-If it looks good in comparison/with to your GPA, yes. \n\n-If it is in the middle 50% or above, yes. \n\n-If it looks poor in comparison/with to your GPA, no. \n\n-If it is the worst score the school have ever seen, no. \n\nBASICALLY: \n\n-If it boosts your application, yes. \n\n-if it weakens your application, no.\n\nPlease, people. It\u2019s not that hard to figure out.\n\nEdit: please don\u2019t ask me if you should submit based off your gpa and test score. That\u2019s exactly what this post is against. Look up \u201cschool + common data set\u201d and you\u2019ll be able to figure out where you stand\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not Tom Stagliano (I wish though)\n\nEdit 3: PLEASE do NOT ask me if you should submit your score",

I ended up spending almost the entire first semester of my junior year in the hospital, and if it weren\u2019t for my mom being a huge advocate for my grades, I would have gotten Fs in all of my classes, and would have likely bumped my GPA down .5 points or so. I ended up being unable to join my National Honor Society chapter and was no longer eligible for many school awards, which makes students stand out. Colleges don\u2019t ask for explanations of GPAs, so if I wanted them to overlook that semester, I would have to open up about a very personal experience.",

I honestly probably could have been able to take more difficult classes my junior year if shit hit the fan my sophomore year, as I desperately needed medication. I don\u2019t like to disclose my mental illness, even though it still affects me to this day, because 1) they might not want to accept me knowing I\u2019ll likely need accommodations and 2) I feel like I\u2019m using my experience as \u201coh, pity me, I\u2019m not going to be considered because of something I had no control over.\u201d People shouldn\u2019t have to explain stuff like that, it should just automatically be understood that a semester or two of bad grades in comparison to good grades was a rough time in a person\u2019s life, and should be overlooked. Even if it wasn\u2019t a rough time, they still were able to bring the grades back up. Sadly, if they don\u2019t self-disclose stuff like that, then GPA is all that matters. Discrimination against those who have mental illnesses is very real, as we can be considered a liability rather than a provider of a diverse perspective.",

Instead, it will just mean that all your other application factors will be weighted more such as GPA, course rigor, LOR, extracurriculars, etc. I am not submitting a test score this year as everything else on my application is strong - I am still going to be a strong applicant without an SAT and will still qualify for scholarships and ALL aid.

The context changes when a school is shut. \n\nContext is also whether you decided to claim credit for an \"AP\" class but then do not bother with the test.\n\nContext is also whether you appear to be trying to get around requirements, or not. Schools do not have strict \"rules\", rather they look at each application within the context, which they can figure out.\n\nThe point is that if you can take the SAT or ACT safely, take it and report it. Don't take advantage of the situation. If you really can't take it, no one will blame you.",
