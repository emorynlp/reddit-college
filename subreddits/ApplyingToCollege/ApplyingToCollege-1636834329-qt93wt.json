  "text": "Does a high school senior applying to a college have the same chances at being accepted as someone who graduated from high school and applied a year later, assuming everything else about them is the same? What about a 25 year old, or a 40 year old? How would the age you apply effect a college's choice of whether to accept you or not, especially when it comes to top schools like Harvard for example?",
