  "text": "it sucks the joy out of learning tbh. in regular and honors classes, theres always variety and the learning is so much more engaging, while in ap classes, teachers just structure it around passing a standardized test. theres no curiosity or any drive behind it. you're just there for the next unit test. and the nonstop never-ending routine, the same ass formatting of questions for every fucking class, the mcq and frqs and long essays, are fucking killing me. no matter how much i enjoy the subject, the ap layout never fails to suck the passion and life out of it. does anyone else feel the same?? im not even a slacker, doing decently well, just DESPISE the system.",

      "text": "I understand what you mean. I remember my bio class in 9th grade was the first time a teacher told me that I didn't have to know something because it wasn't going to be on the test, and I was just confused. It never struck me that the purpose of being in class was to pass a test rather than genuinely for learning. Granted I was a little naive then, but I do think there is something to be said about how project-based learning is almost universally better than test-based learning. I think this is why a lot of high achieving students work on research projects - it's something where you are driven by your own curiosity to work on new developments in an area of your interest. Sometimes it feels kinda like intellectual candy.",

      "text": "100% agree. I found that after taking quite a bit of AP courses at my school, somehow they\u2019re all the same. I\u2019m not even joking the skills I learned in AP Econ were applicable to AP Stats, AP Physics, AP Chem, and APUSH. You can pass the class and AP Exam by just doing past AP FRQs without fully understanding anything.\n\nBut the class I hated the most was APUSH not because it was hard but bc. it taught me skills that just simply don\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things. For example, for the SAQs there was this specific format for answering them but in reality when would you ever be asked to give a singular example of how women\u2019s rights change during WW1?",

      "text": "I love APs for that exact reason! You\u2019re so much less subject to the abilities and whims of the teacher, and it allows for better studying. In honors/non-AP classes, the value is almost entirely dependent on the teacher, their teaching style, and their test formatting. \n\nIn all my APs, even the ones where the teacher doesn\u2019t teach well, I feel like I\u2019ve derived more value and retained more content because of the pressure to succeed on the AP exam, while in other classes, it\u2019s easier to slack and just cram from single exam to single exam, unless the teacher or subject is really engaging.In an AP class, I still can learn and study more on my own more easily than in a comparable honors class. \n\nEven the social aspect of APs is better, the kids are usually more well behaved and want to learn, leading teachers to be more lenient and relaxed, allowing students to socialize both amongst themselves and bond with the teacher. A lot of times, my experience is also more negative in non-AP due to a lower calibre of students and a lesser desire to learn, the teachers are more focused on being disciplinarians rather than teachers (our school is very much segregated via meritocracy).",

      "text": "The rigid AP structures are actually less than 5 years old. They were put In place for a variety of reasons. Part of it was just that they really wanted some baseline education and hope of passing the test to be available to every student, even if they have a bad teacher or an unsupportive school. They also wanted less experienced teachers to be better supported so that maybe not so many kids had bad teachers.  It used to be very difficult to figure out what kids needed to know to pass the exams.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, if a teacher says \"I can teach this my way, which will feel more in depth and organic,  and a third of you will pass, or the AP way, which will be more structured, but 70% of you will pass\", well, kids will pick the latter every time.",

      "text": "I kinda get where your coming from but I actually like the structure and predictability of AP classes. It's nice to know exactly what your knowledge is building up for! Plus all the online resources make studying for AP tests so much easier than studying for your 10th grade history teachers test on the random unit they made up. I will say though the DBQ, LEQ, and SAQ structure do not lend themselves well to deep analysis because of how time constrained they are, and they can leave you kind of craving a more open ended paper.",
