  "text": "I would like a question about the math competition, I only got 126 points in the last AMC12A, and I tried to solve AIME's problem in the early hours of the morning, but I fell asleep in the middle of it, so I got a less than ideal score, not enough support me to join the USAMO team. So I was wondering if I could pick up the AMC12A again and get on the USAMO team, would that make me more competitive? And I am in my Senior year. \n\nA bit messy, thanks for reading",

Theres no USAMO team, its just another competition you can qualify for after doing well on AIME and AMC12. \n\nSecond, saying \"only 126\" is lowkey kinda crazy as getting 130+ puts you in a decent spot for USAMO qualification. \n\nIn terms of answering your question, unfortunately, qualifying for USAMO in your senior year will not help much as qualifiers are announced at a similar time to when regular college decisions are announced.",
