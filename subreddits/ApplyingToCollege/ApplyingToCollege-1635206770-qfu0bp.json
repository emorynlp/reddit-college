But also I think there could be something more here.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been practicing my flute tone lately, to get a more full and ringing sound versus just ~flavored air~. And at the bottom of one of my tone pages, it says this:\n\nFeels like your tone\u2019s getting worse? It\u2019s not! Your ear is just getting better. As you get more experienced with listening to music, your standards increase way before your skill does. \n\nI think this might be happening here! As you\u2019re writing more and more essays, your standards increase way before your essay skill does. The only thing left to do is write more and cry!",

      "text": "I started off strong. Great common app essay. Then went to still pretty solid quality; write about a piece of art that has moved me? Portrait of Ross in L.A and my interpretation of its meaning towards the societal view of Gay men. Easy. A culture? Write about Virginia and my pride in its shifting culture towards the future. Nice nice. \"Why [College]\" oh no. Uhhhhh it has good education program. \"Name a quirk\" uhhh I play my music in the middle of work if I need to think oh haha I just played some in the middle of writing this essay. \n\n\"Why UVM?\" I love New England, UVM's culture and location would give me the chance to grow into the person I want to be more than any other college (my last essay written), ehhhhh people on here telling me the why UVM one is shit but you know, I have good grades and a good personal essay so I'm solid.",
