  "text": "hey guys, so this is a more serious topic that i want to touch on. i\u2019m definitely at a point where stress culture and hs has affected me so much that i\u2019m a few steps away from being hospitalized. let me explain.\n\n\nfor context, i go to an extremely competitive public high school in texas. one of the top schools in the state. even though im grateful for being able to go to the school, i\u2019ve gone through so many things throughout my four years of highschool that i just want to curl up in a corner and cry. here\u2019s a list of what i\u2019ve gone through:\n\n- i got invested in my school\u2019s competitive nature for the worst. i\u2019ve taken 12 aps (not even ones that i like) and i\u2019ve regretted it everyday because my gpa is not it at all.\n\n- i became an introvert as i\u2019ve lost my self confidence\n\n- as a black girl, i don\u2019t like my natural hair anymore. i want it gone. i\u2019m slowly straying away from my culture.\n\n- i quit orchestra, which was the only thing that made me happy. why? wanted to take more aps (so stupid)\n\n- i get 3-4 hours of sleep a night, i\u2019m anemic, and i\u2019m weak most of the time\n\n- i\u2019ve unintentionally lost 30 pounds since last november. im basically unrecognizable.\n\n- my grades are slipping, slowly but surely\n\n- i\u2019m losing friends because i\u2019m not involving myself in school activities due to rigorous studying.\n\n- i eat one meal a day and a bunch of snacks. i\u2019ve lost my appetite pretty much.\n\n- i\u2019ve put all my hobbies on hold (fashion, modeling, sewing, writing) because of constant studying and stress.\n\n\ni need some type of advice. how do i turn this around?",

      "text": "hey i\u2019m also a black girl. i\u2019ll say if there\u2019s one thing i wish i did in high school was invest more time and energy into my health and hobbies. grinding academics serves no use if it\u2019s just to get into a college where you\u2019ll be grinding more academics. I am in the same boat health wise except now i\u2019m a second year at a really hard university and i feel like there\u2019s more on the line now, as this is what will determine my job prospects straight out of college. If i had relaxed, gone to a school where i could pursue my engineering passion and my artistic passions i\u2019d probably be having a way better time, and less stress. If possible i would suggest decreasing your workload. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m meeting with student services once a week too to talk about what\u2019s going on, so I suggest speaking to a counselor, and not the kind whose priority is getting as many kids into college. I mean either a guidance and mental health counselor if your school has one, or find one externally. Try to restructure your eating habits and sleep schedule. Even if it means studying less.",

Switch to a regular or honors course instead of AP for some of them, esp ones that don't relate to your prospective major.\n2. Introversion isn't a problem - lack of self confidence is. I've had friends with similar struggles, and the key is faking it until you make it. Pretending you believe you're the shit is halfway to getting there.\n3. Don't ruin your natural hair straightening it and don't cover it up. You will so regret it. Fuck the white kids at your school that make you feel inferior, black hair is gorgeous. If you haven't already, learn to take care of it, there's plenty resources on the internet.\n4. If you can rejoin orchestra, do it.\n5. Have you been prescribed iron for your anemia? See a doctor asap if not. What's your screen time looking like? If you're guilty of spending too much time on your phone, install an app blocker and let your parents set the password, so that you can't spend too much time on bs like tiktok or instagram. This should help create more free time for you to sleep in. SLEEPLESSNESS is a key cause of your performance slipping. Commit to at least 6 hours a night, until 7.5+ is possible.\n6. Set alarms on your phone so you remember to eat meals. Try to eat a healthy, balanced diet.\n7. Talk. to. your. teachers. it's invaluable. Cite health issues and over-commitment, tell them you'd really appreciate a little leniency. Maybe not all of them will help you out, but some will. They are people too.\n8. You don't need a dozen friends. The ones that are most important however, you should make an effort to keep. Sometimes a call or a text saying what's up? what's been going on? How are \\*you\\* doing? can be enough.\n9. As I said, force yourself to eat. And drink a lot of  water.\n10. If you drop a couple of APs, and cut out your screen time, you can start up your hobbies again. Extracurriculars are sometimes more valuable to colleges than taking \\*another\\* AP class\n11. Chin up girl, you will get through this. Sending virtual hugs.",

We all are put into uncomfortable situation constantly, wether we are at a new job, doing an interview, or just talking to a cashier at some point (and likely at multiple points) you aren\u2019t going to feel comfortable. This is why thinking that you are the top dog can be so beneficial. When you show that you are confident (even if that confidence is fake) people will start treating you like your confident and know why your doing this actually increasing your confidence",

My hair was literally falling out, I was taking tons of ap classes, I had gained a pretty substantial amount of weight, and I was dealing with some family stuff. I have dedicated the next year to healing. Learning how to enjoy life again and not worrying about everything all of the time. Please go to therapy. You can\u2019t achieve all of your dreams if you are so physically drained. Please PM me if you ever need anything, I\u2019d be happy to share some of my hair tips :)",

It's easy to fall into the trap of \"I must take every AP subject bc it seems like everyone else is doing it too,\" but it is genuinely in your own best interest, mentally and physically, to cut back on your academics, and you know this too. At this point, I would really only take APs that you would use the credit to get out of college classes or those that you're genuinely interested in. It's much better to take the Ws now rather than end up with C/D/Fs because you're in the hospital. You aren't going to be punished for doing less academics if you're truly happier and doing things you enjoy, trust me.

      "text": "Hello, I assume you're a senior because you said you've spent four years.  \n\n\n**1. i got invested in my school\u2019s competitive nature for the worst. i\u2019ve taken 12 aps (not even ones that i like) and i\u2019ve regretted it everyday because my gpa is not it at all.**\n\n1. That's ok because colleges look at course rigor. A person that took a 12APs with a 3.7   \nis more valuable than a person that took 2 with a 4.0, holding all else equal.  \n\n\n**2. i became an introvert as i\u2019ve lost my self confidence**  \n\n\n1. Focus on finding new school activities to get yourself involved in that don't need to   \nmuch commitment.   \n\n\n**3. as a black girl, i don\u2019t like my natural hair anymore. i want it gone. i\u2019m slowly straying away from my culture.**  \n\n\n1. This can definitely partly be due to your eating and sleeping habits, as it can affect   \nthe health of your hair. I'm a guy so I don't know much about this, but improving your   \nlifestyle would make your hair look fuller and more natural.  \n\n\n**4. \ri quit orchestra, which was the only thing that made me happy. why? wanted to take more aps (so stupid)**  \n\n\n1. I also quit orchestra, not because I wanted to take more APs, but because my t   \nteacher was a dickhead. It shouldn't affect you do much unless you were like Concert   \nMaster or played in some city/state orchestra.  \n\n\n**5. i get 3-4 hours of sleep a night, i\u2019m anemic, and i\u2019m weak most of the time**  \n\n\n1. You really need to sleep more. Try to get more work done while in school to give   \nyourself more me time at home.   \n\n\n**6. i\u2019ve unintentionally lost 30 pounds since last november. im basically unrecognizable.**  \n\n\n1. Try to eat more, such a dramatic decrease in weight is worrying, especially for a   \nfemale, because females weigh less and average and it gets more and more dangerous   \nthe closer you get to weights like 80/90 lbs.  \n\n\n**7. my grades are slipping, slowly but surely**  \n\n\n1. Trust me, they cannot be slipping so quickly if you believe they are slipping slowly.   \nYou're a senior. Just don't get any Cs and you shouldn't have college acceptance issues.  \n\n\n**8. i\u2019m losing friends because i\u2019m not involving myself in school activities due to rigorous studying.**  \n\n\n1. Look around for school activities that don't require so much extra work. There has to   \nbe a few that you would enjoy.  \n\n\n**9. i eat one meal a day and a bunch of snacks. i\u2019ve lost my appetite pretty much.**  \n\n\n1. Eating is also extremely important for health, I would argue more than sleeping. Aren't   \nyour parents worried about you eating less? Surely there's something they can do.  \n\r  \n**10. \ri\u2019ve put all my hobbies on hold (fashion, modeling, sewing, writing) because of constant studying and stress.**  \n\n\n1. Same. In college there will be tons of time for this. This is unrelated but I haven't   \nwatched anime since the summer of this year and honestly it's been due to my increased   \nworkload.",
