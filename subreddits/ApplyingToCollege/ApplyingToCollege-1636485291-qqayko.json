      "text": "If you have a chance to get a bachelors degree for free, you should probably take it.  If it gives you a masters too, then it's even more worthwhile.\n\nTo give you an example, one of my best friends went to a college that isn't on anyone's ranking list.  But because he was one of the best students there, he had some amazing opportunities and received epic recommendation letters.  He applied to 9 of the top 11 PhD programs in Mechanical Engineering and was admitted to all 9.  He is now a professor at an Ivy.  Your undergrad degree really doesn't matter that much.",

              "text": "If you want to go into academia then you pretty much need a Ph.D., which doesn't require getting a M.S. first.  The strength of the Ph.D. program you're admitted to (and your advisor, and the quality of your dissertation) are what you want to maximize.  It isn't necessary to go to a \"top\" undergrad program in order to get into a \"top\" Ph.D. program; you ideally want to be involved in research while an undergraduate and cultivate relationships with faculty to can write you meaningful recommendation letters.",
