But if you don't win, you'll almost certainly be admitted and likely still get a decent merit aid offer.  Every year I have students who turn down T20 offers to take one of these (or the \"consolation offer\" if they didn't win) - because it brings the total cost of college down dramatically and a lot of middle and upper-middle class families can't afford $80k per child per year.",

              "text": "Absolutely! I've had some online classes (due to not being able to drive freshman year and then ofc COVID), and now I'm taking in-person ones this semester, so I'll just put them in sequential order and mention which mode they were. I'll also give the instructors a letter grade if you just want to skim. (Sorry this is very long, the TLDR is that even my worst professors were just \"meh\" and I had few of those)\n\n**Sophomore Year:**\n\nFirst Semester - USLS 220(?) Intro to Latino/a Studies (always online) *B+*\n\nThe professors were very nice (this class was co-taught by three), and I thought the workload was very manageable. Because this was pre-COVID, there were some extra-credit opportunities to go to on-campus speakers and events, and you could meet the professors there. \n\nSecond Semester - ECON 101 Microeconomics (always online + COVID transition) *B*\n\nThis one was overseen by a grad student TA, but he did have office hours (pre-COVID) and he seemed like a fun guy. The tests were proctored, but once COVID hit, he made the tests unproctored and open-note, so they were very easy. He didn't give much instructor feedback (things were auto-graded).\n\n**Junior Year:**\n\nSecond Semester - ANTHRO 230 Globalization and the Human Condition (COVID online)\n\nTBH, I don't remember my professor's name, I never had a reason to reach out to him and he didn't coordinate any whole-class zoom sessions. The class was pretty easy, and the videos explained what we needed to know for the quizzes.\n\nSecond Semester - MATH 165 Calculus I (COVID online) *A+ lecturer, A+ to D for recitation*\n\nOkay, this one is definitely different from normal because of covid. We had recitations via zoom, and you could pick which instructor (almost all of them were grad students) you went to. Some were definitely not good (the first one I tried made repeated mistakes on problems), or at minimum not good at setting up an online platform, but there was one exceptional one who explained things clearly, and she sent her notes to everyone after class so you could add those to your notes for the quizzes or review them before the quiz. The lecture videos were done by either Steve Butler or Dr. Barloon, whoever you prefer. Steve Butler is OUTSTANDING. He live-recorded his lectures pre-pandemic, and he made new videos, so there were a variety of options. He's like the Bob Ross of calculus, and he explains things very well. \n\nSecond Semester - ME 220 Global Sustainability (COVID online) *Three professors; B-, A, A-*\n\nIt was co-taught by three professors, all of whom had different strengths. They all had a weekly zoom and some other pre-recorded video. Professor Hallam taught the first section about economics, which was the topic I was least interested in, but he still did a fine job (in my opinion, on rate my professor people seem to dislike him?). The next professor was Dr. Bryden, who I thought was a great guy. He provided \"study guides\" that were just the quiz questions, and he offered to meet students for socially distanced coffee (on his dime)! The third professor tried to spice up his zoom + other videos by putting the slides behind him like a weatherman, sometimes this was fun, and sometimes his curtain got messed up, so it was a bit of a tragedy of errors as he tried to fix it. His section was more about what we (as individuals and as a society) can do about various kinds of sustainability, and he added more personal applications because he had feedback from a previous semester that the student didn't feel like they knew how they personally could make an impact. So he listened to feedback and adapted based on the feedback. Even the \"worst\" of the professors (Professor Hallam) was still an okay professor, he didn't hurt my ability to do well, but he didn't make me more interested. \n\n**Senior Year:**\n\nFirst Semester - KIN 210(?) Concepts of Fitness and Wellness (online) *B*\n\nThe professor sends us weekly updates. I don't read them because they're not super relevant. I can't say much about the professor because I don't read his stuff and haven't reached out to him directly, but the grading/class is easy.\n\nFirst Semester - MATH 166 Calculus II (in-person) *C lecturer, B+ recitation, A+ Butler*\n\nI have two instructors I interface with within the classroom. My lecturer (Dr. Song) is okay, he gives off the vibes that he cares about us, but he doesn't manage his time very well, so sometimes he spends too long on easy problems or skims through harder ones. My recitation instructor is fine. He's not allowed to go over practice quiz problems because those are just the quiz problems with the numbers changed, so sometimes the problems he goes over are a very different level of difficulty than the quiz we take at the second half of recitation. I think he still does a good enough job explaining things, and one time he met me outside of class to give back my exam because I had to miss recitation. The calculus coordinator still sends out weekly canvas messages. Sometimes (like with the first exam grade distribution results), they feel a bit passive-aggressive. I still watch Steve Butler's videos sometimes when I can't make it to lecture, and he does offer help hours in the calculus help room (which is staffed half the day with calc II professors and recitation instructors, super helpful resource). There are also SI sessions, which I haven't gone to yet because they don't fit with my schedule, but I've heard good things from my classmates about them. Also, attendance of lectures isn't mandatory / recorded, so if you get a lecturer who isn't terrific, you can go to a different one or watch Butler (or Barloon probably) lectures online. \n\nFirst Semester - GLOBE 201 Intro to Global Resource Systems *A+*\n\nThis class is smaller than some of my high school classes, and it's very discussion-based. The main professor (Dr. Duerfeldt / Kevin) is a nice guy, and he really seems to care about us and tailor the class to our interests. There's a TA that grades our work, but she only interacts with us through online comments; I haven't met her. Very easy grading. The main feature of this class is that we get a bunch of guest speakers. We've had other professors within GLOBE, the associate dean of the college of agriculture, and a World Food Prize Laureate as guest speakers, and I think each person added a new and interesting angle to the class. Off the top of my head, of other professors that have come in, Dr. Masinde and Dr. Zimmerman both made me want to take their classes, and Dr. Swoboda was also pretty interesting.\n\nIn summary, I've had positive experiences in most of my classes, and the worst ones were either forgettable or just one of many options. I hope that helps you, and I'm happy to answer any other questions you have!",
