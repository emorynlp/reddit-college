  "text": "So you know how in coalition app there is college info tab and in progress college coursework tab connected.\n\nI selected the option that I am currently attending colleges in college info tab as I am dual-enrolled, but in progress college coursework tab keeps saying that I indicated that I am currently not attending colleges and thus it doesn't give me the button to add in progress coursework. \n\nI tried refreshing the page, go back and redo it, but it still does not update. \n\nDoes anyone know the solution for that? I just submitted the request to the coalition system, but I don't know if I can hear back soon, so I am posting the q here. If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.",
