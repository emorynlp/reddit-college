  "text": "Hey guys. This year, I chose to take an online class(ap microecon) and I plan to take macro, but the issue is I can\u2019t sign up for it until after this semester is over. So my transcript will show simply \u201conline\u201d class for next semester. Can I still put I want to take macro in my common app, or what",
