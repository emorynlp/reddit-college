  "text": "International student here\n\nMy guidance counselor has told me to report myself as rank 1 because I am the only student to take the most rigorous course load at school and get the highest grades in all my classes. If I'm not wrong, rank is usually determined by GPA, right? If we did have a GPA system, I would have been ranked 1 too. But the thing is we don't have GPAs (the metrics to determining the rank is something similar but definitely not GPA). Neither my rank nor my GPA appears on the transcript. Does this seem fishy? My counselor will obviously vouch for me if contacted.\n\nAlso, is my rank weighted or unweighted? I don't know the exact calculation, but the rank is based on my course load and my grades. I assume rank would be weighted then..?",
