      "text": "(For context, I am Black). I haven\u2019t applied to any HBCUs, so this doesn\u2019t apply to me, but I do know a few people in my life who would choose an HBCU over an Ivy. My cousin, for example, has expressed wanting to go to an HBCU over an Ivy, but it has less to do w/ \u201cquality of education,\u201d and more to do with ensuring a safe/healthy college experience. Both of us have attended predominantly white schools for most of our lives, and the effects of that haven\u2019t been completely beneficial to either of our identities/mental well-being. I think I\u2019ll be fine, but my cousin doesn\u2019t want to subject herself to another four years of feeling unworthy, undesirable, and disrespected in the name of \u201cgood education,\u201d when she can get a good enough education at a place where she\u2019ll have a better chance of having more people around her that understand her background/mindset. And of course, that\u2019s not to say that going to HBCUs don\u2019t have their own problems, and I\u2019m also not trying to say that Ivy League schools and other PWIs are completely devoid of Black people. But some of us are just tired and don\u2019t feel that being in another predominantly white environment would be conducive to our success. \n\nIt\u2019s personally not a decision that I would make simply because the schools I gravitated towards didn\u2019t end up being HBCUs, and I know that I\u2019ll adapt no matter where I end up. But, not everyone has the strength to deal w/ a lot of the problems of going to a PWI, and for them, the pros of going to an HBCU over a PWI outweighs the cons. I would dare to say that if there was an HBCU that I liked better than an Ivy, then I would probably want to go (not even just to have a built-in community of Black people, but also because there are various other reasons for liking a school). I completely understand people who would choose an Ivy over an HBCU (\u2018cause YEAH, it\u2019s an IVY. who would want to pass that opportunity up?). But I also think it\u2019s completely valid for someone not to choose an Ivy. \n\nThat\u2019s the end of my little spiel, but I hope that makes sense!",
