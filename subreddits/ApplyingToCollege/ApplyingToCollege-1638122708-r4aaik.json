  "text": "Before anybody attacks me for this post: I know there's a lot of amazing, capable students who have perfect stats on here... who probably *should* get into top colleges. That's not me. I'm just trying to use what I have.\n\nI've been told since immigrating to America that being Syrian is going to give me an advantage when applying to schools. Now that I'm in the process of applying, I can't figure out which schools actually care about this type of thing.\n\nMy approach so far seems too simple. 4-5 in-state schools, one of which is UVA for ED (I live in VA), and the 15 other schools are ivies or almost equally prestigious.\n\nFor reference, I have a perfect gpa (nothing under an A, 10 AP level classes, no C level unless required), but my SAT is about 90-95th percentile so I'm doing without it. Varsity sport, lots of volunteering, a ton of meaningful activities. Still, those are just the qualifiers for top schools.\n\nAny suggestions on finding schools who wants immigrants/unique kids?",

      "text": "I would check out schools pages on DEI, and see how genuine their commitment to dei is. It\u2019s become a hot topic in the last few years, and every school has instituted policies. However, you can tell when you compare them who really cares about diversity and equity, and who does it to check a box. I\u2019d recommend looking into those schools with a strong commitment, as they\u2019ll recognize the unique perspective you bring as a Syrian refugee.",
