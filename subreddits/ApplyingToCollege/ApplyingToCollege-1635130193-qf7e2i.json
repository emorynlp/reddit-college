  "text": "It's okay, but it just feels a bit wrong. I can't explain it.\n\nMy English teacher gave me 100 on it but gave limited feedback so I don't know if that was valuable. My dad is a writer, has received several awards for his screenplays, and gave me some good changes to make, but parents are technically a bit biased in my favor. My friends don't like it, but their opinion matters the least.\n\nAfter I read \"Hack the College Essay\" I recognize my essay actually does a lot of things right, but it also inspired me to write a better one. Plus at this point, I don't know if the thing is very good or not. \n\nAlthough I'm inspired and motivated to start a new essay (based on the same idea), I have a week full of schoolwork and my job to get through before November 1st. Should I just stick to what I have?",
