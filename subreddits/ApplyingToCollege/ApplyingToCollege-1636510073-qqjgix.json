  "title:": "How do you have a 98% average? How\u2019s that even possible? Is this just \u2018study more\u2019 situation",
  "text": "So I\u2019m in calculus with a 90%. But I see other students across the country with 98% or 99% semester averages while in the same class. How is that feasible? Even in general for all classes as well too. I study and  know the content for all of my classes\u2014 but I inevitably make some mistakes (not due to lack of studying though). So that\u2019s like -6 or -5 points. \n\nSo do the kinds of people who have quite literally near perfect class averages simply just make less mistakes? Or they know the content more, or what are they doing that I\u2019m probably not? I\u2019ve never seen such a thing in my life so I have no idea what the difference is",

We were in a class together and I discovered this and made her leave one homework assignment incomplete so she would get a B.  It took a shocking amount of convincing.  That was the only non-A she ever got and most of her grades were 98%+ her entire academic career.  I'm still amazed by her.\n\nTo this day the smartest thing I ever did >!is ask her to marry me.!<",

Study skills are important. Applying yourself and fighting for things through hard work is important.  There will always be people who are smarter than you. When you get into the working world, being smart is important, but effort is what it takes to get ahead. Developing a strong work ethic now will help you tremendously later in your life.",

So yeah, study one more year does help. I also haven't spend every single minute studying, and I have friends who does that and performed better than me.",

      "text": "It must be caused by the way your approaches the subject. If your final grade depends on several big exams only, it is almost impossible to have a 98% average when you don\u2019t know what will be on the tests and when you consider random errors like forgetting a minus sign in a multi-step integration by parts. Everyone makes such errors sometimes, even literal geniuses who have perfect understanding of the theory. So I don\u2019t believe anyone can survive all the math tests in a year while losing at most one point in each.",
