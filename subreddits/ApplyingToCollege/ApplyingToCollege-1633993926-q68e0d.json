  "text": "ultimately, i've given up lol. my essays are trash no matter how much i edit and everyone else editing it says they cant lower the word count. still dont know what order to put my ecs in. my guidance office is behind. my mom cancelled my sat testing dates so ill be applying test optional to all top 20s. ive never had a B in a science class or english class put now i do thanks to ap chem and ap lit. ap research was supposed to be easy but i have a c- bc i turn in assignments in late because im overwhelmed. no one on my boards listen to me and have terrible communication skills. i won no scholarships ive applied to since junior. at this point, my state school  with everyone I know and my mom close by is my best bet. so cheers to another 4 years of crippling social anxiety and being closeted :))\n\nHOWEVER, I am grateful for my education, i just wish i hadnt held such high hopes for myself when i was younger and hadnt suffered from former gifted kid burnout",
