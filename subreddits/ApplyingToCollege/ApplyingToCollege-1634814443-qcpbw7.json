  "text": "I'm looking for somewhere in Europe majorly, with not so expensive fee structures and somewhat manageable living fees. Computer or Arts related courses like Digital and Mass Media is my preferred type. Any help would be appreciated. I'm in a very depressed state since all my friends are about to even graduate Uni next year. Thanks",

(Google search should work just fine, try to reverse calculate the criterias and see what college you will be a match for, based on your grades and stuff). Germany usually has free / low-cost education facilities but at most universities, you might have to learn the basics of German language and clear a somewhat simple test. \nApplications for the summer semester start in December and are open upto January so you might want to look into that.",
