  "text": "\\*Not SAT Account, Collegeboard account\n\nI'm wondering how the colleges connect our SAT scores to our application? Is there a requirement to link both accounts? if so, how do I do it?\n\nAlso, how many days before deadline is it recommended to send scores to universities? I'm applying REA. As of today am I late to send em?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "Colleges connect official score reports to your application using your name, birthdate, address, high school, etc. You do nothing.\n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster.\n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. For these colleges, order immediately (but not rush, which tends not to help). Official score reports can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks. Most, but not all, colleges have no problem accepting official score reports that are a few days late.",
