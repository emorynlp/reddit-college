  "text": "For the courses and grades section I need to put all of my class from gr 9-12, with the grades I got and the credits. But isn't this something that is part of the transcripts? My college consoler said he would send the transcripts after I apply, so why do I need to do this section? It won't let me submit without filling this out because 2 of the places i'm applying to require it.",

      "text": "Given that two colleges require it, does it even matter?\n\nThe reason is just because some colleges prefer having your grades in the commonapp format versus looking at myriad different transcript formats, but equally, plenty of schools don't require it because they'll just look directly at your transcript",

That\u2019s really all that matters.\n\nIt\u2019s probably so they don\u2019t have to re-key it from your transcript.\n\nThe worst is schools that use the Common App, don\u2019t use the Grades section, then require you to complete a SRAR with the exact same information (looking at you Penn State and UIUC).",
