  "text": "I\u2019m not quite sure how to articulate this but how do colleges review updates youve sent? What if you send an important update after the committee has already made a decision on you? Do AOs go back into your file? Seems unlikely since they have so many apps to go through. \nIf they don\u2019t go back, when is it \u201ctoo late\u201d to send an update for ea schools that come out december?",

      "text": "If they've already made a decision on your application, they would look at the magnitude of your update and see if it is significant enough to reverse a denial decision... And they usually don't go through the whole application again - they make notes and may view the update in context of the notes... As for when to send in the update, the earlier the better, since there is no way to know which order your application will be read in.",

But it can happen.",
