  "title:": "Is Columbia now a T3? Is Stanford no longer a T5?",
  "text": "I've been researching yield rates, acceptance rates, and rankings trends. It seems that Stanford has been dropping in rankings, dropping its yield while peer schools increase their yield, and has an acceptance rate which is now trailing behind Columbia and Harvard DESPITE BEING THE ONLY SCHOOL OF ITS CALIBRE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND THUS HAVING NO COMPETITION.\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia has been climbing the rankings, and now ties with MIT and Harvard. Its acceptance rate is the lowest right behind Harvard. People on the East Coast, Wall Street, and politics see Columbia as more prestigious than Stanford. While Stanford is called \"Harvard of the West,\" Columbia is just called Columbia, signifying that it isn't inferior to Harvard. Columbia is known across the world, and while Stanford is too, Stanford lacks the ivy league brand and is most strongly recognized in Bay Area California (regional prestige).\n\nWhat do y'all think? IMO, \n\nT3: HMC (Harvard MIT Columbia)\n\nT5: HMCYP (Harvard MIT Columbia Yale Princeton)\n\n...then Stanford/UPenn/Duke and similar \"regional prestige\" schools",
