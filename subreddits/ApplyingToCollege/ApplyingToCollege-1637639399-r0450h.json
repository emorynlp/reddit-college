  "text": "Hi everyone, I was working on my UT Austin app, and recently noticed a lot of ppl seem to be applying there as well. I looked up how many apps UT usually gets and their website says over 50,000.\n\nThat seems pretty crazy to me considering they only have from like November 1st to March 1st to make decisions. I\u2019m just curious how they could possibly read through every application\u2019s transcript, personal statement, 4 supplemental essays, ECs, etc in such a short period of time.\n\nI was thinking mb they outsource essay reading but wouldn\u2019t all readers need to sign NDAs and be certified or whatever?\n\nSo anyways how tf do big universities that receive tens of thousands of applications read through them all \ud83e\udd14",

The book is partly about college admissions, but with a healthy dose of the author's philosophy on life (beyond just college). He also lays out his vision of what a \"fair\" admissions policy might look like.",
