  "title:": "Mentioning Why Major in UC PIQ",
  "text": "I'm editing one of my UC PIQs now and I'm realizing that in my response to one of the prompts (the leadership one), I explain the reasoning behind my passion for public health. For context, I was equally torn between majoring in public health or neuroscience. Because I learned that I'm slightly more passionate about public health compared to neuro, I ended up selecting public health for the UC's that offered it/a major similar to it, and neuro for UC's that do not offer public health. \n\nMy question is, wouldn't it be strange for the AOs at a UC at which I applied with a neuro major to read that I want to major in public health? I don't really have any other options though because some of them simply don't offer public health or anything similar to it. Would a bio major make more sense to apply with for these UC's, or should I keep it at neuro?\n\nThanks!",
