  "text": "I was thinking about reviewing an essay from him. It's not **a lot** of money so I think I can afford it. I looked up his website and found very few testimonials from students. I was expecting him to have a bunch of HYPS- admits as his previous clients considering how popular he is.\n\nI know his guides are **very** good but are his one-time essay review services worth it?",

      "text": "My student worked with CEG Matchlighters Scholarship Program which used CEG methods & personal inventory assessments. These helped get essays started as well as authentic delivery of personality. \n\nOur consultant was absolutely worth their insights & knowledge on essays and nuances of some colleges. Shared from professional & personal experiences. \n\nI would expect CEG essay review to be same experience. I would have found $ for review, if not for Matchlighters!",
