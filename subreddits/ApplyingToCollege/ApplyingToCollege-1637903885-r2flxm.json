  "text": "I saw another post regarding the same problem but the problem wasn't really answered. I've been in band since my sophomore year and they require us to take the same 2 classes for every year we are in band. Inputting these courses interfere with the CSU No repeating course policy because when I am reviewing my application before submission, it tells me i cannot have any repeating courses. Should i just input the grade when i took it my sophomore year?? Or what should I do?",
