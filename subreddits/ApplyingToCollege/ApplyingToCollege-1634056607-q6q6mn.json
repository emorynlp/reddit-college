      "text": "You're working off some faulty thinking here. Yes, you need hours, a high MCAT, ECs, and strong grades in pre-reqs classes to be competitive to med school. But an undergraduate school doesn't and can't guarantee any of that. They simply offer the pre-req classes; you have to do everything else outside of class time. So pick a school that has the pre-reqs (so, practically any), that's AFFORDABLE, and that has a pre-health advising center. The rest of your success is based on you, not the school.",
