Personally I have definitely been overworking myself, but I wanted to make the most of my time and opportunities, so I took a lot of classes, joined clubs, did multiple majors, etc. But there are definitely resources to help you when you can't handle things, like advisors and peer mentors and stuff. And professors are generally nice and willing to help (in my experience), as well as TAs, so if you're ever struggling, reach out to them. I think the most important thing is to just not close yourself off if you need help and not be afraid to find resources to get support if you're struggling. But if you got accepted to college, it was because they thought you'd do well there, so try to remember that, even when it doesn't feel true. :)",
