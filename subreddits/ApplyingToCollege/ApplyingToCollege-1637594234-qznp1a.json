  "text": "Hello! I am a student whose parents make enough money, but won\u2019t pay for my college. Therefore, I probably won\u2019t be eligible for financial aid. My dad brings home I\u2019d say 600,000- 1,000,000 a year range. But I haven\u2019t seen or talked to him in years. He has to pay for my high school(private school) for child support reasons. But I am kinda screwed for college. Is there any way I can receive more aid? I\u2019ve saved a lot of money working over the summer and would hate to see it all go to waste and be in debt.",

      "text": "You will want to create your college list with this issue as a primary factor.\n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow\n\nLook at schools that only require FAFSA, and do not require noncustodial parent info. This is more common with public universities, but you really need to check each college's financial aid website individually. Most of the generous top privates will require noncustodial info and accordingly will not be affordable for you. You might start by googling a list of colleges that require the CSS Profile (which often means they also require noncustodial info).\n\nIf you find schools that do not require noncustodial parent income and asset info, then you can use the Net Price Calculator on the college's financial aid website to see a need-based estimate. (Divorce is one type of financial complexity that can make some schools' calculators inaccurate if they don't ask, or you don't enter, the noncustodial info, but if the school doesn't require noncustodial info for aid, you should be able to use the NPC for an accurate estimate.)\n\nIf need-based aid not make college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.\n\nFor reference, if you take the federal student loan (5500), plus make a few thousand over the summer, your budget will be 8-10k. That's a little short of what you need to pay for living expenses (15k-ish) at big auto merit schools. Figure out what you can earn during the summer (be realistic!). You can also work during the school year - things will be tight. Look at your state flagship or regional state university to see what merit they might offer.",

      "text": "Some of this repeats what others have said, but:\n\n1. Definitely take the federal loan, which is worth $29k (total) over four years (I think).\n2. Consider applying to places where there is the potential for a large amount of non-need-based aid, as well as public schools in your state of residence (which come with a built-in discount).\n3. It won't be available freshman year, but during subsequent years you can often apply to be an RA in student housing.  Typically you get a (very small) stipend + free room/board.\n4. If you will be studying engineering, computer science, or possibly business, you may be able to get paid internships during the summer, or summer + one semester.  These often pay enough to finance a significant chunk of your next year's classes, even after paying for your room/board.",
