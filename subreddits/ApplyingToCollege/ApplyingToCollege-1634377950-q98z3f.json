      "text": "EA (Early Action) isn't binding or restrictive.  You can apply to as many EA schools as you want.\n\nSome schools have \"restrictive\" EA (REA).  This is also not binding, but it is restrictive.  Typically it limits the other schools you can apply to early and/or enter into binding agreements with.  You agree not to apply early to private schools and/or to apply to a binding plan at any school (public or private).\n\nAll this is spelled out at the schools' websites.  If their application plan is binding or restrictive, they will tell you.",
