  "text": "So I really like Stoner Brook's academics and location on Long Island (car friendly but has trains), but from what I've seen, their campus really sucks. It looks dead. Any recs for strong science schools within a couple hours of NYC, preferably with public transit? I have a 3.92UW, 34 ACT, and am coming from West Virginia, so generous aid to OOS would be nice, but not necessary. Thank y'all, have a great day!",
