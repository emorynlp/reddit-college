              "text": "If a college says they require it when you apply, it means they believe they cannot assess your application without proof of English proficiency. I do not know of any colleges that will give you a conditional acceptance based on you taking the exam later. If you can take the exam and receive the results before decisions are released, colleges may allow you to apply first then update them with the score. There are also some colleges that technically don\u2019t require proof of English proficiency.",
