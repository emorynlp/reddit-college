          "text": "From the Fed:\n\nIn general, a college endowment is a collection of assets that is held in perpetuity and generates interest income, dividends, or capital gains that the college uses as a funding source. While people often refer to \u201cthe\u201d endowment of a particular college, most endowments comprise a collection of numerous smaller endowments that have specific requirements attached. These smaller endowments may endow, for example, professorships, scholarships, or lecture series. There are also \u201cquasi-endowments\u201d or \u201cfunds functioning as endowments.\u201d Colleges treat these funds in the same way as traditional endowments even though there is not an explicit agreement with a donor to hold the funds in perpetuity.\n\nApart from donor restrictions, another factor limiting endowment spending is the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) in place in most states. These state laws establish guidelines on endowment spending by nonprofit organizations. The UPMIFA in many states presumes that it is imprudent for an institution to spend more than 7 percent of its endowment in a year.\n\nWhy do colleges have endowments? Why not encourage donations that can be spent over a finite time horizon? The answer is not obvious, and a number of explanations have been proposed. One set of explanations relates to the idea that endowments may provide intergenerational equity, or the assurance that future students will have a comparable level of resources as today\u2019s students. A second set of explanations is related to the idea that endowments provide a means of saving for times of need. But as Hansmann (1990) points out, both sets of explanations are potentially problematic. For example, if the economy grows over time or if there will be additional contributions to endowments in the future, then future generations may already be more advantaged than current ones as it is. Moreover, spending by colleges and universities today may pay off into the future, benefiting future generations. Furthermore, there is a question of why colleges do not simply borrow in times of need, perhaps using their land and buildings as collateral.\n\nA third set of explanations suggests that college endowments may have meaning apart from the actual use of the funds. For example, they may provide a simple yardstick for the public or members of a university\u2019s governing board for measuring the \u201csuccess\u201d of a university. Relatedly, a large endowment may be a signal of prestige. These explanations are bolstered by the results of Brown, Dimmock, Kang, and Weisbenner (2014), who find evidence that universities reduce payouts from their endowments relative to their stated policies following negative shocks to the value of the endowment (so as to preserve the size of the endowment) but generally follow their stated spending policies following positive shocks.\n\nA fourth explanation, which has not received as much attention in the research on endowments, is that endowments might help colleges with fundraising. Simply put, a potential donor may be more likely to donate to a college if he knows his legacy will live on.",

You're entirely discounting the value of time spent and the skills involved in converting the resources. The _only_ reason modern economics work is the assumption that people buy and sell goods and services at the mutually beneficial price -- I'm paying less than I value a set of resources to be, and the person selling it sells for more than they value the resource to be.\n\nIf, by your theory, all resources are valued in their final form, then there is absolutely no reason for Subway's supplier to sell their resources to subway -- because Subway is buying it for 50 cents, and according to your theory the resources would eternally be valued $30. Modern trade and commerce would break down in this case.\n\nI think it's more illuminating to talk about a longer supply chain. Let's say, bread making.  \n\nFor example, a farmer might spend the equivalent of $10 to procure every one unit of wheat he farmed. To the farmer making it, it's always worth $10 per unit, and he'd be willing to sell for anything higher than $10 despite the fact that it could potentially be sold for $20 per unit if it's already been milled into flour. This is because the farmer lack the time, physical capital, and expertise required to convert the wheat into flour. Thus his valuation, based on his realistic conditions, is that he'd be happy to sell his wheat for $10 per unit.\n\nThe miller who buys it from him for $10 dollars then processes it and turns it into flour. With the addition of his time, capital, and expertise, he values his flour at $20 per unit, and would be willing to sell for anything higher than that. The fact that a bakery can take his flour and turn it into bread that can sell for $50 per unit is irrelevant, because he lacks the time, capital, and expertise required to turn flour into bread. As such he willing sells his flour to a bakery at anything higher than $20 per unit, and the bakery in turns processes the food, adds value to it, and sells it for higher.\n\nI hope this series of example can shed some light to why your theory is completely antithetical to the way modern economics is founded.\n\nAlso, there is never an upperbound to the value of goods, because for the most part value is relative to the individual. Take a basketball produced for $5 dollars that normally sells for $20. Now you add Kobe Bryant's signature on it (something that takes zero time to produce btw), and it's suddently worth thousands to a normal person. Now if the buyer is his children, considering the circumstances then it's worth becomes virtually infinite...",

The goal of supply-side economics is to make goods easier to produce, which will make them cheaper, and to increase employment. The goal of supply-side economics is not to \"trickle-down\" wealth. I always find it funny when people incorrectly describe the goal of an economic policy as \"trickle-down economics\" and then say \"guys this isn't working\" like no shit sherlock that's not what the result the policy was made to achieve",
