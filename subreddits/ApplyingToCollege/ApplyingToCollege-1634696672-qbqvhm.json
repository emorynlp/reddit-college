  "text": "I went from a 3.29 > 3.77 > 4.14 and I\u2019m on track for a 4.28-4.4 senior year and they should see my first semester.\nAverage is a 3.73 W not counting senior year.\nTest scores are higher than my grades would predict (1460 sat)\nI also touched on how I learned from my poor performance freshman year in my essay.\nHow much will the upward trend help?",

      "text": "It doesn't completely make up for a low GPA, but it's much better than having a downward grade trend.\n\nObviously, the most ideal situation would be having a 4.0 all 4 years, but an upward grade trend shows growth, progress, and that you're able to handle material; maybe you just had an ugly start.",

Though I know that isn\u2019t necessarily a \u2018special circumstance\u2019, it was important to me and changed my life.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t get into my in range schools. Like despite having a 1570 SAT and decent ECs, I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll get into Tier 2 schools like UF or NYU lol.\n\nBut should I put that in my circumstance section?",

I'd ask that question, along with your background story (the first 4 sentences of that comment) on A2C as a separate question.\n\nAnd NYU/UF are super selective; even a 4.5 GPA, 1600 applicant doesn't have a safe shot at either school. (well, maybe UF would be a bit safer.)\n\nBest of luck. :)",
