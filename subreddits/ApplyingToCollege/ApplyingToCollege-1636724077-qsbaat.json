  "title:": "December 1st deadline",
  "text": "If my scores from the November 6th SAT come out on November 19th, do you think I would have enough time to send out my scores by December 1st, because some schools have an early action deadline on December 1st. This is if I even want to send out my score, because I will do test optional if my score is garbage. Also, fee waivers. I don't know what happens after you submit the common app, so if I said yes I want to apply for the common app fee waiver, what happens when you submit the common app? Is there like a paying page when you submit the common app? I'm so lost. Does it take time as well to verify that you have a fee waiver? Will I run out of time? There's always regular decision but still.",
