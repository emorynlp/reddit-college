  "text": "I need urgent help finishing the conclusion of my essay! I am being asked to elaborate on any circumstances or qualifications not reflected in my application.\n\nFor context, I am a first gen immigrant from a single mom household. I grew up with my aunt and uncle and their kids, ultimately making our household a huge family of 10\n\nOur financial situation made it really difficult for me to get a ride to extracurriculars, but the most taxing on my participation in extracurriculars was the fact I had to babysit our younger ones (I\u2019m the eldest daughter)  \n\nBut even so, I feel like I\u2019ve adopted significant leadership skills. How do I write about how these skills will be beneficial at any post-secondary institution? \n\nI am also set to graduate in the top 5% of my class. What can I say about that too?\n\nWhat can I say to appeal to the admissions officers and finish strong?\n\nIf anyone needs a reference to my conclusion, please PM me!",

      "text": " I'm in a difficult situation like that too, albeit with different circumstances, so hopefully I can help. On the other hand, I'm a senior as well, so please take my words with a grain of salt. \n\nIf it's the additional information section, what you've already written about your family looks pretty good to me. I would be less explicit about the leadership skill statement. Personally, I would go for something like this: \"These experiences have given me significant leadership experiences, and I hope to hone/apply my skills at university.\"\n\nI think the part about your graduating in the top 5% of your class will be reflected in your class rank, so I don't think it's necessary. But on the other hand, I don't know much hahaha. \n\nSo that's my advice. In all honesty, I think the best case scenario would be to ask your counselor.",
