  "title:": "How The Hell Do I Get A Counselor Rec. When I\u2019ve Already Graduated",
  "text": "As the title says, basically. I\u2019m applying for colleges right now and every one says I need a counselor recommendation. That would be fine if I applied to college last year as a senior. I did not. Like if it was just a final transcript they needed I could send that over and even show the original copy of it. What should I do??? Do I contact my old school??? How do I even start up that conversation because I never had a single conversation with my school counselors. Why is it even a requirement??",
