  "text": "hello! i know the title sounds pretty bad but i just dont feel like ive had an amazing connection w any of my teachers (except my freshman english and soph yr math teachers that left <\\3) i dont think any teacher has seen me as a bad student, but i havent stood out too much either. i wasnt able to get close to any of my junior yr teachers due to online schooling and i havent gotten close to my current teachers yet. im planning to ask two teachers irl and tell them about myself/my ec\u2019s in an email. those LORs will probably be okay, but not stellar in any way. also, i got a new counselor this year so that doesnt help my case either. how badly fo you think this\u2019ll hurt my chances?",

      "text": "The counselor rec problem is definitely a common thing, most people don\u2019t have connections with their counsellors cause they tend to work more with students who need help or they are new counsellors; you can just give the counsellor your resume so they can have more to discuss. However, not having that strong of a connection with your teacher recommenders will be a problem, especially since they\u2019re given more weight than the counsellor recommendation.",
