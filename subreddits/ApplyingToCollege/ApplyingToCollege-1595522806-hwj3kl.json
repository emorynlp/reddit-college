Basically, one small story in a narrative style.\n\nMontage essay - u know the training montage from Rocky where we see different bits of him exercising? Basically, that thing. You just bring together different experiences from your life (they don't have to be life-changing, just showcase ur personality's good sides, like being consistent or kind or caring about ur family. This is where your handful of ECs come into play) and connect them with one common thread. For example, i read an essay where a girl opened up her photo album and started reflecting on her memories. This common thread makes ur essay one consistent story, instead of a confusing mess.\n\nAs a person with no life-changing experiences or one thing that led to a passion or a passion in general, I chose the second structure (tho that also might be cuz i find it more suitable for my personal writing style).\nBut well, I'm a just teenagers who read a book, so take this with a big grain of salt.\nIf u have any questions about the book, u can pm me (or if u think i can say anything useful lol)",

It's such an important life skill. We need to be able to reflect on ourselves, understand our feelings/desires, and communicate that with others. \n\nThis is obviously massively important for job applications and interviews, but is also just really important just for mental health and positive relationships with others. Knowing your feelings, why you have them, how you react, etc...and being able to openly talk about sensitive topics is a part of getting older.\n\n(Tho I do agree sometimes these essays, applications, and interviews can be pretty fake when u exaggerate and say exactly what u know they want to hear....But introspection as a skill is still important.)",
