  "title:": "can i change my common app essay after applying to one school?",
  "text": "so my early action application is due on November 1st and my  school says for this date i have to submit a transcript request form by october 18. my essay is written and been read over by my peers but my teacher still hasn't gone over it and i'd be much more comfortable if she does before i apply. but i don't think she'll read it before i have to apply even tho i already asked if she could read it soon. im thinking of just applying to the one school with this essay and then when i revise the essay i'll put the final draft on my application for other school. im using the common app to apply. \n\nso is it possible to change the essay on the common app website so that the rest of my schools will see the revised/final draft and only one school will see the \"rough\" draft?",
