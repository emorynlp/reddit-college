  "text": "My English teacher (who is writing my rec) and counselor both really liked my common app essay; they said they could really hear my voice and other stuff. BUT my college consultant wants me to change half of it (change the part about my advocacy to growing up). I asked my English teacher and he thinks the advocacy part is central to my essay and me growing up, but I'm not really sure who I should believe, since my parents are paying the college consultant and not my teachers.",

I would heed the feedback of your college consultant. They are incentivized to be as critical of your writing as possible and aren\u2019t overwhelmed with other stuff as your teachers and counselors are.",
