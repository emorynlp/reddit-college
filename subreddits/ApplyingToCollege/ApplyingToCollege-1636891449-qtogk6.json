  "text": "Hello, I am an international student that lives in the Czech Republic (moved to the Czech Republic in 8th grade) and I am doing HS here. I am really strong in STEM and I have always wanted to try to do one of the International Olympiads in HS like IMO, IOI, or IPhO. I want to try for the Czech team and it turns out I can give the preliminaries and qualify for the team but all the preliminaries are in Czech and I can't speak Czech. I asked them if there was any scope of an English translation but they don't think the effort is justified. So I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions for olympiads (or maybe other good academic competitions I could do because all traditional olympiads like IMO, IOI, IPhO, I can't do because I am not a Czech speaker)",

      "text": "Imma be blunt here, the chances of you getting into IMO IOI or IPhO is tiny if you haven't been SPECIFICLY trained for ONE of these olympiads. So be more detailed about your academic interest. Other than that I would suggest you to check out national olympiads that allow foreign testers, such as all the olympiads in England and Math&Informatics Olympiads in America.",

          "text": "Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, I have strong previous academic and competitive experience (AP Calculus BC in 9th grade (5/5), taken multiple university math courses like multi calc and lin alg on CTY online, also on the competitive side of things, have qualified for AIME before in 9th grade, and also 5/5 on both AP Physics C exams, also won MathCounts Chapter in middle school) so I have definitely trained myself for competitive math and also programming competitions so I know the effort it takes and I am willing to put in that but unfortunately I can't participate here :( I am still a sophomore so I have still some time to participate in Olympiads and prepare for them",
