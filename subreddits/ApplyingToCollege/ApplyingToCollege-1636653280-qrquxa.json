      "text": "There is need-based financial aid and merit-based aid. Merit scholarships for internationals are often rare, extremely competitive, not enough to cover full costs, or a mix of all of the above. But they do exist. If you can afford some part of the tuition, merit scholarships can be the way to go for some less competitive colleges. \n\nNeed-based financial aid is given regardless of merit, just based on financial need. Note that the college decides what your need is, not you. There are colleges that are need-blind, where you asking for aid doesn\u2019t affect your chances. There are colleges that are need-aware, where asking for aid will decrease your chances, often significantly. Check [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need-blind_admission) out. You must apply for need-based aid at the same time you submit your application as a first year, and colleges list submission deadlines for financial documents on their websites. \n\nIf you are taking the SAT this March, I assume you will be applying for first year admissions next autumn. You will mostly apply for aid during that season along with college applications. Your country may offer its own scholarships for students attending US colleges, but that\u2019s something for you to look into. \n\nAs elkrange said, this is asked all the time on this sub. Search the sub. Search Google. Search r/IntltoUSA. The latter particularly has good advice regarding this topic.",
