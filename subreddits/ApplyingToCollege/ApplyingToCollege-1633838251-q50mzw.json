      "text": "Full disclosure: I haven\u2019t done this challenge nor have I heard of it until now, but I did participate in the Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam program which is extremely similar (both related to MIT, both give grant funding for ideas) and I absolutely loved the experience. I\u2019m not sure what exactly you\u2019re asking by \u201chow difficult is it/how difficult does it look?\u201d but if you\u2019re asking about how difficult it is to get then expect it to be very competitive, as is everything associated with MIT. If you\u2019re asking how difficult it would be AFTER getting accepted? Expect a rigorous workload to make your idea into a minimum viable product and then a polished prototype and then a final product ready to be used.",
