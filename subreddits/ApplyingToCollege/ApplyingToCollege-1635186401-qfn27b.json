I believe that the kind of education I want depends more on how much efforts I put than the institute I go to. So getting admitted with enough money to attend is really important.",

      "text": "It's not necessarily a bad thing but it might bite you on your back later on. I am considering how close a college is from industrial and commercial hubs (you will be surprised how tough it is for intl students to get internships unless you live near a city).\nI'm also considering what resources a college offers for international students. Int'l students generally need support regarding visa restrictions, racism (against middle Eastern and Asians especially), and just blending in with the American student body. Sure, the facilities might be far better than your home country, but if you don't get the support you need and if you feel lost (as an international student), you might not have the best time in the US. I'm not considering weather because it's trivial to me as I have no personal preference (as long as it doesn't rain day and night, I'm fine). \nAlso, as long as you're not living in NYC or Cali, I doubt your monthly expenses will be too high. College students can spend VERY modestly if they want. \nI'm also considering what kind of school it is (i.e. small LAC, large public school, etc). I talked with an international student who got into a LAC and found the small town college vibe super suffocating. \n\nThese factors might seem trivial now, but all my relatives, friends, and random strangers on internet who studied in college in the US have adviced me to consider these external factors too as they say the college experience might make me feel alienated if I don't fit in there (and I'm not talking about the hypothetical college fit but rather general preferences and support systems).",
