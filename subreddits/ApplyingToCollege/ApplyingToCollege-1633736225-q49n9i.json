  "text": "Hi! \n\nI\u2019ve been having a lot of trouble choosing a college to apply to for my early decision. I am an international student and a business major, my dream uni is USC and they don\u2019t offer early decision, it\u2019s just my luck. The other unis I have on my list are NYU and Santa Clara University, I\u2019m torn between applying to one of these for ED or wait for regular decision so I can apply to USC. I don\u2019t have the best grades but I still wanna try tho. \nAny help/ advice would be appreciated!!",
