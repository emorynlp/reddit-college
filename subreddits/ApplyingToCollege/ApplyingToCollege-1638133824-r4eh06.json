  "text": "I had Sunday morning as my hard deadline to submit my application, so I was really eager to turn it in. Right after I submit I realized that I forgot to put that I was in a sport and was team captain for that very sport\u2026.\n\nBut at the same time I\u2019m so nonchalant about it because I really did not care for my sport and was only doing it for the application. I was only on JV, did it for 3 years, and am not doing it this year.\n\nSo\u2026 how screwed am I? I would like to believe that I\u2019m not screwed at all since I have other ECs which I do actually care about. But all my friends said that I messed up big time.",
