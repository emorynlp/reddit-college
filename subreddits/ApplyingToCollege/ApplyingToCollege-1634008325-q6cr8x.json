  "title:": "Applying from a private university to an UC as an international",
  "text": "Hi, I'm an international student freshman majoring in Computer Science at a private university. So far, my school is okay, but I still have the intention to transfer my Junior year. It's almost time to pick classes for my next semester, so I talked to my advisor about picking courses that would be suitable for transfer in case I want to. However, he doesn't want to help me at all, and I can't find many resources on the internet for this matter. I'm currently taking 18 semester units with Calc 2, Intro to CompSci, Japanese, GE for Writing (I think), and some graduate-requirement classes. Where can I find the best resources to check if my classes are transferable, and which class should I prioritize? Also, what would be good extracurriculars? Any advice is appreciated!",
