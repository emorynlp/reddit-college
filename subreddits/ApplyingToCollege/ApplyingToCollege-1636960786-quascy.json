  "text": "UC freshman. Which major is easier to get into? Computer science or Computer Science & Engineering? I\u2019m mainly referring to UCs, like San Diego/Irvine/Davis/Riverside. I just recently read about admissions data based on majors, and it\u2019s interesting seeing that CSE has much higher admission rates comparing to CS. Now I know CS it\u2019s too competitive, and I\u2019m thinking about switching my majors. Any recommendations majors that\u2019s related to CS? And any perspectives on the admission data? Is it false?",

      "text": "Most universities usually offer only one out of CS and CSE, and at schools that offer both (like Ohio State), the acceptance rate may depend on which college houses the programs. Unfortunately, most universities don't reveal the breakdown of their acceptance rates.",
