  "text": "UC freshman. Which major is easier to get into? Computer science or Computer Science & Engineering? I\u2019m mainly referring to UCs, like San Diego/Irvine/Davis/Riverside. I just recently read about admissions data based on majors, and it\u2019s interesting seeing that CSE has much higher admission rates comparing to CS. Now I know CS it\u2019s too competitive, and I\u2019m thinking about switching my majors. Any recommendations majors that\u2019s related to CS? And any perspectives on the admission data? Is it false?",

      "text": "Most universities usually offer only one out of CS and CSE, and at schools that offer both (like Ohio State), the acceptance rate may depend on which college houses the programs. Unfortunately, most universities don't reveal the breakdown of their acceptance rates.",

      "text": "I can speak to UCSD, the CSE department as a whole is very competitive, and more so than Computer Engineering within the ECE department. The reasoning for this is that you can switch between majors in the CSE department (ie CSE Computer Engineering --> Computer Science), while switching to CS from outside the CSE department is a lottery process. So if you really want to do CS, 100% apply to the CSE department.   \n\n\nHowever, if you are good with doing ECE: Computer Engineering (which is CS classes and Electrical Engineering!!!), then yea by all means go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso all of the UCs you listed have an alternate major system, so you should be able to apply for your first choice major and then to a second alternative major.",
