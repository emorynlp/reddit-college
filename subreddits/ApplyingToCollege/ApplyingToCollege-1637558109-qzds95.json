  "title:": "omg I came back on this sub for the first time in two years",
  "text": "This is a throwaway account but\u2026\n\nIts so wholesome and strange to come back to this sub after two years. I applied to colleges in fall of 2019 and I LIVED on this sub. I remember freaking out about decision dates, times emails were sent, admissions portals, etc. freaking out on ivy day w everyone, the UC HICAGO jokes (idk if that\u2019s still a joke around here still)\n\nI just want to say though, y\u2019all are doing good. Like, things are really scary as a hs senior and honestly I get it. I had p subpar stats and was super paranoid abt not getting accepted anywhere but I ended up getting into two of my dream universities (one of which I\u2019m attending now.) \n\nIt all works out in the end. Good luck to everyone and hang in there! Trust me a couple years down the road, you\u2019re going to be really fond of your memories about this sub",
