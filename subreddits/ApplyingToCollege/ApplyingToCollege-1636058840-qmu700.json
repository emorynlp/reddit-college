  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m planning on applying EDI to Vassar, and was just wondering if there are any major cons about the school? I toured last month and loved it! I\u2019m planning on majoring in English and maybe doing a correlate in Media Studies or Anthropology. I\u2019m interested in pursuing either writing/journalism or law as a career. Also, does anyone know if they have a Mock Trial team? Thank you so much! :)",

      "text": "Not sure, but when looking for cons sometimes I'll check the 1-2 star reviews on their Niche page (Vassar only has 15 one-star which is pretty low!). Although, unless you see some pretty clear common themes, I wouldn't give too much weight to them, as college really is what you make of it. You can also see if they have their own sub reddit, browse posts there, or ask the opinion of the people in the sub. Good luck!",
