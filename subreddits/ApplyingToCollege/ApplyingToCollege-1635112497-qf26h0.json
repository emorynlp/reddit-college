      "text": "Just a copy and paste, in case any of this is relevant for you:\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. \r  \n\r  \nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\r  \n\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family. Note automatic scholarship deadlines, as some might be earlier than the RD deadline.",
