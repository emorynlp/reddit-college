Probably the best location for your preferences.\n\n**Skidmore** is located right outside of Saratoga Springs, a city of around 28,000 people.\n\n**Vassar** is located in Poughkeepsie, a town of like 40,000 people.\n\n**Grinnell** is located in a small town of 9,000 people.\n\n\\-----\n\nI don't think any of these schools have a big party atmosphere, but there's bound to be at least a few parties at basically every school so you'd be bound to find a few parties if you searched hard enough.\n\nIf you want a smaller college with a work hard, play hard atmosphere: **Colgate, Wake Forest, URichmond, Dartmouth, Tulane, Bucknell,** just to name a few.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck.",
