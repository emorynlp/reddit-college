  "text": "hi y'all,\n\nthis might be a stupid question, but could you guys help me with ED/EA decision? My older brother doesn't want me to apply to Brown, even though he went there, and wants me to \"do better.\"\n\nHe wants me to apply ED/REA to Dartmouth or Yale instead, especially since he thinks its a better fit for me socially and since I mentioned I'm interested in following his career path (he's an investment banker), he's pushing for those two as they have better \"placement\" than Brown generally.\n\nHow do I navigate this? All three schools are at 5-6% acceptance rates (4.9, 5.8, 6.1 respectively I think), but I think I get a slight legacy boost at Brown because of my brother. I've also been there hundreds of times and I can do my Why Brown essay very easily. I do agree with him that Yale and Dartmouth (especially) are a better social fit for me, but I do enjoy the seemingly laid back vibes that Brown can provide. I also want to study Economics, which I know Yale and Dartmouth are ranked higher for, but the difference seems marginal and I would be able to take a lot of interesting courses at Brown pass/fail and just focus on learning.\n\nI get the logic of what my brother is thinking, and I know he wants me to go to a \"better\" school than he did, but I really do enjoy Brown and I'm just confused on why he doesn't want me to go to Brown, as he loved it there (at least 5 frat brothers would come over every holiday) and ended up on a great career track regardless. I would also have legacy at his frat and other organizations, and I'm sure he knows it would make my social life a lot easier, especially since I've met some brothers who would be seniors when I get on campus.\n\nHow do I go about this? Outside of the social aspect, I don't think there's that much of a difference in acceptance probability (east asian male, lower middle class, public school, stats are all competitive with perfect SATs and numerous sports and national academic comps). Career wise, it seems that I'll be set no matter what, even if it might be marginally less common for people to go into finance at Brown. He also tossed out the idea of Harvard, Princeton, or Wharton but didn't think they were worth it socially.\n\nWhat do I tell him? Is he right? I would also need financial aid (heavily) so REA at Yale would give me a chance to apply to other schools to see their financial aid package.",

      "text": ">I would also need financial aid (heavily) ... it almost feels like I\u2019m leaving something on the table now by not going to a Yale or Dartmouth? I don\u2019t know how to describe it.\n\nYour brother sounds like a prestige whore (exactly [this person](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=prestige%20whore)) and you are ***NOT*** going to Yale or Dartmouth. You haven't got into any school yet and you sound like a very arrogant person who doesn't fit in well at Brown. Did your brother need FA since he got off the waitlist? Please read [U. administration seeks to address lack of middle-income applicants](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/10/u-administration-seeks-to-address-lack-of-middle-income-applicants). Your situation might be very different from your bother's. But the fact that you're asking this question now means you shouldn't ED to Brown. Unless you're a full-paid student or your family income is low enough that your family won't pay out of pocket, you probably would get a  better deal if you apply RD, assuming you can get into multiple competitive schools.",

Being in NYC has significant advantage when it comes to these kind of things.\n3. My take: if you are on the edge, REA at Yale and applying to both Dartmouth/Brown RD probably the best choice.
