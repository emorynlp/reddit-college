  "text": "When you invite a teacher into Common App for a rec letter can you use the same letter for multiple college applications automatically, or does the teacher have to do something for each college? What does it mean that I have to assign them to \u201ccomplete an evaluation\u201d for each college? Does that require individual input from them on each application?",

      "text": "For Common App schools, they only write/submit one and you select who to send it to.   \n\n\nFor schools with their own application process, the teacher will receive another email with a different way to submit, but they will almost certainly use the same letter.",
