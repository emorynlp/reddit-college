              "text": "It\u2019s true the UCs will not count the grades for classes in 9th grade and summer before into their calculated UC-GPA they base admissions on.\nBut, you still need to enter all a-g courses that are on your school transcripts. And like you said the 9th grade courses students are typically taking are required courses/credits for graduation.\nMy son is in the same situation that he has 2 classes taken during summer session before 9th grade fall semester started. They are listed on his transcript as summer session 2018-19 ( 9th grade). His counselor said if he had taken the classes in the same school as fall 2018-19, he can just add them to the other courses (as G1 just like the fall courses). Then, explain in the add. info field that these were courses taken during summer session but as part of 9th grade included in the HS transcript.\nIn my son\u2019s case, it was more complicated. Each of his 2 summer courses were with a different online school ( different from each other and different from school he attended in the fall). In his case, the advice was to add both schools under attended schools with the respective dates of attendance (Jul-Aug 2018). Then assign courses/grades to them. Here it is clear that they were summer courses, no need to explain it. \n\nAs a general rule: check your HS transcript. All a-g courses listed there, should go in your UC app. If in doubt how/where, consult your counselor.",
