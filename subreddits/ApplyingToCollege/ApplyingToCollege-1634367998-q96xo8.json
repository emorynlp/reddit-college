      "text": "When did you ask him for a letter? Because it usually takes a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks to write a quality letter. Throw in the fact we're in the biggest youth mental health crisis ever recorded meaning they're likely handling more responsive services for students, filling in all requisite senior meetings, and other responsibilities... It's very realistic that he would not be able to get a letter done in time without enough forewarning...\n\nAs for the terrible suggestions from some... No, a teacher cannot write a counselor recommendation unless you're an International Student. No, your counselor is not lazy or out to get you because he cannot meet a deadline with all of his other requirements. \n\nWhat you need to do is find out one of two things... (1) if the schools you're applying to will accept your transcripts and letters after the ED Deadline or is it all or nothing and (2) If you'll be penalized if your counselor elects to not submit a written evaluation (the actual letter of rec) alongside his student recommendation. If they're fine with the recommendation without the evaluation you would be fine as he can do that rather easily.",

          "text": "i invited him to commonapp in August, and we never really get any info about all these processes. i am a international student, and our school is one of the few school where we have gc. His reason for not able to complete my application is that while I invited him on commonapp I hadn\u2019t selected early action. But can you blame me I was waiting for sat scores to arrive, and hadn\u2019t selected early action college. We never get any information, never. Only mistake I did I would say is I didn\u2019t contact him earlier before my sat scores arrived. And he says that I am not in his list of early action candidates. Now, he also started interview this October. Cmon, thats too late to even start gc interviews. I think I will email him again asking for alternative. If he is rude with me, I will go for alternative. I aint loosing my ea chance with good sat score like 1490 and good enough gpa 3.62",
