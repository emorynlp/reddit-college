  "text": "have a meh GPA - not applying to any T20s, 5 T50s. Goes to a prep school where majority are applying to T50s (we have 20 students in a class of 200 going to the Ivy\u2019s in \u201821)\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about transfer quite a lot, but I know it might be hard to find friends after transfer.\n\nSo, transfer students, what\u2019s your 2 cents and story?",

      "text": "Went to a competitive public high school. Good but not amazing GPA, high SAT, woefully lacking extracurriculars. Wanted to go to an East Coast private but ended up at an in-state public.\n\nWas very depressed at said public, which was a terrible fit. Spent freshman year on campus, then signed up for a yearlong study abroad program.\n\nSpent a semester abroad. Liked it. Then COVID hit, and the rest of the program was cancelled. Instead of resuming classes online, I stayed in the country and started working.\n\nWorked a string of different jobs for a year and a half. Was pressured to go back to school. It was nearly summer at that point, so virtually all schools were closed for applications. Ended up applying to an unranked school because it was the only one that was still open. Accepted offer, attended.\n\nCouldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I could\u2019ve gotten into better schools if I\u2019d just waited for the next app season. Found that Columbia had something called the School of General Studies, a college for nontraditional students that actually seemed to welcome transfers. Saw that the application fee was waived for spring 2022 applicants. Thought \u201cwhy not,\u201d and applied.\n\nWas accepted. Am now very excited to go to New York in a few months.\n\nEdit regarding friends: I had such a hard time making friends at my first school. I went in with an open mind and genuinely tried to put myself out there, but just did not vibe with the general student body. I made a grand total of two friends there (they were gems, though, and we still keep in touch). Here, at my second school, I came in very jaded, and did not actively attempt to make friends at all\u2014but my social life is leagues better than it was at my first school. I\u2019ve made a number of friends without even trying. So, from my limited experience, at least, finding friends depends more on how you fit into your environment than it does on transfer status.",
