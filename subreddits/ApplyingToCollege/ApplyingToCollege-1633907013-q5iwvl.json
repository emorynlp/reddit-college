You stay on A2C for too much my friend.\n\nIf you are truly interested in CS, you should not sacrifice or even compromise your interest just for a better school.

Like, in top colleges, handwork matters less because everyone in the school are hard workers. So the thing that differentiate people are actually how skilled you are. If you don't work hard, you will just get screwed. Also the material isn't something that you can just bang your head at and make it through. You really need to understand the material to do well on tests and homeworks. I am slightly exaggerating the difficulty, but college courses are no joke. AP is a joke compared to college courses (at top colleges at least). 3.3 GPA is probably fine and doable for most people, but 3.6 is probably too stressful for comfort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.P.S\n\nwhy is software engineer hell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nforgot to mention that CS admission criteria don't require prior CS exposure.

And I'm actually interested in CS, I've been doing some sort of CS since I was 12 and I would like to make living/hobby out of it. Please don't confuse me wit the ones that are only interested in the job security and salary.\n\n>people who do very well in college courses (hence high college GPA) are usually the one who is exposed to CS/Math prior in high school\n\nYes, definitely. However, the declaration process makes it possible to study harder and become truly good at it before declaring your major. If you study really hard at it and don't reach the threshold, maybe CS isn't for you. It isn't the only degree available at Berkeley.\n\n>3.3 GPA is probably fine and doable for most people, but 3.6 is probably too stressful for comfort.\n\nWell, I agree. In a good scenario, the GPA threshold would stay the same and they would just better fund their CS program, which is why I believe that Berkeley has to come to terms with the fact that it's a STEM oriented UC and put more resources towards it. \n\n>why is software engineer hell?\r  \n\r\n\nBecause of how competitive and difficult the process to get there is. Internships, interviews, leetcode, this and that. Not so much the actual job, the process to get there.",
