If I\u2019m not mistaken, Most universities in a city work hand in hand with the community colleges in the area as they want students to transfer to the university to finish studies. \n\nHowever, take this with a grain of salt as I haven\u2019t gone in years. Your best bet is to talk to the community college and university admission offices to ensure you have a good path you wanna take while saving some serious money. \n\nBtw: always remember to fill out a FAFSA application. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll qualify. Free money is free money.\n\nAll the best!",

      "text": "If everything transfers, and the classes you choose fill the requirements for the four year degree, then yes that is doable.\n\nDefinitely look at the degree map for what you are thinking of studying at the four year school. There might be an articulation agreement that spells out exactly what the equivalent CC classes are which can help.\n\nPlanning ahead is important to avoid situations where you have enough credits, but can't take a course you need because you skipped a prerequisite -- for example you can't take some later engineering courses unless you have taken the required math as well as classes like statics and dynamics in advance.",

      "text": "You don't even need to get an associate's degree.  You can graduate with two additional years at the 4Y school if:\n\n1. All of your CC credits transfer, and\n2. All of your transfer credits count toward some degree requirement,\n3. The degree you pursue doesn't require more than 4 years worth of credits (some do),\n4. The degree requirements don't involve any \"chains\" of course prerequisites with length greater than four.  e.g. you need \"D\" to graduate, but to take \"D\" you need to have taken \"C\", and to take \"C\" you need to have taken \"B\", and to take \"B\" you need to have taken \"A\".  And:\n5. The 4Y school doesn't require more than 4 semesters worth of credits \"in residence\" in order to award you a degree (different schools may have different requirements).",
