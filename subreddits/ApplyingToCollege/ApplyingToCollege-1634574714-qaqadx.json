  "text": "I applied to UNC EA and just found out on the MyCarolina portal that internationals are not eligible for an application fee waiver so I am considering withdrawing my application. There are a few universities I am skeptical about whether they give a fee waiver to internationals after this happened so I just want to confirm so I don't waste time on essays either.   \nUSC  \nBU  \nUMD college park  \nNYU  \nDo these places give application fee waivers to internationals? If not, I'll not apply to these places    \nThanks",

      "text": "I don't know the fee waiver answer directly. However, consider that UNC and UMD are public universities that will not give any need-based aid to internationals. Accordingly, fee waivers may not be relevant; i.e., if you can't afford the app fee, you can't afford to attend.\n\nBU does not give need-based aid to internationals either. There may be merit available.\n\nNYU has a reputation for lousy aid even for domestic students. If I recall, NYU offers merit to internationals.\n\nJust some food for thought. If you need financial aid to attend, you may want to alter your list.\n\nSee also this post about free NC apps https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qaqjae/free\\_college\\_applications\\_for\\_everyone\\_applying/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3",

          "text": "Oh i do have quite a lot of other universities on my list too. I just want to check whether these ones would give me an application waiver or not.   \nUNC and UMD have merit so I thought I would try for those. Same with USC and BU as neither of those give aid to internationals either.   \nNYU bad aid but ig getting a fee waiver wouldn't be that difficult cuz they give some aid at least, the others I am asking for do not give aid to internationals at all. Plus I cant find specific info on websites either smh",
