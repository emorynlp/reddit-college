Honestly, Mines is super under-rated and if it has your field of study you'll do great coming from there.",

              "text": "The claim that Mines has a higher suicide rate seems to be just a rumor/urban myth: [https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/stories/mines-high-suicide-rate-just-a-rumor,57628](https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/stories/mines-high-suicide-rate-just-a-rumor,57628)? That's not unusual: lots of schools have had reputations as having high suicide rates when their rates are fairly typical. Colorado has a higher suicide rate, but I suspect a lot of that is driven by males who are 40+ years old.\n\nThat said, rumors can lead to concerns, so Mines has been trying to improve their mental health and outreach: https://www.mines.edu/everyoredigger/wp-content/uploads/sites/302/2019/11/every-oredigger-campus-update-oct-29-2019.pdf \n\nSo I would not worry about the campus suicide rate.\n\nIf you, however, have been thinking or or engaging in self-harm... that's not going to change if you go to one university versus another. If that is the case, you need to get help. I've seen lots of people go through this and, with help, you can get stronger and get to a place where you are much better and happy with your life. That seemed impossible to all those people, but they got there. If you are facing that, know that you too can get there, but you will need help (like a guide to climb that mountain).",
