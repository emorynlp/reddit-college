  "text": "i asked one of my teachers for a letter of rec, and she told me that she would be \u201cstraight-forward\u201d in the letter.\n\ni asked her to elaborate and she said she would discuss my current performance in the class. would her letter might be a detriment to my app? because i think being \u201cstraight-forward\u201d insinuates that she has something negative to highlight.\n\nso should i ask her to write or not? i already have a letter from my favorite teacher but some of my RD schools require 2 letters. also she was kinda my last option and i can ask another teacher but i believe his letter would be bland.",
