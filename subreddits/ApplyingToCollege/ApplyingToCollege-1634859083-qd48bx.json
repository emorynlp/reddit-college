  "title:": "Not sure what reach schools to go for.",
  "text": "Because of financial status and the amazing tuition covered by bright futures in FL, I'm already pretty much dead set on going to UF , with FSU as my safety. However, my test scores are pretty high (1570 and 33) and I'm in IB, so I figured it would be worth applying to some reach schools. It's hard to go by SAT score because even though I exceed the 3rd quartile test score wise for MIT/Harvard/the like, I don't think I'm brilliant enough to go to these schools and I know the SAT is only a fraction of the decision (essays, ECs, 4.5 out of 5 GPA etc.,)\n\nThis might sound like a stupid post, and I'm sorry if it does. But I was wondering if anyone could recommend what schools would be worth shooting for? I can't afford to apply for many, maybe 2 reaches at most on top of my in-state and target schools, but I'd like to apply to at least one where I have a fathomable shot but is still above my perceived capabilities. \n\nRealistically I cannot afford to go to any out of state schools. Again I apologize if it sounds arrogant or na\u00efve but I just want to apply for the sake of knowing I got in, in the event that I do. Maybe if a miracle occurred one of them would fund me well, but I highly doubt it. I just don't wanna graduate still wondering what could have been.\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate any and all replies -- even criticism!",

A few other Ivies are as well, but Cornell has more of a \u201cbig school\u201d feeling. It\u2019s nearly as large as Georgia Tech and UNc from an undergrad perspective. Does it snow a lot?  Yeah. But a totally different setting, good CS program. And if you\u2019re only doing this to see \u201cwhat if?\u201d It\u2019s a great choice.",

      "text": "Hi fellow Floridian. I was in a similar boat last year. My SAT score is actually lower than yours and I ended up getting into one of the school you\u2019ve mentioned as a reach reach. If you really like the school then I would go for it. Don\u2019t hold yourself back unless it\u2019s for financial reasons. Even then, it\u2019s always worth a shot to apply for financial aid. Schools like T10 ten to be generous in that unless your really upper middle class",

      "text": "Is the financial aid at top schools likely to be enough for you, or would you need non-need-need based aid as well?  If the latter, then that probably disqualifies many/most of the tip-top programs since they don't offer much (if any) non-need-based aid.\n\nIf you run your financials through the net price calculator of a school doesn't offer non-need-based aid, and the number it returns is not affordable, then I strongly encourage you not to waste time applying to that school \"just to see if you can get in\".\n\nIf, however, that number is close to what you might be able to afford, then it might be worth applying.\n\nAlso, if you want options other than UF, you might consider applying to some schools with large (highly competitive) non-need-based awards and trying to win one of those.  Vanderbilt, Emory, Southern Cal, Wake Forest, UNC (depending on major), Georgia Tech and Boston College all have some (extremely competitive) non-need-based full cost-of-attendance awards.  Also Davidson in NC if you'd consider a LAC.",

If you are in a position where you really can't afford to pay application fees for them, you could also be in the position where private selective schools can really meet your financial need.\n\nAs far as which ones to shoot for - it really depends on what you want in a school, and what you want to study. \"Where I have a shot of getting in\" matters of course, but it's not enough to work from - you are looking for schools that are potentially better for you than a very good public university, so the shots you take really need to offer what you want besides \"higher ranked on this one list I saw\".  If you've got a potential major, or kind of environment you prefer (city vs college town, big school vs small, research focused vs. teaching focused, etc.) that can help people give you suggestions.",
