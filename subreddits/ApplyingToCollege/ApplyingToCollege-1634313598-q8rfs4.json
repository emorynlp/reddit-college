      "text": "I was told by a respected college consultant that it will harm more than help if you graduate early. \n\nColleges don\u2019t want 17 year old freshmen. Graduating one year early does not make you a child genius. \n\nThey want to see what you did with your time after you\u2019ve maxed out your classes. Did you go take college classes? Online courses? Work? In other words, no matter how smart you are, even if you\u2019ve already taken every class in your high school, there is still more you can do and they know that.\n\nETA: of course this only applies to T60 or so colleges. If you\u2019re planning to go to your non-flagship stage college, it probably won\u2019t make that much of a difference.",
