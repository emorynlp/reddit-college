  "title:": "UPDATE: On the boy who lied about getting into Yale",
  "text": "I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so late\ud83d\ude2d I haven\u2019t had access to Reddit for a bit, but I\u2019m back for those who are still interested. Time to update you on the boy from my school who lied about getting into Yale SCEA when he really got deferred.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lbursh/bitches_be_backing_themselves_into_corners/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want to hear about all the juicy drama that has ensued since he lied, you can skip to the end to hear the verdict.\n\nSo, after he lied to the track team, everyone was constantly talking about him getting into Yale at practice. They were like \u201cYou\u2019ve wanted this since freshman year. How did it feel? Can we see the acceptance letter? Did you make a reaction video?\u201d He always looked so uncomfortable. He always deflected and was like \u201cWell, I was really happy...\u201d I actually felt so bad.\n\nAnd some of the guys on the track team, who can\u2019t stand the boy who lied since he always told everyone \u201cOnly I can apply to Yale,\u201d were annoyed that he supposedly got accepted. They were like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he actually got in. I was hoping he\u2019d get rejected.\u201d I was just watching the drama like \ud83d\udc40\n\nThe longer this went on, the worse I felt for him LOL. He figured out that I knew he got deferred because he found out that his mom told my mom about it.\nSo he ambushed me after school in a deserted hallway. He had a miniature freak out and was like, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone I got deferred, I\u2019ll die.\u201d I said I wasn\u2019t going to tell, but he obviously didn\u2019t trust me, lol. Every time someone brought up Yale at practice and he had to make something up like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m so excited to meet everyone when I get there\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go. My parents were so happy when they found out,\u201d he would look over at me uncomfortably like he thought I\u2019d scream that he got deferred or something.\n\nLol it just kept on getting worse for my poor guy.\nDuring weekend practice, we were running over the mini hurdles and our coach casually called out to the Yale kid saying he wanted to see his reaction video (he\u2019s always told people he was going to make a reaction video). Yale kid was caught off guard and tripped over the hurdles and fell, causing everyone to have to stop\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nIt was just me and the kid\u2019s girlfriend who knew that he lied\ud83d\ude2d (His girlfriend got into Princeton.)\nSo he just kept telling the same elaborate story about how he opened his acceptance letter and everyone cried\ud83d\udc80 And dodging whenever someone asked to see his reaction video. Boys and girls track sat together after practice, and some kid started grilling him about getting into Yale. It got increasingly uncomfortable lol. And his girlfriend was just watching like \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\n\nAlas, on Ivy Day, he got his final results.\n\nThe Yale simp kid did not get into Yale. He was very upset about it since he\u2019s been saying he\u2019ll go there for years. And his whole room is full of Yale merch\ud83d\udc80 \n\nHowever, he got into Columbia. So now he\u2019s starting to ditch the Yale gear for Columbia gear and fall in love with them instead. And that\u2019s what happened\ud83d\ude0c",

                  "text": "I don\u2019t believe this story one bit, but to answer your question (from a Princeton AO): \u201cAbout 10-15% of our class every year comes from maybe 30 or so private boarding schools / target schools across the US, a lot of which are in New England. These applicants are held to a much lower standard and are predominantly very rich and very white. Many kids with mediocre scores will get into HYPSM every year. This is why the high school you go to is the easiest way to get into a top school. Imagine a high school that sends 20 kids to Harvard every year while entire states won't get that many in. Out of 100 random public schools in California you might get 5 kids who get into Harvard.
