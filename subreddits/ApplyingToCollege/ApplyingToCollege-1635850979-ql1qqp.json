They are pro poker players and 17/18 year olds are amateurs at best. Less selective schools might give you a little more cash, but if you need to\nCompare FA offers apply RD. \n\nIf you turndown your ED offer expect the school to contact admissions officers at ur RD schools that they think you applied to. I have seen this happen and it gets ugly. The other schools will rescind their offers as you signed a contract along with ur parents and guidance counselor to enroll if accepted. Schools need everyone to play fair so they enforce informally. \n\nThey also don\u2019t want you to see the other offers which is why you are supposed to \u201c withdraw\u201d your application immediately after ED acceptance. \n\nBest of luck - college is ridiculously expensive so don\u2019t overspend for a big name - the job offers are not going to be that much higher. 10 years plus of enormous debt is like putting your life in handcuffs.",
