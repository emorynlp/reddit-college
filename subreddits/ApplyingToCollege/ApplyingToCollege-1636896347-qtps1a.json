      "text": "Only write one if you have truly exceptional circumstances. I chose to write one because I was severely affected and there was a gap on my application. I take all of my classes at a local university so my high school refused to allow me on campus. I was considered a \"covid risk\" so I wasnt allowed to participate in on campus activities until this August. I used the essay to explain why all of my on campus activities stopped and why I suddenly started do tons of activities in my community instead. I had to start working in order to afford gas and continue involvement. I also had multiple academic competitions cancelled and rescheduled for this school year. I explained that I was still participating, but the dates got pushed back in 1.5 years.\nYou have to remember that covid affected everyone. If there is an inconsistency on your application, such as discontinued activities or family death, then explain it. Otherwise, you'll seem like you're complaining about something everyone has had to overcome.",

Here\u2019s what he has to say about the Covid Essay: https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/08/28/to-answer-or-not-to-answer-the-college-admission-covid-19-question/\n\nTrinity U \u2014 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIBC_fi5jNQ&list=PL63oJnhgV-LJBf4HfaJOMDla0PYdREX-v&index=8&ab_channel=TrinityUniversity\n\nI address the essay in my Supplemental Essays post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i2db77/making_peace_with_your_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nFrom Rhodes College Admissions Officer: \nFor COVID response...She asked students to reflect on the following:\r1. Are my experiences different from others?\r2. Am I aware of my privileges?\r3. Am I complaining or explaining?\r4. Am I being specific?\r5. Am I being repetitive?\n\nThis is what over 300 College Admissions say in their collective statement: \u201c\u2026 we encourage students to communicate any factors specific to their circumstances that impeded their academic performance. Those factors might include: lack of access to the internet, no quiet place to study, or the various family responsibilities described above. We encourage students to describe concretely how any of these circumstances have negatively affected their academic performance or ability to engage in activities that matter to them. It is helpful to know, for example, how much time students spent per week taking on a family responsibility, such as taking care of a sick relative.\u201d  This is my summary of the entire statement. They address the Covid issue in the statement (linked in the post). https://www.instagram.com/p/CCGi7lpBP2-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\nThis is what common app says: Community disruptions such as COVID-19 and natural disasters can have deep and long-lasting impacts. If you need it, this space is yours to describe those impacts. Colleges care about the effects on your health and well-being, safety, family circumstances, future plans, and education, including access to reliable technology and quiet study spaces.\nhttps://www.commonapp.org/blog/COVID-19-question-common-app",
