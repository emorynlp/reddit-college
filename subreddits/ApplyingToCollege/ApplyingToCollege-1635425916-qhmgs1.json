  "text": "(Sorry, this may be a little messy, I'm not really sure how to write this out. I'm not sure if this counts as a \"chance-me\" post since it's more about an email than anything, but if it does then I'm sorry.)\n\nHi, I'm a high school senior this school year. I just submitted an application for a school I have my heart set on going to (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University). Their admissions rate is around 60%, and I've heard they accept most applications from anyone who is \"average\" or above. Normally, I wouldn't be concerned and would be confident about getting accepted, since during my freshman and sophomore year I got only As and Bs.\n\nThe problem is my junior year. During COVID and online learning, my grades dropped significantly (Cs, Ds, Fs) and my GPA dropped from around a 3.5 to a 3.1. I want to email the college's admissions office to tell them that COVID negatively affected me and that my junior year grades are not an accurate depiction of my academic abilities. I'm not sure whether to send this email, I don't know if it will help my chances of them accepting me, or hurt them, or not do anything.\n\nEveryone I've spoken to says the school will most likely accept my application since my SAT score is alright (1200), but I'm really not sure because I don't know if this is a special case or not. I also don't know whether sending them an email shedding light on my bad grades will help my chances.\n\nI want to know whether or not I should, and what the admissions office may think if I do? Thanks.",
