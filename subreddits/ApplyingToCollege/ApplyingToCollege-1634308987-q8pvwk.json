  "text": "So, I made a mistake. Instead of putting scores recipients to receive the scores from the test I will take on December, I put from October. I can\u2019t cancel it now and the scores from October weren\u2019t good. Do I send an email to the school I was going to ED test optional explaining the situation or do I not ED there to wait and send better scores in December?",

      "text": "First try to find the answer in the admission website section on test optional or FAQs or some language in the college's questions in the app.  If you don't see the answer in those places, you can call the admission office, say that you are applying ED test optional but accidentally sent scores, and ask whether they will consider the scores. Most colleges will say no, though for a few others, it could be too late.\n\nTHERE IS ANOTHER LESSON here: do not order a score report for scores you have not yet seen. That is, do not use the free score reports for December. Wait to see your Dec scores before deciding whether to report and which scores to report. Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. If the colleges require an official report prior to admission, there will still be time in Dec to order after seeing your scores.\n\nApplying ED without scores vs RD with scores is a separate question. That would depend on the rest of your app and the college.",
