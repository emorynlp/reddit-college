  "text": "Trying to choose between these two:\n\n1) Premed-ish Club/for those exploring a future medical career \u2014 Member for 2 years, 1 hour a week (only during school year)\n\n2) Job where I work with children \u2014 literally just started but will be indicated as 12th grade on CommonApp, 3 hours a week (only during school year)\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards #2 just because it\u2019s a job but I just want to get some opinions. I want to go into pediatrics in the future, so both of these are technically relevant, just kinda worried about how it\u2019s only recent (how it\u2019ll look on early apps). Also, do you think it should be ranked higher on my EC list than say summer programs which were only for a few months? Thanks!",

I\u2019ve heard that being a member of a club isn\u2019t too valuable either, which is why I\u2019m leaning away from it (but it seems like it might be better to include it if it paints a better picture of my career goals?) \n\nIf I still pick #2, do you think it should be ranked higher than science-related summer programs (they don\u2019t have name recognition)?\n\nThanks for replying!",
