  "text": "Hey! I'm an international undergrad applicant from India, and I recently got an email for a Stanford interview from an alumnus.  I wrote back on the same day stating that I would like to opt for the interview and asked for his preferred date and time. It has been 3 days since I wrote back and haven't gotten a response yet.... should I email him again or just wait?",
