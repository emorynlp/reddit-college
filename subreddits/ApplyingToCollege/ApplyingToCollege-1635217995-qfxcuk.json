I was wondering if I could apply right now for early action schools in California, (like UC davis, UC San diego, etc) which are due in a month, but since Santa Clara University application is due within a couple of days (I feel like i won\u2019t finish, procrastination at its finest) am I able to apply for regular action for this school in January as well??",
