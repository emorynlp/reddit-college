  "text": "i know some people say us news ranks are not reliable, but uw seattle is ranked #7 in best global universities (between columbia and cambridge)  and ranked around the #20s for its undergrad engineering school. i'm in state for udub and i think i have a solid chance of getting in since it's one of my safeties, but i never really considered going until i realized how good the resources are here in seattle, considering it's a recruiting hub for many tech companies (amazon, blue origin, google, etc) but what do u guys think?",
