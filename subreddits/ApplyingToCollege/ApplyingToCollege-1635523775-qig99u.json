  "text": "I think imma get into Stanford\u2014I have the universe blessing my app.\n\n\u2026\n\nLast week, I was out walking when I found a penny on the ground. I picked it up subconsciously and flipped it while I was thinking about my Stanford app. As I was thinking to myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to get in,\u201d the penny landed heads up in my palm.\n\nThe next day, I thought, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if I flipped this same penny again and got a heads again while thinking about my Stanford app?\u201d So I flipped it, and\u2014lo and behold\u2014Abe Lincoln was giving me a sideways stare.\n\nSo, I kinda made this part of my morning routine. It\u2019s been 9 days in a row now I\u2019ve been doing this. It\u2019s the same thing every day: I flip the penny and get a heads while thinking about getting into Stanford.\n\nI\u2019m stoked, since there\u2019s a 0.2% chance of getting 9 heads in a row, and Stanford has a 3.5ish% acceptance rate. Is this a likely letter from the universe?\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m losing my fucking mind out of stress and desperation.",
