After you get a job, take turns going into work. You'll work like 2.5 days a week on average if you take turns. In the process, try to be gods among your peers at the work you do until you are earning an average salary of at least 2 people. You can spend all of that free time investing, learning new languages, and getting buff as fuck at the gym. \n\n\nBut one of you has to fake their death or make sure no one from your family and friends circle intertwine with your colleagues. \n\nFor reals though, good luck on getting into the same college as your twin.",

I didn\u2019t get into the university I was expecting and hoped for in the UK back in 2000 and was heartbroken about it. I was going to do retakes and stuff but thought I may as well see what my alternatives were. When I looked into things I managed to get into a place doing a course that now looking back was the best I could have possibly hoped for and I can\u2019t imagine how my life would have been if I had got that first place on a course. Be philosophical about it, but also be strategic. What are your options now, maybe striking out on your own will make a person of you that you cannot anticipate yet and really allow you to develop yourself. Don\u2019t be upset or disappointed, be excited, what is this new unexpected life that has opened up in front of you?",

Going to a different high school than my sister actually made us closer and we really developed as individuals. Going to a different school; our personalities worked better together, we got to each explore our interests independently,  our own opportunities (like internships, ECs, clubs, etc) separately while we still had lots of interests in common. Who knows where you\u2019ll end up, but I\u2019m sure that you will flourish on your own and have the chance to explore whatever opportunities come your way!! Wishing you luck!!",

With ivies especially I don\u2019t think they care if you\u2019re twins. We\u2019ve all seen how horrible the admissions process is. But I know how you feel being a twin having your sister get something that you don\u2019t, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll end up somewhere great!!",
