  "title:": "Question about ECs",
  "text": "Reading through this subreddit I've gathered that ECs are important for getting into your dream college. Now, I don't live in the US and I'm 90% it's not the same in my country, but do they have to be school clubs? Does EC even stand for extracurricular like I've always assumed? Where I live schools don't even really have clubs like that, or maybe I've understood the concept of those clubs wrong. \n\nNow, I've played instruments and in an Amateur Orchestra and bands entirely outside of school a lot, would that even matter if I applied to an American college (those seem to be the ones that matter in this subreddit)? I've played sports outside of school, but I was never any good at them (I for exampel have played some table tennis tournaments you just need a license for), but I lose most od the time. Would that be something worth mentioning?\n\nHere were I live you can't found clubs at your school, and all in-school activities that you can do are led and organized by a teacher, so it'd be kinda hard to make an in-school-based fundraiser to cure cancer (great example, I know). Would that be something I would need? What extracurricular are things that colleges would want to see? And do I have to be so good at them that I can/have won tournaments for them to have any worth?\n\n  \nSorry for the many questions/rant. America and their school system is just confusing for me.",

      "text": "Hey fellow international here.\nSo, in the common app put in the extracurriculars that you have enjoyed doing. Obviously it's better if you have some awards to show but if you represented the school team or even were in top 10 in a tournament, that would be pretty noteworthy.\nI'd advice you to keep some extracurricualrs related to your major( depends on your major) and others to your hobbies.",
