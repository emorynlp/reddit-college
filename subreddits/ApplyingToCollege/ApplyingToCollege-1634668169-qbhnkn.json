I have a 2.38 UW (2.64 weighted according to one of those gpa websites \ud83d\ude0e) with a projected 1300 SAT (taking in November and December) after a solid freshman year then developing severe depression and social anxiety that ended up requiring the use of medication sophomore and junior year before I was finally able to overcome it (as well as someone can overcome depression) late in the 2nd semester of last year. Therefore, I have no safety (other than CC, which in all likelihood I will probably end up at) and my \u201ctargets\u201d have the same odds as a normal person\u2019s reaches. For these reasons, I decided I\u2019d make full use of my common app and coalition along with a few school specific apps just to see what happens. \n\nHoping for like 4-5 acceptances so I can visit some schools in March/April but we will see. Can share my school list if there\u2019s any lower gpa business majors trying to find some new places but this is already way too long lol",
