  "title:": "Recommendation Letter Enquiry",
  "text": "If I am aware, I need 2 letter of recommendations from my school teachers and 1 from counselor.  \n\n\nMy query is, are these letters that should be written/printed and signed by the referees?   \nOr will these need to be typed into the Common College App, like it is done in UK where the referee simply writes their statements in an online portal page, after said referee is chosen as a referee ?  \n\n\nBecause depending on this, I will either ask my school teachers to either write their recommendation letters and sign it, then send scanned copies of these to the Common College App **or** I will ask them to expect Common College App to contact them, to upload their recommendation letters personally, as it is done in the UK.  \n\n\nThank you all in advance!!!",
