You can certainly reach out to colleges and explain the situation, but unfortunately the general policy is that documents can't come directly from the student (because we have no way of verifying whether they are official documents). But an admission officer might be able to reach out to your counselor and request the documents (that might not work, but it could be worth a shot).",
