  "text": "WARNING LONG POST BUT READING DOES GIVE CONTEXT TO THE QUESTION\n\nHello all, \nSo a little background: I graduated HS in 2018 and went straight to college because I had a bunch of credits from college programs in HS and it would only have taken me 5 semesters to finish and I just wanted to get it done. I barely slid through high school, constantly waiting to the last minute to get my grades up, the only reason I was able to get into the caliber of university I did was because of the college credit program that I completed. \n\nFirst semester went pretty well with my motivation only giving out right at the end and ending up with a D in one class but As and Bs in all the others.  But then second semester rolled around. I fell into the worst depression of my life. I would stay up all night in my dorm just staring at my homework, get none of it done because it seemed pointless, and then not be able to function the next day for classes due to lack of sleep. I lost all sense of time as the days just bled together and the withdrawal date passed by. I was humiliated, there was no way my parents could know I messed up that quickly (don\u2019t worry I\u2019ve been to therapy I know that thinking is wrong). So I told them that I needed to take a semester off to \u201cfigure out if I was in the right major\u201d. My parents agreed as long as I was doing something and not just sitting around. I felt so ashamed that I simply left the school after my second semester and didn\u2019t apply for classes the next semester without giving notice to the school. \n\nThe next 2 years I spent working at different places until I started working as a Paraprofessional at a middle school and it ignited a passion in me and i knew that I had to go back to school to get a degree in teaching special Ed. I had started therapy and new medication so I thought I was ready to try again. I applied to my local community college in order to finish up my generals and give myself a good transcript to reapply to my original college. Well I applied and started classes and got pretty far into it doing well until I got overwhelmed and shut down getting completely behind and losing all motivation falling into another depression because it happened again.\n\nSo I have spent the last year and a half seeing specialists and psychologists and we finally came to the conclusion that I have ADHD and chronic depression. Luckily I finally stated the right meds and my life is going in a good direction and I feel like I can focus and actually get things done when I need to. And so now I am looking to go back the right way with the proper preparation and accommodations. \n\nSo we come back to the problem, most of my credits from HS are attached to my bad grades from my first university, but I don\u2019t think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get in if I re-applied because of my bad grades at the community college. Would the easiest thing be to just retake the community college courses and then reapply? I\u2019ve heard of academic records being expunged due to medical reasons and mental health problems with proper documentation and diagnosis. Does anyone know about that ? Im open to any advice.",
