  "text": "I'm applying to schools. I'm assigned-female-at-birth, and all of my IDs still say I'm female. Though, I'd prefer selecting a gender-neutral title (ie. \"Mx\" or \"Other\" as opposed to \"Ms.\" or \"Miss\") in my applications.\n\nOf course, I had to enter in my legal name, which is obviously female, but can I choose a gender neutral title and have it not be an issue? I just don't want my application to be thrown out because I accidentally entered in \"false\" information!\n\nDo titles have *any* sort of legal importance? Any advice would be super appreciated.",
