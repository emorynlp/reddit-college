  "text": "I got into a research program (CCIR) but even with the merit scholarship, I can't afford it. Get into a Cambridge- Oxford Summer school, can't afford it, but still am not offered a scholarship. The opportunities cost, and I am out openings and money, I want to cry. I feel like Americans have such a flow of opportunities, and then there's my country where even rivers die early. STEM competitions cost, internships are for undergrads strictly, and even my school doesn't have the will to let me start a robotics club (much needed), it's all a big dead end.",

      "text": "Most American students are not doing fancy research programs or competitions either. Don't worry, they are not expected.\n\nOften overlooked: a summer job, a normal teen one. Shows responsibility, provides exposure to the real world, and the extra cash is extremely useful.",
