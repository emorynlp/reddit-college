But a small part of it was also because I was tired of online school, time difference had me going to school from 12am-6am for a whole year!! And yes I did! I ended up committing to UC Berkeley and they approved my gap year so if anything I'll most likely be going there :))",

I used to get bad Fomo from seeing all my friends in college while I wasn't. What I did later was to keep myself as busy as I could. I started reading (one in a million years), meeting new people online, take your time OFF Social media!!!(when you need to), working and other things that made me feel productive.

      "text": "Obligatory \"what did you do during gap year?\", but more importantly, was it worth it for you? \n\nI know a few people who took a gap year, and the reasons were diverse. Some took it because they were really intent on going to a specific school (that they got rejected from) and so they wanted to reapply with their better final IB scores. Some others took it simply because they didn't feel like going to college so fast, so they just had fun. A little less traveling bc most countries had 2-week quarantines, but fun nonetheless. Overall though, both types said it was worth it. wbu?",

          "text": "Since I'm halfway through my gap year, I feel like I still have so many more things to experience. Although at the beginning I feel like I got scammed by taking a whole year off, because I always saw how everyone posting about their gap journey on yt was all positive and perfect ...you name it. But my plans were not near as cool as theirs were. \n\nFor now, I'll say it's worth it, because I really learned a lot about independence. I used to be someone who always followed the school agenda, and only got our 2-month summer break like usual, I procrastinate a lot and not very organized(still) so it was tough to start my gap year. I wasted a whole month and half. I'm mainly working right now so I wouldn't say it's very fun but I know I will definitely not regret doing this, because in this process I really learned how to value money and start spending wisely. I feel like I'm much more mature now since I have gotten a short glimpse of the \"real world\" which I know many people experience only after college. I could keep rambling on and on about this but best to keep it short. If you have more questions feel free to ask!",
