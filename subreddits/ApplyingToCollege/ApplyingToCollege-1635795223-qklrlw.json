      "text": "Pretty obvious advice, but I think it's worth mentioning:\n\n1. Is the email ID correct, and the invite actually sent? (I mean it is not at a draft stage or something)\n2. Ask your teacher to search their entire email. This should mean going through spam, entering \"coalition\" (maybe even check words like \"invite\"?) in the search bar, and looking at the \"All mail\" or \"Bulk mail\" folders/labels.\n\nBeyond that, this sounds like something Coalition's support team should handle.",
