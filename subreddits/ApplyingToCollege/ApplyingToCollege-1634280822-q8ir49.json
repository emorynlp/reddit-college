  "text": "Hi, I was wondering whether student government should be entered only once on the common app/ UC application activities section. I have been a part of it for most of high school, and I don\u2019t want to take up space listing all my positions under 1 entry rather than demonstrating impact. However, I want to show my commitment throughout the last 3 years. Any advice?",
