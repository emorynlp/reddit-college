      "text": "I seriously recommend that you do some googling and research yourself before you begin the process. The answers to these questions can easily be found on google.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n1) up to you. Regular Decision deadline is usually around beginning of January so you still have time now.\n\n2) Yes. However, you should look into the differences between Early Action, Restrictive Early Action, Early Decision, and Regular Decision.\n\n3) AP is a type of rigorous courses mainly offered in the US. Similar to IB and A-level. If you don\u2019t have it in your country, don\u2019t worry. Colleges just want to see that you\u2019re taking rigorous courses out of the ones your school offers.",
