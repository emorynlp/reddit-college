  "text": "So basically title. Like a day after sending the official AP score report to a top college, I found out I didn't need to and I just needed to self-report scores. On the official score report, I have one 3, which I don't plan on self-reporting. \n\nDo you think the admission's officer has access to the official score send and will notice I didn't include that 3. If they do, do you think they will care? Thanks!",
