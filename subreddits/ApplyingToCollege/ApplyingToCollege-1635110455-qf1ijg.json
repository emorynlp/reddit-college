  "title:": "Can I Apply as a Political Science major and Change it to Computer Science if I get in?",
  "text": "Apparently majors with significantly higher amounts of applicants have a tougher time getting in than others. For example, as an Asian Male, I would probably have an easier time getting in if I applied as a communications major than as a Computer Science major. \n\nI have done Model UN in my freshman year and am doing it again this year so I imagine I have the ec needed to back it up but it seems like it would be difficult to explain the switch from that to computer science.\n\nIf it helps I'm mainy looking at Rutgers because I live in NJ, Penn State and Purdue. I also don't particulary care for computer science, and would not mind actually doing political science but it's incredibly hard to get a work visa on that after I grow out of my parent's visa.",

Changing majors into CS is not permitted.\n\nAt Penn State, I believe CS is in the school of engineering, so you\u2019d need to apply to transfer schools within the university.\n\nRutgers, I believe, has CS in Arts & Sciences so you wouldn\u2018t need to transfer schools\u2026 but I have no idea about process or ease of switching into CS.",
