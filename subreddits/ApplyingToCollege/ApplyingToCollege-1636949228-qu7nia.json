  "title:": "As an international student, is it worth filling out the FAFSA even though I already sent my CSS?",
  "text": "A few days ago I sent my common app applications to a few colleges and got the FAFSA notification.\n\nI\u2019m unsure if I should fill it out as an international student since in the video it asks for things who someone who isn\u2019t from the US, wouldn\u2019t have. \n\nAlso, from the colleges I applied to, all but 1 could be found on the CSS profile.\n\nThe last remaining one is one of my backup universities so I didn\u2019t really mind it that much. \n\nDon\u2019t think this matters but I\u2019m also from South America.",
