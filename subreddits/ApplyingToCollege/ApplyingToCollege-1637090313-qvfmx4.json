Someone became the first person to step on Mars? THAT'S ME!\n\nGotta unlock all the 'programmed' achievements in this mission of life and then head to the next. I better not waste any moment sobbing for not getting anything prestige in this one, for I AM everyone else out there and **all your achievements are mine.**\n\nJUST GOTTA WAIT and ENJOY this one.\n\nBetter not waste it!\n\n(For those who don't know what the shoot I am talking about, I am referring to the EGG by Andy Weir)",
