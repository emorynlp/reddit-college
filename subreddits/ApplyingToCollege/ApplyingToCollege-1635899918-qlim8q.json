  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore, and I\u2019m aiming to get into a good college, but I\u2019m not happy with some of my current grades, and it\u2019s stressing me out.\n\nLast year (freshman year), I got all As, but I was all online and classes were less rigorous and time consuming. \n\nThis year, I\u2019m taking 2 APs, 3 honors courses, and Spanish. I have high As in honors chem, pre calculus, and Spanish, but I\u2019m not happy with the rest of my classes. I have an 88 in AP Physics (hoping to get that up with a big test we have), and 89 in English (also hoping to get that up to an A with a test), and an 87 in AP world (which could go up to an 89 depending on how I did on an essay). The quarter ends this week, and I hate having so many Bs.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m about to sound like that person, but do you think admission officers will be very harsh about something like this when I apply to college since students are having to adjust to a new learning environment? Coming from online school to being in the building and being involved with activities and stuff has been drastic and stressful. I\u2019ve had a lot of mental health issues so far because of this. I\u2019d just hate for colleges to see this slight dip in my grades as me slacking off as opposed to me just struggling to adjust to everything.",
