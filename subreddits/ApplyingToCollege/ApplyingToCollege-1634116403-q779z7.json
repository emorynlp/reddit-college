First sucky grade too ;/ n e ways\u2026so I\u2019ve been goofing around a lot\u2026.and totally explain your situation in the application AND get your counselor to explain in their recommendation. You need to sit down and talk with your counselor. \n\nMaybe negotiate w a counselor or that teacher. \u201cI\u2019m in my senior year. I got a D. Please, if I show improvements, can my grade be bumped up.\u201d\n\nFor that explanation on your application though\u2026it\u2019s not the \u201cbest\u201d (I think) to blame the situation on someone else. Maybe own up to what happened-throw in some exaggeration to show that you had reasons for that grade. \n\nI mean, I haven\u2019t applied to colleges yet- still junior, but if you can explain in the app., explain how you took charge to improve. They can see your grade improve, but tell them that you improved!",
