  "title:": "Will the amount of people in my area applying for a specific college affect my chances of admission",
  "text": "Seeing as some colleges use location as a way to measure which students they pick, will I be outcast simply because someone with a better resume from my highschool applies as well? This may seem like a dumb question, but a friend and I are applying to the same college with roughly a 15% acceptance rate (around 20% for ED) and although we have very similar GPA and possibly similar test scores, they are involved a bit more than I am. I am part of 5 clubs  but most aren't too note worthy, while my friend is in student council and a sport. Of course, GPA, test scores, and extracurriculars aren't all that make up an application, but they are a big chunk. Of course, I hope they get in, but simply because an admission rep will see we are from the same school, and they may seem like an objectively better candidate than I, will they reject me because they don't want 2 people from the same school? Again, this may just be a ridiculous assumption and I am just overthinking it, but aside from having a higher unweighted GPA, they are a better candidate which may put me in the dust for this college. Totally bet this is different for each university, but just wanted to see if it is common practice. Thanks!",

      "text": "Colleges usually do not directly compare you to your classmates right next to each other. But you and your classmates will be considered in the same context, so in that sense, if one person has clearly taken advantage of the high school\u2019s opportunities while another one hasn\u2019t, it naturally won\u2019t look very good for the latter person. But colleges don\u2019t have quotas on the number of students accepted per high school, so if both applicants are competitive and have taken advantage of their opportunities, there\u2019s no reason a college wouldn\u2019t accept multiple students from one high school.",
