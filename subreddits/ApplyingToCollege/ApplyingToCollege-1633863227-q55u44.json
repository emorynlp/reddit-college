  "text": "The hard truth is that most of you will get rejected by your top choice t20 school because all you guys focus on is stats. Literally every post in this sub is about someone who thinks the world is over because they got a B. Whenever somebody asks what their chances are to get into a t20 they list a shit load of stats. Nobody cares about your stats... 60 thousand other people have the SAME stats as you and even better \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fMost of you get rejected from t20s because you guys are uninteresting robots who just gets 4.0s.... no passion for anything... no personality. Try holding a conversation with somebody with a 4.0 obsessed person in this sub... the conversation would be lacking.. uninteresting and boring. Even in your college essays.... all u guys talk about is your accomplishments. Bro u LISTED ur accomplishments already they don\u2019t need to hear you brag about them anymore... colleges want to see the real you, some personality. Not a robot who gets 4.0s and brags about their accomplishments in essays. What are colleges getting to know about you by you writing a WHOLE essay about your awards and research? Nothing \u2728\u2728\u2728",

      "text": "That's an interesting thought, but you're assuming that everyone who gets a 4.0 is automatically a \"robot\" without any kind of passion... One of the most important factors of a college application is usually your GPA, seen in the context of your course rigor - and given the competitive nature of admissions at the topmost schools, this is still a very important factor... But there is a reason why these schools follow holistic admissions - they look at your GPA for sure, but they also look at every other part of your application to get a complete picture of you as an applicant.",
