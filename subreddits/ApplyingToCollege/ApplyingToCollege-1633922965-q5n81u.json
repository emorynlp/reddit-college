  "text": "This Friday, a representative from Princeton will call my school virtually for an information session personalised to my school. I will attend, along with a few other students who want to go to Princeton, so I'm preparing for the call. According to a friend who did a call with another college last week, we will have the opportunity to personally ask questions. My guidance counsellor told me that the Princeton representative will very likely be my interviewer and application reader because representsrives are chosen by region, so I want to give a good first impression.\n\nI want to look good. I want to be remembered on the day of my interview. I will shave the night before (just in case my mask comes off, but I don't think I'll be taking off my mask), but now comes the more important preparation. What kind of question will show interest in a college like Princeton? (By the way, if you're a Princeton interviewer, please tell me what you like to hear!) No matter what, I know I want to go to Princeton if I get accepted. I just don't know how to show that to the video caller. Please help.",
