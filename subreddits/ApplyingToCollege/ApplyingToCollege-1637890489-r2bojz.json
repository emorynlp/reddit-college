  "text": "Hi all, so my ED school was originally supposed to come out on December 15th or by the 15th but about a week ago, I got an email from them. It seemed like the normal \"Your app is complete\" email but in the email, they said that we will instead get our decisions in \"early December.\" I figure it means nothing but I wanted others' thoughts because I always thought schools stuck with deadlines. Thanks so much!",

But if they put a specific date, they can certainly change it with new data.",
