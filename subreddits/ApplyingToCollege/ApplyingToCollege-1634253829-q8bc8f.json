  "text": "(Currently a junior; throughout this post I'll be referring to the classes I want to take/drop **next year)** \n\nI've been taking Spanish since 6th grade and what is basically a film class since my freshman year. I don't particularly enjoy either class. I would need to drop both film and Spanish in order to fit a bunch of classes that I want to take (some combination of anatomy & physiology, AP Biology, AP Psychology, and/or AP Chemistry) into my schedule. Does it look bad to colleges if I drop a class I've been taking for so long? I'm not too worried about dropping Spanish- it seems that lots of people drop their language class after their junior year- but I'm a bit worried that dropping film, which I've \"committed\" to, will be an issue. If it matters, I plan on majoring in a science field (probably biology?)",
