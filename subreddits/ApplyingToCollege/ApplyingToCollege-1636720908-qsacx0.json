  "text": "Okay, so I had a question. I'm from India, and I checked their website which says this:\n\n>**Year XII** qualification, studied with either the CBSE (All-India SSC) or CISCE (ISC) boards, with the following grades:  \n>  \n>For courses requiring A\\*A\\*A:  \n>  \n>For  the CBSE board, we are aware that students will not know their grades  at the point when they are applying. As an indication, therefore, we  will be looking for marks of 91 or above for A1 and 81 to 90 for A2.\n\nHowever, a friend mentioned that you still have to fill in the marks of your 9-11 grades in the form for reference. \n\nHere's what they said:\n\n>Those are the requirements for your boards but the UCAS requires you to fill out your other grades as well.\n\nI'm a bit confused now, so I'd appreciate any help.\n\nTIA.",

If you did state board in class 10 but are doing CBSE/ISC in class 12, then it doesn\u2019t really matter much. However, score as high as you can in your 10th state boards because Oxford puts a decently high emphasis on GCSEs/10th grade marks (the emphasis depends on the course). However, since it\u2019s the state board, you probably want to be aiming for 96+",
