  "text": "Last year, I was a senior and considered attending UChicago. My parents took me to visit all of my top choices because they wanted me to see if I\u2019d want to spend four years there, and they also wanted to see if the universities were in good areas. My parents told me they didn\u2019t want me to go to school in an area where I wouldn\u2019t be safe walking around campus, let alone off-campus. They did not want me to attend UChicago because it is not in a safe area whatsoever. This was obvious as soon as we got out of the car. My parents were very uncomfortable with me walking around Hyde Park.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m very glad I chose a school where I\u2019m comfortable walking around the city whenever I want. I can leave campus freely. I don\u2019t have to hide inside my school walls all the time. There\u2019s a nice, safe city where I can shop and eat and explore. \n\nThree students have been murdered at UChicago this year alone. The students are protesting, but certain people are still trying to pretend it\u2019s a safe area for young college students to be. The talk on the UChicago subreddit clearly shows that most students realize they\u2019re in a terrible area, and it clearly shows that some people are deliberately trying to hide this reality. Acting like it\u2019s no big deal that kids are dying and getting shot, victim-blaming, denying that Hyde Park is dangerous.\n\nIf you visit campuses or talk to students, it\u2019s usually clear which ones are safe. Make sure to consider where your dream schools are located. Some students are okay with never leaving campus and spending all their time on campus property for four years, and others prefer an off-campus area that is safe to venture out into.",

      "text": "And just to add on to that... once you start to narrow down schools, do some ***serious*** research on what the area around it is *currently* and *actually* like.\n\nThe school I go to has a bad reputation of being in a super unsafe area\u2014but that mostly has to do with 20 year old stereotypes (from when it was, legitimately, unsafe). At the same time, there are definitely some schools I considered that are in legitimately unsafe areas, yet nobody really thinks about that when deciding on a college. \n\nAs with all things in the college process, just do your damn research. You're probably going to be spending 4+ years at this school. You're going to want to venture out into the surrounding area, so take the time to understand what it's like.",
