  "text": "So according to most sites an A+ and A is a 4.0 uw and an A- is a 3.7. My school is really harsh w corrections so we usually score in high 70s to mid 80s. They give an A+ for 90-100%, A for 80-90% and A- for 70-80% in our reports. Will colleges look at the grade when they compute my gpa or go off the percentage? I\u2019m an international student btw",
