  "text": "Hi everyone! \n\nI want to ask that can I submit a separate letter of explanation for my declining GPA to the Admission Committee (via email or applicant portal)? I cannot write it on the Additional Information because I spent this space on more valuable information. Also, because the reason was quite personal, I did not tell my counselor, and she obviously did not know my special circumstances. Therefore, I intend to submit a letter on my own. Is it sound right?\n\nThank you for all your help!",
