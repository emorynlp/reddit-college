  "text": "Hi I\u2019m writing my college essay about my closest friend and my relationship with him and how he has impacted me. He told me that he is ok with me mentioning him in my essay but he wants me to change his name from \u201cJackson\u201d to \u201cKevin\u201d so he can stay anonymous. Would it be ok for me to do this??",
