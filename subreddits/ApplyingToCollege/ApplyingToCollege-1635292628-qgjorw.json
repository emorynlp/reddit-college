          "text": "You realize how big those schools are, right? If 10% of your hs class went to tech, let\u2019s say that\u2019s 50 kids. There are 30,000 students at tech, so thats less than 1 student from your school per every 500 kids. It\u2019s just very easy to meet a ton of new people if you want. Majors at a large state school are also a huge group of people, and if you are a different year than you will likely be taking different classes and would be unlikely to run into each other",

              "text": "So my grandfather graduated from Duke sometime in the 70s. He has donated something like 50,000 dollars to Duke over the course of the past few decades and is considered an \"iron duke\".  Anyways, 2 summers ago he had to have surgery to get a tumor removed and he did it at Duke's hospital. However, he developed a very nasty infection while in the hospital because they did not do a good job keeping where they operated on him sanitary. Because this was at the height of covid, he wasn't allowed visitors in the hospital at all so his mental health took a big hit. He low key lost the will to live and he called my dad to tell him goodbye a few nights in case he didn't make it. Duke then refused to send any type of mental health professional to see him, and when he was discharged they refused to send a nurse over to help with his bandages so my dad had to hire a private company to do it. My dad was so pissed about it that he is currently suing Duke and he told me I could not apply to college there because he would not pay my tuition. I don't qualify for financial aid and I'm not interested in taking out student loans so I just decided it wasn't worth it to apply to a school where I probably wouldn't get in.",
