  "title:": "Capitalized on Russian stereotypes to write my 'cultural background' essay",
  "text": "I would love to hear your honest feedback!  I tried really hard and I'm really proud of the result!\n\nThe essay:\n\nMost people who know me would say that I was born in a wealthy American suburb.  However, dear Admissions Officer, this is a lie born from cultural stereotypes and also the information on my birth certificate.  Just between you and me and the five people I will ask to edit this essay, I was actually born in the middle of a Cold War battlefield in Russia.  I walked to school every day through a snowstorm, and the only thing that kept me warm was the vodka cereal I ate in the morning.\n\nMy experiences in my Russian elementary school are starkly different from my time spent in an American high school.  For example, in Russia we still use chalkboards instead of the American Smartboards, and my teacher was a bear.  Despite this, I managed to learn a variety of indispensable life skills, such as how to not get depressed after reading Russian literature and how to organize the workers to overthrow the ruling class.  Some of my favorite in-school activities included learning how to shoot a rifle, doing math, and meddling in American election results.",
