  "text": "Hi guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a quick question about the Honors section. I have won multiple awards over the course of my high school but its about the same thing. To explain this, let's say there's a journalism competition. I've won 3rd in 9th grade, 2nd in 10th Grade, and 1st in 11th Grade. \n\nIn order to save another slot of honors, can i possibly stack them in the Title section? By stacking, I mean like formatting the Title as:\n\nJounalism Competiton: 3rd in 9th Grade, 2nd in 10th Grade, and 1st in 11th Grade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan I do that?\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nHere are my thoughts on the matter: ditch the 3rd and 2nd place. AO's spend on average 5-10 min per app. If I was an AO reading through an app, I would want to see immediately \" 'blank' Journalism Competition: 1st.\" and specify the year. Of course, your way works perfectly as well since it shows progression!",
