  "text": "I started making videos about 10 months ago and I have 6,500 subscribes and I have one video with 940K views, 4 videos with over 200K views, and 2 videos with over 100K views.  I truly enjoy coming up with ideas, making and editing the videos and I want to write about it in the prompt that talks about your creative side.  And do you think its ok to put the link at the end of the essay?",

Definitely talk about it, because it is a great accomplishment! UC schools get hundreds of thousands of applicants, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d appreciate a YouTube link. Maybe add it to your list of honors/activities and include more information there.",
