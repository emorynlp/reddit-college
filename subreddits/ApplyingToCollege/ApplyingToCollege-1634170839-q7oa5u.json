      "text": "Yes and no. I\u2019ve heard stories of certain schools who tend to get N number of students into Y college yearly. Everyone sweats whether they\u2019re in the top N. In reality these numbers aren\u2019t set in stone (they increased at my HS, I know a private school where these numbers halved). \n\nDon\u2019t forget: There can be a luck factor among highly qualified applicants. Maybe college C needs a certain number of students likely to participate in X and one of your ECs is X. Also, don\u2019t underestimate the power of incredible essays to give yourself a potential edge over other highly qualified applicants.",

      "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a high school college counselor. I can tell you that we provide colleges with what\u2019s called a school report. It lays out what courses are available at your school. What colleges do is they compare your transcript to what is on the school report.\n\nIn other words, if you took more difficult courses or showed signs of growth in your transcript schools will notice that. \n\nAdditionally, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see if the college you\u2019re considering offers interviews to prospective students.",
