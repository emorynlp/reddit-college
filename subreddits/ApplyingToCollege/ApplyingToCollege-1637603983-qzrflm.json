  "text": "Hi, I'm an international and have doubts about claiming credits for A level. I want to pursue math major. \n\nCan I claim credits for all subjects like physics and chemistry too or can I claim only for math? \n\nP.S. : As an international I'll not be entitled for any aid. So was hoping to brings costs down if I get to claim 25-30 credits. I did post in few uni subreddits too. But I couldn't understand certain terminology so thought of asking here too hoping there could be some folks who can help me understand. \n\nThanks in advance.",
