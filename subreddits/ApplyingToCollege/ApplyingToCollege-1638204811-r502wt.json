  "text": "Hello guys, I am currently in my first junior semester and doing research about where to do my masters degree and what is important for the application process. I would prefer to apply through ED/EA and therefore plan to take the GMAT next summer before my first senior semester. Now I saw that most schools already accepted students into undergraduate programs for the 2025 classes. I am wondering when the ED/EA process opens up for graduates for the 2025 class. Also, is there any test needed other than the GMAT for business graduate programs? And does anybody approximately know how much each out of  GPA, GMAT, work experience/athlete experience and letters account for in the likelihood to get accepted?\n\nThank you for your time guys and I appreciate every single reply!\n\nPS: If you have any numbers concerning acceptance rates through ED/EA for graduate programs, I'd be happy if you shared since I can only find acceptance rates through ED/EA for undergraduate programs for most schools.",
