  "text": "I submitted my UC Application today and I looked over it afterwards. I realized that for my \"Superintendent's Honor Roll\" activity, I forgot to list the \"Award Requirements\" and \"What you did to earn this award\" portion; I listed \"come back to\" as a placeholder, but never came back to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also forgot to list one activity meaningful to me (although I did mention it in one of my essays).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do?? All the help is appreciated.",
