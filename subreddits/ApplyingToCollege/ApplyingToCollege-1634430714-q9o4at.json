  "text": "So I\u2019m apply to an honors program for one of my schools and one of the supplements asks about describing leadership experiences. I actually own and run a small business but it\u2019s just me and my dad, there are no other employees. Is it possible to write about leadership in this scenario or should I just go with something else? How should I go about this?\n\nP.S. this post is not to brag. I just want some general insight",
