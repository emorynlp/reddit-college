  "text": "I had plans to submit it after I was done with the Honors College essay, but have had the rest of the app completed since October. I am able to apply later on their website for this. Overall, I\u2019m worried about having lower chances into the school if I don\u2019t submit soon due to the influx of applicants this year.",
