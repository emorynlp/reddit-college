  "text": "I know that being first gen gives you a boost in college admissions, and I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m first gen or not.\n\nMy grandfather on my dad\u2019s side got a degree from Columbia but my dad dropped out of Columbia to inherit my grandfathers business, never getting the degree. My mom didn\u2019t go to college. \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering - am I first gen considering both my parents don\u2019t have a college education?",

But there is also no box on the application that says \" Check here if you are first gen.' You fill in your parents' education and the school does with it what it chooses.\n\nAny admissions advantage for first gen is usually tied in with low income whose parents often have no experience guiding their kids through the admissions process. Having a parent that attended Columbia and inherited a business does not scream disadvantaged.",
