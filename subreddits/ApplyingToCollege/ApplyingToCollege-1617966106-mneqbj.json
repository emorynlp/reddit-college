  "title:": "I got into Stanford. I'm turning them down to lower their yield rate. Not even joking.",
  "text": "Four months ago: December 1st, 2020 at 12:48 AM. I had just finished my UC applications and was talking to friends about which colleges I would be applying to via the Common App. \n\nI decided that night that I would do something no sane overworked 17 year old should, [I would apply to Stanford with zero intention of attending if I was to be accepted.](https://imgur.com/a/VX4rGz4) \n\nWhile I had considered Stanford in the past, I had concluded after months of research and speaking with students at both universities that for my major, Political Science, Stanford was only a little better than UC Berkeley academically, and for my other passion of Public Policy, Stanford was significantly worse. This alongside organizing opportunities I had at Berkeley, but not Stanford, and the difference in culture, alongside the elitism and snobbery I had witnessed first hand at Stanford overnight programs I attended, made Stanford very undesirable for me in comparison to UC Berkeley. \n\nBut more than any of that, I saw an injustice in the college application system: the yield rates were too damn high, and those elitist fools were gonna pay.\n\nI spent the next month crafting the perfect Stanford application, I needed to get in. I had dozens of friends, teachers, and family members read over my essays. I had a low mid 3.8 GPA, so I had to make up for it somewhere, and I did so with the story I brought to their school. I shared my family\u2019s struggles with homelessness and finances, and how that motivated me to take action, I shared my love for progressivism and experiences organizing, and just as these experiences would help me get into Stanford, they also shaped my hate for elitist institutions, it made me the perfect Trojan Horse. Little did Stanford know: this prole would be lowering their yield rate. \n\nViva la Revolution!\n\n--\n\n\nTwo days ago: April 7th, 2021 at 4:02 PM. I checked my Stanford portal. [I got in.](https://imgur.com/21SGSF9)\n\nIt was genuinely unexpected, I had just gotten waitlisted at Princeton the night before, and plenty of universities with much higher acceptance rates had already rejected me. Even more surprisingly, they had given me a full ride in gift aid (although Cal gave me something close). \n\nWith the acceptance came a whirlpool of emotions, did I make the right choice in my plan to turn them down? Would I be ruining my future? Did I deserve to get in? But I was a man on a mission, I would lower their yield rate if it was the last thing I do. \n\nThe next few days, I spent time speaking to friends and loved ones about my acceptance to Stanford, and my plans to turn them down, many people rejected my message, others said I should chase the prestige, but I preferred Cal anyways (go bears!) and silenced the doubters.\n\nAs I write this: my manifesto, I have not yet sent my rejection letter to Stanford, but by the time I publish this, [unless they accept my terms,](https://imgur.com/a/vm2HzkU) I will have committed to Cal (the better school). \n\nTLDR: I didn\u2019t want my mascot to be [a fucking tree.](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sjm-stantree-1022-06.jpg?w=442)\n\n\n(All the hyperbole in this post aside it was a thought-out decision that I spent months going through with my immediate family and counselors. For 98% of people, Stanford is probably a better fit, for my very unique situation and needs, Cal is a better fit. Don't worry in the comments, I'm only a little insane.)",

The students that come out of Berkley on average aren\u2019t as good as the students from elite schools like Harvard, Stanford, etc.   Berkley is easier to get into than the elite schools, so the level of talent at Berkley is not as high on average.  People then equate the school to being worse than the elite schools since their experience is berkeley students are not as talented on average.",

They produce award winners because they\u2019re elite, and are able to hire elites professors because their grads earn enough money to give back to the institution later in life. \n\nYou, my friend, are more out of your mind than a lobotomy patient on acid if you actually believe the nonsense you\u2019re typing.\n\nSomething tells me you either went to Stanford, got rejected from Berkeley, or both (or have somebody close to you who did) and this is the only coping strategy you\u2019ve found.\n\nI mean keep doing you \u2014 it\u2019s amusing at this point to see how badly your every point is being shot down, but don\u2019t expect this ridiculous conversation to continue.

When I say wide, i mean practically any unicorn or above tech company will have a few berkeley employees who are willing to give you referrals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm CS and idk much about ChemE but if you are set on ChemE and think you are good enough to succeed at either places then choose Berkeley. Princeton doesnt have 20 elements on the periodic table + the amazing chem faculty we do.\n\nif you have talked to current ChemE students that you are close with and they say that they think it's hard to succeed **for you** and if you personally prefer to have your hand held then Princeton is the better option. idk about princeton's program for chem (a quick google search says it's chem program is ranked #135) but youd definitely have more 1-on-1 support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh though u got into berkeley and princeton so i think youd be fine here academically, people overhype the difficulty and blame that on their own lack of studying a lot lol.\n\nJob opportunities at Berkeley are great, i don't think i need to say the obvious but all the data is publicly online, u can see where berkeley chem grads go with a google search",

Take a bit of advice from someone who went through this process a long time ago and interviews prospective students as an alum (though not of Stanford). Schools understand you may not consider them a good fit and aren't offended or hurt by it. Consider only your own future when you make your decision. If you really love UCB, then great. However, the reputation of elite schools isn't just among HS students. It pervades adulthood and your resume will get at least a detailed glance by just having Stanford on it.",

      "text": "While its clear you have thought about this, this seems like something you may end up regretting, esp considering its a full ride. Virtually everyone changes majors in college, so picking based on 1 program is a risky idea. Stanford is also obviously more prestigious and that carries over for the rest of your life. Not that Cal isnt, but it certainly isnt at Stanfords level. As others have mentioned, the yield rate is trivial and irrelevant and not a great reason to turn down such an opportunity. Lastly, you hate Stanford bc its elitist? That is never going to change if people like you refuse to go there and I think youd be surprised at how many kids are not from super rich families. \n\nAnyways, the decision is yours and you will prob be fine going to cal...its just a very big decision",

I was facing down the choice between UMich and Stanford, and if I\u2019d gone the other route, I don\u2019t know that the same doors would have been open to me. This is especially true because politics isn\u2019t about what you learn - it\u2019s about your network, and that\u2019s something thats easier to develop at a Harvard or a Stanford or a Yale. Could talk about this all day, but that\u2019s my feelings in a nutshell.",

I've seen so many other underrepresented applicants say the same thing, how they'd get rejected from the Ivies, but Stanford gave them the surprise acceptance. I'm not saying it doesn't favor the wealthy and privileged, of course, but I've heard enough about it to believe that it may be doing that less than the other top schools. It doesn't even have the huge endowment of the older universities, and yet in the case of US students it's \\*unbelievable\\* how much financial aid they receive if they're of low, even middle class income.\n\nMakes me even more sorry for not applying there.

Yea, someone smart enough to get into Stanford is dumb enough to not realise that Stanford is not gonna care one bit about turning them down and that Stanford accepts 2k+ students, of which 18% reject the school, meaning that OP would have a 0.04% effect on their yield rate, LOL! Except even then, it will have 0% effect because Stanford only reports 2 to 3 sig figs. So if the rate is 82.1%, it will still be 82.1%.\n\nYea bro, I bet most kids who end up dropping out of HS have more wisdom and emotional stability than wasting a month crafting the perfect app to a university they were going to reject instead of focusing on other apps, doing school work, relaxing, etc. OP literally said Stanford is a snobby and then proceeds to waste his time applying to Stanford only to act like a snob to them. Then OP says Stanford is an elite university and finds out he got a full ride. Hello irony.\n\nSorry, but the verdict is that this post is insanely fake. One of the fakest A2C posts in history that so many for. I thought it was blatant satire because of the paragraph above, but then OP's tone became serious at the end with the bracketed text, so now it's just fake. I am so disappointed in thia community for falling for this. Sorted by controversial and still couldn't find people questioning this. This might be some weird fetish post by someone who got into Berkeley assuming that part is real. Or maybe it is really good satire.",

It's called a joke; he got accepted into both institutions, can only choose one, and chose to poke fun at Stanford by highlighting a ridiculous reason for declining their offer. **Hundreds** of people on A2C talk about t20s being snobby (often as a joke or shitpost, sometimes seriously) - hell, there's a running gag about St. Anford not even existing, are you taking offense to that as well?

I personally have a lot of friends and people I've worked with in eastbay too, and a few in Palo Alto, and the number and quality of organizations is much better at eastbay than stanford (plus I personally have internships and positions lined up at some of them already). I can't really speak on the amount of grassroots activism in LA though, I don't know many community organizers from there. But tbh if I had gotten into UCLA but not Berkeley, I might've chosen them over Stanford too. I will say Berkeley's Public Policy and Political Science programs are rated significantly higher than UCLAs, but you'd probably be fine at either!",

You never know that if he did not apply another student in very similar situations as he was in may have been accepted (example: if they were looking for a minimum number of people who were qualified but also had a background of financial troubles or other unfortunate situations). Because you never know what could have happened (and who may have been accepted) if OP never applied, imo I believe his application was ill-sighted and was quite immature.\n\n(btw I'm the same person; I just don't have a dedicated reddit account and only make accounts when I want to with a temporary email address.)",

I also don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re struggling with finances but then deny a full ride to a top tier university because apparently settling an imaginary score with a university for reddit points is worth further indebting yourself and your family?? Seems off all around man. Really hope you didn\u2019t send that arrogant email to your admissions officer who literally advocated for you and fought to give you a chance.\n\nEdit: \nPS: just so you know, one person will not even show up as a fraction of a percentage point change for their yield rate.

I know this because my parents do hire people.\n\nI personally feel like you are making the wrong decision, turning down the best university in the world because of stereotypes and because you found that one area is worse, but respect the decision regardless",
