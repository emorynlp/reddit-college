  "text": "So I\u2019ve got my Duke interview tomorrow and I\u2019m wondering when I should enter the zoom. From other resources, most people suggest showing up 30 minutes prior to an in person interview but I don\u2019t know how early to show up for a zoom interview. I don\u2019t want to be in their waiting room for 20+ minutes because I logged in so early because they might still be busy or it might appear as creepy.",
