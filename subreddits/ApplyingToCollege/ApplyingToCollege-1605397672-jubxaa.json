  "text": "There's 5,300 universities in the US.\n\nSome A2Cers get so obsessed with T20s at times, that we forget how good most of the schools we're applying to *really* are.\n\nLike, for example:   \nUNC:  Wall Street Journal Rates them number 33 among all universities; 33/5300 = top 1%  \nUW Seattle: Wall Street Journal has them at number 45 among all universities; 45/5300 = top 1%  \nUC San Diego: Wall Street Journal Rates them number 37 among all universities; 37/5300 = top 1%  \nUT Austin: Wall Street Journal rates them number 61; 61/5300 = top 2%\n\nAnd:  \nUC Riverside: Wall Street Journal Rates them number 183 among all universities; 183/5300 = top 4%  \nASU: Wall Street Journal Rates them number 33 among all universities; 196/5300 = top 4%\n\nLike, god damn, I've seen posts about people being disappointed going to UNC, UW, UT, wherever, and these are LITERALLY in the top 1% in the whole country. \n\nEven schools which are a safety for a lot of us, are solidly in the top 5% in the nation! That's crazy. We're really lucky to be able to apply to colleges, even. If you're in state \"backup\" school is similar to UT, UW, UNC, or wherever, you should be happy if you get into a T20, but you're lucky to have one of the top 1% of schools at your fingertip. Let it sink in, how good that is.",

And even then, the name can only take you so far if all you did at Stanford was go to class with no job or internship. As a California counselor, I can tell you confidently that nobody is trying to name drop UC Riverside or even UC San Diego in most cases.\n\nGo to a school that offers something that excites you, is affordable, and work, volunteer, and intern in the field you want to work in. Do well enough in class, and you'll probably be better off than the kid who went to Yale and didn't do shit outside of school because classes were too hard.",

Refer to my comment from another post for my explanation:\n\n\"People act as if top ranked universities only are there because of their name and us news and world report. Your forgetting how the universities actually got the name that they did and that we are only 17 and not gonna be falling in love with everywhere we are applying.\n\n**We care about these top universities not just because of the name and \"clout\" but because of what comes with the name: prestigious and world-changing research that goes on, access to advanced and specialized courses that are clearly reflected in the strength of the department, the vast alumni network, high access to job and career placement and visibility in the market, emphasis on undergraduate research and internships, being in a class of highly intellectual and motivated peers, just the thought of learning from professors who are doing life changing work, the impressive caliber of the thousands of student organizaitons. There is something in these universities that undoubtedly excite everyone.**\n\nThese are all a general list of items that anyone admitted to these top unvierstiies would be more than capable of and more than glad to take advantage of these opportunities. Yes you can have a clear goal of why by My point is just because you don't have a crystal clear reason or full care to apply and you do value \"clout\" doesn't mean you shouldn't apply. You might seem like valuing \"clout,\" but given the opportunity to attend will bring so much more behind the name of the university that people always forget about\"",

So I think a lot of people see getting into a T20 as the moment they can breathe a sigh of relief in the app process.\n\nIt's hardly necessary, as this post indicates.

I\u2019m not a partier, and I prefer going to a school where we all have a genuine interest in what we\u2019re studying and like working hard. That environment seems a lot easier to find at a top ranking college, as they tend to (from what i see online that is) have smaller party environments and, ofc, simply getting into one requires the kind of drive not everyone has. That being said, I\u2019m just a HS senior, so this is all perception, which is why rankings don\u2019t actually factor v much into my own college list :\u2019)",

But, I also think that when you're comparing places like UT Austin or UW Seattle vs, say, Harvard or Stanford you're going to have great professors and a good atmosphere at either of these places. At that point, the *biggest* difference is brand. Students who scored a 30 on the ACT (average on the first 2), aren't really much less motivated than people who scored like a 33. My state school is University of Nevada (Reno and Las Vegas), those are fine schools, but like you, I crave a different environment. But, I think i'd get that just as much at UNC or UW or UT as I would at an ivy. \n\nBut, yeah, I agree with you.

The Harvard rejects on this sub will SLAY at their safeties so it\u2019s all a lot of whining for nothing. The biggest issue is that society perceives going to Harvard as an inherently good thing. But intelligence and character are very different things, and \u201csmart\u201d people can do very bad things. I wouldn\u2019t consider Jared Kushner to be a man of character, but there he is with his AB degree that he got \u201ccompletely on his merits.\u201d",

The best school I can get into in my country for my major (neuroscience) is somewhere around #600 and a week or so ago I got accepted into a school that ranks #23 in the world for neuroscience. I cannot even express how glad I am for this opportunity and for my parents to allow me to attend a prestigious university as this. I have no words TBH to express my gratitude to everyone that has helped me on this journey. \n\nEveryone that is reading please take a moment to reflect on how good your life is and just realize there are millions of people who'd do anything to be in your position.\n\nHave a great day everyone!",
