  "text": "I love robotics but could only recently join the club in my junior year because my schedule was full the year before. I'll only have 2 years to do the club and I wont have any leadership positions or anything. Should I just stick with what I have and/or create new clubs and try to impove upon those instead of picking up a new club that wont look good on a resume",

      "text": "You should do the clubs that are interesting and meaningful to you. \n\nHere\u2019s what MIT Admissions says about extracurricular activities:\n\nSome students feel so much pressure to get into the \u201cright\u201d college that they want to make sure they do everything right\u2014down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what\u2019s right for you\u2014not what you think is right for us.\n\nChoose your activities\u00a0because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they\u2019ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don\u2019t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy\u2014whether it feels right for you.\n\nCollege is not a costume party; you\u2019re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you\u2019ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you\u2019re ready to try.\u201d \n\nI recently made a post about ECs.
