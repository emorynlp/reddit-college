      "text": "Hey! I'm a freshman at Babson and I'm honestly loving it. The 3 biggest things about Babson (that may be good or bad for you depends on what your preference is) are: \n\n1. Babson's a business school - so if you're not sure if you want to take business or not, better go somewhere else\n2. It's pretty small - most students live on campus and we walk everywhere. and you're going to see the same people over and over lmao\n3. It's a bit far away from Boston - (and the uber's expensive lmao) but if you're looking for something that's peaceful and quiet and far away from the crowd, I think you're going to love Babson",
