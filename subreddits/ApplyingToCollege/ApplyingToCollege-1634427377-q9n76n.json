  "text": "Hello kind a2c redditors. \n\nI have a bit of a dilemma and I just wanted to understand how my thought process should be when approaching this. \n\nSo basically, CMU is near the top of my list of colleges, but not all the way at the top. MIT, Princeton, and Cornell are above on my list. As a result, I would definitely EA to MIT (as this is my dream #1 college), but I wasn't sure wether or not to ED to CMU. \n\nTo these types of questions, everyone on this sub says that you should only ED to your #1 favorite. However, in my case, I don't want to end up getting rejected from the other schools and also CMU if I do not ED CMU (not sure how big of a difference ED makes for CMU for CS). On the other hand, I also do not want to ED CMU and get in, knowing that I may have gotten into a school that was higher on my list. \n\nWhat I'm trying to ask is: is it a wise move for one to understand one's actual likelihood of getting into their dream colleges by purposefully choosing to ED to a less selective school that is near the top of their college list? This way their chances at a school that they could maybe get into (CMU in my case) are a lot better.\n\n I am currently a junior so I honestly do not know why I am stressing about this now.",

          "text": "Not sure about cmu, but the reason ED exists is because of the guarantee that if a student is accepted, they will attend. This is seen as the \u201cultimate\u201d form of demonstrated interest, and this would compel colleges to bag qualified yet maybe not the most exceptional candidates for this guarantee. This tends to increase acceptance rates for ED. For example, off the top of my head, Cornell\u2019s ED round has an ~25% acceptance rate whereas its RD round has a ~5% acceptance rate.",

              "text": "Yes, that\u2019s the conventional wisdom.\n\nBut then you need to ask yourself why highly selective schools would accept less than the most qualified applicants in any round.  With top schools getting 60k applications for like 1,600 spots there\u2019s no shortage of highly-qualified applicants\u2026 so no reason to accept a student who needs \u201can ED boost\u201d in order to get accepted simply because they have demonstrated the \u201cultimate\u201d form of demonstrated interest.\n\nOr, as Harvard and other top schools point out, is it more likely that the ED applicant pool is meaningfully different than the RD pool? At minimum, the ED round typically contains legacy students and recruited athletes",

          "text": ">Don't apply ED to somewhere that isn't your #1 choice\n\nI understand why you say this, but this should not apply to everyone, right? Say that someone's dream school was Harvard. However, this person has a very low chance (way below a typical student accepted at Harvard). Wouldn't it make more sense for this person to apply ED to maybe their 3rd or 4th choice school which lets say is Cornell? Cornell has a much higher early acceptance rate and this person is fine with getting into Cornell, even though it is not their first choice school.\n\nI can imagine this person REA Harvard and will most likely not get in and then apply RD to Cornell which has like a 5% acceptance rate RD and not get in there, too. So I feel like it makes more sense to just apply to a relatively less selective school that is still high on your list that you might have a good chance of actually getting into based on your profile. \n\nOf course, if I was a world class applicant, then I would apply early to my top choice, but I am not, lol",
