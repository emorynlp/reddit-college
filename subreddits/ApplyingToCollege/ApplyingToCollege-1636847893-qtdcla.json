  "title:": "What unis could I get into?",
  "text": "Soooooo yeah, as the title suggests, I wanted to know from you guys about what universities I could get into. \n\n1. I wanna pursue Physics \n\n2. I am an Indian from Nigeria\n\n3. I study in a CBSE school and my predicted score is 92 to 93%-ish\n\nMy ECs:\n\n\nSo being in Nigeria poses a LOT of disabilities for a person who wants to pursue Physics, which is why I decided to take matters into my own hands:-\n\nI have 2 research papers (the first one has been signed on by my Physics teacher, but she has sent it for further review to an *IIT professor)\n\n[*For the non-Indian folk, IITs are the best engineering institutes in India and are famous for the alumnus they produce, along with their infamous entrance exams]\n\nI got a 78th International rank and 1st place school-wise in the International Aerospace Olympiad\n\nI have gotten a certificate from IIT Kanpur for their Experimental Physics exam (although it's only participation cuz I spent my September holidays crying my eyes out in anguish from the people who cheated and got higher predicted scores in their exams lmfaooo\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d)\n\nAnd lastly, I make blueprints for things to build in my free-time. For eg: I just designed an airplane, then an AC generator, a particle accelerator, etc.. I will take on a building project after my Board exams though!!\n\nOther stuff includes a Silver Medal for the International Spelling Bee, Silver Medal for playing in the school Basketball team, merit certificate in the International GK Olympiad.\n\nThere's no work experience or internships or anything here because of how bad this place is for Physics-related stuff. Also, I did join an NGO for volunteer work, but because of the ongoing pandemic, they've not been able to do much\ud83d\ude05.\n\n\n\nAs for my essays, they're pretty good so far, still working on them and as far as my LORs are concerned, my Physics teacher REALLY REALLYYYYY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK WHEN IT CAME TO ME!!! (Heck, my mum and I both cried because of how well she wrote it\ud83d\ude02).\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's about it ig. I realize that my ECs are SUPER DUPER weak rn, and I will build on them for sure, but for now I just wanted to know where I could get in with THESE stats\ud83d\ude05.",
