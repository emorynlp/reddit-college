  "text": "I\u2019m a community college transfer student currently applying to 6 California state universities as a transfer. My GPA is good but I do have 3 W\u2019s from a single summer (long story short taking math over the summer wasn\u2019t it and caused me to fall behind in my other classes/was burnt out from the spring, so I dropped all my summer classes). I ended up retaking all the classes and getting passing grades, and I don\u2019t have any other W\u2019s. Will this affect my decisions?",
