Those, GPA, and ECs related to med school, and MCAT scores are all that matter. The classes are essentially a year of gen chem with lab, a year of organic chem with lab, a year of bio with lab, a year of physics, half a year of calc, half a year of stat, a couple of humanities, bio chem/genetics. You could literally take these classes at any accredited college, including community college. What should matter is schools that are compatible to what you are looking for out of college, finances add up, majors available for you, and oppty for ECs.",

Cleveland has come a long way and the area around campus is great! We were impressed and loved all of the museums in and around campus. Lots of green space and even a small lake. We felt safe walking around. You have two big hospitals on one side, Little Italy neighborhood on another\u2026 \n\nCleveland has trouble areas\u2026 any city does. But the campus area is in a good spot in my opinion.",
