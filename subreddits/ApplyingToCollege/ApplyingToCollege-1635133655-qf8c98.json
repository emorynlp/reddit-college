  "text": "I took advantage of fall break last week and was able to drive around two college campuses very briefly(!) with my mom. Both schools were on my list. My mom had something bad about both schools. She legitimately crossed them off my mental list for me, I didn\u2019t ask her to, she just did it. I\u2019m trying to build my list, but every time I find a school, there\u2019s something that I don\u2019t like about it.\n\nThat now leaves me with one school: my parents alma mater. I love the school, however I don\u2019t love the non-traditional feel of campus. But I\u2019m pretty much guaranteed admission, even with my not so great GPA. it\u2019s near family. it\u2019s got my desired majors and minors, with the ability to easily double major. Plus I could easily afford tuition with a part time job, and or scholarships. Every time I look at another school I\u2019m legitimately like \u201cbut it\u2019s not (parents alma mater.)\u201d at this point I think the universe is just telling me to go to my parents alma mater. But I at least need other schools for my list.",

              "text": ">Campus: I want a medium sized school, ideally less than 20k students. I would prefer a more traditional campus feel, and a campus that is easy to navigate.\n\nBy traditional, I assume you mean a campus with quads, trees, and that sort of thing? Like not an urban campus like NYU? And medium sized is perfectly fine; many schools fit that criteria. :)\n\n>Financial aid: I\u2019m going to need financial aid (parents income is almost six figures, but one parent is not employed.) my parents do not have anything saved up for my college, nor are they willing to foot the bill.\n\nThis is tricky; colleges aren't going to give you *more* financial aid with this taken into consideration, because if they did that, everyone would just say \"my parents aren't contributing to my college tuition\" \n\n>GPA/test scores: gpa was a 3.1 freshmen year, but went down with COVID sophomore year, it\u2019s way up this year (not sure what it is exactly.)\n\nI'll be honest, this does sort of narrow down your list of schools, but you've still got a lot of great options.\n\n>Majors: neuroscience, psychology (double major if possible) a healthcare ethics or policy minor would be nice\n\nI'm going to be focusing on a neuroscience or psychology major, that's a specific minor and I don't have time to look through schools with that as a minor.\n\n\\-----\n\nGiven all that, I'd love to suggest some schools to look into, but could you please answer these two questions?\n\n1. What is your state of residence? (This is really important b/c cost is a major issue for you.)\n2. Does political vibe matter to you? (i.e. are extremely liberal or conservative schools a dealbreaker? any preferences?)",
