  "text": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m freaking out right now because the transcript that my counselor uploaded to the Common App has a mistake, where one of the dual enrollment classes I took in Spring shows that I took it in Fall, which makes it seem like I took 7 classes one semester, and only 5 in the other. Is there any way I can have it fixed? My counselor said she can\u2019t change it through her end because I already submitted to one school. She said she can submit an optional report update, but would this be a hassle for the school and not make them want to accept me?",
