  "text": "I completed the FAFSA earlier this month, and I chose my 10 schools to go on and send it to then. However, I have at least 5 or 6 more schools that I still need to send it to. My SAR can be found on the FAFSA website, but I never received any other confirmation of the SAR yet; neither email or paper. I also haven't applied to all of the schools yet, but I'm really close...\n\nWhen would it be safe to edit the application, removing some schools and adding the others?",
