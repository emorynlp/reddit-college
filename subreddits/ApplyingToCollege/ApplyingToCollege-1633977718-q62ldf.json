  "text": "Okay - I\u2019m a junior, and UW 4.0 at my school is fairly easy.\n\nAfter this year, I will have taken/taken the exams of 5 APs.\n\nAPUSH (A, 5)\n\nAP US Gov (A, 5)\n\nAP Enviro (taking this year)\n\nAP Lang and Comp (taking this year)\n\nAP Modern World (taking this year)\n\nEven if I\u2019m able to get As and 5s on all of these, I\u2019m a little worried about my relatively small number of APs as well as my lack of a math or hard science AP. I\u2019m concerned this makes my course load look extremely weak.\n\nIs this a legitimate concern? Should I look into trying to take AP Physics or AP Calc outside of school or during the summer to bolster my course load and AP scores?\n\nOr am I unnecessarily worried about this?\n\nThanks.",
