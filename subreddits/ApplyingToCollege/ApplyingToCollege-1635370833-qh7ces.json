  "text": "I\u2019m really torn here so I really do appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and respond but here it goes\u2026. So basically I was diagnosed with a rare bone tumor in my pelvis at the begging of my freshman year. I was able to get all A\u2019s that whole year up until March when my pelvis broke out of no where at lunch and I had to be home schooled the rest of the year. (I had received treatment with a 98% success rate prior to my pelvis braking but my tumor had nearly doubled in size on the X-ray). Anyways, they basically just froze my A\u2019s for the rest of that year, which I think I would\u2019ve been able to keep up if I didn\u2019t break my pelvis. Anyways, I began receiving radiation treatment about a month after breaking my pelvis. It gave me bad symptoms for about a month I was throwing up everyday(this was still end of freshman year). It began to get better and after four months I was off crutches for the last few weeks of summer. During that summer, I had formed a new friend group, who would come over and play 2k and stuff while I was on my crutches. As a freshman I was much more independent because I knew I needed to focus on my grades and I knew I would have trouble balancing grades and social life. Anyways when sophomore year started, I got off to a bad start, ditching a few classes and stuff and getting distracted by social stuff. I ended up with a D in Algebra 2 which was my fault for not being responsible and My other grades weren\u2019t great (like 2 C\u2019s two B\u2019s and the rest A\u2019s). Sophomore year in general was not my year, and it was my fault, I got too caught up in having fun, especially after being cooked up on crutches for so long. I ended up with all A\u2019s junior year but now here I am applying to colleges and many of the applications give you the opportunity to explain a bad grade like a D or a F. I am contemplating whether to just lying a little bit and saying I was struggling a lot because of radiation side effects (which had worn off by the school year) or just telling the truth. I like to tell the truth but this could potentially determine whether I get into certain colleges or not. I don\u2019t wanna lie but I also don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity because I was making some dumb mistakes two years ago.  I could just realize another person\u2019s perspective. Thank you to anyone who read all of this,good karma coming your way.",

I remember taking my English final with shooting nerve pains down my leg and often just hurting just sitting down in class. Doesn\u2019t really justify anything but kinda makes me wanna cut myself a little slack i guess idk\u2026",
