  "text": "If I want to major in Biology, which is better between Rice and JHU? \n\nI know that JHU is definitely better for Biology, but there are 2 reasons why I hesitate.\n\n1. JHU has 6000 undergrad and 20000 grad. I think it is not good school for undergrads I guess...?\n2. I have a better possibility to get into Rice than JHU. But it's ONLY for early. Rice likes my high school and students who apply Rice as an early are usually accepted. But for JHU, it is not.\n\nI am an international student and don't need FA. Where should I choose?",

We have something called \u201cnegative curves\u201d in some premed classes, which means that even if you get above, say, a 90%, you can actually get curved down to a B if your percentage was low enough. Premeds here are ridiculously smart and many of them are perfectionists, making it difficult to perform at the top of your class (which is what you need to do in order to get into med school).",
