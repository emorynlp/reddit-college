  "text": "I didn\u2019t have a great time applying to colleges when I was a senior. I really wanted to go to College B because of the location, but chose College A because i thought it was the wiser chose since it was more of a college town and I wanted the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. I honestly thought I was being smart for choosing what I thought would be more sociable rather than a location I really liked. \n\nTurns out I hate the \u201ccollege experience\u201d and I do not like it here at College A. When I was first trying to make my choice a lot of people told me \u201cyou can always just transfer!\u201d. They didn\u2019t tell me that I have to have 60 credits in order to transfer literally anywhere (I can only attend UCs and CSUs). Including College B \n\nI\u2019m really bummed that I need to be in this sucky town for even a semester longer than I planned to. I wish I hadn\u2019t been such an idiot and chose the right college when I was a freshman.",

You\u2019ll need to check the website of the UC campus you\u2019re considering to learn if they will accept applications from lower-division transfers.\u201d\n\nSome UCs will accept lower division transfer students, but it\u2019s school/major specific. I haven\u2019t looked at CSUs but perhaps they also have some options.",
