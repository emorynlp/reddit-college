  "text": "Hi, I'm a international studuent trying to figure out a way I'd get into college. I applied to a few last year when I wasn't even sure when highschool would end(exams were postponded without telling us when it will happen). I did get a few acceptances but the aid wasn't that great and i chose to opt for gap year and here i am applying to colleges this year too.\nI wanted to ask if both the common app and mycoalition allows my recommenders to send a new recommendation letter for me this year. I've added a few things on my resume and they have said they would add it in the letter. But idk if they can basically upload the new letter. Help a folk out please. \nThankyou in advance!",
