  "text": "Hey there,\n\n\nI started the college process late (late September early October) but I've done significant research since then researching colleges. I am trying to look for small liberal arts colleges in big cities that aren't super hard to get into (I have a fine GPA but my extracurriculars are lacking). I also plan on majoring in computer science.\n\nMy top two colleges currently are Occidental and Macalester. Occidental's comp sci program is very young (only four years old), but LA is closer to home.  I really don't want to make a mistake and ED to the wrong school, so do you guys think I should hold off on EDing? On the other hand, I feel like not properly utilizing my ED would be a mistake.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",
