The engineering school has been improving steadily as well. \n\nAt Tufts you'll get a lot more individual attention and smaller classes. \n\nAt Tufts they are actually trying to help you graduate,  whereas at UMich competitive majors are so overcrowded that they actually want you to fail out. \n\nAlso helps to be in Boston for internships et al\n\nBut Michigan is pretty awesome,  but huge,  crowded,  large classes,  profs are more research focused rather than teaching. \"you're just a number\"\n\nBut both schools are great,  albeit very different.\n\nTLDR: Tufts for undergrad,  UMich for grad.",
