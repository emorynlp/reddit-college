  "text": "Hi. For reference here are my stats:\n\n4.33 GPA W/ 3.9 UW\n\n1470 SAT \n\nHook: Being alone at home all day making me become independent \n\nECS: Good for business, not extraordinary. Best EC is owning my own company\n\nI am torn between ED to UVA and ED to Penn. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to UPenn, but in light of my sat score my family thinks it\u2019s best if I ED to uva since the sat score is a little too low for an ivy like penn. I need guidance from the a2c subreddit, what do you guys think? \n\nFor context I love both schools, penn more than uva but that\u2019s just because I\u2019ve been obsessed with Wharton since 8th grade.",
