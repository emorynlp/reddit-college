  "text": "I just sent in my Colby app and realized that I neglected to go test optional upon reading through the PDF form. Although my score isn\u2019t  (1410) it\u2019s definitely not going to help my application considering their median score. Is it worth it to email their office and ask if I can be reviewed as test optional?",
