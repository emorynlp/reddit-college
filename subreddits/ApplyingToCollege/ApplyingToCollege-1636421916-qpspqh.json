  "text": "I\u2019m a native Nebraskan and want to move somewhere else for college, preferably somewhere more liberal. I\u2019m trans and although my family\u2019s upper middle class my parents are adamant that I go somewhere where I won\u2019t have to get any student loans - I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re going to financially contribute to my education but they\u2019re against me going out of state most places. My mom graduated from the University of Wyoming but since it\u2019s ranked as one of the most conservative campuses in the country and there aren\u2019t any gender clinics nearby for me to do hrt from its kind of out of the question, even though I already applied there. I also applied to South Dakota School of Mines and Western Washington University, but Western\u2019s tuition is pretty high and Mines also doesn\u2019t have any gender clinics within the next like 5 hours, so that\u2019s a bit of an issue. At this point I think I\u2019ll probably apply to UNL but I really don\u2019t want to go there; I just don\u2019t know what to do honestly. Already toured Western, UW and Mines and Western was perfect in literally every way aside from the cost\u2026 it\u2019s also the most liberal/accepting of lgbt people by far so it sucks that I probably won\u2019t be going there. Any other progressive schools that have out of state tuition under, say, $20,000? I plan on majoring in computer science btw",

You\u2019d only be paying 7k ish + boarding if you stay on campus. Check out states like Nevada, California, Arizona and Texas, North Carolina. They would have to be State schools though no private. You should be able to find this information on the schools website",

      "text": "Since you're in Nebraska, you can look into the Midwest tuition exchange, there are [a bunch](https://msep.mhec.org/institutions?field_state_term_tid=7&field_program_type_term_tid=12&field_sector_term_tid=10) of schools that would offer an exchange rate. Iowa State doesn't participate, but if you've got good stats then you can get big tuition scholarships and apply to other school scholarships. The nearest Planned Parenthood HRT clinic is a half hour ish drive from campus into Des Moines, and Ames is pretty liberal + accepting relative to most of the rural midwest. ISU is also pretty good for CS. I can't speak to how close HRT clinics are to the schools in the Midwest Tuition Exchange, but there are a lot of options so I imagine some of them should be fairly close.",
