  "text": "Whenever my mom is in a depressive episode (lasting anywhere from one to three weeks), she becomes stubborn, anger, and gives the silent treatment. As a result, she refuses to finish my FAFSA or start my CSS profile. She also took my phone so I have no way to contact my dad to tell him to fill out his portion. As a result, I will miss two early action financial aid deadlines and my early decision financial aid deadline. The early action schools said that my applications will be deferred to a regular decision if I don't make the deadline, which means my chances of getting in just got slimmer. My early decision school hasn't gotten back to me yet but if they defer it to RD as well, I will have missed out on the greatest chance of me getting into my dream school.\n\nLesson Learned: apply for FAFSA and other financial aid docs right when they open on October 1st\n\nGlad I learned this lesson but sad about its consequences.",
