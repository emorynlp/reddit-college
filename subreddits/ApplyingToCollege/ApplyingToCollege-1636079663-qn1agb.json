  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school looking for extra colleges to add to my list.\nI\u2019m thinking about majoring in science and would like a school that is strong academically and where I would be challenged. I\u2019m leaning towards LAC because I feel like it would be more meaningful learning and I\u2019d like to get to know the professors \nAt the same time I love the outdoors, spending time with friends, ect. I don\u2019t want to waste college being stressed, I wan it to be a fun experience that isn\u2019t cutthroat.\nRight now I\u2019m applying to CC Whitman Macalster and other similar schools and possibly williams (I love the school but seems to elitist)\nDoes anyone know of other schools which are academically challenging without being overally cut throat, have a chill student body, and preferably good outdoor access? Merrit scholarships are also a plus.",
