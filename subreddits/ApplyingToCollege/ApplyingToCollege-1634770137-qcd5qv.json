  "text": "One of my top extracurriculars is the sport I play. I have had the same coach for several years, so they\u2019ve known me for a while and have seen me grow in the sport and as a person. I know that they would have great things to say about my leadership, improvement, and dedication to the team. I already have 2 rec letters from teachers lined up, as well as the counselor letter. Would this fourth letter from my coach benefit my application?",
