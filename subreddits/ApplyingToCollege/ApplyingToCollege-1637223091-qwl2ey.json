  "text": "I am not able to take the upcoming mid terms because of my mom's surgery. The school isn't giving an online or hybrid option, so I can't risk it by going to physical school due to safety reasons for my mom. The school said they wouldn't give an 0 but they will put my summative grades with exams not taken written. Can I tell colleges why I wasn't able to give the midterms?",

It could cause my mom to become permanently blind. Plus my mom is also on immunosuppressants. So my parents aren't really comfortable sending me right now.",
