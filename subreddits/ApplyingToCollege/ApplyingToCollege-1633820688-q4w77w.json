  "text": "Hi! My name's Quinn and I'm a sophomore English major at Bryn Mawr College. I wanted to share some advice I was given and a lot of advice I WISH I was given when I was working on my college essays, particularly the common app/personal statement. Here are my top tips:\n\n1. To start off, my best brainstorming tip: **If you're struggling, stop writing. Talk through your ideas instead.** Pull up the voice memos app on your phone, sit down with a friend/parent/teacher or go for a drive, and talk through all your ideas. Then, sleep on it. The next day, listen to your audio recording and write down any ideas you like from it. The blank page can be really intimidating \u2013 talking through ideas instead of pressuring yourself to write them down can help to break through that initial anxiety!\n2. **Make a list of everything you want AO's to know about you.** This can mean things you do, your long term plans, or qualities you have. Then, **consider which part of the application is best suited to show off each thing.** Ten years experience playing the piano? Activities can cover that. But how kind and caring of a friend you are? That's something that can really only be addressed in an essay. Plan your essays, etc. accordingly!\n3. Ask yourself: **is my essay a good story?** Aim for your essay to be a piece of creative writing that you're truly proud of and would want people besides AO's to read it!\n4. Going along with that: **College essay advice is good. Creative writing advice is better.** Look up advice for writing personal essays and creative nonfiction for professional writers, not just for high school students trying to get into T20s, and read as many essays in as many different forms as you can find! High school basically trains you to think of intro with thesis/body paragraphs, each with topic sentence and evidence/conclusion when you think of essays. Your two goals for the essay are 1. humanize yourself and 2. show that you can write. The high school essay format might not be the best fit for those goals, and that\u2019s okay.\n5. **Know the difference between scene and summary, and try to include at least one scene in your essay.** Think of this as the story happening in real time vs. sped up. Most stories will switch between scene and summary, and so smoothly that you may not even notice. Here\u2019s an example from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: \u201cEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. *As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\" \"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry. \"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round.*\u201d Everything up to the italics in this quote is an example of summary \u2013 see how a bunch of events are condensed? As the reader, we\u2019re not with Fred and George as they spy on the Slytherin practice team, we\u2019re just hearing about it. Once we switch to the italics, though, we\u2019re in scene. We\u2019re getting specific details about events as they happen, experiencing the events in real time with Harry. Try to include at least one scene in your personal statement \u2013\u00a0if it\u2019s all summary, you run the risk of your essay becoming just another list, and your application is already full of those! You need scene to make your essay a good story.\n6. **Your essays should sound like you.** I can't tell you how many essays I've read that sound like they could have been written by anyone, or worse \u2013 by any robot. It's about voice! This is the AO's chance to get to know you as a person. That doesn't just mean facts about you listed out like on every other part of the application. This means getting to know how you think, how you sound, how you act and communicate. A great way to check this is to read your essay out loud. Mark all the places you find yourself tripping over your words. Can you make those parts flow better? Reading your writing out loud is helpful no matter the project \u2013\u00a0your ears will catch things that your eyes won\u2019t!\n\nThose are my main tips! I\u2019ve got a ton more advice so I might add to this post periodically if I decide a tip is universal enough to share. I could also do a post of advice specifically for supplements if you guys would be interested in that, since this post was mainly just about the personal statement!\n\nLastly, a little self promo: I charge for essay feedback ($1/100 words, so a common app would be $6) and offer brainstorming sessions/advice on essay topic ideas or outlines, so PM me if you\u2019re interested! I leave lots of comments and a note at the end with overall thoughts/suggestions. And I can edit a free sample of about 100 words so you can see if you like my feedback before committing to the full service!\n\nGood luck with all your applications, class of \u201826! You\u2019ve got this :)",
