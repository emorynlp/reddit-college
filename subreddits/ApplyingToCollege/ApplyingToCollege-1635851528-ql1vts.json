  "text": "I applied early to NYU as class of 2026; but on the \"additional information: community disruption\" portion of my application (where I talked about Covid) I have a sentence that reads:\n\n\"The lack of a studio space, and limited variety of materials found at home **barred me prevented me** from performing as I normally would\"\n\nI didn't deleted the \"barred me\" when I was fixing the adjective! That's literally how it's written on my application! I'm so anxious, I'm sure this is going to be the dealbreaker for my application. Should I call the university to fix it? Or would that just draw attention to it and make it look bad? They already downloaded the application, please send help",

They're weeding out people who truly can't string together coherent thoughts, form proper sentences and can't spell to save their lives. They'll see this for what it is, and may also recognize it for what it represents - someone who is very carefully trying to choose words to fit what they're trying to say. Editorial mistakes happen. It's not a deal breaker for sure.",
