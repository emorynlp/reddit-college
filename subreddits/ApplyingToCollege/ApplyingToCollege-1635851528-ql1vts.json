  "text": "I applied early to NYU as class of 2026; but on the \"additional information: community disruption\" portion of my application (where I talked about Covid) I have a sentence that reads:\n\n\"The lack of a studio space, and limited variety of materials found at home **barred me prevented me** from performing as I normally would\"\n\nI didn't deleted the \"barred me\" when I was fixing the adjective! That's literally how it's written on my application! I'm so anxious, I'm sure this is going to be the dealbreaker for my application. Should I call the university to fix it? Or would that just draw attention to it and make it look bad? They already downloaded the application, please send help",
