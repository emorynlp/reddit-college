  "text": "*I was only 13*\n\nIn my freshman year, I wasn't exactly the most mature person. I didn't understand the point of trying or getting good grades at school and just struggled - I got a 2.5 unweighted that year. Since then, I had a 4.0 GPA Sophomore and Junior years. I switched schools from 9th to 10th grade but I swear THERE IS NO GRADE INFLATION HERE.\n\nI don't know how to explain the circumstance in my Additional Info section. Guess I'm still answering for things I did 3 years ago...\n\nAny suggestions? Would be really appreciated",

It\u2019s not that unusual, unless you were 13 throughout the entire year. And even in that case, I\u2019m not sure what you would say. \n\nWriting that you weren\u2019t mature isn\u2019t the best message to send to a college, and could come off as an excuse. I would just hope for the best. What is your cumulative GPA now?",

I also started to take initiative in my passions\u2026\u201d. I think I\u2019ll go with emphasizing my growth more than explaining what happened because God knows what happened then",

And again, I think my trends help.\n\nApplications go beyond a 3-digit number, and I didn't say they would be easy targets. My end goal is to get into UF, as I'm in-state and it's honestly a pretty decent school.\n\nI think Emory is DEFINITELY at least a target as they don't factor in freshman year\n\nClass rigor was also good, 17 APs over 4 years. I'm just hoping for the best lol",
