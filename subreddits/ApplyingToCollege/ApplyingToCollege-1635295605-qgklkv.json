  "text": "I'm being asked to choose between a BA and a BS degree. Before I go further, I would like to point out I already know the difference between these degrees and know they both are valued equally in terms of opportunities (regardless of which path you go, there is no job exclusive to BS). Finally, I know employers don't care which you took, they just want to see you have a college degree.",

      "text": "You would have to read the college course catalog very carefully to see if there is any difference.  Normally in US colleges & Unis, they are the same.  But when you go for the BS, then you have to take many more hard science courses in the 200-300-400 ranges, and for a  BA, you'll be taking Art or History or Language/ literature, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, most colleges and Universities don't have you choose a Major until the middle to end of Sophomore year... allowing you to get a taste of a number of different classes/ courses and what the different schools ( departments) have to offer at that institution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, don't get bogged down in declaring a major so early... ( and too, you can always change your mind later, to include transfer colleges to somewhere else!).",

      "text": "This is a pretty school specific question.  If a school offers both options you could be taking the same individual courses, but often the BS degree will require more courses within your major while the BA may make a double major or minor easier to accomplish.",
