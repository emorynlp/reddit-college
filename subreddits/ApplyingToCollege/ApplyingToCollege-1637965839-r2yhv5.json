  "text": "So in sophmore year, I applied to the number one magnet school in my state and somehow got in. This is a school that\u2019s really rigorous academics wise; for example, in my junior year I basically had no free time because I was always struggling to finish my school work (Zoom classes from 7:30 AM to 3:00 PM and then grinding out homework until 9:00 PM). So I didn\u2019t get a chance to do many extracurriculars over my high school career. But this is a type of school where about half the population is literally genius kids, so they were able to finish all their school work while still having time to participate in ECs. My question is, will colleges compare my application to others from my school and look at me unfavorably because I wasn\u2019t able to cope up with academics as well as ECs when other kids could?",

There are people without super good ECs(or any ECs at all), that end up at T20.",
