  "title:": "Opinions on Claremont McKenna and/or Pomona?",
  "text": "Hello! Recently I discovered Claremont McKenna and Pomona College, both liberal arts schools I'd love to attend to pursue a government or international relations degree. I plan to apply to both, but CMC is really winning me over. I love CMC's modern campus and academics, but I also love Pomona's old-fashioned style and liberal community. \n\nFor context, I'm an Asian international (U.S. citizen) student. I will not apply for financial aid.\n\nI've also heard some great things about career opportunities after graduating from both schools, but I would like further information on this.\n\nIf you're currently studying at or applying to either or both of these schools, I would really appreciate any opinions of them in terms of campus, academics, admissions, and community! Thank you so much!",
