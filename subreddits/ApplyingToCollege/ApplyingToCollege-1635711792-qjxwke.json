  "title:": "Getting a C in a Dual Enrollment course but it wont show till midyear report",
  "text": "Currently taking a dual enrollment course at a local community college and it\u2019s an upper-level biology course but it\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll be getting a C in it. I\u2019m applying to GaTech as my top choice and I\u2019m OOS. My community college has a weird system where grades aren\u2019t distributed to the Highschools until the semester ends so it\u2019ll only show up on my midyear report. Im applying to GT for biomedical engineering but I could easily see myself doing mechanical. Would switching my application to mechanical soften the blow of getting a C in ghat bio course. For some context my gpa is a 3.88 on the 4.0 scale and 33 on the act.",

      "text": "Did you apply early? If you did you won\u2019t have anything to worry about unless you\u2019re deferred to regular action. As for switching your declared major, tech doesn\u2019t admit by major so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. People sometimes try to game the system and apply as a \u201cless competitive major\u201d but that rarely works. Honestly, write about and apply to the major tour most passionate about and don\u2019t stress too much about it. \n\nSource: GATech AE First Year",
