  "text": "Hey, I'm applying to Cambridge for Engineering and I submitted my UCAS application on Oct. 14 but Cambridge only sent an email about ENGAA on Oct. 15 (some hours before the registration deadline)!\nMy school managed to send my details to a centre to be registered 2hrs before the deadline.\nGot an email from my college saying the application is invalid.\nAlthough my classmate responded to his college explaining the situation and they allowed him to take the test online.\nI responded but the officer is on leave till Monday. I tried calling, no official was available so I left a message.\nI don't know what else to try (the exam is on Wednesday, Nov. 3rd)",
