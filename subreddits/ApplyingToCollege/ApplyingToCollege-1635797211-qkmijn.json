  "text": "I didn\u2019t realized UMD required official SAT score reports. I sent them yesterday, but I\u2019m still so confused, and the wording on their application website is a bit ambiguous. Can I still submit my application EA even though they haven\u2019t received my SAT scores yet, but I\u2019ve technically sent them? I was under the impression that they wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee that they\u2019ll look at the scores if it comes in later than Nov 1., but I can still submit the app, right?",

If the doc are not received, your application is NOT complete and they could move it to the RD pile. \n\nI have been warned by CC folks there regarding strict rule for UMD, PennState from last year applicants.",

This is a school where EA really makes a difference. I\u2019d submit your application saying not to consider tests, but send them anyway. You can always try calling after the fact to get them added to your file. But submitting the application with tests that won\u2019t arrive on time will leave the app marked as incomplete, and it will be moved fo the RD deadline.",
