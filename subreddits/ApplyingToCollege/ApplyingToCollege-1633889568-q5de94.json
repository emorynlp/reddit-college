  "text": "I am an Indian (International) planning to A2C in 2024. National Curriculum (CBSE) and no \"high level classes\" Are available at HS. I am shooting for the T20s and especially HYPS and a few LACs (Amherst etc.) And looking for full fin aid. I have pretty good ECs. As my school doesn't offer APs, should I self study for them? Is it that hard? \nBTW, applying for poly sci/IR/Economics so the APs would be along the lines of Comparative Gov, USGov, Stats, etc. Also, no one has even applied to US from my school, but it is the best school in the district. Also, it is private.",

They aren't extremely in depth, but you can always do extra research. I self studied for both econs last year and I didn't find it extremely challenging.",

              "text": "When I took stats last year, I didn't find it too hard. The first half of it is pretty basic while the second half can get a little complicated. But to be honest, the calculator does most of the work for you on the exam and all you have to do is interpret data. I'd say a month of dedicated studying (1-2 hours a day) will probably be enough for a 5.",
