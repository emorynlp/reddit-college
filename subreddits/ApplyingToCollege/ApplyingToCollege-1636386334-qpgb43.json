  "text": "My mom was adamant that I needed to apply for scholarships at my state school but I really don\u2019t think that I can go through the process of finding another two people to write it especially since one person has to be someone who can testify to my leadership community service stuff. I took my three months before I was able to gain the courage and push past the anxiety to ask the first two teacher for the common app and that caused me to have panic attacks for weeks after. I\u2019m just upset bc I feel like everything is working against me and I wish it wasn\u2019t this hard for me",
