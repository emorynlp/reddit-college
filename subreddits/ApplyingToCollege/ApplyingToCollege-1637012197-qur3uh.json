  "text": "My dream is to study cinematic arts in CA, and as an international student, I think I would greatly reduce my costs by transferring from a community college, but I am in doubt, I know financial aid is very difficult for internationals, but other than that, would I have a limitation as a student from another country or in academic curriculum for transfer?",

      "text": "As far as I am aware, there is no limitation on being able to transfer.\n\nCost is a different matter. Public universities give no need-based aid to internationals. UCs cost 65-70k per year for internationals.\n\nUSC is private, though if I recall, USC only offers merit scholarships to internationals, not need-based aid.\n\nCheck whether you can get a student visa from a California community college.",
