      "text": "IIRC, they admit to a school (Marshall, Viterbi, Dornsife, etc) but not to a specific major. It may be different for some fine arts that require portfolios/auditions. But USC last year required school-specific essays depending on whether the majors you were applying to were in Viterbi or Dornsife or etc., so they certainly look at that at least when deciding to accept you.",
