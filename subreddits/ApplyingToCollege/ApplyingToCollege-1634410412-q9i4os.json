  "text": "mine is a 7/10 i have taken 5 aps (6 if you count economics as separate, micro and macro are one class at my school) kids with 10/10 have taken like 9-12 Does this put me at a disadvantage for schools like villanova, babson and NYU where it says that the average is 9/10 on naviance. When i look up the average aps taken for these schools it says like 3-5.",

      "text": "I wouldn't judge the strength of curriculum based off the number of AP's. I took 10 AP's but I never took AP Bio or AP Chem or AP Physics which are super hard AP's. Now you also can't really judge yourself based off the avg. AP's of the people that got it. The thing is every high school is different. I had a ton at my school, but my roommate went to a high school that didn't offer any AP's and we are both going to a school with an 11% acceptance rate. As someone that went through the same process last year it's so easy to compare yourself to the avg. GPA's and avg. AP's and avg. test scores, but at the end of the day it's usually not a number that got you into the school. Usually it was something in one of your essays or in a rec letter or a super cool passion that makes the school realize they want you. Also, naviance is a great tool, but it doesn't tell you other important information about the applicant that again could have made them more desirable like unique EC's or even their race/ethnicity.",
