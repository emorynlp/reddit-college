I\u2019m assuming what matters more is how much those 500 students are competitive.  If you go to a very low intensity school where those 500 kids aren\u2019t that competitive compared to a class of 300 that is very competitive it would probably matter more?",

I ranked 1/484 freshman year but that was with only 1 AP class (since my school didn\u2019t offer any more), I\u2019m currently in my sophomore year taking 3 APs since that\u2019s the most that we can take this year.  Next year I\u2019ll go with 5 since it\u2019s likely the highest anyone would take, and senior I think I\u2019ll go with all 6 since there\u2019s usually 1 or 2 other kids who go very competitive with APs.  Although I\u2019m not really even sure if rank 1 is even worth all that effort since as long as you stay in the top 5% I wouldn\u2019t even think it would matter that much.  I think maybe it\u2019s possible I could do some APs and maybe still get at least rank 10.\n\nAt my school it\u2019s only really the top 10 positions that are very competitive, since there\u2019s only usually 10 kids per class that care a lot about grades.  Climbing through the top 10 is difficult but as long as you get decent grades you could probably end up top 20\u2026 just depends.",

My other 3 are project/ writing based, so I don\u2019t have to study. I would suggest doing something similar and taking 2/3 testing classes and then 2-3 more project oriented ones.
