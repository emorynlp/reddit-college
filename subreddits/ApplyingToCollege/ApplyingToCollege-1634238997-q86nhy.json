  "text": "Hello A2C, I have to submit an application today however I have not gotten my SAT test results back yet. However I do want to report them later on when they come. What do I do in the Common App Testing Section? Do I just leave it as I do not want to report, or that I do want to report? When I do click report the test scores, it tells me to input the amount of scores I want to report, If I click any number more than 0 it requires me to specify my sat sub scores.",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission",

Am I missing something?\n\nAfter you submit, the portal you are provided by the school will almost certainly provide a place to report scores when they arrive.\n\nI assume this is GT or another 10/15 due date? Otherwise, just wait for scores.\n\n(if it is GT, there\u2019s a big \u201cView and Self-Report Test Scores\u201d button on the main application status page.)",
