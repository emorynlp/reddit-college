What can\u2019t you do with philosophy other than be an engineer or a nurse?\n\nMy son has a philosophy degree and he has a job working making motion designs for movie trailers. \n\nThe skills of learning how to think creatively, problem solve, write well, present your thoughts in a clear and cohesive way, and use logic \u2014 not to mention having an understanding of the historical context of the way people think are transferable skills that can be used in pretty much any job. \n\nFor law school you can major in anything at all \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter.  So if you want to do a more job training education like marketing or CS or engineering you can do that too",
