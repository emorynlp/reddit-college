  "text": "alright so im an intl, so i assume my odds of gettin are alrdy lower (im a citizen of us tho dk if it makes a difference). Okay so basically 11th grade exams ib my country were cancelled last year, and outta nowhere they decide to put em from oct 25- nov 1 and this means i prolly wont br able to finish supplements for all schools cos i gotta prep for em.
