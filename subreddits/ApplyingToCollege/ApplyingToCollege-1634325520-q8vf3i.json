              "text": ">Georgetown University **requires submission of SAT and/or ACT scores as part of our holistic application review process. Ca**ndidates for admission should submit official score reports from the College Board and/or ACT.  \n>  \n>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect students throughout the United States and across the globe, Georgetown recognizes that some students **may not have access to an open testing center**. If this is the case, we encourage you to apply to the university without test scores. A form will be provided to you after the application due date (at Early Action and Regular Decision) to **explain why you were unable to access a test center.**\n\nIf you have a score, you were able to access a test center.",
