  "text": "Hi again A2C.\n\nI'm just about to submit my UNC application which means it's time to crunch for my next early deadlines. I'm worried about whether my senior year grades from the first semester are worth applying regular with or not. They're a continuation of the excellent grades I made last year, although I'm taking a quarter semester of Calculus II at a local college which is significantly more rigorous and I am doing quite well. My grades were mid to low A's freshman year, and have been on an upward trend since. Are the benefits of applying early to Stanford outweighed by not having these grades?",
