  "text": "For context, I do plan on going down the business route long-term (whether it's mine or someone else's), but multiple people have told me that business is considered an \"easy\" major and since there are tons of business grads, it's tough to stand out amongst the competition. \n\nI know there are lots of good undergrad business schools which carry significant weight in your resume (e.g. Wharton). So if I apply to any schools with a good business program, is it better to apply as a business major or stick with Econ?",
