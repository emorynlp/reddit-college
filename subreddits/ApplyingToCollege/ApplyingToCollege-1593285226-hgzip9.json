  "title:": "Dear colleges, please stop asking WHY I do stuff",
  "text": "I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m interested in the sciences. I\u2019m just naturally drawn to it more than I am to the humanities. I want to help people with a career in the sciences, but I can\u2019t pinpoint a specific incident that sparked my interest in STEM or made me want to help people.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I like music or why I like basketball. I \ud83d\udc4f don\u2019t \ud83d\udc4f know\ud83d\udc4f why I do stuff sometimes, and I don\u2019t wanna get to know me better\n\nAlthough i guess it is kinda cool that writing these essays requires me to reflect on a lotta things and try to understand myself more\n\nEdit: I understand that sometimes if you can\u2019t say why, maybe it\u2019s because your parents want you to become a doctor or apply to a certain school, but I feel like it\u2019s not the case a lotta times. Sometimes you love what you do, but it\u2019s hard to find an explanation as to why if you don\u2019t dig deep enough or come up with a plausible story.\n\n##**Edit 2:**\nI understand the meaning behind colleges asking us why we want to apply or why we do X activity, and I agree that it's better to have a solid reason than to not have one. I recognize that I\u2019m fortunate enough to have the chance to apply to college, but this is just a rant. It\u2019s just something I was thinking of as I was writing my essays, it\u2019s not meant to be taken seriously.",

What if she wanted to marry you (and thereby be entitled to half your wealth)?\n\nWhat if you're interviewing for a job and you don't say anything about your skill set, the value you provide, and why you're excited about the position?  What if instead you just talk about the fat salary and awesome lifestyle it will enable you to have?  You're never getting that job.\n\nSame with colleges - don't say you want a lucrative career, access to their deep endowment funds, or even connections to their illustrious alumni network.  That's all so selfish, shallow, and simpleminded.  Instead, talk about how you and the college are a good fit for each other.

Also, OP appears to be male, so I went with what would be more relatable.\n\nThe whole point is that it would be a shallow and hurtful thing to say to someone you were dating.

If you're doing it because your mom is making you, then what happens when you don't live with her anymore?  If you're doing it to get into college, what happens when you get in?  Are you just going to kick back, rest on your laurels, and stop being the awesome person they admitted?\n\nGo watch Simon Sinek's fantastic TED talk, \"How Great Leaders Inspire Action\". It was (for a long time) one of the most watched TED talks and it inspired his book \"Start With Why.\"\n\nFinally, and I'm not trying to be harsh or anything in saying this, if you don't really have a \"why,\" maybe top colleges aren't for you. You can still get a great education at a less selective college and discover your why later.  But if you're not in that top group of students who have passions and values they pursue with purpose, you're probably not a good fit for T20-type colleges.",

They almost always know unconsciously what they think is interesting and worthwhile, it\u2019s just probably no one has asked them before so they might have a hard time putting it into words. These are people willing to take you seriously, so maybe a good way to start is talking it through with someone who will ask you questions and take you seriously (a friend, a parent, a teacher, whatever).",

Passion is a greater driver than education.  You can be trained in something but it doesn't matter if that subject doesn't drive you to the next level.  Being passionate about a subject means you can delve deeper than others who just want to do what they are taught.  It also determines hire-ability which certain colleges are looking more towards than actual suitability.  If I can tell people 95% of my students are hired out of school, you will get more applicants.",

      "text": "In high school and my early college years, I would agree with this 1000%. Now, I understand. \n\nImagine if you\u2019re a girl (or a guy) and a guy says he wants to be your boyfriend. You will not just agree, but will ask a very natural question \u201cwhy?\u201d right? If he says \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why I just like you,\u201d it\u2019s not super convincing (though, relationships are weird, and some people may perceive this as romantic?), and even less convincing if he barely knows you (again, some may think this is love at first sight, but that\u2019s wishful thinking), right? Imagine now the guy says \u201cI also don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to  know too much about myself...\u201d this will raise a red flag as you may not get what you think you\u2019re signing up for, and that\u2019s very risky to the person being asked. \n\nNow, what do you do in this situation then?\n1) get to know yourself a little more and make the other person feel secure for accepting you\n2) you don\u2019t need a life changing moment. Think about how different pieces come together into your interest in STEM. Elaborate your first paragraph a little, and that can be a good essay already. \n3) think about how you\u2019re a good addition to the other party. You\u2019ll want them to want you as much as you want them to make the relationship a mutual one.",
