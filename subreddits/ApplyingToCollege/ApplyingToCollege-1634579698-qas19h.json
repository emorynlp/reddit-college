  "text": " \n\nHi! It might sound weird, but I will ask for a LOR tomorrow from my teachers. (I didn't have time and courage earlier, so am gonna ask for those tomorrow). So, see, my math teacher, he knows me very well. I guess, better than any other teacher. So, I am thinking of asking him for one. BUT, he is just too bad at English. (Yep, am an intl.) He has really poor writing skills, I mean his grammar is just so bad. SO, should I ask him for the LoR? My other teachers do not know me as well as he does because I didn't get to interact with all my teachers due to the covid. But since I am good at math, he admires me. So... any advice? I don't know, maybe he will ask my English teacher to write for me in his name. So i don't trust him about this one.\n\nAnd should I ask them to rush to apply in EA/ED or should I just give them time and apply for RD? Please --- advice on this one as well.",
