  "text": "Hey, A2C. Need some advice here.\n\nI engaged in two research projects throughout high school. One for the national physicists' tournament, for two long years, with my high school teacher who has a PhD, and one in a summer program, with a post-doc researcher.\n\nThe first is one of my main recommenders, closest friends and one of the people I can trust the most on the admissions process. The second is simply a professor I interacted with for two weeks and am in no way close to.\n\nMany schools, including Columbia, say they \"welcome\" LORs from your research mentors. I'm already sending a LOR from the first mentor I've mentioned, and while the second agreed with and was happy when I asked him if I could add our project on college apps, I don't want to ask him for a LOR because he doesn't know me well enough to write it. Besides, I am sending an extra recommendation from my scouter, besides the ones written by my teacher/research mentor, my language teacher, and my counselor. 4 LORs total.\n\nAm I doing the right thing by not asking my 2nd mentor for a LOR? Will colleges see this as a bad sign/red flag? What do you think?\n\nThank you in advance!",
