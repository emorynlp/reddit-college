Most colleges superscore and/or consider your highest section scores. \n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 Common App only has room for your highest section scores. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for these colleges, if they superscore, send both using Score Choice.",
