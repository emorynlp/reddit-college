  "text": "\"Due to being need-aware for international students, we are not unable to consider your request for an application fee waiver. If you would still like to proceed with admission consideration, please go back to your Common Application to submit your application fee ($80). Without payment of the application fee, or approval of a fee waiver, your application will be incomplete and will not be reviewed for admission.\"\n\nThis is from the application fee waiver form of Villanova. Why is the wording so weird? So do I have to pay the fee or not lol? Also, how am I supposed to pay for the application fee when I have already submitted the Common Application?",
