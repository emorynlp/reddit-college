  "text": "hey guys, I was really interested in becoming a certified EMT (in NYC) at 17. I\u2019m probably not even gonna put it down for college apps bc ima senior rn but I genuinely wanna do clinical work - would anyone here that is an EMT, or is working towards EMT certification, have advice on getting started?",

      "text": "The thing is... when would you have time to do all that? The certification process will take a while with all the classes you need and the tests you need to pass. Then you may need even more certifications depending on where you intend to work. Keep in mind this is going on during school and college apps season. Then you would need to apply for a job and you would be extremely busy with that all the time, given you are in NYC. I dont see any way you could viable fit working as an EMT into your schedule without making significant sacrifices. Maybe you could really focus on getting certified over the year then work over the summer before college. But I dont think any company would want to hire someone to work for two months only for them to leave.",
