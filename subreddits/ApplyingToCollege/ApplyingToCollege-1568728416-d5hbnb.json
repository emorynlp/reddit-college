It lacks substance. \n\nbut I mean, like.. this is how life freaking works? I don\u2019t think I ever got a second to catch my breath and find closure with my trauma. Is it because I suppressed my emotions? Possibly. But how is that wrong? As much as I want to be like a chevalier in my own story, it\u2019s fucking hard. Is my suffering simply not valuable, because I failed to differentiate it from the rest of the crowd. It fucking baffles me how AOs think it is okay to undermine a young person\u2019s pain. \n\nSure, from an AO\u2019s POV, I will never know what it is like to read the same story a thousand times, but still. It\u2019s human suffering. Why be so insensible about it?",

Hopefully I can get some sympathy in the process. For me the struggle is remembering that I'm not using it as an advantage because the whole thing is a giant gaping disadvantage. Idk if that's something you struggle with but I think it's important to keep in mind. Good luck with the process. \n\nAnd if it's any consolation, people throughout your life will try to quantify your pain. Those people are not worth spending energy on. Pain is unique and relative and everyone's experience is valid.",

When your sense of incredulousness transcends your ability to create sentences with unwavering subjectivity, you prefer to distance yourself from the scene, and simultaneously merge with readers\u2019 perspectives as the like-minded witness that is overlooking the situation. You become relatable, yet devoid of any consequences you may have when uttering the line, \u201cWhat the fuck is this then\u201d, The destruction of the subjective syntax creates an aberration within the structured order of events as the protagonist exits the event in an attempt to prevent the death of individual syntax and relatability. This responsibility is not that individual\u2019s -- when uttered onto the physical medium in a way that unites many different people, relating the same discrepancies they themselves faced when they said something that shattered the societal structure around them, the so-called responsibility transcends the shackles of the mortal belief of right and wrong. \u201cWhat the fuck is this then\u201d becomes an icon which reminds millions of scared souls that they are not alone in their mistakes, and can continue on their journeys as one.

Got a little rough around March/april again but was good other than that\n\nSo sr year is rough September-December (unless u finish ur apps early) and March-April \n\nIn my experience the senioritis begins around first sem finals (before or after depends) so good luck lmao",
