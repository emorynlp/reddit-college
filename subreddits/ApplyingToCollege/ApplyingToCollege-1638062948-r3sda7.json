  "text": "Hi,\n\nJust got a flyer in the mail from ASU. Currently a National Merit Semi-finalist, awaiting Finalist status.\n\nThe flyer says \"As a National Merit Finalist or one of College Board National Recognition Program Awardees, you may be eligible for...\". I realize that the latter is something I don't qualify for. So, is this confirmation that I'm a finalist?\n\nDid anyone else get this? Thanks!",
