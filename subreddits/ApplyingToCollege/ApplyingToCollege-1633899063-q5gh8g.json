      "text": "Getting an interview:\n\nthere are two main ways you can get one -- you either sign up for one or receive an offer to interview from the college itself. the former can happen before or after submitting your application, depending on the school, and the latter seems to only be after submitting applications. you can find out a school's policy on interviews by doing some googling around.\n\nWhat goes on:\n\neither an officer, alumn, current student, or faculty member interviews you. Especially for alumn and student interviews, these are more like conversations than anything. You'll be asked to introduce yourself and various questions about you, your desire to attend the college, etc. (some basic ones include \"why us\" and \"tell me about you/your school/a hobby\"). specific questions could be found by googling the school name and interview questions, just look for posts and videos by people who interviewed there.",
