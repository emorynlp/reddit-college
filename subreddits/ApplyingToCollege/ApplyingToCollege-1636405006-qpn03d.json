  "text": "I\u2019m not very good at improvising conversation and I think my application truly represents me. If I decline my offered interview will it show up as declined to admission officers or just show up as not interviewed? Also is rejecting the interview really the best choice for my situation?",

      "text": "If offered an interview, your turning it down demonstrates disinterest, aloofness, superior attitude, or immaturity (Or all of these attributes),,,I could go on, but none are a good look. This is not to predict how any given AO will feel, but if I were interested in you as an applicant, I would be interested in finding out why. If you have social anxiety, now would be a good time to take steps to mitigate the problem. This interview is just a moment in time.",
