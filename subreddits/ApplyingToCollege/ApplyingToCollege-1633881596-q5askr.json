They should be even harsher to be more realistic.\n\nThe thing is though, a lot of what's \"good\" and what's \"bad\" depends on your demographics, even when you have no hooks. If you are an unhooked white male in humanities, for instance, then a 1540 on the SAT is a great score; on the other hand, if you are an unhooked Asian male in CS from the Bay Area, then anything below 1580 is garbage. People like me cannot afford to score a 1540 on the SAT or take 4 years of choir. Even supposedly \"strong\" ECs like USAMO or research with a professor don't guarantee us anywhere. So just think of the standards from the perspective of an unhooked Asian male in CS from a competitive magnet school in a competitive area, and it will make more sense.",

Once you get past a certain threshold, say a 1520, any increase to your SAT will barely help you at all, even compared to other Asian Bay Area CS applicants. And 4 years of choir instead of 4 years of study halls helps you more than it hurts you; it shows involvement in your school community and an interest (and talent if you reach a high level) in something, however unrelated to your it may be. \n\n>Even supposedly \"strong\" ECs like USAMO or research with a professor don't guarantee us anywhere.\n\nOf course it doesn't. The rest of your application needs to be good, too, and most essays just aren't. And while most LORs are decent, since no teacher is going to write an actively negative one, few are very helpful to the student because most students don't connect with their teachers on a personal level and instead just do well in their class and expect a bomb LOR. People vastly overestimate the quality of their essays and LORs, so when they don't get in, they start blaming their stats and ECs instead.",

If the extra AP classes are very major-related, then fine, but adding AP World History in 9th grade instead of choir when you're going a CS major isn't going to do much for you, especially if your school has a strong and well-known choir program. \n\n>people also vastly overestimate the importance of them. Essays and LORs only make a difference in the edge cases where they truly stand out.\n\nThis is self-contradictory. They're not important, but they can make a student truly stand out? Plus, when students are so close in stats, they're not going to look for which student's SAT is 20 points higher, or which student did slightly better in USAMO. No, they're going to look at the essays and LORs and see which student they want at their school. If neither student has very good essays or LORs, then unless their ECs/awards are out of this world (even more so than the typical Asian Bay Area CS applicant), then neither will get in.",

Do you seriously think a student's carefully edited 500-word essay written over several months that's been looked at by a college consultant says anything about what they are actually like? And virtually every rec letter says that the student is mature and pleasant to be around, or something along those lines. As long as you are a somewhat normal person, colleges literally can't tell how \"mature\" or \"fun to be around\" you are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, AOs are people, too. I\u2019d rather take a 1500, 3.9 GPA kid who\u2019s mature and seems like a fun guy than a 1600 4.0 Olympiad robot with limited interests outside of niched math competitions.\n\nBut you are not an AO. If AOs thought like you, then T20s should be filled with popular, attractive, well-rounded kids, and yet these \"olympiad robots\" tend to be the most successful in college admissions.",
