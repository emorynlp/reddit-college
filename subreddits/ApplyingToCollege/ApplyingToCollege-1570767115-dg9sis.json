          "text": "Beeeeecause telling positive stories about ourselves is a hard thing to do without sounding humble-braggy or flat out egotistical, but it is possible. The trick is to practice, and a first draft is an excellent starting place. \n\nIt's okay for a first draft to be terrible. In fact, it's helpful to write a first draft secure in the knowledge that no one ever has to read it if you don't want them to. \n\nIf you're having trouble coming up with ideas, here's a list of questions I came up with to help my students brainstorm essay material. I recommend reading each prompt and jotting down whatever comes to mind, then choosing one or two ideas to develop for 15 minutes or so. It's especially helpful to work on these questions by hand. \n\nThe whole exercise can take anywhere from 1-30+ min per prompt and result in some excellent ideas to use in your short and long application responses. I've designed these questions to be helpful to personal development and self-awareness, too, so writing about them can have a cathartic, journal-like feel that eases some of the stress and anxiety of applications. \n\nWhen do you feel happiest? Why do you think that is? \n\nWhat are the biggest obstacles in your path to your ideal future? \n\nHow would your closest friend describe you? \n\nHow do you deal with frustration? (*It's often helpful to keep in mind that frustration is just thinking something different should be happening.) \n\nWhich intellectual areas can you benefit from developing? \n\nDescribe a strong childhood memory. Why do you think it's so vivid? \n\nHow do you respond to change? \n\nWhat's one specific way you've grown as a person in the past year? \n\nWhat do you bring to your community? \n\nWhat physical place has importance to you? Why? \n\nWhat is your favorite (kind of) game? What specifically do you appreciate? \n\nWhat person close to you has had a significant, positive impact on who you are today. Why? \n\nWhat is one of your best qualities? How do you use and/or develop it? \n\nWho is someone that you have helped or would like to help someday? How did/would you assist them? \n\nWhat item in your room catches your eye? What meaning does it hold for you? \n\nWhat's a topic you could talk about for hours? It could be political, nerdy, personal, etc. Why do you think you could talk so easily at length about it? \n\nWhen you think of the word \"punchable,\" what or who comes to mind? Why do you think that is? \n\nWhat\u2019s something that\u2019s true that very few people agree with you on? \n\nWhat\u2019s something that makes you feel proud? \n\nWhat are you afraid of? Is your fear blocking you from doing what you want? What do you think your fear(s) could be trying to signal you to learn?\n\nWhen you get ready to write a full draft, keep these tips in mind: \n\nDo: \n- get to the point without being flowery \n- write something you'd be interested in reading \n- stay focused and relate everything you say to your thesis \n- include precise, related references/examples & analyze each carefully \n- use active voice and proper punctuation \n- be as clear and concise as possible \n- match your formality level to the nature of your writing \n- draw the reader into your world and way of seeing things \n- ask many peers / available adults to be your readers/editors \n\nDon't: \n- use jargon without clearly explaining it \n- generalize or forget to include specific examples \n- just list your extracurriculars or other information available elsewhere in your application \n- use passive voice or inconsistent tenses \n- include unnecessary / pretentious / unrelated references \n\nIf you'd like professional, personalized editing, essay tutoring sessions are available here. Good luck, y'all ~ dm me your responses or questions if you want :)",

Because, while it's necessary to see what's over the next hill, rushing around the bend can make you miss what you already have. We all need to take time to appreciate the simple beauty of being alive, of being present. Even if it's a just a few moments every day, you need to stop and smell the roses. Life's too short as it is, there's really no benefit to wasting it. To quote John Lennon: \"Life's what happens when your making other plans.\"",

Colleges will back away from language like that without a second thought; they don't want mental health issues.  They get plenty of them of course, some probably caused by the application process itself, but Admissions is not your therapist!\n\nThis is probably a heavily used essay idea already, so try to have something clever or different in it.  It's an experience that every single one of the applicants goes through.",
