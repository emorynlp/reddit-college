  "text": "So the two main colleges that I want to apply to I have applied to for early action. I have an above average SAT and GPA for both of these schools, as well as (in my opinion) a very strong common app essay and supplemental. I've been a pretty consistent B+ - A- student, with my Junior year being my strongest year. Like I said, all that I have left to do this year is to wait for me to be accepted, as well as submit my apps to reach colleges in December. How important are my grades this year? I'm going to try to at least stay above an 85 in all of my classes, will this suffice?",
