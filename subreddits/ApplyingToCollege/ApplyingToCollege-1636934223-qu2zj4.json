      "text": "I wouldn't worry as it's just one grammatical error, and as far as I know, most portals aren't for essay updates/fixes, mostly for supplemental materials, checklists, contact, etc. Most people are going to find at least one grammar error in their essays, so it's super common. While I'm not an AO, I'd imagine most won't care about a few errors like that, so the error itself won't lessen your chances, but emailing about it may make AOs think that you're a bit hyper fixated on it, so I wouldn't bother. Whatever you decide, good luck!",
