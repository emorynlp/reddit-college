  "text": "I\u2019m going to explain my situation and hope that someone can help me out since at this point idk what to do. I\u2019m a early business major, and I took an English Class for the credits and shit, but I have this incredibly beyond shitty teacher. Basically I could write an entire essay that is great, and that other people in my class say is great but if I miss a colon, she makes my grade an 85. It\u2019s impossible to win with her and idk what to do at this point. Over half the class has dropped it, and I thought I could stick around for the sake of not losing my grant. I have the federal pell grant paying for my tuition and I have already dropped two classes. There\u2019s no way to win with her, and I currently have an F despite anything I do. No matter how many times I try to get better, she won\u2019t explain. Admin, says they have no complaints despite what everyone is saying. Basically admin is useless. I\u2019m emailing the dean, but that might take too long. Also that professor a bunch of bad reviews.\n\nSo my question (plz help y\u2019all) will I lose my grant if I drop this class. And what are my options?\n\nI\u2019m a good student too. My gpa was a 3.75, idk now. I don\u2019t want to fail.\n\nTysm in advance for everyone\u2019s help.",
