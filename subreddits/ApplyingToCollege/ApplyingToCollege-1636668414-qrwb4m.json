  "text": "Hello everyone. I am a senior in high school and have submitted nearly all of my college applications early action. Senioritis has struck me pretty hard and I have not worked very hard this year. I am a straight A student in my Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior years, but I just got a C in a class first term Senior year. I applied to some pretty selective schools, and I\u2019m wondering how big of an impact this will have on my possibility of acceptance. Do they care much about senior grades? Did I just royally fuck myself in getting into a good college by getting a C?",

One C among all other A\u2019s wont\u2019 be significantly impactful. Lower grades will impact more.",
