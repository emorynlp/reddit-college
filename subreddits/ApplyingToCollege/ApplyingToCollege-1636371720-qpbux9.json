Just because it was a graded subject with exams doesn\u2019t make it a subject that the UCs count.  For example, my daughter (California resident) took PE and Health.  Both classes were graded and had papers/exams.  These classes are not considered by the UCs. My guess is that your PE class will not factor in to your UC GPA.",
