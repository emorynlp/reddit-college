  "text": "Sup awesome people\n\nPretty much the title. I suffer from several mental illnesses (adhd and anxiety to name a couple) that make it incredibly difficult to get decent grades even without hard honors/AP classes.\n\nSo yeah, can anyone comment any stories of people in a similar situation as me, who got into decent schools? Preferably not people who have multi-AP classes and honors cause I'm already melting down over just one. If this question was already asked, please link it.\n\nThanks everyone",

      "text": "I had a super successful college applications process relative to what I should have gotten. I struggled with ADHD and anxiety a lot in high school, has a 3.4 cumulative unweighted GPA by the time I applied to schools but that was with an upward trajectory, my worst semester (sophomore year) I had a 2.7. Overall I only took two AP classes in high school, AP Calc and AP Stats, and a few other honors courses but not many. What made my application work was strong essays, one really good rec letter, and extracurriculars. I did a summer teaching job for two summers that was pretty intense and I had a number of speech and debate awards. I\u2019m currently a freshman at a school with a <20% acceptance rate. I\u2019m not sure what year you\u2019re in, but I\u2019d be happy to talk with you or answer any questions you have about the process.",

              "text": "Yeah for sure.\n\nI was accepted to my state university (nothing super competitive), DePaul University, Kenyon College, American University, and Pitzer College.\n\nI think my biggest tip is to play to your strengths and pick schools that prioritize those strengths. Pitzer, the most competitive school I got into, seemed to value GPA less than other similarly competitive schools, and really prioritized essays and ECs. I knew it wasn\u2019t worth my time to apply to Pomona or Claremont McKenna, for example, because even though those are on the surface very similar they value GPA much more than Pitzer. That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t apply to reaches, I obviously did, and I got rejected from some very competitive schools that I knew were a long shot like Carleton or NYU. But on those applications I also tried to focus attention on the best parts of my app, it just didn\u2019t work out with them like it did with Pitzer, Kenyon, or AU.",

That's good enough for most Cal State schools if you aren't going for an especially competitive major, and for auto admissions at schools like ASU or Missouri  (Mizzou might need an ACT or SAT to go with it).",

Although they didn't get into a really great university, they went to a solid-state school and now run a successful business. You want to know if having a adhd/anxiety will make up for you lower grades? It won't, you'll probably go to a normal state school. In college you'll still probably have some form of what you have now. BUT in the long run I've no doubt you could do amazing things and have a good career (which is the real goal anyway)",
