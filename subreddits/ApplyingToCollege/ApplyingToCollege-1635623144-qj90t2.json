  "title:": "Should I study astrophysics in France or Canada?",
  "text": "I'm in last year of high-school and have chosen to study astrophysics after graduation ( and hopefully get a PhD one day). It's getting bad where I live but I have the option to get a student visa to either Canada or France, in hope of staying long enough to get the nationality. I chose Canada and France specifically because I have an uncle in each country, which will make my time there a lot easier; I speak French and English fluently, although I have passed the DELF B2 exam and not the SAT, so I guess it's either France or French Canadian universities.\n\n  Let's not forget, after getting a PhD in astrophysics, will I have a hard time finding work in either France or Canada?",
