  "text": "Rn I'm a sophomore in HS, and I plan to go somewhere in the medical field in the future (Family Physician, PA, or Psychology). I don't plan on going to an Ivy League, but I want to apply to UMich, Michigan State, and a handful of other colleges as well (the first two are my top choices tho). I feel like I'm not doing enough to achieve that though, and I feel rlly behind on everything.\n\n\nI'm not sure if being in regular math classes (I'm in Geometry as a sophomore) is going to push me back/make me a weaker applicant? Everyone else seems to be really ahead of the game :(\n\n\nI also don't have any volunteer work/jobs/shadowing/experience as of now. I've applied to two local hospitals but idk if I'll even get in.\n\nAdvice?",

      "text": "More advanced classes will make you a stronger applicant, but it's not like you can't get into a good college if you are just going at grade level as long as you do well in your courses.  It sounds like you are on pace for pre-calc as a senior, and that's fine. \n\nThe average student at Michigan State had a 3.75 high school GPA (based on how many in their common data set show up as 4.0, I would assume that includes a lot of weighted GPAs), and an average SAT in the low 1200s if you want a broader perspective on what you should be aiming for.\n\nKeep seeking out opportunities, but COVID has made those tougher to find.  In the meantime, try to stay active and involved in things in ways that you can.  It doesn't have to be some specifically targeted medical interest if those aren't available - a regular part time job, school clubs, band, sports, volunteering in your community, etc. are totally fine.",

      "text": "I just got into MSU with a 3.6 (you can see more specifics about my stats in my post history), and also took geometry as a sophomore. \n\nYou absolutely don\u2019t need perfect grades to get into MSU or any college\u2026 as long as it\u2019s not a T20. What I found to help a lot is to be well rounded, it made up for my lack of perfect grades and I ended up doing relatively well for myself. \n\nHonestly, the best advice I can give is to stop looking at this sub as a sophomore, you\u2019re going to drive yourself crazy. \n\nOf course, U of M is a different story compared to MSU, I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend like I was even considering Michigan. But you shouldn\u2019t worry about specifics of college applications yet, just try your best and start looking at your options when that time comes.",
