  "text": "How are u guys practicing self-care during this time period, especially those of u who are applying to lots of more selective colleges? Also, how are you dealing with writing burnout with your essays and the writers block that comes with it?\n\nI\u2019m applying to 14 so I\u2019m pretty busy especially with AP classes and honors applications and scholarships.\n\nFor self-care I play \u201cCelebration\u201d after submitting an essay, hang out with my boyfriend, journal, and try to go on a short walk outside or do something with my hands like drawing or volunteering.",

I also spend a load of time with my grandma, watching TV and reading books together. Reminding myself every day that I will be happy wherever I end up (and I know I will be) has brought me a great calmness. Everything gets better, always.",
