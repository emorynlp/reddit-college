  "text": "So I presently am applying for school, and in my freshman year I didn\u2019t do so great in Algebra 1. I unfortunately failed the standardized test for it twice, and was dealing with some pretty unfortunate life circumstances then. It was a chaotic time in my life. \n\nMy grades in math did rise since then and I scored pretty well in geometry and all the math classes I took thereafter. My final math standardized test was senior year, and I scored well. Now that I\u2019m applying to school though, the 2 bad scores are still there. If they compare my grades from then until my most recent, will those grades still hurt me? I\u2019m applying for a foundation program for context.",

      "text": "Most standardized state tests are used to evaluate schools, not to evaluate students for admission to college.  So for example, Illinois used to require students to take the Prairie State Achievement Examination, but it was never reported to any college and no colleges asked for individual scores.",
