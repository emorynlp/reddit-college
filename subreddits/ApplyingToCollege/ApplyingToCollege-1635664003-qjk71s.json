      "text": "Hi CatInAMechSuit,\n\nI can\u2019t say with 100% accuracy since I haven\u2019t written a teacher recommendation in a few yrs (since I stopped being a public school teacher). That being stated, I recall basically receiving an email from the common app in which I make my own portal.\n\nIt basically took me to a page that only showed the student name and if it was submitted or not. On it, it gave me the options to evaluate the student (clicking on attributes for leadership and so on) along with uploading recommendation letter pdf. I don\u2019t recall it providing any personal information asides from name of the student.",
