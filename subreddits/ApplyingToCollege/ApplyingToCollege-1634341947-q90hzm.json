              "text": "Yeah, I feel like it might be a bit... informal for your essay. Unless you are using the term in some kind of dialogue, I would avoid it. Your definition of \"Karen\" as a \"middle-aged, overweight, white woman\" may be coined offensive if used in that context. Describing someone in your essay in a derogatory manner can show immaturity. You want to present personal qualities of yourself that would make you appealing in a college campus scenario.",
