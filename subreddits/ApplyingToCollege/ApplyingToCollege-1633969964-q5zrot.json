It's about telling the reader about yourself on a more personal level, and indirectly giving them a reason they NEED to accept you. They only added the prompts to help students get started. Just start writing, and by the end you'll find you'll probably have answered one or more of the prompts (if you find you've answered more than one just pick the one that's most relevant or pick 7).",
