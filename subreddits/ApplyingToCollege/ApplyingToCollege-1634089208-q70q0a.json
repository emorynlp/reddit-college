  "text": "i'm so conflicted right now about where to ED - i'm just swinging back and forth between random schools that I don't know anything about or i just romanticize for absolutely no reason>!>! \n\nwhich schools would you guys say have like a chill, laid-back, or \"fun\" culture? not necessarily just talking about the party scene, but in general - the people, activities, the type of campus where you can just play frisbee w/ strangers in the middle of the day on random fields, etc. a nice selection of parties would be great too, but it's not a necessity for me. i would also prefer a non-pressure cooker environment LOL\n\nso, mostly, i'm looking for schools like \n\n1. schools w/ chill, liberal-artsy vibes like Brown, Tufts, Barnard, etc (for context, brown is like my dream school but idk if i wanna waste my ed there bc its pretty unrealistic for me)\n2. schools w/ a super active student body n lots of activities, super chill like UCLA, UMich, USC, etc\n3. schools in the city, within the vicinity of a city, or at least not very secluded etc\n\nfeel free to suggest schools that fit any of the three descriptions above - thank u so much!!!",

      "text": "If you don\u2019t have a school in mind, I wouldn\u2019t apply ED. ED is meant for people who are 100% sure about 1 school being their dream school. You wouldn\u2019t want to regret committing early when you end up falling in love with another school. It doesn\u2019t seem like you are confident in a choice/school yet; which is perfect fine! ED is an option, not a requirement. Don\u2019t rush into a commitment you aren\u2019t ready for! \n\nAs for the school you\u2019re \u201cdescribing\u201d UVA has a lot of those features. I can always looks out my window and see people playing spike all or some other yard game. The party life here is pretty big, but there is def some pressure going to a prestigious school. UVA is a liberal-arts school with those options, and has over 400 clubs. Charlottesville is kinda it\u2019s own small city, but everything you\u2019ll need is within a mile of grounds (aka restaurants, hotels, malls, etc.)",

Otherwise, don't ED anywhere, because if you did, then that could end up being worse if you get into your ED as well as another school you'd rather go to.\n\nTLDR: You have a dream school that offers ED. It's a no-brainer.",

I needed this",
