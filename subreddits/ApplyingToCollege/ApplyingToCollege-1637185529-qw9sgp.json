  "title:": "A college I\u2019m interested in is ignoring a question I have about admissions. What do I do?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a homeschooled student so my situation is a bit different than most public school students, and this school is really specific about their required classes. I emailed their general admissions two weeks ago and got no response, figured I may have emailed the wrong office, and emailed the admissions counselor for my region instead. It\u2019s been several days and I haven\u2019t heard back yet. \n\nMy question wasn\u2019t stupid and it\u2019s a logical thing to ask about as a homeschooled student. Additionally, this isn\u2019t a selective or high ranking school, it\u2019s not like I was trying to email Harvard. \n\nI\u2019m just feeling kind of embarrassed I guess, and I\u2019m starting to think less of the school. At what point should I follow up? Do I give up on getting an answer? I don\u2019t want to humiliate myself in case I do apply.",

I would give them a call, even if just to put your email at the top of their list. Also, I am a homeschooler turned AO, so feel free to DM me if it\u2019s a general question :)",
