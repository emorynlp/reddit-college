People don't judge people based on what school they are in. Friend groups don't form based on school, but personality, interests, and occasionally similar classes. Also, no one really cares how you got in. Then again, I'm just a freshman who's been here for 4 weeks, and I'm not a hotelie. Please don't let this reason deter you from applying and hopefully enrolling. If you are that concerned, I would ask an upperclassman hotelie, though I really wouldn't be worried about this at all.",

I believe Cornell has their acceptances by college in their site if you do a bit of digging, if you want actual numbers. Also I don't think SAT optional will hurt you, but I would try and take one to see what you could get.",

I know plenty of people who haven't done something like this though. Also had good STEM grades in HS. While not having many stem things may hurt your chances a little, it definitely won't exclude you. \n\nFor the essay, do your research about classes, extracurriculars, etc and describe how you could effectively use what's unique at Cornell to help you in your life. State your current (academic or non academic) interests and state how Cornell specifically will help foster a great environment to help you drive deeper into those interests, if you know what I mean. Some examples are project teams, specific classes, things on campus, etc. \n\nSorry about the late reply.",

And yes, they do not offer an Aero major. \n\nI have no clue how good the program is, as I really didn't look into aero/mechE. Ask other people or look at some rankings or something (rankings are also not the best measure of how good a program is). \n\nWhile I have not looked into research opportunities, there are many opportunities where you can do something as a MechE major. Project teams are the big ones. Most project teams have mechanical subteams, and they are all very cool. [Look into them](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/special-programs/project-teams/active-project-teams). My basic knowledge of the availability of research labs is that there are a decent amount of labs that do look for undergraduate students to work in them. \n\nI really don't think you being an international student will limit any opportunities.\n\nI hope this helped.",
