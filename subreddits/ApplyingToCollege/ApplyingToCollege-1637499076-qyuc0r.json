      "text": "**Arizona State -** Great safety to have. Awesome residential honors college, nice campus, warm weather, and so many majors and fields of study given its large undergrad population. Surprisingly high starting salaries and post-graduation opportunities for CS. It's in Tempe, Arizona, a sprawling area next to Phoenix.\n\n**UCLA, UCSD, UCI, UC Berkeley -** UC schools have great CS programs. I'd also include UCSB and UCSC but they're more suburban/in less major cities. Two things to note about UC schools: a. they cost $62k-$67k a year to attend as a non-California resident, and they do not offer need-based financial aid to non-California residents, and b. They are test blind, meaning that they do not take ACT or SAT scores into consideration for admissions.\n\n**USC, Santa Clara -** USC is quite selective, Santa Clara is not super selective, but still competitive- less so than USC though. Both are great schools if you want to go into CS.\n\n**Georgia Tech -** Great CS/STEM programs, and the South is rapidly expanding in regards to technology/computer sectors. Atlanta, North Carolina, Northern Virginia, Austin TX, etc are all becoming hubs for young professionals in the field of technology.\n\n**Northeastern, Boston University, MIT** (if you really want to shoot for the stars) **-** Boston is an awesome city for college students. SO much to eat, see, and do, and because of the number of universities in the Boston area, there's a lot of fun things geared towards college students. Northeastern is unique in that all students take a 5-year program in which they do co-ops with companies in their intended field of study, which is pretty cool.\n\nI was going to include **UMN Twin Cities, UW Madison, U of Maryland, UPitt, Carnegie Mellon, Rice,** and **U of Washington,** but I don't have time to write descriptions for them.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck! :) \n\nAnd please use Google Maps; it's a really useful tool. Type in the name of the school, and then explore the surrounding area with the satellite tool as well as the street view tool, to get a feel of how the surrounding area corresponds with your preferences.",

          "text": "I would throw out that Santa Clara is a technically true answer to this question, but it's also a relatively suburban campus and probably not what OP thinks of in terms of a \"college in a big city\".  The redeeming feature is it's not a long Uber to downtown San Jose, but then again SJ isn't exactly a college town",
