      "text": "Yale student here\u2014don\u2019t stress too much about interviews!! Yale has said they only ask for them if they want more information on an applicant, so there\u2019s a chance you could be admitted with or without an interview. I would assume it\u2019s difficult to recruit alumni for international interviews, so I\u2019d worry even less if I was in your position. Good luck:)",
