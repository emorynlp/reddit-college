  "text": "Of course there\u2019s the group of people who might be high school age but are actually enrolled in grad school after starting college at ~12, but I\u2019m talking about the people (I fall into this category) who want the high school experience and social life, but also are really interested in a subject, enough so to take a grad class. Like, on your application, for top schools, would it be THAT unique/impressive, or is it more like \u201cbro we\u2019re MIT, we see this all the time\u201d?",
