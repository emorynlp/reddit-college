  "text": "So I took 5 aps throughout High school, 1 sophomore year and two last year. (My school has like 4000 people so it\u2019s really hard to get into aps), regardless, I got a 3 in apush 3 in capstone research and 5 in psych. I know those are really bad but then again I am human people mess up, I\u2019m not those kids who get perfects scores on everything. So I\u2019m applying to some prestigious schools and I was wondering if I should send them in. And I took all 3 of these tests online because that\u2019s when covid hit so that also messed me up. Idk help. Ty.",

      "text": "im an incoming psych major who does a lot of study for fun and while my advice might not be fully perfect i do think it\u2019s worth considering. psychologically, for the same reason that a 1500 is more likely to look good than a 1490(because of how we categorize things), one 5 is going to likely bring a better impression of you than 2 3\u2019s and a 5. and it may be less in volume, but i think the impression of a clean 5 record submitted is likely going to frame you in a better light. ONLY follow this if you agree and if you\u2019re interested in mostly t20 schools though, i\u2019m sure most don\u2019t pay that much attention to ap scores anyway",
