Except, if the nonprofit doesn't *actually* make a lasting positive change, it doesn't fill that niche on the application.\n\nSo, while making a new one is tempting because it's theoretically impressive, the only thing an AO would learn is that you (or maybe your parents) can fill out paperwork. Without demonstrable effects, the nonprofit is dead in the water.\n\nHence why working under an existing one is often more effective.",
