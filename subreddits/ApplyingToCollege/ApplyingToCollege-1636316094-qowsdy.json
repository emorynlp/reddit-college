  "text": "This might be a lot but I can't help but be stressed and worried about my application to colleges because I didn't get the chance to get involved at my school(s) and this year (junior year) I just impulsively decided on going to college after years of not knowing.\n\nMy freshman year, I moved into a whole new state from where I've grown up the past 14 years - I got involved a bit in clubs & volunteered but no outstanding leadership roles. COVID hit in the third quarter of that year, so my school pretty much closed and I passed all my classes with a 3.7 GPA. I built a few relationships with my AP World & English Honors teachers, but they were just awkwardly cut because of COVID.\n\nWhen my school shut down freshman year, I moved to another state and did my entire sophomore year virtual so there was ... absolutely no way for me to get involved or meet anyone. Plus, my mental health declined because of this due to the no social interaction = caused my grades to suffer. I ended up remediating my major grades in the summer tho.\n\nNow, it's my junior year and I'm in the same school as I was in my sophomore year, but I feel so stressed and forced to be in these clubs, build relationships with my teachers for recommendation letter time, get a job, and raise my GPA up to a 3.5 after last year's mess. COVID has really messed up my high school experience because **it's no fucking way that my first FULL year in ACTUAL high school is my junior year man :/.**\n\nI'm interested in going to school for anything music related because it's been a huge passion of mine that I've pursued since middle school. I've recorded songs in my bedroom, built a home studio,  released songs to SoundCloud (over 100k plays in total), collaborated with local artists and producers from across the US and even outside of it, and more when it comes to that. So, schools with a good and updated music program are what I'm interested in. My dream school & program is NYU Clive and I'm just so nervous because I know NYU is very selective, but I also have other schools that I'm looking into.\n\n**Any tips, recommendations, advice, methods? /** **Are colleges going to consider the impact of COVID on my class ('23) when it comes to reviewing transcripts & applications?**",

      "text": "I think the first you need to do is de-stress. It\u2019s really not healthy for you to be extremely stressed and anxious about college applications from now until June 2023. Spend some time doing things you enjoy to destress - playing music, playing sports, going for a run, video games, whatever works for you. \n\nGet engaged in extracurricular activities this year to explore your interests. Don\u2019t do anything for the specific purpose of a college application. \n\nDo your best work academically this year. Get to know your teachers as part of being in class with them. Just work hard, participate in class, and be yourself and recommendation letters will come when the time comes. \n\nThere are thousands of great universities across the U.S. Do a search on a site like Cappex to find universities that have music programs (and other aspects) that would be a good fit for you. \n\nhttps://www.cappex.com",
