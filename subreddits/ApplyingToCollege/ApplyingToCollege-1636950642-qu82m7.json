  "text": "This might be a dumb question, but I\u2019m eligible to receive Texas Tech\u2019s National Merit Scholarship which awards \u201c100% of federally approved cost of attendance\u201d, but I don\u2019t really know how big the scope of coverage is. Will this offer cover a double/triple major? What about expensive housing options or meal plans? \n\nIn a sense, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a cap to the amount of money a school will give to a student with a full ride or if it truly is a full-ride \u201cpay absolutely nothing\u201d offer.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not \u201cpay absolutely nothing\u201d it\u2019s we will give you money according to their [net price](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/financialaid/costtoattend.php). So they would only cover $3,652 in food for example. Each school runs it differently so they might only pay for food only through meal plan or housing only through dorms. Multiple majors doesn\u2019t mean increased cost, you might have difficulties when trying to take more classes than allocated with the standard tuition.",

      "text": "College tuition is a fixed amount, for full-time students, and scholarships will almost certainly be for that amount for 4 years maximum.\n\nIf you can fit the courses for double/triple major in eight semesters, then yes, it will be paid for. If additional majors requires extended timeframes, the additional costs would not be covered.\n\nCheck the fine print for details, but it likely covers the standard cost of attendance as defined by the school. Something like a standard, on-campus, double room and standard school meal plan.",

          "text": "Be aware that some state schools have a fixed tuition amount for a set number of credit hours, and if you take more than that there will be an additional charge. If you're only over by one for one semester it's pretty trivial, but if someone is planning to take an extra class every semester it can add up.",
