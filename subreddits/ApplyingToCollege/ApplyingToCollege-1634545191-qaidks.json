  "text": "The prompt asks to talk about your gender identity, expression or if you are part of lgtb community or not.\n\nI am not part of lgtb community but I am a female and identity as a girl/woman. Can I wrote about that as it comes under identity? More specifically how my identity has been impacted by my country and community and how I have grown to accept to accept my identity while breaking away from stereotypes and boxes that my country puts girls in? P.s. I come from a conservative, traditional country so I feel like I can talk about my identity in terms of that.",

          "text": "Okay so I was bullied pretty intensely all throughout middle school because I played volleyball. Lots of gay-slurs and the sorts. Now after puberty, I come off as a cis straight white man, and get treated as one. Sometimes I have conflicting feelings on whether I\u2019m bisexual. However, the stuff I went through in middle school leaves me wondering if those feelings are from the doubt my aggressors shoved into my mind, or if them using queerness as a way to insult me has morphed into a subconscious homophobia that prevents me from admitting to myself I am what they made picked on me for. Is this something I talk about in the LGBTQ+ box? Or is that box just a way to let them know what your identity is for demographics and stuff.",

An ally simply means you support us. You don\u2019t go through the same traumas we do. That\u2019s why the box is there. For us to talk about it.\n\nMy sister came out as trans and was abused further by my father. Im non-binary and I haven\u2019t dare to come out because of how they treat my sister. \n\nWe are lucky my dad didn\u2019t murder her. \n\nIf you are talking about the prompt that says:\n\n> if you\u2019d like to share perspective you bring or experience you\u2019ve had that would help us understand you better, perhaps a community you belong to or your family or cultural background, we encourage you to do so here.\n\nYou could talk about living in a conservative country as a woman, since that shaped your experience.",

Nobody should have to go through that. \n\nHopefully your family was supportive of you breaking away from the stereotypes. \n\nI hope you get accepted into Duke!",
