  "text": "So I sent my EA and ED schools my CSS profile on Nov 1. However, on the portal for one of my schools it says that they are awaiting it and that the CSS needs to have been filed by the 1st. I'm assuming filed means sent right? cus they can't expect to have already received it by the 1st? \n\nOh and how long does it usually take for the CSS to have been received?",
