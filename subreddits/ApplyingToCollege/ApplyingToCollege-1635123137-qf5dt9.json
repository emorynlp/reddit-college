  "text": "I am doing pretty well in my mock tests, consistently getting right answers and everything. The thirty second speaking part is fine as well. However, I find it uncomfortable to speak to a blank screen while being recorded, and so I get really awkward at the 1-3 minute interview part. The test says institutions have access to these recorded interviews, so will that 1 minute video affect my chances if I mess up? I nowhere in my application have mentioned anything remotely close to speeches or speaking so I dont think it would affect the credibility of my extracurriculars, but i am apprehensive about AOs having a minute long video of me stuttering into a camera.",
