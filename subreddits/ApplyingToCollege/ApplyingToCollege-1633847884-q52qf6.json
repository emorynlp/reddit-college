  "text": "I didn't have any prior coding knowledge when I took the AP Computer Science course in my Junior year and I got a 3, which I'm kinda disappointed about since I did good in the class and got an A. I'm applying to an in-state college which is known for its Computer Science department, but I feel like a 3 will hurt my chances of getting in. Will it affect my application if I decide to report it?",
