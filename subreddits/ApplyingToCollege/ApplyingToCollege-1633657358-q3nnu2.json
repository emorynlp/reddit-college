      "text": "I hit a very similar wall. I had come up with what I thought was a pretty clever, Big Brain\u2122 topic and I had struggled trying to execute it for weeks, only to realize that I hated it.\n\nOut of frustration, I started writing about some of my personal relationships and the people who had a big effect on me. This is typically considered a bad topic because it tends to show more about other people than it does you, but writing it helped me see how my values have evolved over the years, and how I\u2019ve grown as a person.\n\nThen I scrapped that too, took the concepts from it that resonated with me, and wrote an essay that I love. Moral of the story: it\u2019s awfully tricky to get to a final draft without a first draft.",
