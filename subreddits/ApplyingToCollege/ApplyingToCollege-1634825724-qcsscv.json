  "text": "3.96 out of 4.0 unweighted (An A is 93+ my one B is a 90). Weighted 4.0 out of 4.0. Honors get +3 points so my 90 -> 93 = A. Multiple 105s, 103s, etc because of weighting.\n\n32 Superstore ACT, 30 composite. No SAT\n\nAll of the highest courses offered taken, multiple APs, DE, honors etc.\n\nSpanish club 2 years, Art Club 1 year, FFA freshman year. Work between 16 and 28 hours a week at a fast food place. Usually have 5 hour shifts from 4-9:30 (30 min break). I draw digital art and edit with Photoshop, illustrator etc. Attended 6 week art class at local art center? Helped with a Halloween dog park event in 10th and 11th grade? Attended a high adventure camp with BSA (Venture Crew) over the summer. Didn't get into NHS cause I didn't demonstrate \"service\"  last year. Not going to attempt to get in this year.\n\nDecent LORs, I don't expect anything spectacular since I was virtual last year.\n\nEssay: Going to be absolute trash I don't even know what to write about \ud83d\ude2d.\n\nLow income, white, female, single parent household.\n\nMajor: something in stem, will probably apply as a biology major and change it to engineering or chemistry?\n\nWould prefer a private university, somewhat urban, mostly suburban or barely rural, location does not matter to me as long as it's not in Texas or the southwest, Alabama, or Mississippi",
