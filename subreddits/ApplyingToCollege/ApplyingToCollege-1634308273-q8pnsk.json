  "text": "Taking a standardized test in December. I got a 1400 on the SAT and took another practice test 2 days after and dropped to a 1310. So I\u2019m thinking if I should take the ACT or stick with the SAT and try to get a 1520\n\nMain problem is ALWAYS reading like I\u2019d get -19, but get -3 on writing, -3 on maths combined",

      "text": "If you\u2019re deciding what test to take, take both. Studying for one should help with the other and you don\u2019t have to submit a bad score. This may be much for some people but it worked for me. OR, I say take the ACT. Statistics show that your second and third SAT score are usually similar, so you may be better off with a fresh chance at ACT. I went from a 1440 SAT to 36 ACT with one month of hardcore grinding. Happy to talk you through what I did if you want:)",
