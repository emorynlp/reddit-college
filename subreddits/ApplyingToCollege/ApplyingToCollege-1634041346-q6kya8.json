  "text": "I was wondering whether it would be okay to get my two LORs from non core-class teachers. I was told that it was best to get LORs from only core classes, and avoid elective classes, but I\u2019m not especially close with any of my core class teachers. I wanted to ask my ASL teacher since I\u2019ve been in her class for three years and I have a leadership role in the ASLHS that she sponsors, and I wanted to ask my teacher for an education & leadership elective class that I took, because that is what I am planning to major in and I\u2019ve known her for years and talk to her often despite not having her class anymore. Would it be better for me to ask for LORs from my elective teachers who know me way better, or just ask my core class teachers with the possibility that they don\u2019t know me well enough? I will send them a brag sheet anyway, but I don\u2019t know if that would supplement our lack of interactions. Thank you in advance!",
