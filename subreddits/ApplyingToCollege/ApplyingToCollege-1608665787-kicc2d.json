  "text": "I\u2019ve been simping over Harvard for the past 4 years, and I know this woman was hoping I would get rejected. She constantly tries to screw me over lol. When she found out I got an A+ in her class, she gave me a minus on my report card on...wait for it...work habits\ud83e\udd21 We weren\u2019t even in school either. It was online. But I\u2019ve literally been fantasizing about her reaction when she finds out\ud83d\ude33 No one from my school has ever gotten into a top school before, so my school will probably post it on Facebook. And that means she\u2019s gonna see it, and my god I can\u2019t wait for her to see it\ud83d\ude03",

      "text": "lmfao i seriously dont even understand why people like this go into teaching??? like  you spend 6 years in university to do what... hate on highschool kids and get underpaid? idk u irl though so maybe you killed her husband or smth in which case its a lil diff but lmao. also ive heard of horror stories where people ask for ref letters from teachers, they agree happily, and SHIT on the kid in the letter? like im not that close with my recs so idk if they secretly hate me? i was hoping if that was the case theyd just decline to write a letter but to know that some people will purposefully accept so they can prevent kids from getting into university (the same letters are sent to EVERY uni im applying to) both scares me and appalls me. that little rant out of the way though, congratulations on harvard thats amazing",

I\u2019ll always accept your request to write a letter, but it might not be positive.\u201d The German teacher told us he has a template and writes the same letter for every kid, but he also said he ranks his students based on how well he knows them, and if he doesn\u2019t know them well, he purposely misspells words. And this is random, but I\u2019m going to complain about it anyway lol. My 3rd grade teacher literally tried to convince my parents I\u2019m \u201cbright but in the autistic sort of way\u201d and don\u2019t belong in a school with normal kids. My 4th grade teacher straight up hated children and said he wanted to hurt us.\n\nOn a more positive note, all the AP teachers in the latter half of high school were very lovely, intelligent, and dedicated to helping students learn.",

This was their uni professor, whom they trusted. The professor apparently did the same thing to another person who applied for a job where I work.
