  "text": "Ok so I'm applying for direct admit into the UW-Madison business school as a finance major.\n\n I have taken the ACT twice, the first one was a 32 (34E 33M 33R 28S) and the second one was a 33 (35E 31M 33R 33S), Since I am a finance major, which is heavily math reliant, I was wondering if I should submit the 32 with a 33 on the math section or the 33 with a 31 in math.\n\nAny insight on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",
