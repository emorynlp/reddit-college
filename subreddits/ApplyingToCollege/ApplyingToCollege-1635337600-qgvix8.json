The thing is, I\u2019ve sent an Ielts electronic score report from my official test site, but I don\u2019t see its status (whether Rice has received it or not) unlike my SAT score ( which they have received ).\n\nSo how can I make sure that they have received my Ielts score? Do I email them?",

I had them sent to Rice on \\[DATE\\] so I was hoping you could confirm that you have received them\u201d will do the trick. Write from the email account used for your application and include any applicant ID number you may have received.\n\nPS - When they respond to tell you \u201cyes, we have them\u201d do NOT reply saying \u201cthanks.\u201d They are getting a zillion emails an hour this week\u2026 they don\u2018t need one more.",
