  "text": "For context my school offers no AP classes, honors classes, IB classes, foreign language classes, extracurriculars, or class choice ( students are often assigned classes at random. I can\u2019t get into chemistry because of this. ) there are also only three electives ( gym, art, and dig lit ). Transferring schools is not an option, homeschooling, and online school are not options.",

Make the most of the time you have, participate in extra curriculars, maybe take some supplemental online classes or petition your school to make some higher level options. \n\nColleges you apply to understand that not everyone has every opportunity, so you won\u2019t have no chance, but you do need to make the most of what you have if you have high hopes.",
