      "text": "For most colleges, your counselor will need to send a mid-year transcript and a final transcript.\n\nIn the US, the final transcript lists all courses and grades from 9-12 (assuming applicant attended the same school for 4 years). Some international schools don't have a 4 year transcript on one page, do if that's your case, the final transcript with your 12th grade marks is fine, assuming the uni already has your 9-11.",

But, these grades are not certain as teachers who evaluated my work gave her marks very fast and there is a risk that my real grades for the junior year will be different from the sent to colleges ones. Will colleges ask for it again ?",
