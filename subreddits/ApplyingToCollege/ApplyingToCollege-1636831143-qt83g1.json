  "text": "Hey guys! I know I posted before but a lot of the comments were telling me what safeties to add instead of which far reaches to remove. I have safeties but this is just all far reaches because I just to narrow down that list. \n\nBrown\n\nTufts\n\nYale\n\nStanford \n\nUPenn\n\nColumbia\n\nDuke \n\nUSC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw I am thinking about going into premed but I am not entirely sure. Some possibly majors/interests are business, psych, bio, architecture, and (film but more minor and for fun). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a more small-medium school with a work hard play hard energy but also having it be not so competitive. Like people aren't making friends just for prof. connections. More traditional college: school spirit etc. But also good for career opportunities. A lot of these schools I was unable to visit in person so its hard for me to get that feeling. But I want someplace that feels like home? I know that's super cheesy but I struggled with making friends in hs and I just really want to be able to find my people in college. Ok, you probably did not need to know all of that. Anyways, as for physical location, I like more urban areas that still feel collegey? Like Yale for example. The opposite would be like NYU where its more city and less traditional college which I don't like. Like it has to have a campus, I know Columbia is in the city but it has a campus yk. Like hangouts could be in the dorms but sometimes we want have a city girl moment. Anyways I have no idea why I am telling you guys all of this. Also as for people environment, I am looking for people who are truly passionate at what they do and are open to new things...adventurous what not. Not uptight and neurotic. More openminded. Anyways, I look forward to hearing your responses :))))",

I heard arnd 50% come in as premed, does this make things competitive for premeds? What was it like for you making friends there? How comparable were you with them? What is the dating culture tjere like, more hookups etc? What do people do for fun since it\u2019s kind of a small city? Would you say it\u2019s safe there, I heard it\u2019s dangerous outside of campus but dk if that\u2019s true. What are you majoring in? Is it easy to switch majors? Do they give good financial aid? Are the people more southern like or northeast type?",
