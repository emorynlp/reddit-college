  "text": "I WAS SENT A REJECTION LETTER YESTERDAY. LEHIGH WAS MY EARLY DECISION AND OH BOY DID I BAWL MY EYES OUT. \n\nA FEW HOURS AGO THEY SENT AN APOLOGY LETTER THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE AND ACCEPTED ME. \n\nNOW I AM CRYING WITH TEARS OF JOYYYYY. \n\nSTEVE HARVEY 2.0 \n\nLEHIGH YOU SUNNUVABICH I LOVE YOU!!\n\nEdit: I am thinking of deleting this post cuz I speculate the apology email was actually for the new acceptance letter. \nI have emailed Lehigh. \nSuch an unprofessional behavior. I mean shame on you guys. Thank God I didn't withdraw my applications. \n\nDepauw and Drexel came thru with 40K worth of aid SO FUCK LEHIGH.",
