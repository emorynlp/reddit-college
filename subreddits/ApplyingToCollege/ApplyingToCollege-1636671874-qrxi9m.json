  "text": "So I didn\u2019t notice the spot to self report my ap scores on the commonapp for my ED application (submitted on October 31st) and I\u2019d still like to send my ap scores. I contacted my admissions counselor and he said that they can be sent through email, however I\u2019m not sure how I should do it. Do I send the unofficial score report found on the college board website or do I just type out the courses and scores in the email? I was leaning towards the latter since there\u2019s a 3 that I don\u2019t really want to send and the unofficial report includes all of the scores, but I feel like the report itself is more tangible than me just typing them out lmao (and excluding the 3 that I don\u2019t want to send). Thanks for any help.",
