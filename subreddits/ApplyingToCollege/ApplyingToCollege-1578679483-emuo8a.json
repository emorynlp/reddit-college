This is why your grades only matter so much as if you have a good GPA.  Colleges don't really care how good your grades are if you don't have an SAT or ACT score to back it up.",

              "text": "TBH you'll probably find better information at r/ACT, because I just think my classes prepared me really well (for graded reading assessments, my English teacher deadass takes the SAT reading questions and tweaks them to be more difficult). I'll give my best advice for each section, but take it with a grain of salt, because I've only taken one actual ACT (and my parents were also yelling at me the night before for staying up playing Halo lol)\n___\n**Reading**: this section is a lot less tricky than the SAT's reading, imo. This may not work if you're not a fast reader, but what I liked to do was read each passage twice: first, I'd glance over the passage (taking no more than a minute or two), underline important stuff, look at the questions/answer as many as possible, and then read again more thoroughly. There is *almost always* going to be direct evidence from the passage to support the right answer. \n\nGeneral trends I've noticed: answers with words like \"always\", \"never\", etc *tend* to be wrong (95% of the time there's an exception to a statement). Don't immediately dismiss those answers, but be careful. In general, at least one or two answer choices can be eliminated instantly, which makes guessing easier if you're pressed for time.\n\nAlso: ANNOTATE!!! My reading passages always look like sketchbooks when I'm through with them. I underline major plot points in addition to things that indicate important ideas, such as repetition, figurative language, etc. This makes it easier to pull evidence back and quickly refer to the passage's important parts if you flip between the questions and answers a lot (I don't recommend flipping pages too much bc it wastes time tho).\n___\n**Math**: Let's start with calculators. You can use your calculator for the entire section, but it should also be possible (not ideal obviously) to go without it. Use your calculator wisely. Sometimes, pressing buttons and scrolling through your calculator's menu can waste more time than doing the problem by hand. On most calculators, you can program formulas or applications in; this is kind of a grey area, and I try not to use them too much as a crutch. If there's just one or two things you always forget, this might be worth considering; in most cases, it's not prohibited as long as the code is under a certain length.\n\nThe difficulty goes from easy to hard in my limited experience. The first 40 questions tend to take as long as the last 20. If you get stuck on a question, spend no more than one minute on it. If you do get tripped up (and there are almost always one or two weird questions designed to do that), eliminate the obviously wrong answers and guess; there's no penalty, and you can come back later if you have extra time.\n\nAlso, for anything involving diagrams/geometry/angles/etc, ACT says their figures aren't drawn to scale, but they usually are in my experience. And that's another thing: drawing a diagram (if you can do so quickly) often helps me visualize a problem that I can't wrap my head around.\n___\n**Writing/Editing:** I can't name a single English grammar rule (wtf is a compound-complex sentence??), yet I had zero mistakes here. This might stem from reading a lot for fun when I was younger, but 90% of my reasoning for answers were \"eh, this is the least awkward one\". You get a feel for it after reading a lot; if you don't have that intuition, try asking yourself whether it would flow naturally or sound choppy or awkward if you said it out loud.\n\nFor questions that ask \"should the author delete or add this phrase\", look at where it's being removed/added and ask what it contributes to the paragraph. Another trend I've seen is \"less is more\"; generally, it's not a good idea to add extraneous information unless it's somehow relevant to the paragraph's main point. As a general rule of thumb, sudden topic changes, filler words and unneeded info bog down writing and should be avoided.\n\nFor guessing vocabulary words, literally try to substitute each answer choice into the original word's place. I just did that and picked whichever sounded the least out-of-place. Also look out for words with multiple possible meanings; you have to determine those from context.\n___\n**Science:** Depending on how good you are at processing information and making sense of data, this could be the easiest section or a total nightmare. \n\nFirst, *stop thinking of it as a science section*; instead, legit think of it as a second reading section with a focus on science articles. It's really just analyzing claims, data, and statistics. \n\nGraphs, diagrams and tables look intimidating at first, but don't let them psych you out; you just need to try and understand *what the charts are trying to represent*. Ask yourself: \"What is the point of this info? What is the independent/dependent variable? What's being tested, and did the experimental conditions change from trial to trial?\"\n\nI like to interpret things visually, so I again find that annotating the passages and underlining data, facts, and conclusions are helpful. Also, when I'm reading something like a line chart, I will literally trace the line with my pencil to make sure I don't look at the wrong data point.\n\nYou need *very little* outside knowledge (and math) to ace this section; out of 40 science questions, I can only remember one that required any form of background knowledge. I can count on my hand how many times I needed to do math beyond addition and subtraction. I will say, having outside knowledge does actually make this section easier to deal with, because you spend less time processing the vocabulary (and it can also help orient you in the right direction). But the science section will give you everything you need for 95% of questions. \n___\nI hope that helps, if you have a specific question or problems with a certain format of question, I'll try to answer. Beyond a certain point, there is an element of luck though. Last tips: eat a breakfast with lots of complex carbs, bring a snack and water, wear a watch that you can mute, sleep well the night before, and don't let test anxiety make you second guess yourself.",

Everyone I know who has gotten a 1500+ put in hundreds or thousands of hours into doing khan academy or Uworld, etc. \n\n2 times a year shouldn't be a problem either, since if you're planning on going to a t20, you'll have started preparing since 9th grade. That gives you 6 chances at the SAT. Not to mention, universities don't look highly on people taking the SATs too many times either, its rare that people take the SAT more than 4 times.\n\nPersonally, I think the SAT is as fair a standardized test as you'll get.  \n\nPeople always complain about how upper class kids get to go to SAT Prep Classes that cost thousands, but those classes are just more practice tests and a brief and pretty much useless explanation from the tutors there. The SAT is really just a measure of how much time you put into preparing for it, or rather, how motivated and on task you are. \n\nDo a practice test every week for a year while learning from your mistakes and I guaranteed you'll hit 1500+",

These AP classes are the hardest my school has, yet everything is curved massively so everyone gets an A. I know a kid who consistently gets around 25% or less problems right on physics tests yet still maintains a B- in the class (3.677 GPA). GPA and grades in general are all super subjective and depend on the school and teacher, which is why I think nearly no emphasis should be put on them.",

It honestly baffles me how so little people get promise, and I think it\u2019s due to the poverty level and lack of prep courses for them.

For something like the SAT, you either need to be very academically talented or put a lot of effort into studying (or maybe a little bit of both) to score well. Grades just measure how well you follow braindead directions, SAT measures work ethic and/or academic potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI barely had to work to maintain a 4.0 UW. Most in-class things I did didn't even make me think-- in other words, I didn't have to be smart, study in my free time, or anything like that. In the few classes that required critical thinking, such as Algebra 2/precalculus, the teacher just babied us through everything and gave test answers almost verbatim with study guides (funny enough, people still failed lol). Achieving high 1500s on the SAT was very different. For the first time, I had to grind through khanacademy for a couple of months, thoroughly think through and understand English conventions and math concepts, and actually use my brain. The SAT was both a test of my academic potential and my work ethic. My score rightly reflects these qualities.\n\nTLDR; GPA is a shitty indicator of academic success, SAT is much better in that regard",

My opinion on the SAT is that in order to do well you don\u2019t have to be smart, you just have to know the format of the test. You have to game the system. If it was a true test of intelligence, it would be correlated with GPA (which also isn\u2019t a very good measure). 1.5 years into college I have a 3.87 GPA (one B in Calculus) and it all worked out. My suggestion? Don\u2019t put so much weight on test scores.\n\nP.S. I literally did khan academy every single day after my first PSAT. I got my score up 140 points from an 1150.",

I go to a school in a bad area where kids care more about drugs and popularity than school. That alone accounts for around 150/420 people. There\u2019s also a fuckload of cheating and the favored kids who get grades but are actually dumb.\n\nHere, there are kids who get into these STEM vocational programs that are basically given a high GPA because they have to take so many AP classes, but the majority of them only applied for the program because they didn\u2019t want to go to their zoned school. They seem smart at school, but their SATs? Not good. Not that the work they do isn\u2019t hard, but these students are practically spoon fed and set up to be the top of our class, no matter how stupid they are. The high GPA comes from the inflation from their program, and low SAT from the lack of knowledge they hold onto from that program.\n\nThen there are the cheaters who we all know and want to die. The STEM kids can also be put into this group because they cheat the most and help their non STEM friends cheat like shit (cough cough engineering and medicine kids).\n\nI personally just happened to beat out the druggies, performing arts students who don\u2019t care, jailbirds, and smart kids who refused to take AP classes because they know it\u2019s not worth it (which is what I realize now rip) and get a 38/420 rank. Being in a school with kids who do not give a fuck really helped me in the GPA and rank world, but I literally don\u2019t learn anything because the kids are so hard to deal with. I had an opportunity to go to my nmom\u2019s country for an education because they lack technology meaning kids actually retain information rather than google the answers like they do here, and I feel like if I took that opportunity I would\u2019ve done much better on my ACT/SAT. \n\nEven though I benefited from grade inflation I honestly hate it because it had me thinking I was smart this whole time until I got a wopping 1050/21 SAT/ACT. I read here all the time about kids who are devastated because they have such low GPAs but extraordinary test scores. In the end, the SAT isn\u2019t something you should make define your life and it\u2019s just a dumb test to capitalize off of desperate teens like ourselves. To hell with College Board.",

The root of the problem is that grades are not standardized. \n\nThey\u2019re not standardized across the country, across districts or even across classes in the same school in some cases. The work required to get an A in one class at a certain school might be completely different from the amount of work required to get the same grade in the same class at a different school. But unless you\u2019re familiar with the curriculum of both classes, people on the outside won\u2019t know the difference. \n\nSo yes, grades measure academic performance over four years, but the accuracy of grades as a measurement of performance varies GREATLY. This is the main reason why some kids have a 3.4 but can easily get a 1400+, because while their gpa is low, their courses are challenging and they\u2019ve still learned all the material on standardized tests and then some. \n\nLikewise, often the reason students with a 4.0 end up with a 900 SAT is because they simply don\u2019t know the content. Their classes weren\u2019t rigorous and didn\u2019t teach it. \n\nThis isn\u2019t *always* the reason behind a large gpa and test score disparity, but it often is.",

A ~4 hour long test isn\u2019t some people\u2019s strong suit, some people just fail to succeed in that environment, and perhaps that strict test-taking environment is totally different from their school\n\n2. Access to SAT/ACT preparation & understanding the weight SAT/ACT carries on college applications (some people just brush it off) \n\n3. Maybe English is someone\u2019s second language\n\n4. Some people do better on sat or act, (myself included, I took the sat 6 times and the highest I got was 1280, took the act twice with no preparation and got 30, and 31 which is ~1400SAT)\n\n5. Location/environment, if the nearest testing center is far away and if standardized testing isn\u2019t emphasized at your school\n\nTL:DR: While 900 is quite low, there a lot of factors that should go into account, and also admission officers do look at that, hence why some people get in with lower test scores even though they aren\u2019t an URM or any other peculiar circumstances",
