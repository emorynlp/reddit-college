  "text": "I plan on transferring from UIC computer engineering to UIUC, Wisconsin and Purdue. I might apply to a few other places. UIUC lists some required courses to apply-and I am on track to meet those requirements with the exception of Chemistry, I am behind on that by one class. Should I do a credit overload by 2 hours (18 is max, I\u2019m planning 20), or should I take it in the summer? Would taking it in the summer hurt my admissions chances at the schools and at other ones as well?",
