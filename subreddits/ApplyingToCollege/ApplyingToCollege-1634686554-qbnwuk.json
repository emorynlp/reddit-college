  "text": "will listing valuation ($200M) of startup (I'm not gonna explain anything regarding the startup so don't ask please) reduce chances for Harvard REA cuz apparently it starts the claim, 'you don't need to go to college'?\n\nEdit: should I just say we raised $2 million (for 1%) crowd funding?\n\nEdit 2: the humour of the replies genuinely confuses me.",
