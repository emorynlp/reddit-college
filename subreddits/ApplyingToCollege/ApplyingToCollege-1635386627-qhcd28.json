  "title:": "Didn't include a certain college in my education section of my application, how bad does this hurt my chances of acceptance?",
  "text": "Two days ago I applied to a school with a \\~90% acceptance rate in my home state. I really wish to go here in order to attempt to walk-on on one of their sports programs. I am an undergraduate transferring from a community college out of state. In the education section of my application, I included my high school, my current community college (which I have over 50 credits at, and have attended since 2018), and both my respective GPA's at these schools. However, I also briefly attended another community college for a spring semester a couple years ago that I do not know my GPA for and that I very stupidly did not include in the application. The school has received all my transcripts except for that one, but I had it sent today when I realized I made a mistake. I also emailed their admissions office telling them about my application mistake. I'm just wondering if the fact that I didn't originally include it on my application can really hurt my chances of getting accepted here or if I should be okay? I'm slightly stressing about it since I feel like before I had a really good shot of acceptance. Thanks for reading!!",

      "text": "Many colleges outside the top 100 or so are experiencing real enrollment declines so my guess is that school is happy to see someone who has shown they can pass college classes apply. My guess is your chances are high given what you\u2019ve said. I don\u2019t think the omission will hurt you because you caught it and fixed it. And that shows you care enough you might actually come",
