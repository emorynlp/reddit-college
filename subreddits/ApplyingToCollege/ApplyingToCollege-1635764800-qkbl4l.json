He moved to CA from NY to attend Santa Barbara CC, did his two years, was admitted to UCLA through the (very good) CC transfer pipeline to UCs, and now he's a senior but still paying OOS tuition. It's pretty hard to establish residency for UCs. A parent could move to CA and then has to have been paying CA taxes for one year before applying for in-state tuition. There is an appeals process, but from what I'm seeing in the UCLA parents groups, it's not easy to do.",

If NYU is a realistic reach for you stats-wise I\u2019d drop one or two of the super selective schools like Stanford, MIT, or Harvard and only keep ones you feel really fit your academic ambitions and personal preference. \n\nGood luck during admissions!",
