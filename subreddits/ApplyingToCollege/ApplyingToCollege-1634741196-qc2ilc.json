Should I submit it? The performance is of very high-level. (I\u2019m a international students so I thought that a video might give an idea of what I wrote about an EC in the respective section). \n\nTHE COLLEGE WEBSITE STATES \u201cIf not a solo recording, please indicate your\nperformance in the description\nsection of the media details\u201d.",

Personally I'd say maybe point out a circle on the video itself depicting where you're located on stage (just use an editing app and a drawing tool) since the AO might not even know what you look like.",
