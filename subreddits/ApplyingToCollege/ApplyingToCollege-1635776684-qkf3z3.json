  "text": "Uhm, I have all my essays and everything else ready to submit ED for Rice. But, my counselor still hasn't finished the letter of recommendation and school report and I am not sure if Rice has a grace period. I looked at the website on Rice and it said that they want letters of recommendation done by November 1. What should I do??",
