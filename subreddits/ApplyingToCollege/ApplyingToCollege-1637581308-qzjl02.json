  "text": "I have already turned in a personal statement that lists all my qualifications and such and am trying to get into the Stockholm School of Economics for a bachelor's degree. I am trying to get the scholarship but they require a motivation letter of 500  words. Would repeating my qualifications all over again look bad? Also I have a bit of a sob story so I know I can definitely write about that on my letter but at the same time I don't want to look like I am trying to get pity points. What can I write in the motivation letter and what should my letter structure look like. Any kind of assistance helps!!",
