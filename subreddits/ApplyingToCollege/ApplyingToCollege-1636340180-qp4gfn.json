  "text": "Idk if this is a stupid question or not but I\u2019m 18 (19 in feb) and my high school years got all fucked up due to moving, Covid, etc. etc. so I never started my senior year. (I have a very good gpa for the three years I did attend hs though so I have that going for me ig) I plan to get a ged and take the act soon, but I feel so behind in the college application process. Up until two months ago I wasn\u2019t planning to go to college so I\u2019m very unprepared currently. If I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll make it by the last app. deadlines, but it\u2019d probably be rushed and I feel like I should wait until next year. I\u2019m just worried I\u2019ll feel even more behind in life cause I\u2019ll be starting college later than most do. So, this may seem kinda nonsensical, but I really don\u2019t know if I should rush and get it all together now or wait and give myself that extra year.",

I always hear about how much harder it is to make friends and transition into it all compared to joining at the start of the year. Maybe I should reconsider though",
