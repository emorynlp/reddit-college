  "text": "Hi everyone, so I'm an international student and my school did not offer a lot of STEM related things that I was interested in. There are no APs, no honor classes, etc, everyone basically learns the same stuff. So I self-studied some AP classes like physics 2 and C:Mechanics, and CS (wasn't possible to take any exams, but I just wanted to learn). I also learned how to program  with HTML, JavaScript, C, etc. by using YouTube videos and some online courses. Should I put these as ECs? Do they count as ECs? How could I put them?",

I think you can mention a project you did as the title, probably the one you're the most proud of and elaborate on how you self taught yourself the programming languages in the EC description? You can also put it in the additional information section, incase you don't have any slots left in the ECs section.",
