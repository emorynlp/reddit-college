  "text": "Hey everyone, I don\u2019t know if some of y\u2019all know or not but Temple started releasing decisions. Does anyone know how they release them? Does Philly residents get them first or depends on the major ? A few of my friends who applied 2 weeks ago already got a decision and it\u2019s been a month for me (also to count in international so that might be the reason why I haven\u2019t gotten anything yet?)",
