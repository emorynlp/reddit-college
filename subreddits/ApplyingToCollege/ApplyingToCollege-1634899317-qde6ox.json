  "text": "One of the colleges i\u2019m applying to has a prompt that asks what I like about the location the college is in, and how it\u2019ll impact my experience. But never having visited, I have no idea what to say and i\u2019m worried about sounding generic. How should i go about it?",

      "text": "Do your research. Look at google maps to see what\u2019s around the college. Look on trip advisor to see what there is to do near by.  Read the college website to see what they like to highlight to do. Check out a local newspaper.  What\u2019s the weather like? Are there any culture or tradition that are unique to the area you\u2019d like to participate in. They want to know you\u2019ve done your research and you know what to expect",
