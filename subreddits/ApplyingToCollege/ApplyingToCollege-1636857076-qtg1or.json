  "text": "(Posted this on r/jobs too,, I\u2019m new here so idk if that\u2019s some sort of reddit sin. Feel free to cyberbully me if so.)\n\nFor some quick context, I\u2019m a high-school junior, so keep that in mind lol.\nLike every other junior these past few months, I\u2019ve been heavily focused on my impending college application. It\u2019s definitely less intense pressure than what I\u2019m sure many seniors are feeling, (I\u2019ve just been busy with researching universities, SAT prep, etc. etc.) Nonetheless, I feel completely and utterly lost. I have no idea what I\u2019m interested in doing career-wise, so I have no idea of what major I should choose, and because of that, I have no idea of what universities I should research. The problem is that I have no idea of where to start researching potential careers. The only guidance that I can find online are those shitty, vague \u2018what career is best for you?\u2019 quizzes. \nOddly enough, I know what i\u2019m interested in. (Linguistics \u2014 or anything that\u2019s not mathematical, really.) And I know what I\u2019d like my minor to be (Chinese language). But I just can\u2019t fathom a career that is within my field of interest, well-paying, and satisfying to me. It\u2019ll be greatly appreciated if anybody has any advice on where I can look for answers.",

Go to a school that you can afford that has a lot to offer and decide later when you\u2019re there. Your major will only nudge you in a direction and not set your life in stone.\n\nhttps://whatcanidowiththismajor.com/major/linguistics/",
