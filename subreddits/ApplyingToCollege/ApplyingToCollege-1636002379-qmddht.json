  "title:": "Georgia Tech portal acting up?!",
  "text": "I submitted my Georgia Tech application about a week ago along with all my other EA colleges. Their portal says they are still \"awaiting\" my transcript, and the deadline for documents is Nov 15. All my other EA colleges which I submitted on the same day say they received my transcript already.\n\nShould I ask my counselor to resend my transcript just in case? Or should I first ask Georgia Tech admissions to manually double-check if they have my transcript? Their website says that it may take up to two weeks to update the portal, but waiting another week will make me anxious.",
