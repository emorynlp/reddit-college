  "text": "When listing your courses on the common app, what level did you say your 4U courses were?\n\nThe options are advanced, college prep, regular/standard, accelerated, honours, gifted, enriched\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of them could potentially apply, but I'm considering 4M and 4C and O courses to be lower in level than 4U. So O would be regular, C would be college prep, M would be advanced, and 4U would either be enriched or honours?",
