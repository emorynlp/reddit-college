  "title:": "Harvard Super-score Dilemma",
  "text": "So I applied to Harvard EA, and I\u2019m self reporting my ACT scores, but I\u2019m unsure if I should report both tests. My super-score with highest section scores is a 34, but my individual composites are a 33 and a 32, and I don\u2019t know if the 32 is going to weaken my application or not. Here\u2019s my ACT breakdowns\n\nJune ACT : Comp-33, Math-34, Science-34, English-29, Reading-36\n\nSeptember ACT : Comp-32, Math-28, Science-36, English-26, Reading-36\n\nThe second test I obviously did way worse in math, and did a little worse on english. Should I report both scores??? or will the inclusion of a 32 composite, 28 math, and 26 english weaken my application to the point that just submitting my 33 composite is the better option? Any info is helpful and welcome.",

However, if you entered your test score information and would like it to be considered, that data will still be transmitted to us *with your application* and we will review it.\n\n[https://college.harvard.edu/guides/application-tips](https://college.harvard.edu/guides/application-tips)\n\n(I haven't seen the portal, so I wouldn't know what it says. There are schools that accept self-reported scores via portal but not in the app, though H's website seems relatively clear.)",
