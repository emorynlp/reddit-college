  "text": "So I really want to go to Tulane, but there probably isn't a chance if I don't ED. My gpa is below what they usually take and even if I apply EA there's probably no way. The issue is that I can't visit the campus before the deadline and I don't want to make a binding decision to a college I haven't seen in person. I know I really like New Orleans and both my siblings liked the campus when they visited. Thoughts?",
