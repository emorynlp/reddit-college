It can increase accessibility, accuracy, response time, you name it in almost any industry or application you can think of. People talk about CS as a sellout major, yet I see it as almost hte opposite because you can still follow your passion -- health care needs programmers; nonprofits need programmers; government needs programmers; pretty much all of science needs programmers -- the possibilities are basically endless in terms of using a CS major to do something sincere and socially beneficial if that's what you're going for. On top of that, it's a huge problem-solving thrill that I just didn't get in other departments' classes, even science classes within my physics major. There's something so satisfying about setting up your code, debugging it, formatting it, and documenting it until it's this flawless, professional product that might even stand the test of time.",

It's pretty long tho:\n\nEvery profession has tools that make the job easier to do. Carpenters use hammers, saws, and measuring tapes. Mechanics use wrenches, screwdrivers, and ratchets. Electronics technicians\r  \nuse probes, scopes, and meters. Some tools are unique and can be categorized as belonging to a single profession. For example, surgeons have certain tools that are designed specifically for surgical operations. Those tools probably aren\u2019t used by anyone other than surgeons. There are some tools, however, that are used in several professions. Screwdrivers, for instance, are used by mechanics, carpenters, and many others. \n\nThe computer is a tool used by so many professions that it cannot be easily categorized. It can perform so many different jobs that it is perhaps the most versatile tool ever made. To the accountant, computers balance books, analyze profits and losses, and prepare tax reports. To the factory worker, computers control manufacturing machines and track production. To the mechanic, computers analyze the various systems in an automobile and pinpoint hard-to-find problems. The computer can do such a wide variety of tasks because it can be programmed. It is a machine specifically designed to follow instructions. Because of the  \ncomputer\u2019s programmability, it doesn\u2019t belong to any single profession. Computers are designed to do whatever job their programs, or software, tell them to do. \n\nComputer programmers do a very important job. They create software that transforms computers into the specialized tools of many trades. Without programmers, the users of computers would have no software, and without software, computers would not be able to do anything. \n\nComputer programming is both an art and a science. It is an art because every aspect of a program should be carefully designed. Here are a few of the things that must be designed for any real-world computer program:  \n\u2022 The logical flow of the instructions  \n\u2022 The mathematical procedures  \n\u2022 The layout of the programming statements  \n\u2022 The appearance of the screens  \n\u2022 The way information is presented to the user  \n\u2022 The program\u2019s \u201cuser friendliness\u201d  \n\u2022 Manuals, help systems, and/or other forms of written documentation",

That led to the development of multiple apps and now I can't see myself doing anything else.",

Passion helps, but I swear this degree and career path is the only that is gatekept so hard where people make it sound like if you aren't passionate, you can't (or shouldn't) get a job. Nobody ever claims you need to be passionate about consulting. Nobody ever claims you need to be passionate about banking/finance. And the idea that being passionate at something makes you better at it than someone who isn't passionate is bunk. If you find it miserable, don't do it because you'll burn out, but choosing to do it for the money and not having a super-innate passion is just fine. That's the type of jobs *most people* do lol",
