Since most of my colleges require 2 LOR from teachers, I have two teacher recs that I could submit. I'm just not sure which teacher's I should submit (I feel like each has their possible pros and cons). \n\nDo you think my counselor is allowed to read the teacher LORs and advise me as to which one I should submit?",
