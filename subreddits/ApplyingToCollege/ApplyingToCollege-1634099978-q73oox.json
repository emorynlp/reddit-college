  "text": "Currently deciding between Rice and WashU for premed with plans of majoring in psych. Which one offers more opportunities for undergrad and has the better premed program? I really value Rice's collaborative environment, but I also appreciate the quality of student life at WashU.\n\nAlso, I have a pretty mediocre background in the sciences. My school doesn't have any labs, and I taught myself chemistry when classes shifted to online. Which school would provide more resources to succeed in classes? Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit: I'm applying through the QuestBridge National College Match! Just trying to figure out my rankings as they're due on the 14th :'))",

      "text": "They are both amazing.  And actually to me they even look a lot alike! Chumer was right about diversity tho. I like the area around Rice a lot more. Beautiful neighborhood, right across the street from the largest med center in the world,  lots of museums, and a large city park. You\u2019re also walking distance to a great shopping and restaurant area. I also prefer rices weather \u2014 but I hate cold rainy weather for days on end, so that\u2019s just me. Rice is really fricking hot in September and then the rest of the school year is practically spring except for the occasional ice storm that lasts for a couple days and then you\u2019re back to spring. \n\nI know tons of happy kids and alums for both schools. You really can\u2019t go wrong in terms of academics and opportunities. They both offer excellence in those areas.  I think it\u2019s gonna have to come down to weather, location, etc. \n\nAlso consider distance and cost of travel from home.",

Perhaps you want a larger student body?  Specific weather?  Dining?  More/fewer distribution requirements?",

We have a number of students here on the sub that have found their community to be much more collaborative than rumors would indicate. \n\nFor all things diversity though\u2014Rice is a better bet.  WashU is making strides towards improving the wealth inequality within its student body (and its decision to go need-blind just this year will help a lot) but Rice is still ahead ethnically and socioeconomically.",
