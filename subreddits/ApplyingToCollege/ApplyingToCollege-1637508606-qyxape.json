  "text": "Throwaway cause anyone who knows me will be able to figure out who I am\n\nBasically I work in the library at my school during ~2 of my frees, and it\u2019s a pretty neat job. However, I spend like an hour a day there, for all days all weeks of school, and I realize it counts as community service bc of how the librarians set it up, and I just realized I\u2019ve racked up like 200 hours a year.\n\nIt sounds infeasible if I worked after school bc I have a lot of other extracurriculars, but I work during school so I\u2019ve managed it fine. Should I clarify this on my common app?\n\nThx!",
