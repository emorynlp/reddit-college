  "text": "This is the definition of a shitpost if I have ever seen one, but I\u2019ve just stared at a wall for the past two minutes while cleaning, and realized something. I\u2019m applying to schools for a Marketing and Neuroscience major (some one, others the latter, thx curriculum that doesn\u2019t have it as a specific thing in many schools). But anyways, it just clicked that I literally have an education in marketing. Context, my school offers a technical curriculum where you specialize in one of four areas (government mandatory x public/ semi public schools). I specialize in marketing, but I didn\u2019t think it would make much of an impact or significance, I think I was overwhelmed by everything else that I didn\u2019t think too much on it. Now, I kinda realize, it improves my chances and makes my profile a bit better. All the while I complained about how my school doesn\u2019t have AP classes, but these might as well be, we get more than 4 hours on them per week. #shocked at my Dory Brain",

          "text": "The course load is divided per year. First year was publicity, display window (how to understand it and work it, in Spanish it\u2019s escaparate), customer service, sales and another I can\u2019t remember. Second year was sales techniques, marketing as a whole (the types and more), how to behave in the workspace and accounting. The 3rd (this one), we have consumer taxes, information systems and data, interviews and polls and entrepreneurship. This is a bit too detailed, but it\u2019s how it works. We learn to understand costumers, create necessities and evaluate if a product works for the market or not, creating strategies that will save it.",
