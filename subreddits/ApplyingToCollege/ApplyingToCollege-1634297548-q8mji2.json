Fewer applicants, plus AOs will of course be more interested in someone committed v. someone who is not. If they think their SAT score will be the most important part of their application, then RD v. ED doesn\u2019t matter since it only takes 10 seconds to look through a score. However, if the more important part of their application is something mentioned in an essay or through an EC, ED is worth it because on that plan there\u2019s a chance the AO will be able to give more time to said things. And I totally agree with you on a 1500-1550 both showing the same level of intelligence.",
