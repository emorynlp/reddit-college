  "text": "When I found out about showing demonstrated interest I went crazy and started emailing all admissions officers and joining info sessions. I stupidly emailed NYU\u2019s admissions officer asking about mental health resources on campus. Now that I\u2019ve actually done research I know that talking about mental health should be avoided. Ugh I hate myself for this. Nyu was one of my top choices.",
