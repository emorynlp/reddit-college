  "text": "Basically the title. I just sent test scores for early action but the schools deadline for materials to be sent in is October 22. As test scores are mandatory for this school does that mean I will just be moved to the regular decision pool or will my application be removed altogether for not being completed??",

      "text": "Check to see if the school accepts scores self-reported in the app or portal, which is faster. What school is it? Moving to RD is a possibility, though most schools are not quite this strict - depends on the school.\n\nIf the school is UGA, they do appear to require an official score report. Their FAQ says\n\n>For Early Action, the last test date accepted is the October SAT or the September ACT. For Regular Decision, the last test date accepted is the December ACT or SAT. As long as tests are taken and scores are requested by the application deadline we can utilize them in the review process.\n\nIt is likely, but not guaranteed, that an official report sent from College Board today would be received by Oct 22. But, you have requested by the app deadline. I think you're in good shape.",
