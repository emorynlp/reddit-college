For example, health science would be much better at McMaster. However, I would rank UofT as one of the best technology universities in Canada with UWaterloo, UBC, and McGill. There may be a few more unis that could be added to this list though.\n\nRegarding acceptance rate, again, that depends on the program. Computer science and engineering is very competitive to get into there while other programs may have much higher acceptance rates. Also, having a high acceptance doesn't make a university bad.\n\nAlmost every top 10 university in Canada is comparable to UofT.",
