  "text": "Basically what the title says. My school only uses common app and I\u2019ve only seen one post on reddit that talked about the coalition app. I just feel like most people use common app and there\u2019s even some schools that will only accept common app and not coalition. So basically does anybody use it, and if so, why did you chose it over common app (or was it your school)",
