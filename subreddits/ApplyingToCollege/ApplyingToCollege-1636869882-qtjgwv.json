  "text": "So I wanted to give a trigger warning for one of my essays since it mentions sexual violence and the death penalty, (not graphic in any way, it's in the context of protests and the academics surrounding it. I just wanna be safe in case any of the AOs would prefer one) but I'm not sure how to do it. Should I create a front page with my name, common app ID, and the trigger warning?",

      "text": "Considering that the majority of AOs are 40+ and wouldn't know what a tw is or care about it for that matter, it is not needed. That being said, there could be more of a problem with the topic rather than the significance of a tw in this case. Not sure of the context but, do you need to talk about such a political/sensitive topic for an essay?\n\nSource: https://www.zippia.com/admissions-officer-jobs/demographics/",

There are already mentally prepared for anything. So you should be fine. But, if you don't like my answer, please email the AO of the school you're applying to.",
