  "text": "Writing all these application essays and looking for anything interesting about me or things that have happened to me made me realize I am boring as hell. \n\nThe things I like are shopping, music, art, reading, and exercise. Problem is I\u2019m not avid enough about any of these. I\u2019m not a black belt karate competitor or play a competitive sport or anything unique...all I do is go to the gym and run on my treadmill. I don\u2019t listen to some obscure indie artist, play a bassoon, or am obsessed with classical music and famous composers...I just like pop music. \n\nI always thought I had a lot of personality but it feels impossible to get that through. On paper I\u2019m as bland as an A4 sheet of paper. \n\nRip me, a basic bitch 2020",

(I ended writing about indie gaming for one of mine, and even though that's hardly interesting by itself, a lot of people liked it because of how I connected it to personal development and my own major.)",

And how I couldn't think of how i could stand out.. Then i remembered wait, who else has written content for one of the top mobile games in the app store. From here i began to talk about the writing team i ran and how seeing the content i wrote be featured by the developers improved my confidence. I backed this up with a letter od recommendation from the senior moderator. My AO basically loved how I was helping there player community and how I twisted it to a learning experience that improved my grammar skills etc. The game is guns of glory a classic pay to win mobile strategy game, i don't reccmended playing. However if you're interested I can hook you up with someone I'm currently mentoring who's doing the same thing with another kings group game :)\n\nIn short its guns or glory my content is still featured in game even though I've sorta stopped playing to sort out the addminsions process \ud83d\ude02.",

I've been texting my AO back and forth sense September, I've been in the committee decision room, and they said they'd like to see one more thing the Semester 1 final transcripts. Only 3 Weeks tell finals! Kinda excited tbh.\n\nHere are the numbers\n\nWarner Pacific University Minimum Requirements\n\nSAT 990\nGPA 2.5\n\nMe:\n\nSAT 990\nGPA 2.09\n\nI submitted examples of my writing and letters of recommendation, one of witch was from the Senior Moderator. In addition I provided an essay on success, and an MLA research paper that we did in English class. I've also visited the university and so forths. I'm basically friends with my  AO at this point. She's even edited my essays as i accidentally had some grammar mistakes.\n\nFor reference Warner Pacific is a small liberal arts Christian based university with only 500 students in undergraduate classes. I had my heart set the moment she reached out as there admissions process is extremely personal.  Oh and they don't charge more for out of state tuition!!! \ud83d\ude02 I'm in state though :) haven't been formally accepted yet but I've been to in the board room and haven't been rejected yet! \ud83d\ude02",

I'm applying this season too, ready to get all those sweet rejections :( There's no hope for us average beings, not in college admissions at least, but the world ain't like that bud. We can do our little magic and make our little differences, and that's what'll make us special. College is just a rock to get there, but there are lots of rocks on this beach. Heads up, confidence high! You'll find your way!",
