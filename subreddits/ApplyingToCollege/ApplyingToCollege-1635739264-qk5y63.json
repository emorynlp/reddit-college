  "text": "I have question about the Princeton app (yes I'm applying early, yes I waited until the day before to finish my shit...). On the Princeton website it says that they \"recommend that you self-report all of your AP or IB scores on your application\" if you took any (keyword RECOMMEND). The thing is, I've failed two of my exams and made 3's on another two (out of ten total), so would it be better to only report the ones I want, not report any, or report all of them?",

      "text": "A couple of years ago, Princeton went so far as to make applicants give a reason if they weren't reporting all AP scores. Keep an eye out for that in Princeton's app questions, but I think that's gone now. As long as they aren't asking anymore whether you're self-reporting all AP exam scores, there is no reason to report your low AP exam scores.",
