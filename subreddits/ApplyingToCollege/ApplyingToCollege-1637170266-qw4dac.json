Last year, whenever some big company or celebrity donated money to HBCU\u2019s, it was always Howard (where all that moneys gone is beyond me, idk they\u2019re such a mess this year), Spelman, Morehouse, and occasionally FAMU. I don\u2019t mean to pocket watch, but it\u2019s starting to seem like those are the only HBCU\u2019s people know about. The pandemic was hard for all small colleges, causing some to shut down, but it was especially hard for the lesser known HBCU\u2019s. \n\nSlightly sad comment aside, I applied to Spelman EA, and I\u2019m really excited !",
