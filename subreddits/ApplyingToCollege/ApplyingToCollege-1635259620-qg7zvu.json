  "text": "Hey y'all, I don't know if anyone told you this today but you're doing great! College apps are hard and with the level of competition that's around, we're all giving our best! Don't let your parents or colleagues tell you you're not enough, you are and you know it!\n\nUse the comments to show your appreciation towards our beautiful community, everyone. Believe me, at this time nothing is sweeter than a total stranger having faith in you and praising you for your hard work!",
