      "text": "If you score highly on the AIME that means you're more likely to score highly on the SAT math section.  Your AIME score has no \\*direct\\* affect on your SAT math score, but it indicates you're strong in math, which predicts a high SAT math score.\n\nLikewise, winning a school's competitive merit scholarship is not likely to have any \\*direct\\* impact on whether you're accepted to competitive programs later on, but it suggests you're the kind of person who will have a better shot than most.",

A high school record that qualified you for a scholarship is likely no longer meaningful.",
