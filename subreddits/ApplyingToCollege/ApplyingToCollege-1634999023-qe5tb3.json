      "text": "This sounds really frustrating I know, and I hope that your parents will come around to seeing your perspective eventually.\n\nI have some suggestions that might help but you need to be in the right frame of mind first. So, let\u2019s try to imagine this from their perspective. I don\u2019t know your parents, but most parents come from a place of love and fear \u2014 and that sense of protecting what they love most can take over \u2014 especially as their children begin to grow up and form their own opinions and separate from the parents. Your parents have this image of their son or daughter, the doctor, and that\u2019s what they have been expecting and imagining and working for. Nothing wrong with that \u2014 except that it\u2019s theirs and not yours. So let\u2019s let them mourn the loss of what they always imagined would happen. Sometimes we parents get far too wrapped up in what our  expectations for our children should be and we neglect our own lives in doing so \u2014 then it feels like a sacrifice and that just makes it harder for everyone. \n\nSo let\u2019s give your parents some grace \u2014 they have this  extended image of who you are in their head \u2014 and you\u2019re changing it. That\u2019s some scary shit to a parent. Being a doctor is stable. It\u2019s a set path. Who the heck knows what you can do with computer stuff right? It feels unstable \u2014 and they won\u2019t be able to say my kid, the doctor.  So allow them to feel their feels. You be the bigger person here and show them how it\u2019s done to try to understand someone else\u2019s perspective. You set the example.  \n\nAnd talk to them. Ask them questions \u2014 don\u2019t interrogate them. Just talk. And listen to what they have to say. Use some active listening where you repeat back to them what they\u2019ve shared with you so they know you\u2019re listening and not just blocking them out.  If they know you hear them, it can make the conversations about your future much smoother. Don\u2019t argue. Just listen. You also don\u2019t have to agree with anything \u2014 you\u2019re just listening to understand their point of view \n\nThen think about how you can address their concerns in ways they\u2019ll understand. Maybe show them graduation rates, internship opportunities, career paths, and some of your interests.  If you make it like an organized presentation you\u2019ll be showing them that this is serious to you and you\u2019re not taking this decision lightly or on a whim.  Ask them to just sit and listen to you and your thoughts like you did for them. \n\nThis path can work with some parents \u2014 but even if it doesn\u2019t you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve made the effort and maybe they\u2019ll turn back to the presentation at some point. \n\n\nI know there are lots of narcissistic parents  out there (I have no idea if yours are or not) and trying to make them see your point of view can seem pointless but if this is the case, just do this for you.  I have narcissistic family members \u2014 it\u2019s rough. And it\u2019s a whole other conversation \n\nBeyond your parents, take care of you. Recognize that while it\u2019s nice to get acknowledgement from others, our self worth absolutely has to come from within  \u2014 not from parents, teachers, grades, names of colleges, awards or anything else \u2014 it\u2019s all pointless if you don\u2019t know and care about your own worth. It\u2019s a lifelong lesson. \n\nGood luck to you. I hope that even by making this post and blowing off some steam, you\u2019re already feeling better. \n\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 admissionsmom",
