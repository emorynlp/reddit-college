I will be submitting a music supplement for Columbia, and I would like to know how to answer this question (**For those submitting musical recordings, please indicate the time range(s) of your recording that you wish to highlight for our review.**). \n\nShould it be like (0:00 - 5:00)?\n\nI will be submitting a 15-minute supplement; is it possible to request that the entire supplement be listened to? If not, what would be an appropriate length to cut the 15-minute supplement to?",
