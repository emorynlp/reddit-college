  "text": "This one is a strange one. I live in a purple state, and I said something kinda political in my \u201cWhy Cornell\u201d essay, specifically about how child me was scared of Mitt Romney. Long story, tbf. \nSo I showed two separate English teachers my writing, and I\u2019m getting two conflicting opinions. On one side, my current AP Lit teacher \u201cI like Romney!\u201d and on the other, my AP Lang teacher who really liked it. \n\nhonestly I just find this funny lol.",
