  "text": "So I\u2019ve had this in the back of my mind for a while and with the November 1st deadline coming up I have to get started on it but I have absolutely no idea what to write about. I\u2019m a pretty bland person and the philosophies that describe my outlook on the world  relate closely to that of Nihilism (lol fancy pessimism). I haven\u2019t had anything super traumatic or hard happen to me. My parents are still married, and have stable well paying jobs (and compared to a lot of families, that is something I am pretty lucky to have)\u2026idk any help to create that \u201cspark\u201d would be greatly appreciated",
