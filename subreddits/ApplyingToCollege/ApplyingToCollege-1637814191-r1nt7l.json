  "text": "MIT: Types at 208 wpm. Does not know how to talk to girls, like at all. Stays up until 2 am playing Fortnite every night.\n\nStanford: The bees knees. Or at least they think they are. Wakes up at 5 every morning to do Pilates and their daily affirmations.\n\nDuke: Ur local chad wannabe. Wears glasses and is a little nicer dressed than a chad, so probably named Timmy. Gets offended when you call a \u201cfraternity\u201d a frat. \n\nWash U: The person that awkwardly tries to join in on all the popular group\u2019s conversations. \n\nCalTech: Plays RetroBowl through AP Calc every single day and still makes good grades. Asked the AP Calc teacher for a letter of rec. It was probably bad.\n\nU Chicago: r/notlikeothergirls\n\nNorthwestern: The theater kid who is always singing. Tried to pull off the all black suit during Hoco but it did NOT work.\n\nGeorgetown: Definitely reposted AOC\u2019s tax the rich dress on their instagram story. Also wears lululemon. Also is rich.",
