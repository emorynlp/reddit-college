  "text": "I'm deciding between the Math and CS major at UT Austin and leaning towards math. But what if I change my mind, can I switch into CS? Or is it really hard to do so? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw both majors are in the college of natural sciences",

      "text": "When I was there it was not hard to switch between majors in the same college, but a pain to switch colleges.  That said, given how much more demand there is for CS relative to the rest of the majors in the CNS, I suspect they make it difficult.  You might give the CNS a call or email and ask them directly.",

      "text": "It is **really** difficult to internally transfer to CS from math. The department already has issues managing the number of current CS students. Though it is not impossible to transfer, I definitely would not recommend it. However, it's much easier to transfer to math from CS. You could also do the Elements of Computing Certificate along with a math major if your interests align more with math.",
