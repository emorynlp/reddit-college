  "title:": "Wondering what to write my college essay on",
  "text": "I want to write my college essay on how horrible my schooling experience was. I had ADHD coming into 1st grade and my school separated me from the other kids and this experience grew worse throughout highschool, and i ended up suffering depression which the school and my teachers did nothing about. I really want to write about the struggles i face because of this, but I\u2019m really wondering wether or not this would look good for colleges considering that it does involve criticizing the schooling system in America.",

      "text": "I suggest turning this into how you were able to succeed in the face of adhd/depression. Use a specific story for essay framework. Perhaps you have worked with or mentored/volunteered w kids so they don't suffer in the same way etc... Criticizing isn't a problem if overall you highlight you. Tell why this experience has made you stronger, wiser and motivated.\n\nGood Luck",
