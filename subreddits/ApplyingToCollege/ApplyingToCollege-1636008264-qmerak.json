I would attribute that to how Harvard is 60 or so years older, and Harvard alumni tend to be more well-known/ influential in my home country. \n\nBut in reality, I think everyone would agree that they are both indisputably world class, even if there are marginal differences based on major choice. I wouldn't say that one is a better school than the other.",
