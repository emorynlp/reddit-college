  "text": "i still need to take an art class to fulfill my AG requirements in the spring but since course registration isn\u2019t over yet how would i list it? ill most likely get into the class at my dual enrollment school, but if not ill be taking 2 virtual art classes instead from my own high school. either way the art requirement will for sure be completed, i just don\u2019t know exactly how yet. how should i explain this in my application if i don\u2019t get my courses finalized by the deadline? will it even let me submit without the art listed? can i update them as soon as my courses ARE  finalized? ahhh",
