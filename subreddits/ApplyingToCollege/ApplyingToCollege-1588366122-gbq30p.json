  "text": "I know that I should be happy for people in my grade who are going to Harvard, Stanford. The Ivy leagues. t-10s.  I know how hard it is to get admission into these schools. I know that they worked hard to get into these schools. They deserved to get in.\n\nI just can't help feeling that I worked hard too. I cried. I did the all nighters. I sacrificed. I did everything they did. I feel like all my hard work as gone to waste. I deserved to get in too. Sometimes I feel like I wasted the last four years of my life. People say \"you can always get where you want to be, you just have to work hard.\" I did, though.. I worked. and I worked. and I worked.\n\nI am going to a state school, which is 100% NOT BAD. I am happy that I even had an option, a thing that some don't have.\n\nI know that one day I will get over it. I can get to the same place, someday. But, today, I am just miserable. I feel like I am nothing. I feel so bad about myself.",

          "text": "I mean... the comparison that stole the joy was the quasi-arbitrary ranked statistical assessment of actual human beings that people such as yourself perform. No offense but your suggestion of remedying this by watching hype videos is bold in the extreme. The fact is that competition has increased incredibly over the last twenty or so years, resulting in drastically reduced college availability for this generation. The logic of capitalism is coming home to roost in the fact that this young person\u2019s sincere and effective labor has been radically devalued even as it has been increasingly demanded by the system you represent. \nI went to high school over 3 decades ago but my peers had jobs, hung out, read unassigned literature, smoked the occasional joint and still got into MIT, Harvard, and UVA among other top schools. I couldn\u2019t focus, nearly failed out, got my bearings in community college and ultimately went to a super cheap but top graduate school. \n\nMy path seems less and less possible now and what is demanded of young people such as OP or my kids is ridiculous. Especially as it results in the dramatic emphasis on vocation over self-development and discovery as used to be and decreasingly is represented in a holistic liberal arts education.  And this emphasis on narrowing to vocational training is happening at even those t20 schools everyone fixates on.  - How could it not? Only those who have pushed themselves to the point of school above all else get in now. \n\nIt seems that given the changes going on and the grim state of affairs that something in all this can break. I have faith in the generation applying now- they appear to recognize the limitations and injustice of their lot. This can happen at any school - perhaps more readily at schools that are slightly (slightly!) less fixated on competition such as the state school op has been admitted to. But no doubt it should be shared by the whole generation.",

So what? As long as there is inequality between humans on Earth (so, forever and always), there will always be different levels of accomplishment and thus stress for people trying to be at the top.\n\nNot to mention that 30 years ago even *applying* to top schools was MUCH less accessible, especially for the poor and lower middle class, so yeah there was less competition and less stress. The Internet, Common App, better financial aid, and other facets of modernity make a much larger subset of people view top schools as attainable, increasing application count and driving down acceptance rate.\n\nJFK wrote a 1 paragraph essay and was a B/C student, and got into Harvard. I'm sure he and all of his peers experienced next-to-no stress as they applied to HYP. Is that the state of affairs we should go back to, in your opinion? It was soooo stress-and-competition-free, after all!\n\nOh wait, seems like whether someone experiences a lot of \"competition\" is not the end-all-be-all for evaluating the validity of their efforts and of the system.",

The study skills you developed to get great grades, the ability to manage extracurriculars and tough classes, the amount of self teaching you did away from the classroom, the hours you put into your sports/music/clubs. Those will all help you be a strong student in college. \n\nState schools are great and I'm not just talking about the UCs, Georgia Tech, UMich, or UT Austin. There are so many connections to be made at state schools and so many opportunities available to you. Being a top student at a state school might make it easier to get research opportunities and not being overwhelmed by a rigorous class schedule may allow you more time to pursue other things your college has to offer like club sports, student organizations, frats/sororities, the honors college, study abroad, volunteer opportunities, etc. Don't knock your state schools. My wife and I both went to our state colleges as undergrads (me because I couldn't afford anything else, wife because she wanted to save for medical school) and we couldn't be happier with how things turned out. I know it may not seem like what you worked so hard for but it's not a waste.",

You'll get over it at some point, just like the rest of us. It's now time to make the most out of your current opportunities during undergrad.

I counsel my students to spend the next four years in a place they'd like to live, not in a rank. No one will care in a few years where you went to school. But many of those who went to a high-ranked ivy league school will spend the rest of their lives expecting greatness to be handed to them and will be woefully disappointed when reality sets in - that life is about the relationships you form with yourself, with others, with animals and with this energy around us that makes things grow. Congratulations on your victory getting into a solid university. Your hard work paid off.",

You could have worked hard, but sometimes, rejection=does not fit, meaning, the school thinks you wouldn\u2019t fit the campus or the lifestyle there, so in a way, they are saving you both time and money. Ivy\u2019s are expensive. Everyone knows that. So on the bright side, at least you are saving money, maybe you can even invest the money into a double major or buying a house to get a head start in the part of life that actually matters. In the end, we are all paying for the branding of our degrees. The brand only matters for the first job, after that, it\u2019s just experience. You don\u2019t need an Ivy to earn experience. You may have to work hard to prove that you are as equal to any other Ivy school student, but it seems like you aren\u2019t afraid of hard work. In a way, you\u2019ve trained and disciplined yourself to have a good work ethic, a trait all jobs want, no matter what school you went to. You worked hard and that\u2019s what matters.",

I will say, one year later, I am thankful I didn't get in. I would be miserable being there. Trust me, everything happens for a reason. I dodged a $60,000x4 (approximately) sized bullet. Hard times breed better men. Thats what I believe. The hardest part of my experience was seeing them all getting praise and me getting none despite getting a scholarship and attending a school that is just as fucking good. But you gotta have faith that that praise is lying somewhere in your path. I wish you the best of luck.",

It should have never been about beating others, but becoming the person you strive to be.\n\nI don't want to spend all my life miserable and studying my ass off. I'd rather put in adequate work and in turn recieve an adequate life. Hell my brother graduated from a tiny ass local school and makes more money than a LOT of people. My uncle never went to college, yet runs a big local business that allows him to live more than comfortably. You shouldn't be looking at college as a way to beat others, but purely a way to be what you want to be. \n\nAs for me, I want to make music and study computer engineering. Not because I want to be better than everyone, but because it's my passion and what I want in life.\n\nIn other words, chill out, life is too short to try and be better than everyone. Enjoy it while you can and realize that you don't need to go to the best school on Earth to live a happy life.\n\nAnd to the few arrogant snobs that occassionaly lurk on this subreddit, I wish you well in the future.",

This is going to get downvoted for real... now I know there are some people who get into T10s through legacy or sports or just by pure chance, I think that last one is me, but if you look at the majority of students, you can see that they worked their asses off. I\u2019m not saying that you didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m not saying that anyone who does will get in, but atleast with T30 schools, most over qualified applicants can get in. I don\u2019t know anything about you, but I\u2019ll use someone I know who explained a similar emotion to the one you\u2019re feeling.\n\nHe worked really hard, got a 1510, took almost all of the most difficult classes he could, only got a few Bs throughout his whole high school career, and still didn\u2019t get into any T20s. Sure, he worked hard, but he could have worked harder. The quote you gave is mostly true, if you work as hard as you can on your academics and extracurriculars, you\u2019ll get in. If my friend wanted a T20 school bad enough, he should\u2019ve studied harder on the SAT to get 1550+, he should\u2019ve taken *the* most difficult course load and gotten straight A\u2019s. People often aren\u2019t willing to make those sacrifices, I know I didn\u2019t, and that should be respected, but those same people probably didn\u2019t work as hard as most students who got into T20s... most of the people who did get in are the ones who made the sacrifices you weren\u2019t willing to make",

Your education is what you make of it, and it's a true statement that the schools you apply to are a better indicator for success than the schools you attend, because success is a product of ambition. The fact that you put in the work is all that needs to be said. Besides, I've found that the student bodies of state schools tend to be a more diverse and interesting bunch than most of the T-10s ever could be, which I chalk up to wealth and prestige muddying the process.\n\nI suppose the point is: you may look back later in life and see this as a positive turning point.",

      "text": "This is a slightly old thread and there's been some great stuff said already. That said, I've been in the same spot and here's one bit of advice and an anecdote I think might be helpful.\n\nAdvice: Allow yourself to grieve. Don't try to undermine what you've lost. Acknowledging that it sucks, it hurts and isn't really going to change is an essential part of moving on.\nIt may feel dumb as you're going to a great school nonetheless but you've just spent spent months, maybe even years, striving for something and not landed quite where you wanted to. Of course that's going to hurt.\n\nAnecdote: I was in your spot a few years ago. I'm from the UK and applied to Cambridge. I got the needed predicted grades by the skin of my teeth but then miraculously aced the interview and got an offer. A few bad exams later and I was off to my backup uni. \nI have a few hobbies but outside of my field, I had one main thing that I really enjoyed and was expecting to stop: backstage production work. By pure coincidence my uni has one of the largest amateur backstage groups in the country. My misfortune has allowed me to continue to learn/enjoy it side-by-side with my degree. This wouldn't have happened at Cambridge where would have had to spend more time studying. \n\n\nSo, yeah, it sucks. But get stuck in where you are, invest in societies/groups and make lots of new friends. In no time at all you won't be able to imagine yourself anywhere else.",

I did all of this just to get into my 3rd choice. I realized I was making myself more disappointed. When I got to high school, I made a deal with myself not to fall into that mentality. Everything I would do I would do for me. The things I would get involved in I would choose because they make me a better, more interesting, more competent, and happier person. The goal would be self-improvement, regardless of if other people noticed. I got into a couple of great schools and I am more than happy to go to WashU next year. Stanford was my dream, but a couple of other great students got in instead. This time I wasn\u2019t nearly as sad, because of my new goals. Even though I hoped everything I had done would reward me with Stanford, that wasn\u2019t the main reward. The real reward was knowing that everything I have done in my high school career has helped me grow into a person I am proud to be.\n\nI know not everyone has this mindset, but I\u2019d encourage you to try it out in the next 4 years. A lot of the people I know who live and die by their resumes tend to make themselves miserable. Even if you do choose to do stuff for your resume, don\u2019t let that be the part you focus on",

      "text": "Hey, it's 100% okay to feel the way you're feeling, life is a bitch and there are so many people on this earth, it's a crap shoot these days and it's definitely not based 100% on your effort or anything you have control over, ESPECIALLY at a private school. \n\nThe most important thing right here is what you do with this feeling.\n\nYou are nothing. We're all nothing! We are all just people with hope and dreams. The sooner you can accept that, the happier, and more successful you will be. Just humans in a beautiful crazy world, and thats what makes you equal to everyone who got in, you are not deemed \"lesser\" (so don't deem yourself \"lesser!\").\n\nAll of the amazing things that inspired you to whatever degree or study you hope to pursue, was created by other humans! People with a passion to create and make a difference. \n\nA state school will help you learn  passion, and let you live life a little bit after all of your hard work. You need some perspective to go with that big brain and greasy elbow, once you get that, you're not gonna give a fuck about what Stanford or Harvard has to say about you. \n\nSome people work really hard right now and end up doing nothing with their entire lives. Some people did jack shit for 18 years, and they end up changing the world with their lives. \n\nReality is, your personality makes a huge difference in.... every single part of your life. If you can break your own barriers, put yourself out there, learn, grow and excel at a state school, the world is your oyster.",

Only to not only be rejected from my target and reach school, but also some of my safetys. I had a reasonable dream to goto a reasonable school to major in something I found great passion in while in high school, which is computer engineering. Now I my only option is goto a cuny school, which is a public business school and obviously doesn\u2019t have my major in hopes that maybe I can transfer somewhere else. I not only disappointed my entire family bringing disgrace upon myself, but I was too blinded by my foolish dreams to understand how unfortunate and unforgiving real world actually is.

Those summers you spent grinding, those late night study sessions, they are not wasted. Your dreams are not foolish. It\u2019s not foolish to want something for yourself and work hard for it, but the world is a unforgiving place . You can work so hard and the world will not reciprocate but that is simply what it means to live. In life there will be obstacles that will utterly crush you. This might be one of them but know that everything you do now will come to define who you are. Will you overcome this impediment, which may be filled with judgements, disappointments and sadness, or will you be swallow up by it. You have not brought disgrace upon yourself. Disgrace is not a word use to describe someone who has worked so hard nor is it a word for someone with a dream. This trajectory may not have been the proper path you\u2019ve always envisioned but here you are. So take a step forward toward a new beginning and show those around you that you will not be defined by this impediment. Seeing the success of those around us can make us feel lesser, this sub esp can be filled with people who achieved their dream but this sub is also filled with people who are disappointed. Take solace in the idea that many are in your same shoes although maybe not exactly. You are a person with vision for your own future. Right now the world may have thrown you a curve ball but so long as you don\u2019t give in you\u2019ll never strike out. Steady yourself, this is simply the beginning of your journey not the end.

The students that got into T20 school's didn't just have good grades, their personalities must've really stood out to the admissions officers based on their essays and EC's. It's not just about all nighters and working hard, it's simply a matter of personality. Don't sweat it because chances are you wouldn't have liked it there anyways if you were honest about who you are, and what your interests are. Better to get rejected and find a school that actually wants a student like you than to get accepted because you lied. It's a given anyone applying to a top school has good grades and put in work, at the end of the day it's really just luck.",

If you did not get in maby it's for the best. And as Warren buffet said \"I don't care where someone went to school, and that never caused me to hire anyone or buy a business\". Many people that went to ivy league schools have become nothing, I don't think it's about the school you go to but the person you are and the work you do. As Jordan peterson said: you don't want to be the smartest person in the room, but you don't want to be the stupidest person either(not direct quote). In the state school you might mark yourself as the best student, that however is much much harder in a ivy league school. \n\nAnd finally: \"no reason to cry over spilled milk\"",

Although I went to a very good state school and had nothing but happy memories and amazing experiences there, I feel like I'm a low intelligence second class citizen next to kids who were the same age as me but went to MIT, Caltech, Stanford etc.. They get to experience being part of a community full of elite people and gets to enjoy lifelong elite reputation and respect from others, they can get any job they want, and they just enjoy much more privileges and pride that my social status will never be on their level. You are indeed privileged enough to get good secondary education and even attend a four year reputable university but those 4 years will be one of the most important parts of your life that not only it will define your outlook on life but will follow you for the rest of your life. The good thing is you can always transfer to your dream school or you might even find joy and fulfillment in going to your state school and graduate with honors or something. But overall cest la vie and we all get dealt shitty cards in life one way or the other :(",
