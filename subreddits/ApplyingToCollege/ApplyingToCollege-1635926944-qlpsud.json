  "title:": "Question about Brown Video Portfolio",
  "text": "Hey, so I just found out Brown had a video portfolio, thankfully it's deadline is Nov 4th for ppl who applied ED.\n\nI was wondering how these videos are typically like, if we needed it to be staged, edited, and have segments of us doing other things since all the samples I'm seeing on Youtube seem to be super creative and well planned. I'm ngl, I have like way too much work piled up, and I thought this would be just a stationary type of video where I speak in front of the camera, which is what the Brown website said it was supposed to be like. However, seeing all these types of accepted videos online, I'm starting to doubt if the \"basic\" approach to the video portfolio would hurt me in admissions.\n\nSo my question is should I bother submitting the video portfolio if I plan on just having a basic talk-in with my topic in front of the camera, or would that hurt my application rather than help it? Mainly asking due to the shitload of amazing content put online from the accepted students for their video portfolios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if I worded this weird, but thank you in advance for any advice :)",
