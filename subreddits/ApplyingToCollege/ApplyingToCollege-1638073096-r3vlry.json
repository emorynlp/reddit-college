  "text": "So I just submitted my UC application a few days ago and I was just looking it over again because I was helping a friend and I realized that I submitted an essay under the wrong prompt. I meant to put it under prompt #4, but instead I put it under prompt #5. Is there any way to fix this or am I screwed?",
