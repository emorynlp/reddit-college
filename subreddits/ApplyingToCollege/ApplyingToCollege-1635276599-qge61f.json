  "title:": "The scale of Extra-curricular Activities",
  "text": "Everywhere I go, especially on this Reddit, I see kids with fantastic extra-curricular activities such as research at a university level or starting a national-level initiative. I have a fair amount of extra-curricular activities that I do because I genuinely enjoy them, but they are not as impressive as most of what I see on Reddit. Touchwood, I have decent grades, but ECs really just stress me out. Does anyone feel the same way?",

      "text": "Don\u2019t stress!  The important thing is to participate in ECs in which you have a genuine interest.  Don\u2019t compare yourself to others, especially people online.  Many factors affect the type of ECs available to a student and the amount of time a student can devote to ECs.  AOs understand that.  Applicants can stand out in other ways, e.g., personal essays.\n\nThe Yale Admissions podcast has a good episode on this topic.",
