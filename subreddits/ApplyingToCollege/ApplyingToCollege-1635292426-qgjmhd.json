  "text": "Long story short, I didn\u2019t perform to the best of my ability as an underclassman. (9-10) I didn\u2019t take school as seriously as I should have and my grades were reflected by that. While there were some legitimate reasons during 10th grade, for the most part it was my own fault and I need to explain that in the add info section, especially given my drastic jump during junior and even more so senior year. Will it be bad to straight up say, \u201cI didn\u2019t perform to my potential.\u201d And try to urge them toward my junior grades?",
