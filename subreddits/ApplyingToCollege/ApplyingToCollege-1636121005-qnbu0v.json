  "text": " I want to take a gap year but I am not sure if I should apply to my schools this year or the next.\n\nMy chances will probably be better next year by a lot but of course, getting in now would put me in a really comfortable position. I do not want to apply this year if they will throw my application right into the bin next year, though. Does someone have experience or knowledge on this?",
