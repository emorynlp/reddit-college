  "text": "I'm doing a few ECs, and all are mediocre except one.\n\nThe one I do well is Mock Trial. It isn't by any means great, as my team hasn't even made states, but I founded the club, grew it to 100+ members, started some other chapters at other schools, host competitions, and lead like 4 teams. I volunteer and compete through my teams too.\n\nI spend over 20 hours a week on Mock Trial, but since literally everything from volunteering to competing to leadership is only in this one activity, I was wondering whether I should drop some of my load in this activity and try diversifying a bit, especially since my intended major is CS>",

      "text": "The skills you learnt in Mock trial will serve you for life.  It looks great that you have critical thinking skills and more than just STEM skills. I think having MT will set you apart from other CS applicants. \n\nAdditionally, computer scientists are often in court (subpoenas and what not), and ur mock trial skills will serve you well. The public speaking part will help you in interviews and networking",
