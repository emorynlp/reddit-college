  "text": "Last year was the shittiest year of my life. I got bullied by some bitch in my school and lost my whole friend group (they moved away) so I had no friends. Both my mom's sisters got stage 2 breast cancer, making me worry for my mom and myself. Then to cheer us up, we got a surprise puppy, who was killed exactly a month later in a freak accident. My other dog got stage 3 leukemia to make things worse. Then I got influenza for a week and covid for over 1.5 months within the span of 2 months. Then the gynecologist told me I'm showing signs of endometriosis and put me on birth control that makes me feel like shit.\n\n My grades dropped from an A GPA to probably a C at this point. My parents are double Asian (Hong Kong and Indian) and they have super high expectations plus I'm the eldest so I have to set a good example. My predicted grades are dog shit so I can't even ED. My uni list won't work for me anymore, as the worst-case scenario was B- GPA which would be shitty unis for me as I'm Asian and I heard that the US is racist against Asians in college aps. I don't know what to do anymore I don't know what I was working for so hard. I don't want to give up as it won't help and I don't want to kill myself as my parents sacrificed so much for me but Idk what to do. \n\nI'm still working very hard and my grades are already recovering from last year's shitstorm so I think my semester grades will be good. do all American unis use predicted grades or are it possible I can use semester grades or something idk (i am an IBDP student)",

If it doesn't specify, then you can either make a judgment call and not include them, or contact the school's admission office and ask whether they should be included.  I suspect that unless the application specifically mentions you should include predicted grades that they should *not* be included, but that's just a guess.",
