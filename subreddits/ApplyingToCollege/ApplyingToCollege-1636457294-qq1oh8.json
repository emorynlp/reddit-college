  "text": "I was just looking at a university's page for an engineering course, and I see loads of classes, placements, grading etc.\n\nBut I'm looking for an answer to: what kinds of things I'll be able to engineer/build/design after doing this course. It's a pretty standard feature in places like Coursera. Why not here? That's the whole point of doing the course, right?",

We usually include this on the syllabus, in a section titled something like \"Course learning objectives.\" \n\nu/prsehgal is also correct that any course or major could  lead to a wide array of career paths.
