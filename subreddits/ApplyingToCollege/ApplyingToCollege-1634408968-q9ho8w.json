  "text": "If I put in my application, No for applying for need based financial aid, will they still consider me for merit scholarships? When my brother went through, he received nothing from FAFSA or need so my dad says I should say no to that question. However I still want to be considered for merit scholarships. I know they\u2019re different but I wonder if a college would consider my answer to one for the other?",

Check your colleges' scholarship web pages carefully.\n\nRe: checking the financial aid box:  first rule out whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",
