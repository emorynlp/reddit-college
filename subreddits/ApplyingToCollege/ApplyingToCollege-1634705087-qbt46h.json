  "title:": "Help - transfer to Georgia State University?",
  "text": "I'm honestly feeling a bit lost in my second year of community college. I'll need to apply for transfer soon. I have full scholarships to any public college in Georgia. \n\nGSU seems to be the best option as it's free, I have guaranteed admission, I can commute, and it has a great history dual degree program so I can get my master's in five years. There's nowhere else public in Georgia that I'm interested in. Just Emory and that's private. I could potentially afford Emory if I got in and reallyyyy stretched my money.\n\nI want to transfer out of state to a school like William and Mary, but can't afford it. I have a 4.0 gpa, honors courses, decent high school ECs, and good essays. I'll also likely have a good letter of rec if I ask, from a professor who knows me well.\n\nAm I missing options here? What should I do?",

      "text": "I'd apply for all the private  schools or out of state schools you want to just to see what they give you for aid. In the end, you'll be able to fall back on an awesome deal At GSU if those don't work out l. You might also end up at a school like W&M , and the aid might end up working in your favor. You gotta be realistic and prepare for anything with your expectations, but I'm also a big believer in rolling the dice and seeing what happens.",

      "text": "Have you run the net price calculator for Emory and other private schools?  Often they are more affordable than you expect if you qualify for need based aid, although if you've got a full scholarship at GSU that's hard to beat.\n\nI don't think you are missing anything with an OOS public school like William & Mary - public schools generally focus their need based aid on in-state students.",

          "text": "Yes I have! It would end up about 15-20k a year (I think) after my scholarship and grant money. I qualify for a little need based aid but unfortunately my parents make too much lol, and won't really pay for much. I work part time so I could pay for some of it, but not all.\n\nThanks for the encouragement. I guess it's a case of the grass being greener on the other side, lol.",
