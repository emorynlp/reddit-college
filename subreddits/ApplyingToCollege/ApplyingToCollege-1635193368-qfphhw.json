  "title:": "Fantasy for personal essay",
  "text": "Hi, so basically my application essay is about how I discovered my love for fantasy books at the beginning of the pandemic and how this unrealistic world and characters helped me with my anxiety and how they changed my view of my daily life. I sent the essay to a friend in college and she said that in universities everyone have to read, so the topic is boring and won't catch the administration attention. \n\nThe truth is I love reading and I dont really have anything else I would like to talk about, but now I'm scared the essay is to basic.\n\n Should I keep my topic or start from 0. Is fantasy a good enough topic?",

You can probably only \u201csay\u201d that this has changed your view\u2026 but probably have no \u201cevidence\u201c to back that up.",
