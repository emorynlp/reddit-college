  "text": "I currently take AP Physics C Mechanics, AP Comp Sci A, AP Lit, AP Psych, AP Econ, and Multi Calc. I plan to major in engineering so I will definitely take the comp sci and physics tests, should I also take the humanities exams to opt-out of certain core classes. I don't know where I am going yet but am aiming for t20s. If I should take an exam which one would be the best to use to opt-out of college requirements?\n\n\\*\\*I know that I should probably look up each individually, but is there any general consensus?",
