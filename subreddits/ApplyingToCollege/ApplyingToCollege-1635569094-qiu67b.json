  "text": "Hey Everyone! Hope you're doing well. \n\nI submitted my UMich EA application to just LSA, but Common App is informing me that I must submit a portfolio on Slideroom. I answered no to the question that asked about whether or not I would like to do preferred admissions, so I'm not sure why this is still showing up on my portal. Could someone please clarify what I should do?\n\nThanks!",
