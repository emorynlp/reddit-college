  "text": "So y'all I think they saw my SAT score and like send daily emails which begin like \"You're talented; We're interested in you; Your academic records show you'll excel here; I can wait to read your application.\"\n\nI know a lot of people on here love CWRU, and I do too tbh. The only issue is that I won't be able to afford it even with their highest scholarship for international students. And it already sucks that I can't apply, but then they send emails like this\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15. SUCKS \ud83d\ude35",
