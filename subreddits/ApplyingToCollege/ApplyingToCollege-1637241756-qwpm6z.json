      "text": "That\u2019s a good question to ask yourself \u2014 especially to highly rejective colleges. It might not be imposter syndrome as much as a dose of realism. The fact is for the highly rejective schools and most of the rejective colleges most kids who apply aren\u2019t accepted. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t apply if you\u2019ve done your research and feel that they are good fits for you and you\u2019re a good fit for them. But you can\u2019t apply to those highly rejective colleges with any kind of expectation of acceptance \u2014 no matter how shiny and beautiful your stats and application are.",

Colleges have to sift through hundreds or thousands of applicants with \"national-level recognition\" or \"notable research work\" or whatever relatively notable achievement there is and they ultimately have to reject the majority of those because that'd make for a relatively monotonous class.\n\nAnd then a lower stat yet nonetheless qualified applicant comes along with fabulous essays and a unique background that the university just can't help but accept them because of what they can provide to spice up the student body.",
