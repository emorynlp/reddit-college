  "text": "Wondering how you would account for the distance learning thing. All my comments are on google classroom or they\u2019re comments on google docs, so how could I transfer that to pdf? Do I just insert comments with [1] and put the comment at the bottom of the paper?\n\nEDIT: ALSO, can I use a paper that was originally ~10 pages, but just attach the first 2 pages of the paper? \n\nThanks!",

They ask for a paper that is 1-2 pages long, so I assume they expect a paper that is 1-2 pages long in its entirety. If an AO reads like 1/5 of an essay, don't know exactly how they would react lol.",

              "text": "Hmm well its just my opinion, but I feel like an AO would like to see how writers structure their whole essay. Even if a writer's style is very good, they might be terrible at organizing their arguments (personally, I know plenty of people who write \"well,\" but can't structure their essays to execute their points). Unless there's some info that says otherwise, I think that seeing a writer's work in whole is valuable.",
