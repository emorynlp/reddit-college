Trust me when I say this that the SAT is a very very small component of your application and going test optional truly does not disadvantage you. I got admitted to Cornell, UPenn, CMU, UCLA, UCB etc. Also I had a B in my transcript too so I would say one thing I took away from the college app process is that it is a holistic process and you need your personality to shine through in your essays. Good luck!",
