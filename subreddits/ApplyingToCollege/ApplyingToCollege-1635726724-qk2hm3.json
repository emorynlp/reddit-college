  "text": "I wrote my essay as a comparison to my inner personal relationship with the grass outside of my childhood home and how my fathers obsession with mowing it down was a look into his narcissism and such. I want to write my next few paragraphs on how i was able to still take inspiration from such a secluded home and practically raise myself but I don\u2019t know how to do that and still keep the comparison of me and grass. Plus I need to talk about myself the next few paragraphs and just don\u2019t know how to start.",
