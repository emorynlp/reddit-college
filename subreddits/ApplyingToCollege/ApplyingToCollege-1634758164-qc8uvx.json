Its not that they were at loss just that they brought stuff more than they required or irrespective of their needs. Although my way did gave them satisfaction. \n\nI mean it does show my brainy side but.... What do you think? How can I make my self seem less cruel?\n\nEdit- Help me rephrase-\n\nI introduced a system, following two psychological facts.....\n\n.....It helps us..... restrict their options, and hence result in the instant purchase and high satisfaction of customers.",

      "text": "I'm confused here. How do you *know* people bought more than they needed or wanted? Manipulated is indeed a strong word and how it is being used here seems a bit off.  In other words, I would agree with others not to use the term because it is troubling and distasteful; however, I also think the term is unwarranted.\n\nFirst, marketing uses psychology and the line for manipulation is grey: adults have to own their decisions and, so long as what you presented was not fraudulent, manipulation seems tenuous. If your marketing was manipulative, then so are almost all presentations. e.g. By presenting the data in a chart of historical values, I manipulated people to believe current numbers are high. Really? That seems more like you offered helpful context.\n\nSecond, people get inundated easily. Swedish policy makers presented people with pages of investment fund choices. Guess what people did? They got overwhelmed and most stuck with the first choice -- which was a poor choice. Restricting the choices people are confronted with is not clearly manipulation and may, in fact, make it easier for them to decide what is best for them.\n\nDoes manipulation happen? Sure. Excluding material information (this used car was in a crash) or choices which are probably better (you could receive more for the same price) would be unethical and manipulative. Promoting certain choices while still allowing other choices, however, would not be unethical.\n\nFinally, you noted that people were satisfied. Unless you are taking advantage of people's mental incapacity, addictions, or lack of knowledge, it seems presumptuous to assume they are worse off despite being satisfied with their transactions. If we don't trust [capable adults to make choices they are happy to make](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/lack-capacity-to-contract-32647.html), I'm not sure what sort of society we will have.",
