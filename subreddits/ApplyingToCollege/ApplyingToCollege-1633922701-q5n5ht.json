  "text": "Just wanted to rant with how competitive college application process is getting. Im not even talking abt ivys or t20s. Seeing what people do just to get into state schools is crazy (particularly cs) People legit be starting companies, startups,  having like 10 internships, etc. I swear people spend more time on their college applications vs trying to get a job. I wonder how ECs will look like in 10 years. It would be pretty funny if somebody put curing cancer as an EC",

      "text": "Well if it's any consolation most of my peers at HYPSM had one or two activities (myself included) that they care about and put a sh\\*t ton of time and effort into, ultimately actually accomplishing something and getting real impactful results.\n\nI don't think people with 15 activities spanning the realm of all activities get very far. I had a lot of peers who started multiple NGOs and had high school leadership positions in clubs, both of which amounted to nothing except weekly meetings. Most of them just ended up at a mid-tier (still good) school.",
