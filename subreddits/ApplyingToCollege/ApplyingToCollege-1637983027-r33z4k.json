  "text": "Okay so I applied to my ED school and a couple of other school and all the schools I\u2019m applying to require at least 2 years of foreign language. I took Latin 1 in 10 grd but hated it so I switched to Spanish 1 in 11th. I\u2019m taking Spanish 2 this year in 12th grade. Do I need to tell the colleges I am taking my 2nd year of foreign language sicne on my transcript it will not show Spanish 2 and they will only see 1 year of the same foreign language??",
