  "text": "Hello!! As it says in the title, I\u2019m applying to film school but I\u2019m having a bit of a dilemma right now. I\u2019ve been planning on applying ED to NYU for the longest time, as NYU\u2019s program is the best for what I want to do as a filmmaker as it seemingly allows students to take both animation and live action classes, alongside offering courses on writing/producing children\u2019s television. I also love NYC, and I don\u2019t mind not having a \u2018true campus.\u2019 However, I just visited Boston University as I know they also have a great film program, and I love the area it\u2019s in so, so much. I\u2019m having a difficult time deciding if I should still ED NYU now, especially because BU\u2019s program seems more general compared to NYU\u2019s and, even though my stats and portfolio are pretty okay, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be unable to get into NYU without ED. I\u2019m going to visit NYU one more time but, before that, any advice please? Thanks in advance :D",

      "text": "If you are serious about a film career and able to get in, NYU hands down. But if your heart is really set on BU and you worry you'll have buyers remorse at NYU, go to BU. You can always try to transfer later.\n\nYou go to film school for the connections. If you're at any major university and apply yourself, you'll get a good well rounded education. And no matter what your degree you can always go into the entertainment business. But at USC, NYU, Chapman or AFI you meet many more people who can help your career. And this applies to faculty, alumni and your fellow students. Internships, writers room opportunities, shadowing directors - things like that come more often through casual introductions than blind applications. And particularly at NYU and USC it's the friend-group you form during your time there that will keep being important to sourcing those opportunities. \n\nThere are no guarantees, though. You can go to a top film school and wind up never working in the business or go to a community college and win an Oscar. Going to USC or NYU just helps you stack the deck a little more in your favor if you are diligent, persistent and open to getting to know people.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for the advice!! I actually thought about it a lot more and settled on definitely applying ED to NYU (of course, still applying to other schools in case I don\u2019t get in), especially because their course offerings are much better for what I want to do and, like what you said, it is a school that offers a lot of connections which is important. Thanks again!!",
