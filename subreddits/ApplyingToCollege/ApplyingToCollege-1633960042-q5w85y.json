  "title:": "Looking for advice on my film school applications!!",
  "text": "Hello!! As it says in the title, I\u2019m applying to film school but I\u2019m having a bit of a dilemma right now. I\u2019ve been planning on applying ED to NYU for the longest time, as NYU\u2019s program is the best for what I want to do as a filmmaker as it seemingly allows students to take both animation and live action classes, alongside offering courses on writing/producing children\u2019s television. I also love NYC, and I don\u2019t mind not having a \u2018true campus.\u2019 However, I just visited Boston University as I know they also have a great film program, and I love the area it\u2019s in so, so much. I\u2019m having a difficult time deciding if I should still ED NYU now, especially because BU\u2019s program seems more general compared to NYU\u2019s and, even though my stats and portfolio are pretty okay, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be unable to get into NYU without ED. I\u2019m going to visit NYU one more time but, before that, any advice please? Thanks in advance :D",
