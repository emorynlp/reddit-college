  "text": "I made a post about this a few months back, but with application deadlines right around the corner, I wanted to make sure  \ud83d\ude2c\n\nI took two college courses this summer, and I didn't do so hot. These are the worst grades I'd ever gotten, and ngl the courses really kicked my ass. (I have all A's other than these two, in the highest rigor course load at my school.)
