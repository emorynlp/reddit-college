      "text": "i think it depends on what you do with your time. if you're graduating early to  spend the next semester doing research w professors, or you're taking dual enrollment classes or anything academic, it won't be too bad as long as whatever you do is obviously above high school level work. if you graduate early to work a regular job / do nothing, that'll probably reflect badly.",

              "text": "Well the main (and arguably only) thing AO's are looking for in 2nd semester of senior year is that you're keeping grades at an acceptable level. If you don't have grades or any academics to show, that might not be great. of course i'm not an AO and i'm not qualified to make assumptions so take it with a grain of salt :) also your internships should be something that not everyone can get / had a rigorous application process or very high requirements to enter. if it's not, then it looks like you gave up academics to pursue something that any averagely accomplished high schooler could do",
