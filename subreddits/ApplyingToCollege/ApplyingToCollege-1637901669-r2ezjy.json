Their criteria can\u2019t be applied to every kind of EC because it\u2019s too general and the only examples they name explicitly are in-school positions. Their criteria for an extracurricular 1 is possible national achievement, but a national award in an easy competition wouldn\u2019t be in the same category as USAMO gold. The problem is that because exceptions exist like that (and are very common), we don\u2019t know how they value them. There are also other factors like continuity, time spent, and impact that are not even mentioned in the criteria that would strengthen or weaken an EC. You can try assigning a ballpark rating for yourself, but don\u2019t count on it being accurate at all because you\u2019re not an AO",

At the same time, this is what exists, and obviously some random national accomplishment isn't the same as USAMO gold, but it's still considered national achievement. I didn't read OP's post too much, but if all his ECs are local/school activities, there's no chance he'll have a high score on the EC rubric no matter what he did if it's only local.",
