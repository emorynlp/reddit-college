The thing with Princeton is that you have to be near academically perfect (near 4.0, 1510 is mean sat but 75% is 1570) plus truly extraordinary in other way(s) in ecs to get in, or else it wouldn\u2019t be the #1 uni in the country. What are you interested in? They don\u2019t look for picture perfect kids - what could you develop into something very impressive and with a large impact in the world by the time you apply?",
