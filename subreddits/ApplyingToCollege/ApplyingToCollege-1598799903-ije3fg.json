The campus is fine, the school has a huge police force, and there are very nice parts, but it can be a bit sketchy.  Last time I was there visiting a UC grad student friend, the guy in the car next to me at the stop light started throwing up gang signs to me.  Luckily we were both reppin\u2019 the same fam, so it was cool...j/k.   There was also some kind altercation in the condo next to his that night.  But even if you put that aside, it lacks the level of area amenities that you can find elsewhere (restaurants, bars, activities) if you\u2019re into those things.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t don\u2019t have them, it\u2019s simply more limited and I don\u2019t like them as much as other areas.  \n\nIn terms of academics, it\u2019s great.  However, this is one place I would urge that you spend some time visiting and interacting with students.  While you get a wide variety of people at every school, there\u2019s often a general personality that emerges.  UC has this.  Whether it\u2019s for you, only you can decide, but I would try to experience it before deciding to go there.",
