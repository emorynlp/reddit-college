  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI submitted my EA/ED applications to 5 CommonApp schools today, but I just realized that I messed up on the name for one of the courses I\u2019m taking senior year (I put Wind Symphony instead of Wind Ensemble). Also for 4 of the schools it says that my application has already been downloaded by the college already. What should I do to fix this error and how screwed am I?",

      "text": "you can change your common app for future schools, but this really doesn\u2019t feel like something that a college would care about. if you are really worried you could email your AO to fix it, but i feel like since AOs are so busy rn, it probabky isn\u2019t worth it.",
