      "text": "Which schools are safeties very much depends on how strong your application is.  Since you've said your list is \"top heavy\" I'll assume it's \"very strong\".\n\nHare are some reasonably well-regarded schools (and their overall acceptance rates and 75th percentile SAT scores) that might reasonably be considered safeties *or targets* for you:\n\nWisconsin (54%, 1490)\n\nMaryland (44%, 1480)\n\nPurdue (60%, 1440)\n\nColorado (78%, 1360)\n\nVirginia Tech (70%, 1390)\n\nTexas A&M (58%, 1390)\n\nMinnesota (57%, 1480)\n\nOhio State (54%, 1460)\n\nPenn State (49%, 1370)\n\nMichigan State (71%, 1320)\n\nNorth Carolina State (45%, 1420)\n\nArizona (85%, 1360)\n\nArizona State (86%, 1360)\n\nBear in mind:  these are all public so their acceptance rates may be lower (potentially much lower) for out-of-state applicants.  Also, the top few are especially strong for CS so they may have lower admit rates for CS applicants.",
