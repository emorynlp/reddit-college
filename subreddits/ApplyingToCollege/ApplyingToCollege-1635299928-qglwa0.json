  "text": "On my identification card there is a space in my name (ex: Ban ana). However in my daily life I remove the space and conjoin my name to one word (ex: Banana). I was wondering if I use my official name on my college application but parts of my application mentions my \"unofficial\" name, will my application  be revoked? I hope that made sense, it's one of my big worries.",
