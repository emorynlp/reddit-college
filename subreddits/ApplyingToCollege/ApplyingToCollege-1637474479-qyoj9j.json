I wanted to know if there is a way if I can do off campus jobs that are NOT RELATED TO MY MAJOR starting from my Sophomore year for my living expenses. Can I ask my DSO for it?! Please help!!!",

Your best bet for finding employment as an intl will be 1) find on-campus jobs 2) find internships that don\u2019t require US work authorization that your college will give a grant/stipend for 3) find internships that you can use your CPT for",
