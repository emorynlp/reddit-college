  "title:": "Are harvard ppl really \"smart\"? And is it good for CS?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI read an article today which said that most of harvards students are either big donors or legacies. Is this true? I mean tbh i thought all along that its the place for geniuses and all but upon hearing this and even watching youtube vids on the topic im aware that a lot of ppl are just plain rich and thats it. lmao I just discovered have a multibillion dollar endowment, and use a lot of it used to grow their bank more\n\nAnd if it is all true, then why am I even applying there? That too, for *CS*, a major which (presumably) is not a focus there? Of course i applied to other schools but like , i mean, it just means more work to do on my commonapp and stuff. Wasta time. lmao",

      "text": "Of course, Harvard students are \"smart\" - what kind of a question is that? Sure, they have a lot of legacy and sports admits, but they wouldn't admit just anybody because of three reasons. And being rich doesn't mean it's \"easy\" to get into Harvard or similar schools. And yes, it is a great school for CS too, just like it is for many other majors.",
