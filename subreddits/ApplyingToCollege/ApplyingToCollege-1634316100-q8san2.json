I am applying for Wharton at UPenn not asking for financial aid.\n\nI have a couple questions:\n1. To look at 25/75 percentile, should I consider the data from year before test optional or after.\n2. Should i submit my score based on the context given.  \n\nIf this post does not comply with the rules, please let me know. I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m new to the community here. Thanks.",
