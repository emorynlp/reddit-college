  "title:": "Parents do not know where Harvard is but a girl from a village in India gets into Harvard",
  "text": "Yes, we hear about Olivia Jade and Rick (Rolling) Singer and the side door and the back door and the rich guaranteeing their spots at top institutions, but we forget there is a front door too. And that there are inspiring cases too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA girl with illiterate parents from a rural village in India got into Harvard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the article: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/my-parents-do-not-know-where-harvard-is-jharkhand-girl-enjoys-spotlight-after-getting-harvard-scholarship/articleshow/82369266.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/my-parents-do-not-know-where-harvard-is-jharkhand-girl-enjoys-spotlight-after-getting-harvard-scholarship/articleshow/82369266.cms)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will quote relevant parts of the article:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jharkhand girl Seema Kumari, 17, daughter of illiterate parents working as subsistence farmers made headlines after securing a full scholarship from Harvard University. She gained prominence as Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra tweeted a congratulatory message.  \n>  \n>Seema has got a full scholarship to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was also accepted at Ashoka University, Middlebury College, and Trinity College.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Born and brought up in Dahu village in Ormanjhi block near state capital Ranchi, she finished her class XII through NIOS. She joined the youth football team at the NGO in 2012.  \n>  \n>**Yet to finalise the subject**\nSeema is currently undecided about what her major will be, but she is interested in pursuing four-year undergraduate programme in Sociology or Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. \u201cI plan to start an organisation for women in my village and studying these subjects will help me. My organisation will work to help women start small businesses that would train them to be financially independent. I also want to educate women about their rights and build a bigger network to support women by providing essential vocational skills and knowledge,\u201d explains Seema who is likely to go to the US in August.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**No access to education, technology**  \n>  \n>\u201cAs a first-generation learner, I did not grow up reading books or having an access to educational material. My learning was more from the day to day life. For instance, participating in traditional farming, looking after cattle and livestock and nurturing nature\u201d says Seema, who studied till class VII at local government school. Seema is flooded with messages on social media, ever since news about her success went viral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Parents\u2019 reaction**  \n>  \n>Seema\u2019s parents are happy but do not know much about the importance of Harvard scholarship. \u201cMy parents do not even know the name of this prominent global university and have no idea of what I have achieved,\u201d she adds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Future plan**  \n>  \n>Seema plans to return to India to work towards gender equality: \"Gender equality is something that my village needs to develop socially. Sensitising the villagers will reduce injustices against women and cases of gender discrimination, domestic violence, child marriage etc. It would not only show economic growth but also social development where women will be a part of decision making at each house,\u201d says Seema.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: As someone from India myself, I think it is important to provide the context u/sevsaysturntopage394 has given in the comments:\n\n\"This is absolutely incredible, like small villages in India barely have any resources for education, especially for girls. Most girls are married off young in such rural areas as the only viable option in their lives is to be a homemaker. Also, the state she lives in, i.e. Jharkhand, is quite poor and underdeveloped. She's truly an inspiration. I wish her everything good in life and I hope she does her best to bring about gender equality change in India cause God knows we need it.\"\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the awards!\n\n\nSpeaking of which, I've written this post. Time to find my own ticket to get into Harvard using the front door :)",

Coming from a tiny village on the other side of the world, with a very different background from your average Harvard student, and presumably little financial or emotional support in America, it makes me wonder how much more difficult it\u2019ll be for her to finish her education at Harvard than for students from wealthier backgrounds with all the resources and knowledge to succeed in Harvard with relative ease. \n\nFitting in with students and feeling at home, even with the Indian American diaspora, will be a struggle for someone who is so different from everyone else. \n\nTo get into Harvard from such a difficult starting-point means this woman is of high caliber, and I hope that caliber is enough to carry her through the grueling journey that\u2019s next for her with her mental health intact. I wish her the best of luck.",

I don't blame them as they felt that getting into top colleges in India like IITs or AIIMS was the only hope for middle-class Indian families like ours.\n\nAnd the funniest thing about this whole journey was that when I told them that I got into UMass and Purdue, they told me to get back to my studies and that I was just wasting my time and theirs on some utopian stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, finances are a barrier to success here in India, so couldn't commit to Purdue or UMass and am packing my bags to SUNY Stony Brook.\n\nAnother tip to my Indian friends:- Doesn't matter man, in the long run,  you never know what you are capable of. So, rise up and congratulate yourself, that you fought against the critical mindset of the Indian society and applied abroad.\n\nBecause  Sharma Aunty's MY SON GOT INTO A TOP COLLEGE swag is temporary and  maybe in 10 years, you might be playing the UNO reverse card and proudly  saying that,\" Yes, I thought out of the box and that's why I am here.\"\n\nCheers! Hustle!\n\nPeace out!",
