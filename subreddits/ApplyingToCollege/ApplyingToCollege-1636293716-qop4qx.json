  "text": "My parents are married, but my father has income in an EU country and my mother has an income in India with each having a business in the respective countries. How can I accurately report the information of both of them, given that there is no 'married but income in different countries' or a similar option on the CSS? Should I choose 'separated'? That sounds wrong and misleading to me tho since they are married.",

          "text": "we have a rented house in EU which is technically an expense but not a loan on our house in India so I'm not sure how to report that. Secondly, when I enter the information for their businesses I need to put in the business address, and that assumes that both businesses are in the same country since it only asks for street, city, state. so it seems that country is significant to some extent.",
