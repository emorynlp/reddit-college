  "text": "Hi y'all. I'm Canadian and was only thinking of applying to Canadian school but because of job opportunities and the forgoing of the SAT/ACT by quite a few unis this year, I am thinking of also applying to the US. Problem is, I have never researched schools outside the T20's and given my not-so-great ECs, probably won't make it there.\n\nLocation: I\u2019d like a campus near a big tech-hub. Basically, schools that become feeders for internships and jobs at tech companies.\nRegion: Wherever.\nMajor: CS, maybe engineering.\nSize: On the bigger end of the spectrum\nCosts: Doesn't matter\n\nOther information: I enjoyed Cornell when I visited, but as mentioned above I hated NYU when I visited NYC. I want a connected campus.\n\nSchools I\u2019m applying to: lol\n\nStats:\n~ 3.6 UW (is this for my entire high school grades or just grade 12?)\nSouth asian\nMale\nDoing a few IB and AP courses\nDo a few math/coding competitions. Did pretty good in a grade 11 one.\nTwo clubs for ~3 hours per week. Started in grade 12.\nCompetitive code on personal time.\nSports in grade 10.\n\nAlso, I reposted this because I posted it at like 4 last night and only got 1 comment.\n\nEdit: OK I went to a GPA calculator and I'll check again but it was like a 3.54 UW and 3.81 W (since I took IB classes).",

      "text": ">campus near a big tech-hub\n\nSanta Clara University (mid size, in Silicon Valley) comes to mind immediately. SCU offers both CS in their arts & sciences school and in their engineering school (CS, ECE, CSE, etc), though the engineering school is more competitive, and possibly a tall order with a 3.6 and no scores.\n\nWork backwards. Look into areas that are tech hubs (e.g., Boston? Austin?) and then look for schools nearby where test optional admission is possible with a  3.6.\n\nTry to take SAT or ACT if possible.",
