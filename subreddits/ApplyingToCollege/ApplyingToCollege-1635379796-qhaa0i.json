      "text": "Just be yourself and have a conversation. I have these meetings with students all the time. I\u2019m not \u201cevaluating\u201d the student during the conversation. But you should be able to talk about what major(s) interests you and what inspired that interest. \n\nAsk them to describe the courses you\u2019d take as a freshman. Once admitted to Purdue, will you have to achieve a certain GPA to enter the specific major that you want to pursue? Ask about clubs related to your major as well as other things that interest you (performing arts, sports, community service, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019re on campus, ask if you can see some of the facilities related to your major.",
