      "text": "To expand upon what BrawnyAcolyte said:\nThere are 2 different architecture degrees you can get from undergrad: one is a 4 year degree (schools like WashU, Northeastern, UPenn, etc ) have them and the other is a 5 year degree which is called a BArch. (Cornell, Syracuse, UT Austin, Penn State, Tulane, etc)\n\nThe 5 yr BArch is more intense and is a professional degree which allows you to eventually become a licensed architect \n\nThe 4 year degree is not as intense and you must get a MArch (masters) afterwards to eventually become a licensed architect- this can take anywhere from 2-3 years to get the MArch\n\nThe only Ivy to offer a BArch is Cornell. Generally speaking, BArch programs are more competitive to get into then the 4 year degree programs\u2026",
