  "text": "Hey guys, so I accidentally reported my GPA Scale as a 5.0 instead of a 4.0, and reported my weighted gpa (above 4). I've contacted all my universities but I cannot find the link to contact Stanford, so I added an application update and in the 500 characters wrote a letter to tell admissions about the issue. Will they notice? Please help",
