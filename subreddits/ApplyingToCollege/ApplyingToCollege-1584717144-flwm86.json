UCLA will give you an amazing education while also having a pretty campus and alumni pride, all located in the beautiful rolling hills of LA. Most applicants are from California anyways so the 100k thing doesn't apply. Also, most private school educations equivalent to UCLA will be about the same price if not more expensive.\n\nIt's condescending to say that most people only want to go to UCLA for the prestige. This claim may have some merit for a school like Harvard, but this falls apart when you consider that UCLA is considerably less prestigious than Harvard and has more than twice the applicants. If applicants were truly only applying for clout than Harvard and Stanford wouldn't be processing less than half the number of applications as UCLA.",

Are we even questioning the fact that the 31st best worldwide Uni isn't as reputable as the 30th? Come on.\n\nOh, and before downvoting claiming I don't know shit about college: I'm a Geosciences major (BSc, soon to be MSc, and PhD to be). Before applying, you may wanna check the specific placement of the department of your interest. A place may rank -- for instance -- 35th, with a super duper Chemistry School (10th) and an average Liberal Arts College (120th).",

Besides, this sort of competition, based on numbers only, is not sane.   \nIf you get accepted into Wisconsin-Madison, or into Vanderbilt, does it mean you're getting a useless degree? A less reputable degree? Obviously nope. Otherwise, there would be no collaboration between institutions whatsoever, or only graduates from Yale would be employed somewhere making a six-figures salary.   \n\n\nWhile I 100% agree that some places have to be completely erased, due to the scarce quality of overall teaching, facilities, research, and whatnot, I do believe there's some middle ground between T30s and lower 30s.  \nAnd the middle ground is as reputable as an Ivy. Period.   \nSomeplace ranked 201st is STILL in the top 1% worldwide.",
