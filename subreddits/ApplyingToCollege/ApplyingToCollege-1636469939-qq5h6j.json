  "title:": "How to get into University of Paris with low gpa",
  "text": "I\u2019m in tenth grade now and I\u2019m not from an EU country, my GPA is 2.4, teachers at my school are very hard on giving high scores so I don\u2019t think I can get a higher GPA in the next two years. I\u2019ve passed DELF C1, I want to apply to University of Paris in France for psychology, are there any other ways to make my application look better or balance my low GPA on the application? Thank you!",
