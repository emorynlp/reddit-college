      "text": "It's certainly understandable that with the amount of time and thought you dedicate to your crush/SO, you would only naturally consider them as you plan out your future, right?\n\nI don't want to rain on anyone's rom-com parade, but please be careful deciding where to go to college based on where your high school SO or crush goes.  Most high school relationships don't last in college.  This is four years of your life, six figures of someone's money, and one of the most formative experiences you'll have.  Don't let your vision be clouded by a high school crush.  \n\nIn general, if you are engaged or married, then it makes sense to make major life decisions together.  That's part of what a lifelong commitment means.  But if you're not, then make sure you will be happy with your decisions and options whether your relationship ends in marriage or not.  Make sure you pick colleges based on what you want for your own future, not where someone else is attending.\n\n*\"Yeah, yeah, that's what my parents would say too...\"*\n\nOk, let's look at some data.  [This article indicates **just 5% of high school relationships** last beyond freshman year of college.](https://www.albionpleiad.com/2013/02/break-up-valentines-piece)\n\nFurthermore, [**just 2% of existing marriages** are from a high school relationship.](https://mensdivorce.com/high-school-sweethearts/)  You are almost three times more likely to get into Princeton than you are to marry your high school crush for life.\n\nWhen it comes to college, this means that you are **FAR** more likely to break up during your freshman year (95%, assuming you ever get together in the first place) than you are to get married and spend the rest of your lives together (2%).  Make your decisions accordingly.",

I'm mainly considering Princeton because it has a wonderful focus on STEM classes and has a strong presence for good internships + study abroad programs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to get into a relationship or associate with my crush anyways now or ever,  because we belong to completely different cliques and other things. But, I did find out what Princeton is about, cause he would talk about it in class. I ended up doing my own research, for I didn't really know anything about the college before, so it was a great way to explore. I really liked the college campus and location, so it ended on a completely different note, with me applying because I wanted to go there.\n\nThank you so much for your advice! I really appreciate it. I'll make sure I keep my head below the clouds.",
