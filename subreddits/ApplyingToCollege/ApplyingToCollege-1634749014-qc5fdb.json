  "text": "(im not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this)\n\nI remember back in highschool my avid teacher gave us this form to sign with your email address asking what you are interested in and I did that having no clue what it is.\n\nI began getting so much college email spam that it fills up my entire inbox and its so annoying and Unsubscribing to them doesn\u2019t even do anything. I went to the college board website and put my email to see if they can remove it and they said there\u2019s no registered email. \n\nI\u2019m not interested in going to college and I keep getting these email spams and I looked up many times on the internet how to get rid of it and there\u2019s nothing.\n\nplease help :(",
