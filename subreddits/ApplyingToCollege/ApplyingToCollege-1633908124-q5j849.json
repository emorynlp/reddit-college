          "text": "They are not viewed the same because they are fundamentally different. The IBDP is THE most rigorous *structured* program a student can undertake-literally every class is advanced. The AP equivalent would be a student maxing out on AP classes for their schedule junior and senior year. The benefit AP gives a students is more flexibility because the classes are one offs compared to an integrated program like IB.\n\nThere is a reason why the AP program is trying to become more like IB with the addition of AP Capstone, AP Seminar, and AP Research. Those extra components that IB requires really mimic the learning experience students would have at a college. There\u2019s more on an emphasis on critical thinking across disciplines with the IB program, which makes it attractive for selective colleges/universities.",

In the end I think I benefited more from not having to go to IB. Due to AP classes being less rigorous, I had time to gain a significant amount of credits via dual enrollment. And according to my IB friends, IB students simply did not have the time to do things like dual enrollment. Plus, I think dual enrollment + AP is more impressive then just IB.",

If you were looking for an elite private college, know that you will get very few if any AP credits.\n\nExamples from the state level would be that the state of Florida gives credit for three or above on any AP just about, so if you take a dozen AP classes you could enter with a year and a half of credit or close to it without even having to think about it.\n\nThe rules are a little more stringent in Arizona, were you would still likely have a full year of credits out of the way. Possibly less for an engineering major\n\nAnd then in Texas, with the possible exception of UT Austin, you\u2019d have at least a year done already.\n\nThose are the only three states that I\u2019ve actually research the AP transfer tables, but it gives you a general idea.",

Maybe take 1 AP class sophomore year or self study for one. Junior year take at least 3 AP classes, and take another 3 or 4 in senior year.",
