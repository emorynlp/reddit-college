      "text": "the \u201cwhile the rest of the world was suffering\u201d sounds just bad to me. It is a good idea but it is worded terribly here. You can easily make an essay about your Covid-19 progress and maybe add a little background of why is that impressive for you. But u have to be careful because it can sound a little insensitive??
