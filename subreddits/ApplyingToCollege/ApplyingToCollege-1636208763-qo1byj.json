I don\u2019t have numbers for dean\u2019s list/faculty children and obviously there\u2019s going to be some overlap, but that\u2019s about 20-30% of the overall student body, and given that white students at Harvard are disproportionately likely to be ALDC, the 43% figure isn\u2019t a stretch of plausibility.",

Harvard has more Division I NCAA sports teams than any other school in the country, mostly due to offering relatively niche sports that are often played by wealthy/white students (sailing, squash, etc.), meaning recruited athletes make up a pretty large portion of their class.\n\nBut yeah I absolutely agree with your overall point \u2014 for as much as Harvard and its ilk like to promote their efforts towards diversity (racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, etc.), elitism is still deeply embedded in these schools and admissions plays a large role in perpetuating that. I definitely hope they can do more to serve bright and capable students from less privileged backgrounds.",

The lawsuit, and the things in this article, really misconstrue how Ivy and Ivy peer admissions works.\n\nRace is considered as a tip rarely and only when a group is being underrepresented and when a student is already academically qualified and comparable to other students being admitted. The applicant still has to demonstrate academic capability. \n\nGeographic region is used the same way. You\u2019re more like to get admitted from Alaska for example than if your from Massachusetts, even if you have identical or better scores.\n\nI commented elsewhere that the authors of this study seem to think there\u2019s a formula because Harvard loosely ranks applicants among a small list of items. They use an inverse scoring system with 1 being the highest. So the lower the score the \u201chigher\u201d your score. And athletes get a 1 for athletics and extracurriculars. So if they get a 2 or 3 for academics that\u2019s an amazing application and yes will have a great to good shot at getting admitted. And many will have a two for academics. And most will also have other activities they participate in, and will have glowing recommendations. What the authors of this study are saying is that if you remove or lower an athlete\u2019s highest mark, the 1, they would no longer \u201cscore\u201d as well. But the same is for any application category, moreover, if you remove extracurriculars for other non athlete applications their chances of admissions fall as well. A student with a 1520 sat score isn\u2019t getting into Harvard if you remove their extracurriculars just as an athlete with a 1450 sat isn\u2019t getting into Harvard without their extracurriculars.\n\nI also have to say that the authors of this study have zero clue how the scoring they are talking about works. The authors have actual algorithms and formulas being used in the article. That\u2019s not how that works at all. Admissions officers literally sit there and say \u201cso, what do you think?\u201d They don\u2019t care about the difference between a 1470 sat and a 1530 thaaaat much. It\u2019s all about the recommendations the extracurriculars the interviews. Harvard literally rejects students with 1600 sat scores and 4.0 gpas because that\u2019s all some of those students submit. There are literally applications with just those two scores and nothing else. And those applicants don\u2019t get in. The authors of this article are making a litany of weird assumptions and also are just making stuff up about how all this works out of thin air.",

But, you do get some boost and I think that should change.  I know about 12 students that applied to schools such as Yale, Harvard, Penn, Cornell and Princeton in the past couple of years who had legacy.  Those that got in (except at Cornell) had academic qualifications that mostly exceeded the average at least for grades and SAT/ACT.",

It does matter, unfortunately, but at Ivies (with the exception of Cornell from what I have seen) only a small percentage of accepted legacy applicants would not fit squarely into the middle to top half of qualifications --- those applicants would have gotten in anyway (absent spikes to others for their ethnicity or race).  To say 75% of those legacy students are unqualified or less qualified is almost certainly false but I have to see the data (not going to subscribe to a publication to make a reddit point).  I also believe that white applicants (and now Asian-Americans) who are not first generation or  economically disadvantaged or not a recruited athlete, are the first subset of students to receive less than fair consideration on merit.  The super rich donor's child is not reflective of most white applicants.  Most white applicants are just like everyone else, lower, middle, or upper, middle class that have a hard time affording college.  It will also be interesting as to what we all think about legacy in 20 years when students of schools ---that now have 50% of their students identifying as person of color ---- are now parents of applicants.",

The lawsuit, and the things in this article, really misconstrue how Ivy and Ivy peer admissions works.\n\nRace is considered as a tip rarely and only when a group is being underrepresented and when a student is already academically qualified and comparable to other students being admitted. The applicant still has to demonstrate academic capability.\n\nGeographic region is used the same way. You\u2019re more like to get admitted from Alaska for example than if your from Massachusetts, even if you have identical or better scores.\n\nI commented elsewhere that the authors of this study seem to think there\u2019s a formula because Harvard loosely ranks applicants among a small list of items. They use an inverse scoring system with 1 being the highest. So the lower the score the \u201chigher\u201d your score. And athletes get a 1 for athletics and extracurriculars. So if they get a 2 or 3 for academics that\u2019s an amazing application and yes will have a great to good shot at getting admitted. And many will have a two for academics. And most will also have other activities they participate in, and will have glowing recommendations. What the authors of this study are saying is that if you remove or lower an athlete\u2019s highest mark, the 1, they would no longer \u201cscore\u201d as well. But the same is for any application category, moreover, if you remove extracurriculars for other non athlete applications their chances of admissions fall as well. A student with a 1520 sat score isn\u2019t getting into Harvard if you remove their extracurriculars just as an athlete with a 1450 sat isn\u2019t getting into Harvard without their extracurriculars.\n\nI also have to say that the authors of this study have zero clue how the scoring they are talking about works. The authors have actual algorithms and formulas being used in the article. That\u2019s not how that works at all. Admissions officers literally sit there and say \u201cso, what do you think?\u201d They don\u2019t care about the difference between a 1470 sat and a 1530 thaaaat much. It\u2019s all about the recommendations the extracurriculars the interviews. Harvard literally rejects students with 1600 sat scores and 4.0 gpas because that\u2019s all some of those students submit. There are literally applications with just those two scores and nothing else. And those applicants don\u2019t get in. The authors of this article are making a litany of weird assumptions and also are just making stuff up about how all this works out of thin air.",

About a quarter of the undergrads play varsity sports at Harvard, only about 10% of admits in a year are recruited athletes so we are talking about maybe 120 students and the vast majority of which are in the mainstream for gpa and sat scores. Every year about 60-70% of admits were high school athletes. And about the same number participate in athletics in some form a year while at Harvard. \n\nTaking a look at the academics of students admitted in a year show very very few outliers.\n\nhttps://features.thecrimson.com/2015/freshman-survey/makeup/",

I would assume that recruited athletes are vetted at least informally prior to being targeted for at least a minimum threshold of academic achievement, which I don't think the paper accounts for (correct me if I'm wrong, please).\n\nBut the results are pretty stark and frankly shocking. Example: \"A typical applicant with only a 1% chance of admission would see his admission likelihood increase to 98% if he were a recruited athlete.\"  Whoa.\n\nAnd your link (which actually is quite out of date) proves the opposite of what you were trying to show.  Harvard athletes have SAT scores that are on average 120 points lower than others in their class.  That's non-trivial. \n\nLook, I have tremendous respect for athletes and what they accomplish.  I'm not arguing that they shouldn't be given a boost.  But to argue that they are not boosted is  inconsistent with the data, brah.",

I mean we\u2019re talking about circa 10% off all the athletes at Harvard are \u201crecruited athletes\u201d none of them are guaranteed admission and there are plenty of would be athletes who are rejected. These applicants aren\u2019t like on a path to admissions, they\u2019re just people the coaching staff have told to apply. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t try to help an applicant by putting in a good word, they do, but they don\u2019t have a get automatically admitted to Harvard card to play. I mean what the coaches do is invite every possible athlete they can convince to apply and hope for the best.\n\nThe line you gave about a 1% chance becoming a 98% chance is really misleading. A student athlete with a 1400 sat who is a really good top National level athlete has a good chance at admission. But I mean look, take a student with 1520 sat and remove their extracurriculars and guess what? They conversely won\u2019t ever\u2026ever\u2026get admitted. They literally can go from a high chance to no chance.\n\nI guess my angle is the authors keeping assuming if you remove athletics it is different than if you were to remove other extracurriculars, when it\u2019s extracurriculars and interviews and recommendations that are essentially what actually get students admitted to Harvard.",

They  don\u2019t have the kind of first hand experience of admissions at Harvard to know what they are talking about. Hence they seem to think athletes have somehow gamed the system, it seems the authors haven\u2019t considered what makes many athlete\u2019s application a good application, or that an athletes 1400 sat scores is somehow out of the norm at Harvard when it really simply isn\u2019t.
