  "text": "Hey everyone, I am applying to UC\u2019s and I\u2019m interested in the field of CS/CE. Honestly, between Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Science & Engineering, I just want to choose the major that will increase my chances the most. For every school I have selected Data Science as my second major. Out of those three \u201ccomputer\u201d majors, which will increase my chances of getting in the most? Or is there not much difference?",

Personally I\u2019m selecting the one I like the most, computer science.",

Data science in many UCs is from Math/Statistics dept and is math intensive. Secondly, UC primarily consider your application for the primary major.",
