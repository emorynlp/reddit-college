      "text": "1. Congrats if you go to this one you too can go to a more prestigious schools than Green. With two added bonuses: 1. Professors so bad at teaching the school has become known for students doing so bad the minimum grade is capped at C. 2. When you go to South Carolina you can say I am a Browner and get put on a police list.\n\n2. It\u2019s a decent safety (safetyschool.org). With the added bonus of 85% of the students turning to the last three letters of its name because they ended up in Connecticut a state whose excitement comes from being a NYC suburb.\n\n3. Dart-mouth \ud83d\udc44 not a kissy lip but a mouth. It\u2019s a school who thinks it\u2019s on paar with Harv\u2019s yard or Y-ale \ud83c\udf7a just because it\u2019s in the same sports conference but in reality if you go there you will have to show them US News to get them to believe that it is a well known school. \n\n4. I personally like Northwestern but\u2026 no matter how prestigious the school majoring in Music or communications is just a waste of time and money. It has a world class business school without a business major.\n\n5. Ah, Bast-on University. The stupid kid\u2019s Harv\u2019s yard or MIT. The prestigious safety. A worse Notre Dame that is only interesting for the first word in its name. Where kids who could not get into Bastion college go.\n\nCongrats on being a semi-finalist I\u2019m sure you worked really hard. Just really? The only school that you\u2019re looking at outside of New England is Northwestern? Like 3/5 schools on your list are in states that exist because they hated Massachusetts and that\u2019s the region you want to go to?",
