  "text": "Greatly appreciate any colleges you guys think would be good for me. I already have a list but a couple more won\u2019t hurt. Also it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a reach, target, or safety\n\n**Stats:**\n\n-\tGpa: 3.86 UW, 4.02 W\n-\tACT: 33 (superscore)\n-\tActivities: not comfortable sharing online but pretty mediocre tbh, not terrible tho\n\n\n**What I\u2019m looking for**\n\n-\tstrong computer science program\n-\tdecent Spanish department and exchange opportunities\n-\tlots of LGBT students\n-\tsmall class sizes (least important out of all of these but would be nice)\n\nThanks again to anyone reading this and giving advice",
