  "text": "So, I just applied to UF and the applicant portal indicates that they have received all of my test scores, even though I only wanted them to receive 1 score\u2014my best score and superscore (since the other scores are significantly worse). However, when I took my earlier SATs, I took advantage of the free score send option on College Board and sent my scores before seeing them to some of my safety schools because I thought maybe one would make a superscore. I\u2019m assuming that UF got a hold of all my scores through the Florida University System since I sent the scores to USF and UCF. Will UF seeing my worse scores affect my chances significantly? I know colleges say they only look at the highest score\u2026but it still makes me feel like they will view these scores as worse than if they only saw the highest score. This also happened for UNC. I\u2019m really upset about this because I specifically sent UF only my highest score because I didn\u2019t want them to see any of my worse scores. Please be honest\u2026:)\n\nHere are my scores:\n1510: 760 M, 750 EBRW\n\n1410: 680 M, 730 EBRW\n\n1390: 700 M, 690 EBRW\n\n1380: 680 M, 700 EBRW",
