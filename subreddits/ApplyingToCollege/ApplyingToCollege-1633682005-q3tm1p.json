  "text": "ok this is my first post here\ud83d\ude0bso for one of my uc personal insight prompts i want to write about my disease which has impacted me IMMENSELY. i want to turn it into a positive thing cuz it has rly forced me to work 10x harder than my able bodied peers for basic academic achievements since i am constantly in the hospital. i know that writing abt injuries and stuff is cliche but i have a literal like rly debilitating disease and I\u2019ve still accomplished a lot of things in spite of that(yes i am gonna give credit to myself for that cuz shit is hard fr\ud83d\ude2d) so would it be weird to write abt that and the unique perspective it\u2019s given me\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28",

      "text": "Topics themselves don't necessarily make the essays clich\u00e9, but the structure and how you choose you describe your disease do. Start with a \"quirky\" line or have a wacky structure.\n\nAt the end of the day, just be yourself. No matter how clich\u00e9 that sounds, if you act like a superficial version of yourself you're basically not putting yourself out there, but a version of you that has been created for the sake of pleasing a college.",
