  "title:": "help me find a liberal and welcoming college",
  "text": "I'm a freshman at UNC Wilmington and I'm just not having fun here at all.\n\nThe school is way too white and conservative for me and I would really like some help finding a school better fit for me. The people here are not welcoming, there's not much to do other than going to the beach, and the school is so big and spread out that I feel isolated. Also, almost everyone here goes home every weekend to see their family and friends!\n\n I visited Belmont University to see a friend and loved the vibe there. Liberal, lots of LBGTQ+ students (I'm queer, so I would love this), and lots to do around the city of Nashville.\n\nDo you guys know any schools I can transfer to my sophomore year that fits those categories?",
