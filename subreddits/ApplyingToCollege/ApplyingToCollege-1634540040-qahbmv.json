  "text": "I know I'm super late but I still got no clue on what topic I should write about on my PIQs. All these example essays I've been reading have been either huge accomplishments like starting a pride week at their school or extracurriculars that they've been heavily involved in all their lives like being/leading a competative robotics team. I've never been committed to anything or have mastered in one thing. I have always tried learning one thing, then jumping to another interest and haven't really found a passion to talk about.",
