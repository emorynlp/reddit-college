  "text": " So I hadn't clicked any option on the FERPA RIGHTS section of common app. My counselor has submitted the LoRs and the transcripts, however, I haven't submitted my application to any college yet. Now, I can't untick this option: I do not waive my rights to review all recommendations and supporting documents. It says that the I can't edit my FERPA waiver because my counselor has already submitted the forms/ I have already submitted the application BUT I haven't submitted the application.\n\nWhat do I do? Am I at risk if I don't waive the FERPA? Can I not change my option anymore?",

      "text": "Unfortunately you cannot change your decision to waive or reserve your FERPA right, and some colleges consider it a bit sketchy to reserve your right cause to them it could mean that you were controlling what your recommender said about you and all. But you won\u2019t be set back all that much. It\u2019s completely fine. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\n\nWhat you could try is talk to your counselor about you taking them off your recommender list and putting them back on the list but with the right waived this time and just have them resubmit the LOR.",

      "text": "Before you click on the box, it clearly tells  you that can cannot undo it later. So, no, you can\u2019t change it.\n\nAre you saying it is checked and you never checked it? This seems unlikely.\n\nRecommenders and colleges depend on this waiver to provide honest feedback about an applicant and to trust that the information is honest and accurate. It should be clear why you can\u2019t indicate that this is waived, then change it after a recommendation is complete.\n\nIf you don\u2019t waive FERPA, many schools/teachers will only confirm that you were a student and the grade that you received. Schools likely would have reservations about believing the information in a recommendation where it was not waived.",
