  "text": " So I hadn't clicked any option on the FERPA RIGHTS section of common app. My counselor has submitted the LoRs and the transcripts, however, I haven't submitted my application to any college yet. Now, I can't untick this option: I do not waive my rights to review all recommendations and supporting documents. It says that the I can't edit my FERPA waiver because my counselor has already submitted the forms/ I have already submitted the application BUT I haven't submitted the application.\n\nWhat do I do? Am I at risk if I don't waive the FERPA? Can I not change my option anymore?",

      "text": "Unfortunately you cannot change your decision to waive or reserve your FERPA right, and some colleges consider it a bit sketchy to reserve your right cause to them it could mean that you were controlling what your recommender said about you and all. But you won\u2019t be set back all that much. It\u2019s completely fine. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\n\nWhat you could try is talk to your counselor about you taking them off your recommender list and putting them back on the list but with the right waived this time and just have them resubmit the LOR.",
