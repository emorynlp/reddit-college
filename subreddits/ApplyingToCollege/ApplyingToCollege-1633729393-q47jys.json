  "title:": "Potentially bad LORs?",
  "text": "So I have asked two teachers that I am pretty close with for LORs(my Precalc and ap calc teacher, and my Ap chem teacher.) the issue is that Im like the first kid that either of them has ever had that has signed the Ferpa agreement and is attempting to go for T20s. so they are kinda confused on why I cant read their letter. But my issue is that the chem teacher knows me pretty well and she wrote me a letter for NHS that I did read a while back and that letter was not the greatest. It explained me decent, it wasn't negative or anything, just kind of lack luster. So I worried that they aren't taking their time on it or something. One of them finished the college LOR in two days... Should I be worried or am i overthinking it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike these teachers were like a 7-8.5/ 10 on closeness and i would always talk to them and speak up when things would get awkward. Im just worried about their writing lol",
