  "text": "Yes, it sucks that seniors are getting their grad nights, admission days, proms, possible graduation, last senior performances, games, events cancelled. Sucks major ass.\n\nYes, it sucks that juniors are getting their SATS and competitions and AP tests cancelled or interferes with. \n\nYes, if sucks for the underclassmen who are gonna be missing out on valuable time to volunteer or participate in activities. \n\nYes, it sucks for college students who are possibly having their own senior events cancelled maybe even graduation. \n\nYes, it sucks for the adults who won\u2019t be able to work and will get behind on payments.\n\nYes, it sucks for the people who actually have the disease and their health is in jeapordy. \n\nSo can we stop saying \u201cokay but MY junior year is messed up so stop complaining\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll my senior events are cancelled so I have it worse\u201d. It all sucks. And if you want to vent about how much it sucks, go for it! This is an open space! But don\u2019t make this into a competition about who has it worse. This all sucks and sometimes we just need to vent. \n\nLife will go on and this pandemic will pass and we\u2019ll be okay. Let\u2019s not make this ugly guys. We\u2019re better than that.",

All I can say is that your generation is learning something profound about life that it took me many decades to figure out: we can't control much of anything in this world. Our plans aren't real. Every project and dream can be flipped upside-down in a heartbeat. Live in the now and try to steer your life in the direction you want to go, keep working hard, but with the knowledge that that there's only so much you can control and your health and safety is more precious than anything else.

Are you actually learning stuff that you want to/need to to get that job/major you want by being in class? Then keep paying attention and working hard to learn even more because you know that it'll be worth it. If you are just working to attend a specific college, you shouldn't be so preoccupied with whether or not you will get in because whatever college you go to will not matter if you don't maximize your resources there (and being prepared for that starts now and it started a while ago). \n\n\nAnyways, i just want you to not be so preoccupied with getting that A in a class where its not gonna help you in life.

Some of us are losing opportunities for the future. Some of us will get sick. Some of us may lose someone close to us, especially older parents or grandparents. Some families will struggle financially. And sure, not everyone has it as bad as everyone else. For some, this entire thing is little more than an inconvenience. \n\n Those juniors complaining about SAT being canceled could say that people upset over a cancelled basketball tournament have no reason to complain because it doesn't have any real impact. And I could tell them that they should shut up about the SAT because they'll still get the opportunity to take it, even if it's later than they originally planned. Meanwhile I've permanently lost at least one opportunity that I've been working so damn hard for over the past four years, and quite possibly also lost a second opportunity that I've also spent the past several years building up to it. And someone else could come along and give some reason why my complaints barely matter in the scheme of things compared to whatever shit they're going through. I mean, there are thousands of people who are already dead, and I have the nerve to complain about a stupid presentation I can no longer give. Talk about complaining about nothing, right?\n\n \n\nLike, I get it. I get how frustrating it is to lose something important to you and hear other people acting like they're experiencing the worst thing ever because they lost out on something you consider minor. But, while some people might need a reminder to keep things in perspective, they're allowed to be upset. Just like I'm allowed to be upset about my lost opportunities and you're allowed to be upset over whatever you're pissed about. \n\nYou don't get to gatekeep emotions and you don't get a gold medal for winning the misery olympics, so stop wasting your energy trying to police who has it worse.",

We planned to go this year and I was very excited. We planned to drive to D.C. to visit a school I applied too and see the national mall. Then school closed, I live in a county adjacent to LA and LA basically shut down, D.C. shut down, I\u2019m sure most restaurants and activities are shut down in PA. Even if they weren\u2019t closed, we\u2019re all supposed to be practicing social distancing anyways. Our flight is for this Sunday, but California may close state borders so if we do end up going we could potentially be stuck there for a few weeks and then my grandparents wouldn\u2019t be able to work and pay the rent. I was very excited to see my uncle and also have a lot of fun on the east coast. This is a rant but I just wanted to say I soon realized I\u2019m not the only one who had their plans soiled. Others also have to deal with the fact that they have to stay home and miss out on great opportunities. I really hope this doesn\u2019t get everyone down. We\u2019re all going through it together, as much as it sucks I hope we can find a little bit of comfort in that.",

I really think decision day should be postponed a month or so- at least until campuses are safe to visit. \n\nApparently some colleges are already accommodating and have set their deposit deadlines to June 1st, but more colleges should be getting on board.\n\nA friend of mine actually started a petition for this. I hate to sound annoying and like a walking advertisement, but this is the only way I can think of getting change for all of us. Plenty of things have been changing recently, and with some colleges already accommodating, it isn\u2019t entirely unlikely that this could work. But we have to voice our opinions collectively.\n\nIf you have time, please sign & share with as many people as you can. If everyone who saw this could sign and send to, let\u2019s say, 5 people, the results would be MASSIVE. I\u2019ll take all the support I can, and signatures can be anonymous. \n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/u-s-colleges-universities-postpone-college-decision-day-because-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/dashboard",
