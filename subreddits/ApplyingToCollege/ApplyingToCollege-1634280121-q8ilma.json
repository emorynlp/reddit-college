  "text": "I am a legacy to Stanford and I kinda feel bad.\n\nI\u2019m from the bay area in one of the top public high schools. In the past, Stanford has basically accepted all legacies from my school who had pretty good to very good stats, good ECs but nothing crazy, possibly good awards but nothing crazy.\n\nThey are usually close to the top of students, like maybe top 15-20%. \n\nIts not to say that they\u2019re bad, but the probably would not have gotten in without legacy.\n\nOther people who have even better stats ecs and awards usually get rejected.\n\nNow im sad that if I get in, i\u2019ll probably get called out for only getting in because of legacy.\n\nI have very good stats, strong ecs and decent awards but we all know a school like Stanford expects more than that. What should I respond? Because theyre probably right",

As someone very much not a legacy (foster kid, both parents didn't finish high school) I find it difficult to get that upset about it when the entire process isn't fair especially at particular individuals who play no role in the process.\n\nI'd recommend just getting over being called out, admit the system is often arbitrary and unfair, and instead try to push in your own small way to make the world a better and fairer place. It's not like if you turn down your Stanford spot it matters, it'll probably just end up going to some other legacy private school kid instead. You aren't robbing a spot from someone like me lol",
