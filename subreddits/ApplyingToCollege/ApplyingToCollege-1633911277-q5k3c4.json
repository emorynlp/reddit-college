  "text": "I applied/submitted applications to University of Utah (September), University of Kansas (September), and Michigan State University (today, 10/10/21) recently on Common App. Upon submission, I got  a notification saying to check my status on the university's respective websites to submit additional materials, etc. If I cannot create an account or when I do log in and all I see is to start applying via the university's website, how do I know of my admission/acceptance? I got acceptance mail and an acceptance email about a week after submitting the Kansas application, but I have yet to see/hear anything from Utah, so I am a little concerned.",
