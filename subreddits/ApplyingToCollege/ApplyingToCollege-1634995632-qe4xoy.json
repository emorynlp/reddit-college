  "text": "I wrote a draft like a week ago on the \"topic you lose time thinking about\" prompt a while back and hated it. So I was thinking of which other common app prompt to pick while I was outlining my individual uni question responses and it came to me.\n\nI have no idea if this will work out or if my (absolute hero of a) counselor will say it's a good idea but I'm about to write my heart out and hope for the best. Fingers crossed I don't need to pick a different prompt and start over again.",
