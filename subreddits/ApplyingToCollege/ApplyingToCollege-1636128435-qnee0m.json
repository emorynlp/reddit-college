  "text": "Before you come at me: I have read that it is stupid to submit the SAT if it is under the 25th percentile. \n\nAs I am an international student, my grade system might be hard to understand, especially because my grades might look only semi-nice (GPA: 3.53 UW) even though I am in my country's 99th percentile. \n\nI am just so unsure... Please help!",
