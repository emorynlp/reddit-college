  "title:": "I think I bombed my Stanford Interview",
  "text": "Guys I think I blew my Stanford interview :(. The interview was about an hour ago, and it went on for 35 minutes. Rather than it being a conversation, the interviewer only asked me questions, which she clearly prepped before hand. Not one question was based on contextual information i provided in the previous answers, it was just a salvo of checking the boxes. She also had constant background noise of  family members chitchatting. At one time interrupted me mid sentence, to go offline and return after 20 seconds of chatting with a family member. Granted, I think my answers were a bit uninteresting but now im really scared for my chances.",
