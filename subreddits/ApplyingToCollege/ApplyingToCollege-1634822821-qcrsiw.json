  "text": "Hello,\n\nBasically, I have been preparing / shaping my resume around architecture major, and I realized only several months ago that architecture is shit. I realized that architects spend more time talking about regulations and constructability of a building than actual designing. Also, they need to work like shit for more than 5 years just to earn as much as other professions earn within 1 year right after college. \n\nI initially decided to pursue architecture major because a job survey said that I might consider being an architect, but it apparently is shit. \n\nIn short, I have been following wrong path for years, and I have just realized that I need to follow different path.\n\nThe question is, how should I fill the column that asks for my intended major and write \"why this major\" essay?",
