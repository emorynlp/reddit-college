  "text": "If I'm applying to a school through common app that doesn't need an essay, can I go back and change it for future apps or do I have to submit them all at once?  So like if I have a draft, can I just copy paste it into the writing section since I need it there to submit the common app but don't need to submit the essay and then go back and edit it for other apps or is it a one time thing where that essay will be have to sent everywhere? Sorry for the second question in a day.",
