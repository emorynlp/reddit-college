      "text": "i didn\u2019t do ib, but i\u2019m here to tell you that top schools are hard. i\u2019m at mit and i get more sleep than most people and still do work for pretty much 14-16 hours a day, every day. to be fair, i\u2019m doing research and have four full classes, and am involved in clubs, but there is a lot. it is often hard to psets alone and exams are extremely stressful though so far i haven\u2019t done too badly (after a ton of cramming). it\u2019s extremely hard because of the volume and intensity of stuff and i can tell you this, but you won\u2019t actually grasp what it means unless you experience it. \n\nhowever, friends make it entirely bearable and enjoyable. i also realize mit isn\u2019t most top 20s, but seriously, there is a lot of rigor.\n\ni hope that helps.",
