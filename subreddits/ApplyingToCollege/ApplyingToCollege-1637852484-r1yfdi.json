It really depends on how long the essay is and how much time you want to put in to \u201cperfect\u201d it. Assuming an average word count of 250 words, it could take you anywhere from like 40 mins to 4 hours to do a given essay depending how hard it is for you to come up with ideas and how much you want to edit and make tweaks to the essays.",

The main essay you will be sending to all colleges will likely take the longest to complete - I wrote mine over 2 days after a week of brainstorming topics, but I spent another month getting it reviewed and edited by peers and teachers. The college-specific \u201cWhy XX?\u201d essays are easier and faster; once you\u2019ve written one or two, you usually end up with a rhythm / formula to keep the production line going.",
