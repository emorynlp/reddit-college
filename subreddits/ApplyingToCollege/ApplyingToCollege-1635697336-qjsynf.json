  "text": "Would it be okay if I addressed how I ran for my school's Model UN exec board this year but that my advisers were unable to sign us up for the November conference in time so they could not release the election results?\n\nAlso, would it be okay to add in that my school created its first chapter of the national english honor society that I was just accepted into? I ran out of space to add that in the activities section and since it was only created this year I did not add it in. \n\nI was also thinking about adding how I played tennis 9-10th grade because I did not add that in my activities section either due to a lack of space.\n\nI have heard people say you should avoid adding extra activities in the additional info section but I already submitted some of my EAs so now I'm debating on whether i should delete them for the other colleges. Should I keep what I wrote down or would it negatively impact me?",
