  "text": "I've decided that I'm going to write my own question for the common application essay because the story I want to tell doesn't exactly fit the prompts that they provide. Are there guidelines to what my essay should focus on or is there some recommended \"depth\" to the question that I might leave out when writing my own college essay prompt? \n\nTL;DR: What factors should I consider when writing my own college essay prompt for an essay?\n\nThank you.",
