  "text": "Ok so long story short, my guidance counselor told me I didn't need to request my teacher's letters of recommendation because they do it through Naviance. I mistakenly assumed this meant for all colleges. Only today while talking to a friend did I realize that my guidance counselor only meant I didn't have to through the common app. \n\nUnfortunately, I have been left in the position that I have an unfinished application that I sent to my dream school... \n\nWhat should I do?",

MIT can receive LOR through Naviance. \n\nWe prefer that students use our MIT application portal detailed in our Letters of Recommendation page; however, we also accept electronic documents submitted through Naviance, SOCIR, or other methods. Regardless of where documents are submitted, recommenders must fill out the MIT-specific recommendation form. On the form, recommenders can indicate if they would like to submit their additional documents (prepared letters, school profiles, transcripts, etc.) using a third-party service.",
