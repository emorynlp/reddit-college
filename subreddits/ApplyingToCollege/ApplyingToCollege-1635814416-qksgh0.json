  "text": " Hi so I am a current high school junior and when I was researching finance and accounting university programs, I noticed many strongly recommend having BAT4M (Grade 12 Accounting).\n\nHowever, my school doesn't offer Finance or Business courses at all. How important are these courses for university applications.\n\nFurthermore if I want to do virtual courses, how would I go about doing this.\n\nThanks, any advice is welcomed.",
