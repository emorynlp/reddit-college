  "text": "I'm trying to get into Ross but I don't know if I should apply for direct or admit. I think the differences are that with preferred you know if you get accepted into ross while still in high school but you only have 45 credits that carry over while with direct you apply to Ross at the end of freshman year at college but you get to carry over 60 credits over. Am I right or did I misinterpret the information wrong? also are there any other pieces of information that I'm missing?",
