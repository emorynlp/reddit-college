But I realized that I didn\u2019t have a genuine interest in going to these schools despite their good rankings and all. \n\nSure I applied to a few T20\u2019s but that\u2019s only because I would like to attend them if given the opportunity and if I can afford them. But it\u2019s not the end of the world if I don\u2019t get in. \n\nMy safety is giving me a full ride and it\u2019s a good university. Good and affordable education trumps prestige.",

But through my health issues I found out I want to be a nurse! So when I graduate this spring, i\u2019ll take a year to finish up some nursing prerequisites, and then apply for a one year accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing somewhere in SoCal.",
