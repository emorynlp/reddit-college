      "text": "The space side of aerospace isn't bad for jobs - it is concentrated in a few areas of the country. \n\nThe advantages of an aerospace degree over mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science might be marginal so I think it makes sense to consider other majors even if your goal is to do engineering for things in space or to get things to space. Fortunately, switching majors within engineering isn't too hard - at many schools you don't even set your major until after a first year engineering program (Purdue, Texas A&M, UW Seattle are good examples that work that way).\n\nFor some job stats, here are some numbers from Iowa State that cover their job placement based on major within engineering. I am using them as an example because they publish the data and I think they are a reasonable representation of a pretty good engineering school without any real location or prestige advantages.  I think Cal Poly SLO might publish similar info on their website if you want another set of data.\n\nhttps://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs/files/2020/12/2019-2020-@-Six-Months-Career-Outcomes-Report-BS-MS-PhD.pdf\n\nAerospace is about on par with mechanical engineering, materials science, and chemical engineering for outcomes. It doesn't have the same kind of earnings potential as software development, or the same kind of security as civil engineering - I don't think that should be a big surprise.",
