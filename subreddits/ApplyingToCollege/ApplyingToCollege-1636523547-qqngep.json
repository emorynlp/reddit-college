  "text": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/qqe1yv/misleading\\_students\\_parents\\_and\\_staff\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/qqe1yv/misleading_students_parents_and_staff_into/)\n\n>\u200bTo any prospective student, researchers, and anyone in general: Hyde Park is not safe, full stop. Especially if you aren't American and aren't used to the normalization of deadly gun crimes.  \n>  \n>To people still misleading others who don't know about the numerous horrific dangers in Hyde Park: Why do you keep doing this? Hyde Park is not safe. Misleading people around you into thinking that it is is unethical. Some people decide to come to UChicago underestimating the hazard and risk of doing so due to the understatement of the danger in Hyde Park. It's at least understandable why the University downplays the security issues, but regular students? People need to make informed decisions and misinformation is shady to the nth degree.  \n>  \n>How many deaths must we have before people stop parroting the lie that Hyde Park is safe?\n\n[24-Year-Old Male Shot and Killed at 54th Place and Ellis Avenue](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2021/11/9/24-year-old-male-shot-killed-54th-place-ellis-avenue/)\n\n>A recent graduate of the\u00a0University of Chicago was shot and killed at about 1:54 p.m. Tuesday afternoon at 956 East 54th Place.  \n>  \n>The victim, a 24-year-old Asian male, was struck in the chest, according to the police scanner [Rangecast](https://twitter.com/SPOTNEWSonIG/status/1458162345470013449?s=20).\u00a0  \n>  \n>The Chicago Police Department (CPD) confirmed that the victim was on  the sidewalk when the offender exited a dark-colored vehicle and  demanded property from him. The offender then shot the victim and fled  the scene in the vehicle.  \n>  \n>The victim was transported to the University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:13 p.m.  \n>  \n>The incident is different from the nearby shooting at East 53rd  Street and South Harper Avenue around 12:10 p.m., which was reported to  the University of Chicago Police Department and communicated to students  in an email. No casualties were reported in that incident.\u00a0\n\nUpdated: [Recent University of Chicago graduate killed in Hyde Park identified as international student](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-university-chicago-graduate-killed-hyde-park-20211110-jcqptf2mpjhszjjlblzygsocdq-story.html) ([Dennis Shaoxiong Zheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-zheng/))",

      "text": "Another comment: perhaps gives more insight into the area. \n\n>You're right, Hyde Park is not safe, but an even more egregious falsehood is the astroturfed talking point where they act as if campus is just in Hyde Park. Over half of the dorms, lots of off campus housing, and many academic buildings are in the even more dangerous Woodlawn, not Hyde Park. And of course orbiting Woodlawn and Hyde Park are far more terrifying neighborhoods. And the other lie is acting like downtown is just a peachy brief trip from campus. It's a legit 45 minute one-way trek on public transportation with walking, bus and/or el stops in and passing through war zones.\n\nTo prospective peeps, I am in no way saying that you shouldn't apply to UC Hicago because it's definitely not like I'm applying there as well and would like to increase my chances (/s), but this just shows that location is a very very important factor. College campuses are probably the safest places in any city aside from government buildings, but it's unlikely that you'll be cooped up on campus 24/7. The surrounding area is definitely something to consider. Also, for my fellow internationals, gun crime is a thing in the US. They are on the rare side if you look at the statistics, but it's still a thing. Don't be blinded by the potential opportunities, think and research very carefully.",

          "text": "Just so people know there\u2019s someone with multiple accounts who basically has been pushing three points and shows up whenever the topic of crime comes up:\n\n1) Hyde Park isn\u2019t safe\n2) Even if Hyde Park is safe, a lot of the campus is in Woodlawn which isn\u2019t\n3) Chicago isn\u2019t a peer to the ivies. \n\nThis last year has been horrific, and even though a year ago I would have said Hyde Park was a safe neighborhood, this year it\u2019s different. Whether this will get better as Covid subsides and the admin becomes serious about improving safety (which we\u2019ve received several emails about) is something we can only guess at. But there are several things this person consistently gets wrong:\n\n1) Woodlawn as a neighbourhood extends well beyond the part of it that university buildings are on and the patrol area of the UCPD - the crime stats you get for that neighborhood include areas that students are well aware they shouldn\u2019t go to, meanwhile the actual campus part (a tiny part of the overall neighborhood) reports very little crime.\n2) it\u2019s actually very easy to get downtown using metra or the 6 bus, which is an express bus skips over the \u2018dangerous\u2019 neighborhoods by taking a highway down the lake from Hyde park. During non-rush-hour times it takes about 20 minutes. \n\nTbh I think this person is just someone who got rejected. It\u2019s really random to shoehorn a convo about prestige into a dialog about campus safety, and it\u2019s really clear that the person just doesn\u2019t know the layout of the neighborhood/public transport.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m talking about the person who wrote the comment being quoted here, not U_of_Sol.",
