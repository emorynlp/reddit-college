  "title:": "Anybody else find Domonique Cynthia super annoying?",
  "text": "For anybody who doesn't know, she's a college youtuber who makes tons of college admission insight videos--mosty Ivy League, and goes to UPENN I believe. I just find her annoying because in her college decision reaction video she was literally bawling her eyes out when those rejections from ivies came in and was like distraught until she got into upenn. You could just tell this girl was TOO obsessed with going to an ivy and had an unhealthy want to get into one . She is literally now just promoting this fucken unhealthy obsession with ivies for high school students with her channel (LITERALLY EVERY VIDEO) and though the advice videos are helpful, it is still causing people to become TOO intent on going to these schools. Most of these students likely wont have the happy ending she had. Like damn can you not see how delusional you were back then and how unhealthy these channels are for the mindsets of students. It is okay to want to go to an ivy and to cry if you get rejected, but you should never revolve your whole life around getting into an ivy man. She also has the nerve to be like \"its okay guys, you dont HAVE to go to an ivyyyyy,\" like damn bruh doesnt seem like it from your OWN reaction video.",

Some college students do be thinking that just because they got into a good school, they had great essays (when there could be a ton of other factors influencing their acceptance) and are qualified to take money and edit people's essays.",

But that was 3 years ago. From the comments it seems to be a video about extracurricular. I skipped to a random part of aforementioned video and she was talking about how stressful it was to try and be the leader of many ECs, so she switched her approach to something she simply liked. \n\nIt seems like basic legitimate advice: don\u2019t stress yourself out trying to impress AOs and spend ur life doing what you like.",

It makes me sad that so many seniors believe that it's the Ivy League or nothing. I believe you should apply to schools that fit YOU, and it was clear from her video that she - like so many other teenagers in America - likely valued prestige and praise from others over actual fit. I'm not trying to direct judgement toward her specifically. I feel this way about any senior who applies to all the Ivy Leagues, despite the vast differences between them.\n\nI disagree with the statement that she promotes an unhealthy obsession with the Ivy League. She is not responsible for the obsessions of others (that have been going on for decades), and I'm assuming she has said that one does not have to go to an Ivy League to be successful. I think the 73 questions thing is cool and insightful. However, I do agree that it's a bit hypocritical for one to say that going to an Ivy does not matter when it is clear that that person did not appear to feel that way in high school.\n\nOverall, I just feel that she is no better or worse than any other YouTuber who makes the school the YouTuber attends the YouTuber's entire personality. I feel that we should stop promoting the crazy emotional college decision reaction videos, as those probably do more damage than a creative series on one girl's channel.",

They\u2019re literally just informational videos about prospective colleges (not just ivies) from the viewpoints of students who go there.. it\u2019s definitely not that serious, and the fact that the only people agreeing with you have never watched her videos says a lot. \n\nIt\u2019s like saying Med School insiders promotes the mindset that \u201cin order to be successful you have to be in the healthcare industry\u201d just because they make niche videos revolving around said field\u2026\n\nI feel like you\u2019re projecting your own subconscious feelings about ivies onto her videos. Because how you saw 1 + 1 and came up with 27 I don\u2019t understand.",

Ofc she doesn't cover just ivies but that is the MAJORITY of her content and if its not ivies, its other T20's. I am definitely not projecting bad feelings of ivies onto her videos because I myself want to go to an ivy. I just am not unhealthy obsessed with getting into one and my point is that the type of content she produces causes that type of mindset and how I kinda expected her to not produce that type of content since she herself was so negatively impacted by that mindset (in the end it was her choice tho). She produces stats videos, days in the life, the 73 questions ones, etc. and while I know all of her content is not bad there is definitely some things which promote unhealthy habits.",

Like, at all. She\u2019s just sharing different perspectives on different colleges, as told by people who go there.\n\nSo, If you watch a video where an Ivy student gives their opinions on various aspects of said Ivy and your main takeaway is that you have to go to an Ivy to be successful it\u2019s not the video that\u2019s the problem. \n\nAdditionally, I was speaking about those in the comments, which even so, are likely reflective of said upvotes.",

Most Ivys *reject \\~95%* of those who apply, while it's fine to be confident, it's also probably not good to expect to get into these schools. I definitely see this mindset at my own school, people acting like going to anything below a T20 means that their life is over, hell I saw people shit-talking Carnegie Mellon (and not for their lack of mental health support)! I'm applying to my share of super-selective schools, but tell myself that I just want to shoot my shot. I'm not hinging my existence on getting in, and I've balanced my list with less selective state schools / CC, which are honestly really solid institutions.",

However I want to defend her.\n\nShe is literally working a side job besides her college work and she is travelling to different places to get her videos done. This makes her have different viewpoints of various colleges and she shares it with all of us prospective students. Besides day in the lifes and overview, these interviews are MASSIVE gold nuggets to add on to consideration.\n\nHer editing skills is supreme and she knows how to properly make a video. That is something not many realize and really big props to her for that. She also asks the right questions - questions that are repeated however they all are asking for the college experience and debunking/reinforcing on myths or stereotypes of a school. She's articulate, intellectual, and knows how to really talk to a person.\n\nI understand why you see her creating this unhealthy obsession, however I believe she is going to keep creating videos covering other schools. She's a student, a human being, a fellow soul walking on Earth with her perfections and mistakes. I believe all she wants is to help make the distance of college and highschool a tid bit closer and more understandable. She has tons of videos covering HBCUs and other lesser known schools, they're all gold. \n\nIf you don't know who she is and don't want to be involved in college things outside of school, don't watch it. However if you don't know crap about the college you want to go to  - those videos are nuggets to consume.",
