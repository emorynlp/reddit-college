  "text": "Like actually how, how do you guys manage 30 ap classes a day and 3 different international businesses while still having a normal life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I only took 1 ap class (ap bio) so far and I already have horrific stress from it, to the point where I can't  even enjoy other things anymore. Work is piling up school in general and I have missing assignments stretching back to like, late August (disappointment I know \ud83d\ude0e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried sleeping and eating more, I tried sleeping and eating less, I tried time management (adhd says no :( ), taking mental health days (too many honestly), hell I even gave up a few ECs I was pretty passionate in cause I knew they were wasting my time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, is it weird to like something even if you hate it? What I mean by this is that, I really love math and science, but I'm horrible at it. I plan on majoring in astrophysics but I'm still in algebra 2 as a junior and I need teacher help most of the times to get through. But I love the ideas and concepts etc. Just wondering if I should keep going on math or give up and focus on something I'm good at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if I'm a failure or if you guys were part of a government superhuman project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUh... there was my rant. If you read all the way through you're a true homie, thank you.",

If you're passionate about something, it isn't a waste of time in general. Even with respect to college apps, if you're passionate about something, you will be more willing to try hard at it and pursue it more, and that will lead to good results which will help in a college app.",

They were actually the 2 hardest in my school, and gave more hw than the 5 APs my friends took combined. \n\nAdditionally, most people have international business listed, but look at what they actually do: I'm not discounting those who work rly hard, but my friend has a \"business\" that has 3 customers: grandparent, parent, aunt... She's made 5k and it's all from selling to family members. (And she only does this over the summer!!) A lot of crazy ECs are only \"crazy\" because people exaggerate them.\n\nOfc there's also superhumans who truly do the impossible, but they're few.",

Keep in mind everyone\u2019s different and u dont need to compare urself though - if you\u2019re working hard and trying your best that\u2019s all that matters. And for the math thing a lot of us stem kids go through this! Kinda thought stem wasn\u2019t for me when I started ap phy 2 last year lmfao there was a learning curve and i genuinely thought I shouldn\u2019t bother w stem for w while but if you want to do it go for it then you need more scientists anyway.
