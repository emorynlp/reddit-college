  "title:": "Poor kids have it worse. In response to middle class complaints on this sub.",
  "text": "It's a pretty common notion here that middle class kids get fucked over the worst with financial aid - because rich kids can afford to pay in full, and poor kids qualify for lots of aid. And I'm not going to refute that middle class people do get fucked over quite often. Middle class kids often don't qualify for the aid that they would benefit from, and that's not a good thing.\n\nThe notion that middle class kids have it *worse* than poor kids is incredibly insensitive and wrong, though.\n\nSomeone made a comment on one of the recent front page \"the middle class gets the shortest end of the stick :(\" posts with something to the effect of \"the poor will always have it worse\" and I want to echo that sentiment and make sure some of y'all get a little clarity on what being poor is actually like.\n\nSo sure, poor kids get a lot of financial aid. Might get all of their tuition, all of their room and board paid for. That doesn't account for all the other expenses, though. That doesn't account for food, for all of the living supplies like toiletries, cleaning supplies, new sheets because nobody owns a Twin XL at home. And while everyone has these expenses, they're a lot bigger of a burden on poor people, and y'all better not have the audacity to try and refute that. Simply living on a day to day basis can be a challenging expense for some folks.\n\nI'll use the disclaimer that I'm poor, so yeah, I'm going to be more sensitive to my fellow poor kids. I got over 3/4 of my tuition and housing paid for with need-based aid. But that's only the beginning of the expenses. I feel guilty buying the things that I need to live in college. Even buying things from the thrift store and the dollar store - I still feel horrible for the burden it is on my parents. Because that's what it's like. Buying sheets is a burden. Buying a hamper for my laundry. Paying for laundry. Paying for books. We already skimp on breakfast sometimes if we haven't gotten paid yet and don't have the spare fucking 2 dollars for a dozen eggs. I'm worried for how they'll fare this year after I've left, with monthly tuition bills on top of every other expense.\n\nBeing poor isn't some great circumstance that middle class kids should somehow envy. It fucking sucks. And while I understand that it's frustrating not to receive financial aid, I promise you that you are NOT getting the shortest end of the stick. It's really disheartening and disgusting to see people on here acting like being middle class is the worst thing that happened to them, and that somehow, they've got it worse off than poor people. **Being poor isn't worth all the financial aid in the world.**\n\nSorry if this comes off as mean, but I'm at my wits' end and I'm absolutely disgusted with the misunderstanding of poorness on this sub. Not everybody here acts like it, but I have seen far too many posts here complaining about how middle class kids have it the worst for college, and far too many of them are making it to the front page. I understand your frustration. But not one of you would want to live a day in a poor kid's shoes. It's insensitive to erase those struggles and act as though your lack of financial aid is a bigger problem than things like, I don't know, poverty.\n\nInb4 \"struggle is not a competition\" I know it isn't. But there are people on this sub acting like it is and that they've got it the worst, when there are so many other struggles in this community.",

      "text": "Every time I try to explain what being poor at university is like, I use examples from some of my undergraduate friends.\n\n1. A guy I did intro chemistry with. He lived at home and caught the bus in each day, but the buses are unreliable at best in the poorer areas so he ended up missing quite a few classes and failed. It rained a lot where we lived, and he couldn't afford to buy new shoes when the soles of his wore through, so he just wrapped them in duct tape and wore that for the rest of the year. Paying $100 for a pair of jeans or new shoes was an unimaginable cost. \n\n2. Another guy, two years younger. He couldn't afford any of his lab gear. Couldn't afford textbooks either, and wasn't able to find versions that were cheap enough or even an illegal PDF. He *cried* when I gave him my books and safety glasses. \n\nThese are people who have literally 0.50c to their name, if not -0.50c. Sometimes you do the absolute best you can with the cards you were dealt and it's still a steaming pile of shit, and it isn't your fault.",

          "text": "In my experience attending a very poor high school, college admission was really hard on poor people.  Most of them don't have resources or time to devote to achieving top academics, studying for SATs, building a portfolio of activities, or other things that make students attractive to colleges.  So many of them had no idea how to apply to college and had no idea that fee waivers and need-based aid exist.  I was lower-middle class myself and I thought FAFSA = student loans.  \n\nThe data bear this out - only 10% of low income students land in the top quartile of standardized test scores, and of those, just 41% complete a bachelors degree within 10 years.  [There are 38 top colleges that have more students from the top 1% of the income distribution than from the entire bottom 60%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html).  That was last updated in 2017 and the trend has only been getting worse.\n\nFinally, not every college has generous financial aid.  Only 104 of the ~4600 degree granting institutions in the US guarantee that your need will be met and these are all predictably selective.  So if you're poor, you have to be aware of the resources available, perform at an outstanding level, attend a college with generous aid, and then defy the odds and graduate.",

You can't join a club, you can't lead a club, you can't start a club. Most people who attend the school actually live quite far away and will travel 30-60 minutes one way on a bus, without any family members who can pick them up, so almost all after-school activities are also not possible. \n\nThere was no one to tell us how to apply to universities, or when any of the deadlines were. Absolutely zero teachers mentioned university applications. Our parents didn't mention them. Our friends didn't mention them. And even places like this sub are worthless if students don't know they exist. By the time you do find these boards, you're in your senior year, you have no clubs, maybe one sport that you never won a game in, no competitions, no real ECs aside from working in a fast-food store. It's too late, and you're fucked.",

You\u2019d prob end up being better off than a middle class person who will be trying to pay off debt and be undergoing many expenses. In the end, both of you guys will get good jobs except the originally middle class person will be behind in terms of wealth because they had to continue paying their debt.

                  "text": "You are missing the point entirely. It\u2019s incredibly difficult for low-income students to get into one of those schools if they don\u2019t have the resources to do so in the first place. And even once they are in, they have to deal with costs of textbooks, clothes, transportation, etc. Many have to work jobs to stay afloat in college, which decreases the amount of time they can study to get a good gpa, or do extracurriculars or research that can help on your resume or a grad school application. They can\u2019t take internships that offer great experience if they\u2019re unpaid. And they don\u2019t have networking connections that can actually help you land jobs. Being a poor college student will put you at a disadvantage when it\u2019s time to go out into the workforce or higher education.\n\nAlso not every college has great financial aid that will cover all costs for poor students. Many do take out loans and have less means to pay them off than middle class students.",

                  "text": "So do you believe in predestination too? I was taught by calvinists in religious schools and, let me tell you, this is the kind of excuses they use for not teaching *certain types* of people.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to assert that you have to be intelligent to get educated. How about you can be more intelligent when you\u2019re educated?\n\nWhen a kid is hungry when she takes a test it\u2019s natural that she will underperform compared to non hungry peers. Look at it like that not that the rich have some natural intelligent ability. \n\nAnd this is not an opportunity to argue scientific definitions of intelligence and other semantics. It\u2019s just absolutely ridiculous to assert that predetermined intelligence should dictate whether or not you have access to education.\n\nI get what you\u2019re saying\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s right or wrong it\u2019s just a trend we should expect. Yeah in this shitty timeline. But it\u2019s not because wealthy people are genetically smart, it\u2019s because the education system in the US is for the elite and can be a ticket to a slightly better social class for poorer people if they are willing to pay up. \n\nIt\u2019s designed for it to be easier for wealthy people. Read some of the other comments here\u2014that\u2019s a fact. \n\nShouldn\u2019t those oh so intellectual benevolent wealthy people have had the smarts to change the education system to make it easier for the chosen few intelligent poor folks? The fact that that has not happened shows that people want universities and education to be for the elite. Not to mention that even the dumbest rich kid will certainly go to college because that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of them. It\u2019s not expected of most poor kids no matter how smart they are.\n\nEdit-\nPS kids don\u2019t get into college based entirely on their intellectual merit. I get that you think that because you\u2019re a kid and you work really hard. You need to think that to get through this stressful time and get your reward for your hard work.  You seriously deserve that reward. But, you\u2019ll be a 100% better person if you think a bit about the lurking variables in these statistics and what social circumstances are leading to this so called intellectual disparity. \nI went to high school with kids in complete abject poverty. This girl I went to school with was beaten brutally as a kid and had extreme social problems. She had a kid by her own uncle when she was 14 years old after suffering years of abuse. Her father was a university professor in another country who was executed.  She started to improve greatly and is doing ok these days but never went to university\u2014this has nothing to do with her intelligence. This is obviously extreme but just a slice of what social circumstances can dictate for a kid vs their natural intelligence.",

On the same note, not everyone has a library close to them (I don't have them within a 15 mile radius of me),  and not everyone has a car that they can use to drive the distance to go to a place with internet access.

My situation is far from the worst, but I'm just using it as an example because apparently, you don't believe that people struggle and live paycheck to paycheck(or not even, in most cases). It's not rare at all, literally, so many people don't go to college because they have to get jobs to help their families. I consider myself blessed that recent developments have allowed for my family to begin having enough to support themselves in the past few months without the contribution that I cannot provide while away.\n\n\n>What kind of city are you in that doesn\u2019t have a public library close by you?\n\n\ud83e\udd37 I don't know why.\n\n\n>If $50 is the difference between survival and death for you and you are a kid in high school, your parents are extremely selfish for birthing you (unless you went through some terribly tragedy that sucked all your money up and left your parents unemployed), but that is so rare).\n\nRent rises. People get laid off. Medical expenses occur. There's so many reasons that aren't rare at all for why people live paycheck to paycheck if even. I don't know why you think it's rare?

That\u2019s incorrect. 40 million Americans struggle to have enough food to feed themselves, and 5.8 million U.S. households suffer from severe food insecurity, which means they\u2019re more often than not hungry. Of course, you aren\u2019t completely wrong. The CDC doesn\u2019t track deaths by starvation, so we can safely assume it\u2019s not too common. But the idea that it\u2019s okay to be starving as long as you aren\u2019t dead (which is exactly what you\u2019re implying) is, how you say, fucking stupid. I sort of get the vibe that you grew up upper middle class, and don\u2019t even see poor people as people. And do you know what I could do with $50? I could feed myself for a week. It would be one meal a day, and it wouldn\u2019t be good, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be healthy, but I\u2019ve done it, and will do it, because after a lifetime of only allowing myself one meal a day because that\u2019s what I can afford, nothing is going to change that ingrained behavior. But like, I\u2019m not going to give you a lesson on the psychological effects of growing up poor and starving. You clearly have the Internet. Fucking Google it. \n\nAlso, you seem to be under the impression that having the internet is the same as a college education. If I go to a public library, yea, I can use a computer and read books and I could become fucking Einstein. But we don\u2019t live in a world where having the intelligence or skill is enough. An employer isn\u2019t going to hire someone as an historian just because he read every history book available at the library. They want a college degree. They want a vocational certificate. They want PROOF that you know the stuff, and they aren\u2019t going to go through the trouble of testing you when having a degree does that for them.\n\nSomething else that you said that doesn\u2019t bother me, but does make me feel extreme pity for you and your pea sized brain, is that your response to \u201cit\u2019s hard to justify going to community college instead of helping support your family\u201d was \u201cso? It\u2019s not my fault those kids can\u2019t talk about their future with their parents.\u201d\n\n1. No one is saying it\u2019s your fault? The argument is: some kids can\u2019t afford school, and those that get aid still struggle more than middle class kids. It benefits you in NO WAY to argue with this fact. NO ONE is asking you to support those kids. NO ONE is asking you to take responsibility for them. You have gone out of your way to comment on this thread and to argue with people about the oh-so controversial fact that financial aid doesn\u2019t magically make a poor person\u2019s life better. \n\n2. When you are in that situation, where going to school would be a significant financial burden on your family, it\u2019s a hard decision to make. Sometimes your family wants you to go to school anyway. Sometimes they beg you not to so they can still afford to get by. It is gut wrenching to be a parent and to know that you have hurt your child in that way. It is gut wrenching to be a child and to have to choose between getting by or getting an education. Ideally, an education will help you get a good job, help better help your family. But it\u2019s a gamble. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to afford it, and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll end up dropping out after a year to help out with medical bills or because the cost got to be too much. And then what? All of those loans were for nothing. It\u2019s not about talking to your parents, because talking about it won\u2019t change the choice that has to be made.\n\n3. How I read your response was, \u201cso? It\u2019s not MY PROBLEM that they\u2019re poor.\u201d And you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s not your business. You\u2019re just some well off kid who spends his time on reddit making troll comments. So my real question for you is, what do you benefit out of being such a dumbass? How does INSISTING that poor people deserve to be poor get you what you want? Is it a classic case of \u201cprivileged person wants so bad to be the underdog that he ignores facts\u201d or do you just like stirring people up with your EDGY takes?\n\nLike, don\u2019t worry, I know it may seem like I\u2019m worked up, but really I\u2019ve been laughing for the past hour at your comments. Come on. Give me your takes. Let\u2019s see if you can out source me, and prove ONCE AND FOR ALL that POOR PEOPLE are the luckiest of them all. \n\nSources: https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=84972\nhttps://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/new-data",

We know for fact that intelligence is largely genetic, and we also know for fact that there is a strong link between social class and intelligence in the US and UK (you can read more about that here if you\u2019re interested). \n\nThis idea of intelligence as genetic is something I don't have the time to fully contest right now, but I want you to consider the assumptions you're making about how colleges find worthy admits. Assuming that you're right about intelligence, for your assertion to be true the SAT and ACT would have to be measures of fluid intelligence (Gf). The rub there, of course, is that these tests aren't. The SAT has famously dropped any presumption of aptitude from its abbreviation and has changed substantially from any time its results could be accurately equated to an IQ score (which isn't a particularly accurate measurement of Gf either); and, if you don't trust the College Board, the SAT, and ACT to a lesser extent, are no longer viable qualifiers for the majority of high-intelligence societies, including Mensa. \n\nI'd also like to respond to some of the stuff you've said in other comments: \n\n>Are you kidding? Do you think intelligence spontaneously and randomly generates in someone\u2019s brain after conception? Intelligence is certainly genetic; education is what is not genetic. \n\nAgain, not going to contest the idea of genetic intelligence right now, but have you thought about how the level of education one has influences how well they score on measures of intelligence? Parts of the SAT and ACT are literally basic grammar, proper use of which is certainly not a measure of Gf. If someone hasn't read many books, hasn't taken any halfway-decent English classes, and goes home to a community where they predominantly speak another language or an untested dialect of English, how does missing those points somehow imply they're less intelligent? \n\n>And how exactly am I spreading race propaganda when I did not even mention race? What the hell? You\u2019re the one who strangely just brought that up.\n\nPart of me thinks you're being intentionally obtuse, but I'll go with it. Frankly, the linking to an article about The Bell Curve, a commonly-cited book in race realist circles; the implication that being less intelligent is not only a cause of poverty but also genetic; and the fact that some races are statistically more likely to be poor is what led /u/HecarimMainsUnite to make their comment. \n\n>America is more or less a meritocracy due to its capitalistic nature.\n>America is a capitalist society which allows it to be more or less a meritocracy. That\u2019s why the result that more money equals more intelligence generally holds true and makes sense.\n\nIt would take too long to respond to this thoroughly. Unfortunately I don't remember where I read this (so take it with a grain of salt ig), but just know that the best indicator of your ultimate status in life in the US is not intelligence, but what class you were born into.",

                          "text": ">Take a deep breath and rationally analyze what you are saying. Your responses are full of pure emotion with little to no sources or logical reasoning to back up your outlandish claims.\n\nAlright. **Deep breath.** I've done that. I'm prepared to respond now. \n\n>Here\u2019s a great study that demonstrates the EXTREMELY strong correlation between ACT score and IQ. See page 4 to view the graph that really shows you. On a basic level, this result makes sense. Think of it on a personal level: Of the people you know, do the smarter ones generally score higher on the ACT? I know that\u2019s definitely true in my case with very few exceptions, and that study supports my anecdotal experiences.\n\nA few things here: this source, like the one from before, operates on some old data. The ACT has changed substantially since 1975, the year when the data points in this study sat the exam, and, even if it hadn't, the test-taking strategies of students are wildly different now. In the past twenty or so years, the percent of students scoring a 36 has increased dramatically (see [this graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/ACT-36-1997_to_2011.png), sourced from [this data set](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173540/http://www.act.org/newsroom/data/)), while the test itself has changed very little. Since we seem fond of using anecdotal evidence here, I have anecdotally understood that this is the result of extensive test prep, whether that be done individually or with a company, which is a privilege disproportionately afforded to the wealthy. As for me: I don't know anyone who took the ACT in 1975, so I don't know how to answer your question; sorry. \n\n>Again, bringing race into this is absurd. I made no mention of race, yet you and others seem to be dragging that into this. All I\u2019m saying (which is supported by the linked study) is that lower socioeconomic status, regardless of race, directly correlates to a lower IQ on average.\n\nOk. I'm only responding to this so you know I'm not ignoring any of your points. I also would like you remind you of: \n\n>Your responses are full of pure emotion with little to no sources or logical reasoning to back up your outlandish claims.\n\nWhen I had responded with the evidence about The Bell Curve and the implications of your argument, I was only telling you why it was that /u/HecarimMainsUnite was (rather kindly, I think) telling you that your argument hinted at race realist dogwhistles. I'm not bringing race into this argument, but, please, keep propping up purely emotional, sans-logic strawmen. \n\n>This has no contradiction with my claim. If I\u2019m saying that higher classes are already more intelligent on average, then it would be expected that those who are born into those higher classes are very likely to remain in a higher class. Your claim also has no source by the way, which is troubling. Especially because you are wrong. \u201cModerator analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the relationship.\u201d So intelligence is the best predictor, it is just not overwhelmingly the best predictor. Couple this with the fact that higher IQ generally equals higher socioeconomic status and you get that my analysis is very well-reasoned and grounded in evidence.\n\nI hope it wasn't too much of a leap to go from (paraphrasing here) \"America is, as a result of its capitalist framework, mostly a meritocracy,\" \"Poor people are more likely to be less intelligent,\" and \"Intelligence is genetic,\" to my thought that you believed that wealth in America is a result of intelligence. The point I was trying to make with my comment is that, whether or not intelligence is genetic, to claim that wealth, and especially generational wealth, is a result of Gf is shortsighted. The article also references what I was talking about in my last post: \n\n>Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor\n(Bowles & Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles & Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important\naspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles & Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996).\n\nIt's likely I was thinking of either Bowles and Nelson's study or Fischer's. In any case, I can concede that this study seems to be better analyzed than those two and that intelligence is at least as good a predictor of income as parental income and SES are. That being said, I'd like to push back on this study in particular as evidence for the point about the U.S.'s \"meritocratic\" nature. Some of the data in the meta-analysis comes from the '40s and not all of it is American. As a result, I don't think it says very much about the current state of the U.S. \n\nStill on the article, I found the correlation presented by it between income and parental income strikingly low, so I went ahead and looked for articles specifically dedicated to analyzing this link in the U.S. For example, [this paper from the notably conservative Booth School of Economics at UChicago, which claims a .37 parent-child income correlation](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/final_resub_jpe_dec2002.pdf), or [this 2010 OECD report, which contends that American parent-child income correlation *r* is actually closer to .45.](http://www.oecd.org/centrodemexico/medios/44582910.pdf)\n\n>I think you\u2019ve been thoroughly debunked here. You can either choose to accept it and hopefully change your viewpoint or you can continue to live in denial. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll probably choose the latter option as people tend to become more strongly rooted in their beliefs when they are met with countering evidence.\n\nlol I sincerely hope you get the irony here because it's hilarious from my point of view",

                  "text": "I'm sorry if this is somehow offensive to you, but your basic premises are entirely unfounded. First, to stipulate that intelligence is largely predetermined by your genetic makeup based on the fact that there are observable differences in demonstrated intelligence is straight-up wrong. There is no causal link between those two statements. That is the crucial point of misinformation in the article you cite.\n\nThe article notes: \"Unless we are willing to assume that we are all born with exactly the same intellectual capacity (in which case any of us could have written the plays of Shakespeare or discovered the theory of relativity), we have to accept that innate differences of intelligence exist, and that such differences will tend to be passed on from parents to their children.\" Making this statement is akin to dismissing entirely the effect the environment a child is raised in has on their demonstrated intelligence.\n\nYou say that \"if college admissions were purely based on academic merit alone (not ECs or athletics or wealth), the bottom 50% money-wise of America would still be way underrepresented because the top 50% naturally outperform them in academic fields.\" I'm not going to dispute this. But you assume that this is caused by some deficiency of the student in question, instead of a deficiency in the system they are subject to and part of. Yes, research has shown that children of poorer parents tend to perform worse than those of richer parents even before grade school. But richer families read to their children close to five times more often than those in the bottom quintile of the income bracket do. Those in the top quarter tend to have close to ten times more books in their homes than those in the bottom quarter. Rich babies receive, on average, a greater level of positive reinforcement in response to achievement. These seemingly subtle environmental changes have drastic impacts on a child's perceived ability.\n\nNow, I'll not insult you by saying there is no correlation whatsoever between intelligence and certain genetic markers. But most of the scientific field agree that genetic predisposition accounts for only 30% of an individual's behaviors. If we agree that success is the product of a series of undertaken actions, we can then assume that only 30% of the success an individual in the middle class has enjoyed can be attributed to their born ability, and, in turn, assume that only 30% of the failure an impoverished individual faces stems from their genes.\n\nNot even a close minority for either individual. So what, then, do we attribute the remaining 70% to? Let's start before the baby is even born. Factors such as quality of prenatal care, exposure to toxins, and stress have a strong influence on the developing child (Jenses 2009). Those from disadvantaged backgrounds have long experienced lessened access to quality healthcare and nutrition. We move on, then, to a child's socialization, both with caregivers and others. This is when the pressure to fit in or risk social rejection kicks in. Jensen 2009 (and the vast majority of other sources agree with him):\n\n\"Socioeconomic status forms a huge part of this equation. Children raised in poverty rarely choose to behave differently, but they are faced daily with overwhelming challenges that affluent children never have to confront, and their brains have adapted to suboptimal conditions in ways that undermine good school performance.\"\n\nEkman in 2003 notes that because the brains of those under three are limitedly capable of experiencing emotion, these children need \"A strong, reliable primary caregiver who provides consistent and unconditional love, guidance, and support; safe, predictable, stable environments; ten to 20 hours each week of harmonious, reciprocal interactions (this process, known as *attunement*, is most crucial during the first 6\u201324 months of infants' lives and helps them develop a wider range of healthy emotions, including gratitude, forgiveness, and empathy); and enrichment through personalized, increasingly complex activities.\" This is something children born into poverty are often not provided. The report continues that \"children raised in poverty are much less likely to have these crucial needs met than their more affluent peers\" Deficits in these areas inhibit the production of new brain cells, alter the path of maturation, and rework the healthy neural circuitry in children's brains, thereby undermining emotional and social development and predisposing them to emotional dysfunction (Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, & Van Ryzin, 2009; Miller, Seifer, Stroud, Sheinkopf, & Dickstein, 2006).\n\nThat's the first issue: predisposition due to a lack of early-life emotional maturation. The second is the stupidly diverse number of chronic stressors children in poor households experience. Stressors include living in overcrowded, substandard housing or unsafe neighborhoods; enduring community or domestic violence, separation or divorce, or the loss of family members; and experiencing financial strain, forced mobility, or material deprivation (Evans & English, 2002). It's really quite simple -- stress is a biological response. Cells can either grow or deteriorate. When faced with acute, chronic stressors, biological mechanisms kick in that essentially force an individual's biology into a mode that conserves energy and learning capacity for what these cells perceive as a threatened future. And before you say it, this isn't something you can overcome by \"realizing you aren't in immediate danger.\" It's an involuntary biological response.\n\nBut wait -- there's more. \"Compared with a healthy neuron, a stressed neuron generates a weaker signal, handles less blood flow, processes less oxygen, and extends fewer connective branches to nearby cells. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, crucial for learning, cognition, and working memory, are the areas of the brain most affected by *cortisol*, the so-called \"stress hormone.\u201d Experiments have demonstrated that exposure to chronic or acute stress actually shrinks neurons in the brain's frontal lobes\u2014an area that includes the prefrontal cortex and is responsible for such functions as making judgments, planning, and regulating impulsivity (Cook & Wellman, 2004)\u2014and can modify and impair the hippocampus in ways that reduce learning capacity (Vythilingam et al., 2002).\"\n\nThe result? Diminished room for growth because of a child's surrounding environment, *not* their genetic predisposition. Poor students get worse teachers, worse facilities, fewer real growth opportunities, etc.\n\nAs for your misguided notion that there are apparently *so few* people that live from paycheck to paycheck, and are therefore unable to pursue higher education, here are a few widely accepted statistics:\n\n31 percent of American families have trouble paying their electricity bills. So no, people don't all have access to online education. Half or more community college students struggle to afford food. Low income students can't afford 95% percent of colleges, and have trouble finding the ones they can afford because, again, they are subject to a shitty educational system without many resources.\n\nYou're also conveniently forgetting about the time investment dedicating oneself to an education costs. That in particular is something many kids from poor households can't afford. Hell, I'm from a middle-class family and I struggle to dedicate myself entirely to a competitive education because I'm responsible for caring for two ill parents. While that seems like an extenuating circumstance, it isn't -- not for many families under the poverty line, who don't have access to decent healthcare. If you want a number, that's 8.8 percent of the US's population -- 28.5 million people who can't afford basic medication or treatment.\n\nIf any of you actually managed to read until the end, thanks for sticking around. I get that this response isn't particularly organized. I could go on for ages, but I have better things to do than write a twenty-page paper that tries to educate a grossly misinformed, close-minded Redditor. In these many words, at least I tried.\n\nAnd hey, AP-Account -- thanks for being mostly civil in your responses. I may disagree with you and think you aren't taking into account the vast body of empirical evidence and meta-analysis that sits against you, but I respect that.",

          "text": "That was kinda me although not that extreme.\n\nI used to take 8am classes so that I could work 30 odd hours in the week. My thinking was I could do that with my lower level classes but I wouldn\u2019t be able to in my upper division classes. That way I could have some savings later on.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t only that the classes necessitated me to be up at like 5:30 and I was at a higher risk of being late. It was also that my alma mater is one stereotypically for wealthy kids and the vast majority of underclassmen live on campus. As such, the classes we\u2019re not built for people like myself who needed to work and could not live on campus. Furthermore, many underclassmen professors had really punitive policies designed to teach these wealthy 18 yr olds to be responsible. I was older but didn\u2019t look it. The policy that hurt the most was when an English teacher belittled my preparedness when I didn\u2019t have the expensive anthology she requires for the course (on DAY ONE) and completely shut me down when I started to ask about alternatives. I needed SO MUCH more support than I had, and not just monetarily.\n\nI did graduate with a good and useful degree but I\u2019m not the wild success story I wanted to be. I\u2019ve been working my ass off since I was 15 yrs old to survive and, although it\u2019s better now, my mom has a mental illness that makes it hard for me to be close to her which has been a major strain on my adulthood. I found a wonderful partner who makes a good wage and, honestly, I\u2019ve just been letting myself not panic and struggle since graduating two years ago. I am working meh paying jobs that I enjoy and relying on my partner a lot. He\u2019s ok with this and so am I for now.\n\nThe prospect of joining another office where I am different and need to struggle to exist there isn\u2019t for me. I know other people say the pay check makes it worth it but I have such severe anxiety now from living such an unstable life for so long I don\u2019t think any amount of money is worth it. I need to rest and heal my chronically stressed self.\n\nI\u2019m happy now! Poor for now but happy.",

      "text": "Finally, someone said it! I totally understand that middle-class kids have less access to financial aid compared to us lower-income households. I also recognize that having a lot of siblings or having cheap parents or dealing with family crises have to be factored in, too.  But idk, in my own experience coming from a family who's always been poor and knowing others with the same peasant-ass status, it's more likely for poor kids to deal with financial burdens constantly. There's no ups and downs, really. It's just always stagnant and really low.( please don't @ me idk if this is making any sense at all)\n\nAlso to add on to your point of how being poor affects literally every decision to do with college, the same thing applied to high school shit. When your family is struggling to not get kicked out and you're trying to juggle 3 jobs at once, finding interesting hobbies, funds for school ecs, and enrichment opportunities just aren't on your radar. You can't just pull yourself up by the bootstraps when you don't have the means to.\n\nEdit: ALSO FORGOT, don't know if this just me but poor kids tend to be first-generation. idk not knowing what the fuck i was doing while everyone else did scared me so much (and continues to!). on the bright side, i guess this leads to more perseverance and initiative.",

Yeah, it sucks your parents can't help pay for your college as much as you want them to, but at least your parents have jobs that pay more than minimum wage. At least you haven't had to budget with your parents to see if they could afford to let you go on a school trip in the hopes of getting an award that'll help you out further down the road. \n\nSure, I get all my application and testing fees waived, but the humiliation I feel when I have to ask my school counselor, who makes more money than my parents could think of, for waivers, is more than I can bare sometimes.",

Whether you move back home to pay rent or send money for bills, unless you have a toxic parent it's likely that you (and others in your position) will do what you can to take care of her.  Especially if you still have siblings at home.\n\nThat's something middle class kids generally don't have to worry about, at least not to that degree.",

This sounds so fucking judgemental - I'm sorry.\n\nMy mom was the sole bread winner in our family. I really can't count how many times she's fretted about not having enough to pay for food or the house despite making 70-90K as we grew up. Even now, she just started making 90K and we have a broken sink she can't afford to fix. 75K is a middle class salary but we still had to pay a gross 20K per year at UPitt (before she lost her job and I just couldn't go at all.)\n\nSoo even with a middle class salary, people can still struggle, maybe not as much as a household with less income, but I'm tired of yall pushing like you have the worst situation so only you have the right to feel sorry for yourself and anyone who isn't your definition of poor and is still complaining about their situation has no right? Fuck off with that.\n\nEveryone's situation is different. You're about to go to college most likely. You better learn that really quick or you are going to seem really judgmental and not well liked in college and beyond, even if people are \"nice\" and don't say anything. \n\nSorry but this thread really urks me.",

It may seem like poor kids can afford college more because of schools that meet full financial need, but the fact is, there aren\u2019t a lot of schools that do that. And the ones that do are very competitive. If a poor kid can\u2019t get into one of those schools, which is more likely, then they will struggle to pay for college more than a middle class kid would.",

They often are also responsible for helping out with housework and child care of siblings.\n\nIt's hard to concentrate to study when your heat has been turned off in the winter and you can see your breath inside.  It's hard to get work done when you don't have power and may or may not be able to afford candles.  It's hard to focus during class when you're exhausted from working late. It can be hard to get to school on time if you are having to use public transportation or walk in potentially bad weather.  Tardiness affects your grades, too.\n\nDisclaimer, I did not grow up poor.  I did know people who were close to it, especially as I got older, to get an idea of what that could be like.  As an adult, events beyond our control have drastically reduced out earning potential.  Things are tight.  We are still not in these straights, but I can see how it could happen, and I can guess how the difficulties of poverty complicate everything. It's not just \"being poor\".  It's about have few to no options, and then others who are better off tell you to work harder.\n\nEmpathy goes a long way.",

For them to grow up and qualified to be in the same school as another kid with adequate resources is hard. Yet some middle classes don't see that. They envy the figures poor kids received, but did not see the resources they had growing up. Financial aid help make the situation equal, for middle classes to complain is ridiculous.

Also, his whole platform is that the rich are evil and selfish when he himself is a millionaire; he just wants more power.  Yang is a proven businessman with charisma and a genuine belief in his ability to revolutionize the country's economic system to help people and subsequently increase output; he's spent his funds and time on philanthropy before he ever thought about politics, so his desire to establish equity (giving people what they need to survive, NOT equality) is sincere.  He also calmly and reasonably explains how his ideas could function without being expensive and tripling taxes, instead of the Ocasio-Cortez method of saying that \"we'll spend less on funerals so we can totally make up for the 30 trillion dollar deficit.\"",

          "text": "I would clarify this a bit.  \n\nI wouldn't call these \"subsidies.\"  This is part of the calculation of the cost of attendance, so any college which meets full need would include aid to cover this kind of expense.  Food and books and personal items like shampoo are all part of the total cost of attendance.  So this doesn't come as part of some \"extra\" cash on top of the aid package; it's part of the entire aid package.  Therefore, every college should include this in their calculation of need for aid.  Whether or not that provides cash to students to meet these expenses will depend on aid policies.  It would surprise me that this is the case as \"many\" colleges.\n\nIf a college doesn't provide full aid, any aid they provide is going to be applied to tuition first, and the \"gap\" (where students have to use their own additional resources) is what will cover the living expenses and books and such.  \n\nIf the aid package includes loans, then a student might be trying to take the minimum loan as possible and therefore end up with very little money for these kinds of living expenses.\n\nAlso, some lower-income students may end up contributing to their family by sending money home or buying things that siblings need, further cutting into their ability to meet their needs.  \n\nLower-income students may find that lack of transportation, long job hours, or other factors limit their ability to shop frugally, so their expenses may come in higher than the budgeted estimate.\n\nSo **even at colleges where student aid budgets yield available cash to buy food and books, lower-income students can struggle!**  This is really important to understand.",

My family is definitely middle class, because my dad works 60+ hours every week at a factory job he's had for 35 years, and so we technically make in the range of 100k a year. But my parents had a business they started fail in the crash of 2012... that left us over half a million in debt. So for the past decade we've been penny-pinching. My mom started couponing, and got multiple side jobs; when I was 15, I got my first job and have now been working part time pretty consistently, for over 3 years. \n\n\nWe haven't been to the point of struggling to put food on the table in a while. But for the longest time I've been aware that I have no college fund from them, and they will have little to no extra money to help me with. And that's a huge factor why I chose to start working as early as I could reasonably, and am going to a community college for my first 2 years while continuing to work part or possibly even upping to full time. Sknce my household income is so high on paper, but our net budget after bills, debt payments etc. is so low, I felt crushed by both sets of expenses when looking at the numbers. I'm not saying my situation is worse than one of someone who genuinely does have no money and no/heavily underpaying source of income though. I see friends trying to survive on even 15$ an hour for skilled job pay and it's... terrifying and heartbreaking, and I am thankful for everything I do have and the opportunities and luck I have had in my life. Just wanted to point out that a high middle class income doesn't directly equate to being able to handle normal expenses outside of tuition, sometimes it can mean not being able to handle either\n\nI apologise for rambling on your post. I do that a lot on Reddit. \nI hope you can find a way to get your needs met, and that everything goes well for you throughout your journey. \u2665\ufe0f May your life be fulfilling, and all your dreams come true except for one, so you always have something to strive for.",

      "text": "I mean the fact that I\u2019ve seen many middle class kids here say that they\u2019ve got it worse than poor kids because they can\u2019t go to Harvard or Stanford or Duke because they didn\u2019t get enough aid is already a huge showcase of their privilege. For poor kids these schools usually aren\u2019t even an option. I know I didn\u2019t even think about them, even when I actually had the stats for some early on in HS. \n\nI have poor friends who literally could not even afford community college which was only about 2k a year unless it was subsidized or they got grants to pay for it, but even then they struggle with the overall living cost of it because at CC they still have to struggle with living life without money at home. I have 3 friends who have been working at fast food/gas stations for the past 3 years post HS graduation because they cannot even afford transportation to our community college which is 30 min away. So they\u2019re literally saving for years just for transportation to go to CC. \n\nMyself personally, I\u2019m lower middle class and my parents did great with financial planning but I\u2019ve never even considered going out of state or going to any college where my scholarships or dual enrollment wouldn\u2019t go with me. \n\nHonestly, a lot of middle class kids here are angry at themselves and their parents for not thinking ahead, which is an understandable way to feel, but it in no way makes their lives comparable to kids who are actually poor. I knew that being lower middle class I needed to work around that bc I didn\u2019t get a lot of aid so I took free dual enrollment classes and saved 1 free year\u2019s worth of college and only looked at schools where my aid would transfer and that would be in state. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me how so many middle class kids here casually flex these out of state schools with tuition being 60k+ as being their \u201conly\u201d options and then compare themselves to poor people. I\u2019m going to have a hard time believing anyone who claims that they\u2019re poor but acts like CC doesn\u2019t even exist as an option in their world. \n\nLike, many poor people cannot even afford transportation to get to these out of state schools in the first place. \n\nAt the end of the day college is a personal responsibility imo, not something that your parents must help you with (though I think they should), and if a middle class kid did not take advantage of work, dual enrollment, scholarship application, etc opportunities they should not think that they are comparable to a poor child when they\u2019ll still likely be able to go to CC without a worry in the world about their next meal or buying a few books. Really ridiculous to me how many \u201cmy parents make 120k+ a year but I\u2019m not gonna be able to afford duke I\u2019m so poor ugh\u201d comments I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s just insulting to the poor kids who have only had CC as an option their entire lives. \n\nAnd for a reference if it helps im now attending Clemson and my tuition is fully covered by scholarships/aid except for a few thousand each semester which I and my parents can cover fine for 3 years bc I planned ahead & saved & can graduate early due to that. Had I not planned ahead I would suck it up and attend CC. \n\n(So I agree op)",

It's just that 99% of kids from those classes have literally never experienced hardship that wasn't just basic school stress and so the first time their parent's wealth actually works against them in any way they freak out and decry discrimination and write essays ranting about how life is unfair. \n\nConversely, when being wealthy works in their favor (i.e. their entire lives) they don't notice the benefits it brings.\n\nI attend a pretty good school and there have been many times I was legitimately *shocked* at the caliber of my classmates, I have had class with honest to god geniuses and I've also had classes with people where I couldn't understand how they even graduated high school (I have a couple funny stories). All those dumbass kids in my classes came from private schools that send a lot of people to my school every year, while the kids from legitimately poor backgrounds tend to fall into that genius category more often than not.",

      "text": "I think there is a pretty significant point you're missing here. I can certainly see the frustration and would never trade my middle class upbringing for more tuition, but a big source of the frustration for middle class students comes from the elitist nature of the sub. Many people in this sub want to go to top schools, almost all of which are private. Fixed costs such as food and supplies like you mentioned arent much of an issue for the middle class compared to what you mentioned. However, these costs dont change based on what school you go to (most of the time). The cost of attending school drastically changes between state and private colleges. The middle class students on the sub feel like they cant attend those private schools because the tuition gap is so large. Im looking at well over 100,000$ in loans to attend just about any private school in the country. It makes it just about useless to apply to any top schools since the cost is looking like a 30-40k difference per year. \n\nAgain, not trying to make this a struggle olympics and certainly wouldn't wish I had a worse upbringing just for more college money, but the frustration comes from the discrepancy between private and public cost for the middle class, at least for me.",

No savings, no college fund, no place to go. He took everything he had paid for in the past, even my cell phone. I went to college on baseball scholarship so all was well, I had a job and paid for food and got a new phone and cashed on my friends floors after practice. Then I got hurt and lost my scholarship. I spent 6 months delivering pizzas and couch surfing. My dad again said figure it out. He refused to co-sign loans, he refused to give me money or let me back home. He makes roughly 300k$ a year. He\u2019s my best friend, he thought what he was doing was a right of passage. I was forced to join the national guard to pay for my schooling. I worked a full time job my entire way through school for a degree I don\u2019t even use, and I still had to pay all taxes and fees for school out of pocket. All my clothes, all my food, my car, everything. That was thousands of dollars. Where was my financial aid? They didn\u2019t care what I made, they cared what my father made. That part of the system needs to be fixed or at least they need to teach high schoolers how to use their resources because I was clueless and lost.",

Possible train of thought:\n\n \n\n\"My parents worked hard and sacrificed a lot to give us a secure life.  They always spent money responsibly and worked to get promoted instead of fired; they went to community college and had no advantages but that doesn't matter.  Now, after 20 years of work and careful saving, they're expected to pay out half of their total income? and that guy a few blocks over with parents who chose to be lazy, chose to be a drag at work, chose to skip college to party, chose to try out some drugs, chose to do anything besides pursue the means for a more financially secure future for their children, now they're expected to be pay nothing?  My parents don't deserve to have to pay for someone else's kid, they earned what they have and the other people didn't.  And even more pressing, I can't go to that selective college because my parents can't afford it even after busting their tails, but that guy a few blocks down gets to go there for free even though his parents didn't work hard.\"\n\nOr something like that.  The poor student did nothing to earn the financial aid.  The poor parents did nothing to earn the financial aid.  But the parents who did grind their way to a secure life, they're basically penalized for being financially stable.  Because look at it this way, the poor people aren't just \"not having to pay,\" someone else's tuition dollars are paying the poor parents $70k per year even though the poor parents didn't work hard and make the right sacrifices.  From the eyes of the middle class, poor people are rewarded just for being poor, while the middle class worked hard and made sacrifices are for nothing because they lost $200k.  These aren't my views, I'm just explaining that some people's perspective isn't that paying sucks, it's that poor parents did nothing to deserve the $70k they are basically being paid by the middle class, and the middle class have their opportunity to attend a top college ripped away from them but the poor kid goes for free.",

Harvard is not a charity, and it shouldn't be. Top institutions should teach people who are ready to do world class things. It doesn't matter that Sally from 20k household does way more than people would expect if she still can't do as much as Sarah from 200k that runs her own clothing company and does research at a prestigious lab.\n\nTop private institutions aren't a right or an expected privilege. They aren't supposed to be some lifeline for poorer kids. I don't mean that with any malice, I'm just saying they aren't.\n\nYou say compare people apples to apples, but you are implying to fulfill an income bracket quota. That's stupid. Why should I not be able to get in while I am in all-state bands, win a few big awards, 5 all my ap exams, do research, etc. just so someone from the inner city who easily gets A's among unintelligent peers and does a single club can get in because \"Harvard needs more poor kids\"?\"\n\nHere's another:\n\n\"Very stupid. First off, a lot of people say College Board's standardized tests can only quantify intelligence to a degree. But a FUCKING ADVERSITY SCORE? Ok so wow I wish I went to my local public high school where it is much easier to succeed and more fun instead of working to get into a magnet or private on scholarship, since my public school gives me better chances since there was more \"adversity\" in being in classes taught at an elementary school maturity level. And now there is the fact that my parents made good decisions all their lives for their children, just so someone else can claim a university spot because their parents blew their money on stupid things and live in a smaller house. And they won't even let students see how their life experiences are being boiled down to just a number, because they know that nobody wants this. ACT all the way.\"\n\nor this:\n\n\"The wealthy and middle class should have an \"advantage\" in admission, depending on how you define the term. If by advantage you mean they are automatically considered greater, then that is false because \"adversity\" is a de facto bonus to the application while \"privilege\" is frowned upon (AO's say it themselves that they are trying to get more socioeconomically diverse classes). If by advantage you mean that more wealthier people are admitted, then yes of course they are, because they have the highest chance of bringing back money and fame to the university and had more opportunities that could already sharpen them into the top candidates for elite universities if they chose to capitalize on them. Why would good universities be mostly/more comprised of people who come from financial lows (there is nothing undignified with not having money, but financial background is the easiest predictor of skill level at almost anything so it makes sense that higher ed has more wealthy people)?\"\n\nthis one was good:\n\n\"hat doesn't make sense. You think that being rich automatically gives you opportunities and makes you intelligent? You think that being slightly above average all of a sudden means you are \"advantaged\"? Why should someone else substantially achieve less than me (in the ways that are measurable) and still be seen as a more qualified candidate? I'm not saying not to consider background, I'm just saying that they are trying to put objective numbers on things that aren't just a simple \"oh his life was 'harder' and he MUST have worked harder.\" Furthermore, what does it mean to be in a \"good\" school system when it is less fun and puts you at a disadvantage for higher education (what your career options are based upon)? If it is advantageous to take the easy way out, more people will take the easy way out. That degrades lower education. I'm not talking about people who are seriously impoverished, but the middle class. This gives advantage to middle class people who chose easier schools (easier schools as in less academic rigor which is correlated with the adversity factors strongly) relative to their peers who went for challenges or more difficult schools. Going to a magnet school is generally harder than the local high school, but often doesn't change what opportunities are available while the adversity factors are diminished. So by going to the better school, you are more \"privileged\" despite doing more and learning more and earning it.\"\n\nand this one:\n\n\"You are literally arguing my point. What is the incentive for anyone from the middle class to go to a place with more opportunities and hard work when those places are viewed less favorably (no \"adversity\") than going to a school facing \"hardship\" where they can coast in comparison to the other students? This system provides reward for going to worse schools (because you face more \"adversity\" even though everything is easier SCHOOLWISE).\n\nAnd you also aren't reading what I'm saying. I'm not talking about people from poverty and unstable situations gaining an advantage, but the middle class people who are intrinsically smart but would rather coast always choosing the easy path and then being rewarded for it.\"\n\nThe guy was right.  You really do think that people choose to be poor.",

The bootstrap method simply isn\u2019t possible.\n\nI grew up POOR. I was a fantastic student, President of my NHS, did speech and debate, etc. I still needed to take out over 100k in private loans to attend a STATE school. I\u2019ve worked since I was 15 and worked HARD. I had a full time job and a part time job during undergrad, and a full time job during my Master\u2019s as well. I have worked fucking HARD. And guess what! Because I needed loans to get a good education because I was poor, I might as well have not gone to college and just worked at a hardware store. I take home about the same amount of money.\n\nSo, no. Just because your parents work hard doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they earned being middle class, and it CERTAINLY doesn\u2019t mean that poor people didn\u2019t/don\u2019t work hard and decide to be poor. I worked and continue to work hard, like many poor people, and yet nothing truly has changed financially. Except now I don\u2019t qualify for any government assistance because I \u201cmake plenty of money.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: not all poor kids get financial aid, and I\u2019d say 90% can\u2019t even earn them due to circumstances preventing them from being good students, and even when you\u2019re a good student and poor, you almost never get enough financial aid to afford college anyhow. Socioeconomic status is inherited and nearly impossible to break out of. Stop blaming poor people for not having money, and stop claiming people with more money, in any way, have it easier.",

      "text": "The writer John Scalzi wrote in his blog about what it's like to grow up being poor, [https://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/03/being-poor/](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/03/being-poor/)  and it really hits you in the feels. Growing up poor myself, I really connected with what he said. Reading it again, it makes me angry. Angry at the privileged elite and the rationalization that if you are poor because you must have done something wrong to make you this way.  Most of the privileged people I know just don't have a clue how much more difficult it is to be in financial straits, with the thing they understand the least being that those less fortunate typically have less time, skills, and resources to devote to improving their lives because all their energy is spent just trying to keep their heads above the water.\n\nMy wife worked at a homeless day shelter before we had kids, and she mentioned something to me that really illuminates just how unfair things can be if you are poor, and how untouchable you can be if you are rich.  She said,\n\n\"Everybody is human, and everybody make mistakes, whether you're rich or poor.  It's just that the rich have so many more chances to make the same mistakes, and sometimes bigger and nastier mistakes, often with no consequences.  If you are poor and you make a mistake, you are done, as in you're homeless, or you're in jail, or you're out of a job.  And the rich make these same mistakes, and because they are rich they have that safety net that so many of us simply do not have.  And what's truly maddening is they are oblivious to this advantage, or use this advantage to further their own ends,often to the detriment of others, and think that the rest of us deserve the consequences of our mistakes moreso than them. It's part of the all-too-common rationalization that the poor in our society just don't work hard enough or are decent enough to deserve a better life\".\n\nTo put the above statement in context, we were having a discussion about an incident that happened in a rich north side suburb in our city.  Four 18-19 Y.O. upperclassman basketball players hazed several freshman teammates multiple times, but most notably on a bus to one of their games.  They held several freshman down and penetrated them anally with their fingers.  All 4 got brought up on charges- mind you in most circumstances  they would have been charged  with rape or sexual battery. Nope!  One kid was apparently really stinking rich (i think their dad was a lawyer), got the charges reduced to a misdemeanor, and every one of them only got probation and community service.  understandably tons of people were up in arms over this.\n\n[http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/news/features/article\\_19ef025c-b994-59b2-9bdd-b566b06932ed.html](http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/news/features/article_19ef025c-b994-59b2-9bdd-b566b06932ed.html)",

The only way I was able to move far away and live on campus was because every free second of time in high school was dedicated to working so I could pay my own phone and car payments. Plus cover the costs of my extra curriculars like soccer and national honors society. My participation in those and good grades won me a lot of scholarships to accompany the aid I get. You\u2019d think working so hard in high school would make you set for college, but nope, I had 3 more years I needed to win money to cover. So I joined clubs and worked in college. Still paying my own rent, utilities, insurance, phone, food, clothes, etc. I had no time to have fun in college. I had to plan out every single move. \u201cWhat else can I do to stand out on scholarship applications?\u201d My plate was so full, I feel burnt out and I haven\u2019t even graduated yet. \n\nThe saddest part is that while everyone else gets to go home over the summer and chill out while they live off their parents and wake up to breakfast, I had to work harder. I was gone for 9 months out of the year, bedrooms in my moms house are in high demand so she gave my little sister my room. That was pretty much my unofficial \u201cyou\u2019re on your own.\u201d I don\u2019t get financial aid in the summer ya know so I had to work so so much to keep paying my rent. I know it has made me a better person, but you have no idea how much I miss waking up in a chaotic house to eggs in the morning and sitting at dinner talking with everyone rather than being in an empty apartment eating cereal for dinner",

I mean, the occasional benefit like getting more financial aid doesn\u2019t outweigh being unable to afford to eat or buy clothes regularly, or to have any nice things or fun experiences that cost money. People in the middle class take a lot of small things for granted, I know that I see myself doing so quite often and I know what it\u2019s like to be poor so someone who has never been truly poor probably doesn\u2019t really understand fully what it\u2019s like. I mean, even the smallest little things like buying a candy bar at the corner store is impossible when you\u2019re poor, forget about actually having disposable income for leisure. Poor kids have to go without so many things, including outright necessities, while middle class kids simply don\u2019t have as much money as they\u2019d like. Obviously it\u2019s hard on everyone that isn\u2019t financially comfortable, middle class and poor kids both have it rough in this country, but it\u2019s crazy to think that it\u2019s overall more beneficial to be poor due to things like easier access to financial aid because that doesn\u2019t begin to justify being poor tour whole life. I just wanted to throw in my two cents and say I agree with OP, being poor sucks.\nReally though, we should be making it possible for every single person who is competent enough to get a college degree to do so. It\u2019s better for the country as a whole if more people are educated. The fact is, I\u2019d rather see my tax dollars go toward educating our citizens than to see it go toward police having freaking light tanks and other military grade weapons and tools. Hell, I\u2019d rather it go to education than like 99% of what it usually does go to. It\u2019s sad to think how many people that are capable of being doctors or engineers end up having to drop out of high school to start working because they can\u2019t afford school. Even people who could be eligible for financial aid, if their families don\u2019t know how to go about applying for it and they are from crappy schools that don\u2019t take the time to teach kids how to access it, they never get to go simply because they don\u2019t know how to get financial aid. It\u2019s really sad, as I\u2019d rather love in a country where everyone who is competent enough to go to college get to do so without it putting them into debt for decades.",

Poor kids tend to get less attention and less time to talk with their parents from when they are young, which has huge negative effects on their reading, writing, and verbal abilities. Food insecurity means that kids sometimes go to school hungry, and when you go to school hungry, you can't focus. lower middle class kids can afford to pay for community college out of pocket to a certain extent. poor kids usually have to put money towards their needs. everything adds up when you're poor.",

We were somewhat well off when I was in preschool. But my dad (the primary supporter) became blind and my mom was an art major. I was really lucky that I was able to get a piano scholarship from my piano teacher when I was 6, whose husband was a Columbia math professor and tutored me. She made sure I always had food and clothes while I was younger while my parents did odd jobs here and there to support me and my 3 siblings. My piano teacher and her husband were amazing people who gave me resources for school I would\u2019ve never been able to have. But they did move away when I entered middle school. \n\nI was lucky to have awesome parents who always tried to take us to the park or to the library since we didn\u2019t have a television. They always tried their best to make sure we knew we were loved, even skipping meals so we ate well. In return, my siblings and I tried our best in school. But because I struggled the least in school, I used the extra time to work so my little sister can grow up without stressing about asking my parents for $5 for fees for her clubs and stuff.",

I guess if you think you have to go to Cornell or something, maybe, but that's just a very elitist and privileged mindset in the first place. If you're a top student from either the middle class or the impoverished class, there are more than enough universities that would be willing to fund your education and throw scholarships at you. \n\nWhich... Given all the disadvantages that poor people face in daily life against the middle class and above, I don't really feel is a bad thing at all. This really is a non-issue as well since it affects such a small percent of the population; the vast majority of poor people are not enjoying such benefits.",

If they can afford it. The idea of paying a decent percentage of tuition to someone in the lower class is a fucking joke. For us, it just sucks. Maybe some loans.\n\nAnd I know that not being able to go to your ideal college sucks but at the very least, if you\u2019re middle class, you can get a scholarship to a solid school, then be fine. The books, toiletries, etc. hardly matter because they\u2019re nothing compared to that huge sticker price.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019re poor, first generation. You work your frickin butt off in grade school to get an amazing scholarship to a competitive high school. Then you\u2019re lost. It\u2019s a completely new environment. Everyone seems to know what they\u2019re doing but you. You struggle freshman year but eventually get the hangout of it. You push yourself everyday to get good grades while dealing with challenges people aren\u2019t even aware of. You didn\u2019t have a family wedding during that school field trip; you couldn\u2019t afford the $80 like most people paid without even thinking.\n\nBut you keep pushing and get a great scholarship to a solid school. Now it\u2019s high school all over again but worse. Now all these things that are little to most people NEED to be paid. You can\u2019t go without toiletries, sheets, etc. But sometimes you have to.\n\nIt\u2019s just so different. I\u2019m not saying people in the middle class don\u2019t have reason to complain. Not saying that at all. But I don\u2019t think you can say the struggles are the same burden.",

You suggested that lower income kids do not suffer from student debt, but that those that do (middle-upper class) may end up in worse situations. You stated that \u201ceveryone else\u201d is fucked over by student debt. All of that is heavily flawed, and if that isn\u2019t what you meant, that IS how you phrased it. \n\nEdit: You\u2019re a rising junior. I know you hate when people bring this up\u2014 I hated it too\u2014but you\u2019re young. Don\u2019t start acting like you\u2019ve got the whole country\u2019s situation figured out yourself. You\u2019ll have plenty of time when you\u2019re older to feel that way. I don\u2019t even feel that way, and I\u2019m 5 years older than you. \n\nYour instant downvotes on my comments are showing that you aren\u2019t even kind of open to my opinion, and that really sucks to see.",
