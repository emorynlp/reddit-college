  "text": "I am a matric student from South Africa and I am applying to the US for fall 2022. I need some advice with regards to a few things in terms of my application and I literally have no one to ask for advice. Can someone who has been through the process of applying be willing to assist me personally? i would really appreciate the effort as I have no outside assistance and cannot afford a paid agency.  \n\n\nHere is my profile if anyone is interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/ph59xq/chances\\_of\\_me\\_getting\\_accepted\\_with\\_financial\\_aid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/ph59xq/chances_of_me_getting_accepted_with_financial_aid/)",
