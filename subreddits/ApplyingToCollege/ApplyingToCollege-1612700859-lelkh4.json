  "title:": "Ya'll remember the time a school got a bunch of minority kids into Ivy leauge colleges, and were exposed by the New York Times?",
  "text": "If you don't know the story already, I'm talking about the school T.M. Landry. It was a school that was predominantly black but also had students of other races. The school claimed to have a 100% college acceptance rate, saying that they could get any kid into college. They uploaded videos of black and minority students getting in to Harvard, Stanford, Columbia and more. These videos went viral and two students form this school went on Ellen to talk about their acceptance here's the link: Watch \"Ellen Meets Viral College Acceptance Brothers\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/VA__sb8ZFh8 \n\nBut ofcourse all that glitters isn't gold, The New York Times got a tip and began to investigate the school, here's the link: \n Watch \"How Viral Videos Masked a Louisiana Prep School\u2019s Problems | NYT News\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/LRewodHw-8E. \n\nApparently the founders of the school Mike and Tracy had no formal teaching degrees or expirences. They made kids lie on their essays taking advantage of them being minorities and exaggerating their lives with things like coming from a Crack home or their fathers being alcoholics and not being in their lives. They would fake transcript because they never really learned anything, the only thing they did do was make kids take the ACT. This is partly the reasons why kids could get into these top schools, they took the ACT like crazy. \n\nThere were even claims of verbal abuse and even some physical altercations. Anyway what I'm trying to say is that the school was a sham taking advantage of minority children and kids futures. They're still in business unfortunately, ofcourse their kids aren't getting into harvard and yale anymore but they are still in business. \n\nHere is a link to a student who went to this sham I mean school and talks about their expirence first hand. It is really interesting to see everything people were speculating so here it is:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1r4j3McXGaLuwMN-0A1pYwiKRhJt55ZlAebq76Pf9ggA/edit?usp=drivesdk",

I don't  know if it's the schools laziness or if this just gives top schools more of a reason to advertise that \"look our school is so hard to get into people have to cheat and lie their way in lol\". But I really hope the kids finish their education but I know some had to drop out because they just couldn't handle the rigor of the schools form their poor teachings at T.M. Landry,  the ones who stayed in college were students who didn't attend TM Landry for long probably only junior and senior year.",

So yes in a way the kids who weren\u2019t currently under investigation graduated or have since graduated got Away with it.

They don\u2019t learn very much actual schooling; they practice how to take standardized tests, they practice how to do interviews, they write their college applications essays, and they rehearse weeks in advance when a news network wants to do a story on them. \n\nIf someone with credentials wants to, they can back you up on anything. So, each of these kids has wild resumes that are all fake. But when a college calls, the husband and wife answer and of course support the lies they made. The students practice how to act like they\u2019re the person on the resume.\n\nIt\u2019s all really fuckdd",
