  "text": "The deadline for the University of Washington says that it is 11/15. The website ([https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/)) says that it is due on November 15th but the countdown clearly doesn't count down until then. Can someone clarify what is going on here? If the deadline is in fact 11/15, what time during the day would that be?\n\nCan Coalition App not be down. Thanks :)\n\nEdit: As I posted this, the website countdown changed to the correct time I believe.",
