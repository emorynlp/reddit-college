  "text": "Hello!\n\nI recently got my two transfer decisions back and I am torn on what to do. Before this semester started, I thought that it would be an easy decision to transfer if I got accepted to one of these schools. But now as I am nearly through with my first semester on campus, I have grown a bit fond of my current school and the friends I have made. Hence why I am having more of a dilemma between choosing to stay at my current school (UConn) or transferring to either the University of Michigan or Georgia Tech. Below I'm going to list the pros and cons I can think of for attending each school next semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(FYI I am a second year student and major in Computer Science in all of these schools)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUConn:\n\nPros:\n\nMade a lot of friends and am socially doing pretty well in most aspects\n\nClose to Home (Convenient and Cheap Transportation)\n\nCheapest\n\nAlready accustomed to campus and how things operate\n\nCons:\n\nLeast Prestigious Academically\n\nPales in contrast to the other two universities in terms of resources and class breadth\n\nMiddle of nowhere (mabye also could be a pro for less distractions?)\n\nI'm constantly going to think what if? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUniversity of Michigan:\n\nPros:\n\nDream School\n\nSupposedly the holy grail for a mix of student life and academics\n\nAnn Arbor is great and more similar weather to where I am from \n\nStrong in my major\n\nSummer Break starts earlier than most schools (advantage for internships)\n\nCons:\n\nHave to start from scratch socially and academically (GPA reset)\n\nTransportation is not as convenient or cheap \n\nMost expensive out of the three (I wouldn't have to take out loans still)\n\nI may be 1-2 classes behind due to not all credits transferring\n\nSlightly bigger student body and possible over enrollment issues for the CS major?\n\nMany CS/Engineering classes are located away from central campus\n\nAlmost 50K students (not sure if this will be a shock from 30k ish students)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGeorgia Tech:\n\nPros:\n\nStrongest for my major?\n\nThreads would allow me to gain unique experience in certain areas of computing\n\nTons of opportunities/things to do in Atlanta\n\nI think all main classes will transfer\n\nCons:\n\nSuper Stressful Environment\n\nHave to start from scratch socially and academically (GPA reset)\n\nTransportation is not as convenient or cheap \n\nSecond most expensive out of the three (similarly wouldn't have to take loans)\n\nDon't know if the student body suits me well since it is a very academically focused school\n\nDon't know if I would like the environment since i've lived in the northeast my whole life\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally, I am concerned that if I transfer, 1. Can I make friends and fit in? (Which I am somewhat confident I can by joining clubs and putting myself out there as I did this semester) and 2. How much more difficult will the academics be at these higher ranked schools? Is the difference in quality between my current school and these two substantial? Also does transferring in the winter/spring semester make it harder to integrate versus in the fall?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any more information is needed please let me know, I'd love to hear all of your opinions!",
