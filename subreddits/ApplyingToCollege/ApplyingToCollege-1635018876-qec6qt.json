  "text": "i was privileged enough to not face any severe obstacles that substantially changed my academic performance, so i have no idea what to write about for one of my college's essay prompt. \n\nthis [blog](https://texadmissions.com/blog/2019/5/19/tips-and-examples-for-ut-austin-optional-special-circumstances-short-answer) suggested for students in a similar situation to instead write something along the lines of *\"I am thankful that I do not have any significant academic special circumstances or COVID disruptions to report. I prefer not to include anything for this prompt beyond what I wrote in my other essays.\u201d* \n\ni believe this is the best idea, but i'm a little worried that the response isn't sufficient. what do you guys think?",

Please share background on events or special circumstances that you feel may have impacted your high school academic performance, including the possible effects of COVID-19.\n\nWhat experiences have you had in high school that affected your academic performance- positive or negative? Did you have a specific teacher or a specific class that inspired the major you want to pursue?",
