  "text": "i was privileged enough to not face any severe obstacles that substantially changed my academic performance, so i have no idea what to write about for one of my college's essay prompt. \n\nthis [blog](https://texadmissions.com/blog/2019/5/19/tips-and-examples-for-ut-austin-optional-special-circumstances-short-answer) suggested for students in a similar situation to instead write something along the lines of *\"I am thankful that I do not have any significant academic special circumstances or COVID disruptions to report. I prefer not to include anything for this prompt beyond what I wrote in my other essays.\u201d* \n\ni believe this is the best idea, but i'm a little worried that the response isn't sufficient. what do you guys think?",
