  "text": "When inputting courses taken at an out-of-state high school on the UC application, any courses that aren't AP/IB (but honors at the high school) are supposed to be put as \"not honors,\" right? Since \"honors level\" is only supposed to be for approved UC courses, which are only from California high schools? Let me know if I'm correct on this. Thanks in advance!",
