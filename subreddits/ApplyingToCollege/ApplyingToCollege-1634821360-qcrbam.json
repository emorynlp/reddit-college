  "text": "Hey asking for a friend who is for some reason unwilling to make their own Reddit account. \n\nHe wants to graduate a year early since he has all the credits required at school. If he applies to college, will he be considered differently from the seniors who apply or be given some benefit of the doubt because he is choosing to apply one year earl and had one year less to gather ECs and grades and such.",
