      "text": "As far as colleges in Europe are concerned, you should aim for basically anything in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland or Ireland. These countries usually have programs in English as well (well for Ireland it's obviously all English).\n\n  \nOther good choices would be Germany, Austria, Spain, Czech Republic but there most probably will be less option in English.\n\n  \nMost countries have a website name like \"Study in X\", where X is the name of the country. These websites are for foreigners that would like to study in that country and usually offer a lot of information regarding colleges, English programs, procedures and fees.\n\n  \nI have studied in 4 different European countries so far, met a lot of American students, they ALL loved it and NONEof the returned to the States after graduation.\n\n  \nSo it's definitely worth giving a try :-)",
