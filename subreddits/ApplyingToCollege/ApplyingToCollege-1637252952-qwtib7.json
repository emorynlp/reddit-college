  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an international student from india and Berkeley has been one of my dream colleges since the beginning of high school. Rn I feel I have similar grades and ECs to some people in my school who got admitted the last 2 years. I got disappointed after learning about the UCs new policy to decrease international student intake. How much is this going to affect an international applicants chances? Is it true that it\u2019s going to be half as before this application season? Im not asking for aid so will I still get affected?",

I don\u2019t think that they specified if the cuts would be from OOS or international (probably a bit of both). So run the math and see what that means for admissions rates if all were from international, half, etc\u2026",

OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Do you/your family have $280,000 to spend on an undergraduate degree?",

Luckily I\u2019m privileged that I can do this since my American dream would get ruined if I ask for aid. But by how much do u think international acceptance rate would change according to the policy? Will it be small this year or pretty significant?",
