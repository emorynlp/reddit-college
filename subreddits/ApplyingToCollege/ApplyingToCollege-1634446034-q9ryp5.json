  "text": "Basically the title. I went to a few college matching websites, and they all seemed to give different results, so I wanted to ask your opinion. \n\nBasically I want a college that is equal male/female or has more males than females. I\u2019d like it to be good for economics as that is my intended major. I would prefer the campus to be near or in a big city, but for it to be an actual campus, not an array of buildings scattered across a few blocks. Furthermore, I would like it to be medium or large, if possible. I don\u2019t mind if it is private or public. In terms of admissions, I want it to be a realistic option, so here are my stats. In terms of region, I would prefer if it is at least mildly relevant (please don\u2019t recommend any of the dakotas) and my top choices are New England, Middle, and northwest states\n\nLatino international (though currently studying in Massachusetts) male.\n3.4 gpa (I am still a junior so it could get better)\n1580 SAT 800 math 780 English\nToefl 115\n\nECs\n\nPresident and founder of chess club\nMexican math Olympiad medalist\nMexican national essay contest winner\nMexican chess National Master\nBest delegate 3x in MUN\nAdvanced piano player (I haven\u2019t taken lessons, so my knowledge might be unorthodox, but I can play some Liszt and Chopin)\nLooking forward to doing new ECs, so I could also use recommendations.",
