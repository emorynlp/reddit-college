  "text": "So I EA\u2019d to two colleges, but I messed up on the Activities section. On one of my activities, the label is:\n\nIndoor Track, Varsity Captain, [school cross country team]\n\nIt should be:\n\nCross country, Varsity Captain , [school cross country team]\n\n\n\nOn a later activity, I put:\n\nTennis, Varsity Captain, [school indoor track team]\n\nIt should\u2019ve been:\n\nIndoor Track, Varsity Captain, [school indoor track team]\n\n\n\nI have my entire email drafted, because these seem like a big deal to me, but I want to check in with others whether I should even send an email for this.",
