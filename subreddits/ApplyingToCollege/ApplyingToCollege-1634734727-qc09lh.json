  "title:": "My dad refuses to be open about finances",
  "text": "His intention is to ease the stress on me so that I can focus on the present, i.e. school and the applications. He says that *'as long as it's education, I am willing to pay any sum.'*\n\nWhile this may sound too nice, I REALLY do not want to be too much of a financial burden on my family. Our annual income lies in the 100-149,999k bracket. I am also an Asian international if that matters. Without considering any factor, he accepted my advice of EDing to Cornell, despite it costing like a megaton of money. I feel like he is going to end up signing for more than is capable, and gets mad if I mention finances even in the slightest.\n\nMy question is that what should the EFC , on average, be for someone in the 130-150k bracket. That way I can figure out if I should apply for aid to certain colleges and for how much.\n\nI'm applying to quite a few schools by November 1 (EA) and potentially 1 for (ED)\n\nPlease help : (",

      "text": ">My question is that what should the EFC , on average, be for someone in the 130-150k bracket.\n\nThere is absolutely no way to answer that question.\n\nEFC is a function of income AND assets.  Frankly, with assets probably being more important than income in the range you mention.\n\nA family that makes $150k with nothing in the bank is in a very different situation than a family with the same income and several hundred grand in savings/investment accounts.\n\nYou need to know not just what his is willing to pay\u2026 but what he is CAPABLE of paying.",

      "text": "You can look at how Rice gives out aid - you would be on the edge between getting full tuition and half tuition in aid there with normal assets.\n\nhttps://financialaid.rice.edu/rice-investment\n\nThe colleges themselves determine how much aid they will give you, but your EFC could be around $30-40k with normal assets.",
