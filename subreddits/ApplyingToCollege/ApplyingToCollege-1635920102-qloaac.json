      "text": "At large schools that receive tens of thousands of applications, the first review is often done by a temporary worker hired and trained to be an application reader (often grad students, at least at the University of Washington ). There aren\u2019t enough regular admissions officers to read them all.\n\nFor schools that allow direct admission to a major, I assume (but don\u2019t know for sure) that people from the department are involved in making those decisions. But that comes after a file already made it through initial review.",

      "text": "Would not post essay online for critiques.\n\nThe only exception to your admissions question would be specialized programs like ScB/MD programs, since that's like applying to med school anyways.  They will have some representative from the med school admissions office reading apps.  In some cases, like Brown, they're separate.  Only the students admitted to Brown undergrad get their files passed to the MD admissions office.  I don't know if this applies to, say, Penn Wharton, but I would think maybe there would at least be 1 rep from Wharton reading those apps.  They won't be just random professors, though, unless they've volunteered to do it.  I'm sure every school is set up differently.",
