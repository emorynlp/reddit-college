Dartmouth is basically known for being the ivy with the most attractive student body.\n\nAlso, I saw this tik tok of a gay couple and goddamn both of them were hot as FUCK... I researched (stalked) a little and both are recruited athletes at Brown... So Brown is second for me.\n\nThe sweet sweet letter of acceptance from Harvard will most definitely amplify anyone's beauty for me... So Harvard is the third.\n\nPrinceton has a HUGE population of rich white brats and let's be honest, most of them are hot af. So it is next.\n\nFor the rest, Cornell>Yale>UPenn>Columbia... No specific reasons, just intuition.",
