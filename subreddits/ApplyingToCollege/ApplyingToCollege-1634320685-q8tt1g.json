I heard that gap year students are supposed to write an additional essay justifying why they are taking a gap year. I haven't seen anything relating to gap year students on the CommonApp, so how am I supposed to submit this additional essay?",

I'll probably add on a little bit of what I did do instead during the Summer, and what I will be doing next year before college starts.",
