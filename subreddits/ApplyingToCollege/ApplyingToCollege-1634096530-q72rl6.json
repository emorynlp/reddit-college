  "text": "Hi, i hope I\u2019m not breaking any rules but I\u2019m applying for colleges for either spring or fall, and i wasn\u2019t entirely sure how many i should apply to, and which ones i would have a chance of getting in to. I\u2019m a computer science major currently attending community college, and i am graduating this semester so i have to start looking for a bachelors. \n\nI cant afford to spend too much money but i want a school that has a decent undergrad population, and has a \u201cdecent\u201d computer science program (doesn\u2019t have to be anything too good, right now my reach school is Rutgers since it\u2019s good and I\u2019m in state)\n\nI currently have a 2.4 gpa but that\u2019s because of covid made me unable to take classes but i couldn\u2019t drop so they affected my gpa but i am retaking those classes and should be able to end with about 3.2 at best if i get all A\u2019s. I don\u2019t know how relevant it is but i also got an 1190 on sat\u2019s and can answer any other questions that might be relevant, so if anyone has any advice, please lemme know",
