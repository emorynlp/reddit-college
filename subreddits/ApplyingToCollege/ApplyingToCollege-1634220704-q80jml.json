  "text": "So, I am now a senior, getting ready to send in college applications. I have A's in all of my classes, perfectly completing my application. All A's except for AP GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS! I currently have the highest grade in that class with an 81. Most people are in the low 70's!! How do I convince the man that this grading distribution is ridiculous and that he should at least grade on some sort of curve?",
