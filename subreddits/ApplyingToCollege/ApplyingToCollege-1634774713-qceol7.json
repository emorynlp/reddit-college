  "text": "I am a first-gen American who\u2019s an in-state from Maryland. I feel like I\u2019ve let everyone down because academically I have a 3.46 UW/3.8 W and my SAT was so low the first time I don\u2019t even want to say it. I did indeed go through some traumatic stuff but don\u2019t want to use it as an excuse. Anyways I think I want to do IS or Comp Sci and I\u2019ve recently found out that all the HS Classes I took in MS (7th and 8th grade) will appear on my transcript and are affecting my GPA. 7th and 8th my grades were mediocre (I took all honors classes and did alg. 1, biology, and geometry). 9th Grade I was again at a mediocre 3.2 taking all honors (no AP cause school didn\u2019t offer any). 10th had a 4.2 (All Honors and AP), 11th had a 4.5 (All Honors, AP, and Cybersecurity DE). I really want to go to schools like Georgetown, UMD, GWU, UMBC but I\u2019m really scared I won\u2019t get into any. What should I do, and any colleges near my area I should apply to?",

You can start over and cut your college costs by a lot. I do t know much about Maryland but most state universities have admission agreements with CCs that can provide guaranteed admission if you have the right grades/classes.",
