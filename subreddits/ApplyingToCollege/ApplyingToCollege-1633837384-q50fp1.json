But I just saw someone asking if they should retake 1500+ SAT while I am planning to just go with this score. I do have a solid reason to explain my situation  as I was sick before my exam and I will be using the additional information to explain that. Yet, I just feel really scared",

      "text": "First off, no reason to be scared, it's just a test.\n\nBut I kind of come from a similar situation. I had a pretty serious concussion towards the end of high school (2013) and had to stick with a score that I felt didn't represent my best work and test taking. I don't even remember what the score was. I had the opportunity to retake it, but passed it up for reasons I don't remember. I did always include my injury in application letters/interviews because it is a real reason as to why I didn't get the score I felt I was capable of.\n\nStill, I went to a few good universities (for various majors) before dropping out and going for a culinary certificate. Now, 8 years later, I will be a restaurant part owner by the new year.\n\nBut that's just my experience, take what you will from it, but don't compare yourself to others. Make the best decision for your self and  have confidence in those choices.",
