  "text": "so i'm currently the only person in my school who's still virtual this year, as i have a severe health issue that prevents me from returning. i'm on good terms with all of my teachers, but i don't always get the opportunity to participate, nor do they see much of my personality (i join class through a google meet & sometimes they forget i'm there lmao). i'm not sure what i can do to ensure that i can get solid LORs despite this, and i was wondering if anyone has any advice/strategies they used last year",
