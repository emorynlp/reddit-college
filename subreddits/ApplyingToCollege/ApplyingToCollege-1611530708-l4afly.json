I know it's not perfect and wealthier kids score better but that's across the board. They have more access to everything. At least standardized test are something people can improve on by themselves.

      "text": "Yup that is the inequality of the education system. The opportunities are different. As you go through it the gaps between you and the other kids in schools better or worse than yours widens. Really good (and usually expensive) schools have teachers with more academic background and reputation, send students for global competitions, and give them rare opportunities to build up an extraordinary portfolio. Governments love to say every school is a good school because you should find the one that is the right fit for you. That is so untrue because who are they to tell you what schools fit you considering there are so many barriers like location and money. The problem is most students don't even realise what they could be doing for themselves. They don't know these competitions exist to even ask for them, or what other kids of the same age are achieving.And the problem is now with the internet there are so many opportunities out there that universities will expect that you search for it. (I mean makes sense thats what sets apart the brightest kids from the normal ones) So at the end of the day, its almost always the students fault for well... not knowing. And its always the normal kids, those of middle income, in normal schools, normal experiences, who find that they have nothing about themselves that stand out, regardless how talented they are, which is kind of sad.\n\nSo basically if your school doesn't offer these competitions, I hope you take the initiative to fight for it. Search for and find them and tell the school you want to assemble a team to go for it. Let the universities know that you tried your best and made the most of what you had.",

Most professor don't even want college sophomores or freshmen for research. Hence why I say it's acceptable for HS because you're demonstrating you understand how to analyze text and critically write about it.\n\nSource: am professor that stumbled into this subreddit",

You\u2019re a damn 16-17 year old and you should only be doing it because you love the field you\u2019re in, not because of some stupid application. I did it because I was exploring a field which is the only reason I would recommend it, but **do not** go into it thinking you need to cure cancer or publish some paper. Use it to simply explore the field or a project you\u2019re into (which btw there are TONS of other ways to do this).",

I do research and yes I put it on my resume, but the choice to do research was more of having an interest in the field instead of trying to improve my application. I can say with 100% certainty that doing research for the fun of it and having an interest in the topic eliminates any stress attached and makes the experience more enjoyable. Many professors are happy to see a young person interested in their field, so no you don't have to be a super genius.",
