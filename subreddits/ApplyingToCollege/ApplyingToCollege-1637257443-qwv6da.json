  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm HoH (hard of hearing). I've heard REALLY mixed things about mentioning disabilities in college apps, from it can help a ton to it can potentially lead to rejection. Ik ADA has their \"you can't be rejected for that\" part but I feel like for colleges it's pretty easy to say the rejection was for something else.\n\nWhat do you think? Would mentioning disabilities harm me? Could it maybe even help?? It hasn't really impacted my grades or anything but it's still something that's a big part of my life",
