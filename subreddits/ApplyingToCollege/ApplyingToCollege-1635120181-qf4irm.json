  "text": "I don\u2019t have many requirements for the place I attend, in all honesty I\u2019m just hoping to attend a university not too far from a ski base lol. Also somewhere that would accept a good amount of dual credit? \n\nCurrently my stats are: \n\nGPA: 3.45 (unweighted) but I think I\u2019m going to submit applications last minute when this semester is accounted for, which should give me a 3.75 hopefully \n\nAct:28, but waiting on the October 23rd scores \n\nDual credits: currently have 52 credits, graduating in the spring with around 80 and an associates in General Engineering\n\nExtra curricular activities: \n\n-Shakespeare club\n-Track (only participated freshman year)\n-Snowboarding (since this isn\u2019t with a club or school I don\u2019t think this would be applicable but idk) \n\nExtra info:\nFirst gen Arab-American (Syrian) \nBilingual (have take Arabic classes on the side for most of my life)\nI play the guitar and Ukulele B)\n\n\n\n\nI honestly have no idea where to apply? Is it too much of a reach to apply to nyu as an \u201cunlikely\u201d choice? Is it too easy to apply to places like CSU(Colorado state university)? \n\nAll advice is appreciated!",

      "text": "You should be fine for CSU -- CU Boulder would pretty safe as well (maybe not direct entry to engineering, but change of major there isn't a competitive process), and you could take a shot at Colorado School of Mines.\n\nIf you are out of state, there may be more affordable options that are just as good (Colorado State does offer WUE if you are in a western state, the other two don't).  I think NYU is a pretty big reach, but as long as you are also applying to reasonable safeties and targets shoot your shot if you would really regret not knowing.\n\nYou can absolutely include activities that aren't through clubs or school for your extracurriculars.",
