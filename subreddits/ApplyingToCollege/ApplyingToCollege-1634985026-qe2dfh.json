You can churn out 50 drafts for an essay, with each one taking 2 hours, and still have it come out terrible.\n\nAlternatively, you can theoretically write a perfect essay in one sitting in less than 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s about planning IMO. Before you start writing, plot out exactly how your essay would go, and if doesn\u2019t work well, just scrap it and think of something else. \n\nI can\u2019t think of a time where I had to restart an essay from scratch because it didn\u2019t work out, since I plan it out beforehand. Usually I revisit my writing a few days later to correct minor wording issues before submitting.",
