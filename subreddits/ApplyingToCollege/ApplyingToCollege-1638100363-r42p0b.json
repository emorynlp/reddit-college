  "text": "My sister has depression and the time I've devoted to helping and encouraging her step by step to get through it has shaped me a lot, including my choice of major. However, is this a good topic for a personal statement, considering my parents may be uncomfortable with me \"spreading\" bad news about her for my own good?",

Like I don't think there's any issue in writing this as long as your sister isn't applying there this year and you talk about yourself in the essay too. But your questions seems more to your parents and yourself than to us. Will your parents be happy if you write this? Ask them. Will you be writing this if they're okay with it, or if they're not? Ask yourself. If your parents don't spy on your essays, then there's nothing stopping you from writing it and not telling them.\ud83e\udd37",

      "text": "Topic is great just make sure that this is an essay about you and you remain the focus. Just like your post said focus on how helping her has shaped you and your choices. I would imagine her struggles have been a big part of your family and each member has their own experience dealing with it. This will be your story and from where I sit the outcome for you is very positive and inspiring. Talking about depression to me isn't spreading bad new, it is bringing awareness and taking away the stigma of something so many suffer with. While I understand your parents concern I think if you frame it like this they will understand. Please remember your parents have their own perspective but they are not applying to college and they don't have your same experiences, this has the potential to be a great essay-good luck!",
