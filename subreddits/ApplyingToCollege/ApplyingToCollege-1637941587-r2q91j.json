  "text": "During the summer of 2020, I received a grant to work on a device to aid in teaching social distancing to students with autism spectrum disorder. I put this in my activities. Could I expand on this as a short essay for the common app covid essay? I already wrote an essay as a supplemental for MIT (~250 words), so all I would have to do is copy and paste it. Thoughts?",

For example, was school closed and you had no internet and struggled with classes? Were you headed to the Olympics but Tokyo Olympics got postponed a year? Things like that",

Is the essay reserved for only negative impacts?",
