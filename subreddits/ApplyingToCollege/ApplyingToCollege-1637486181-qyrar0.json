  "text": "provided they all have nice quality and fit well with what's mentioned in the app. \n\nI want to email supplemental materials to my ED choice especially since they have demonstrated interest but I'm afraid it's going to be too much. I want to send 3-4 updates that I think will add nicely to my app but im afraid they will reject me if they think it's too much.\n\nThanks and have a nice day y'all :)",
