  "text": "\nIm a member of our school publication and i have suggested a lot of ideas to them that have gotten approved, even some projects that require a lot of manpower. However, im just a writer so im basically at the bottom of the hierarchy. I want to carve out a position for myself to cut out the middle man in some way (the approval process takes so long for suggestions, idk whats up with our clubs higher ups) and also because i want to further make this ec look better on my apps.",

              "text": "I was borrowing a term from live action TV for the person who pitches ideas in the writers room and edits scripts, etc., because that seemed analogous to what you do for your publication. But maybe a more traditional title in written journalism would be Content Editor. I was just tossing out a title I thought sounded more easily distinguishable from the editor in chief.",
