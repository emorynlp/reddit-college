  "text": "My highschool annoys the actual fuck out of me. the grade deflation isn't just bad it's HORRIBLE. like\ni got 7 A* and 1 A in my o'levels but my GPA SUCKS.\nlike the highest grade in our chem exam was 90/100 and only one girl got that and it was like DAMN WOW. yk\nThe teachers have told us that it's impossible to get full grades even in maths (im not fucking kidding)\nlike if a question has 4 marks and the answer is perfect still the max amount they can give is 3.\n\nThis shit is literally fucking everything up and everything is worse cuz I'm an international who needs aid\nFUCK",
