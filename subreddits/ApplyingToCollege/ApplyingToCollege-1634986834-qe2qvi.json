  "text": "recently i decided to skip gym class by pretending i was there by signing in and signing out (we use an online platform to track attendance for gym) \n\nneedless to say i got caught and now there\u2019s a chance i will get suspended. i know if i get suspended i will have to report this but if i get a detention (which I don\u2019t think goes on my record) will I have to report that too?",
