  "title:": "Failing AP Micro and I submitted it on my college app",
  "text": "Title is self-explanatory. I'd like to clarify that by failing, I don't mean a B or a C+. It's an F. How does that affect my chances? The quarter is almost ending and I'd be lucky to raise it to a B. I want to switch out but it is on my college app. I simply do not know what to do. Help me out, reddit. Some things to note: I'm not applying for a business major or anything like that and the colleges I'm applying to are quite good, but not Ivy or first tier.",

At best, a school may request a first grading period report. More likely, the next thing they\u2019ll see is a mid-year report with first semester grades.",
