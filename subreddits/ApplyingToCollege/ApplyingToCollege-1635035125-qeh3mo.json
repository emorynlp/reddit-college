  "text": "I'd really like to ED to Rice, but I am worried that the financial aid provided will not be enough. \n\nI came across this from [this article](https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/inside-admissions/post/dollar-dollar-bills-financial-aid-and-early-decision/) from Tufts, which states that if the net price calculator results are too high, to express that through your essays or to your admission officer if that's the only thing barring you from applying ED : \n\n**\"Make a point of mentioning in your \u201cWhy Tufts?\u201d or an email to your admissions officer that Tufts is your first choice but concerns over funding made you hesitate on ED.\"**\n\nHow would I go about writing the email to Rice, since it's just a simple expression of interest and can be done by everyone without proof that the certain school is their top choice? I don't want to annoy the admissions officer or paint myself in a negative light.",

      "text": "Hm the only thing I can think of that writing a letter could help would be them calculating your exact financial contribution before you even apply. Getting more financial aid seems unlikely. I\u2019d email a couple sentences about how much you love Rice, then explain that you would absolutely ED if it weren\u2019t for the fact you\u2019re uncertain about the cost, and then ask if there\u2019s anything they can do. I wouldn\u2019t overcomplicate it.\n\nAlso, doesn\u2019t Rice have the Rice Investment? You\u2019re guaranteed half tuition if income is below $200k, full tuition if it\u2019s below $130k, and don\u2019t have to pay anything if it\u2019s below $65k.",
