  "title:": "Unweighted GPA of Above 4.0, even though I have multiple B+'s",
  "text": "So I need to calculate my unweighted GPA. I consulted my school counselor regarding this, and she instructed me to use the grading scale provided on the side of my transcript (disregarding columns for AP and Dual Enrollment, obviously). Issue is, even unweighted, the scale counts an honors A+ as a 4.5, and I took all honors, and got a fair few A+'s. So, my calculated unwighted GPA comes out to 4.2, even though I have three B+'s on my transcript. Intuitively, this seems wrong, but I'm also unsure of whether I could even use another method of calculation. My school is a bit of an odd-ball with its grading, and there is no - (like A- or B-) in the grading system at all. \n\nNot sure where to go from here. I don't want to be inflating my GPA or lying if I put 4.0 down for scholarship applications and the like.",
