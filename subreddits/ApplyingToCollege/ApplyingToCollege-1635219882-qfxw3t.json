  "title:": "Seriously lost on the MIT research portfolio, any help appreciated",
  "text": "MIT, what the heck.\n\nThe research portfolio requests an \u201cabstract or poster\u201d, but provides no specifications beyond that. When I emailed them asking if I could include visuals in the abstract, they essentially told me to do whatever I think best represents my research. How close to the textbook should I stick when writing my abstract for the research portfolio? How long should it be?\n\nCurrently it\u2019s 480 words long separated into 5 paragraphs. Not too detailed, just enough for a person with a little knowledge to understand everything. I know abstracts aren\u2019t supposed to be multi paragraphs or really over 300-400 words, so I\u2019m wondering how much creative freedom I have here.",

          "text": "Thank you for the response.\n\nI\u2019ve read through that blog already, and it talks about the maker portfolio and FAQs related to that. My dilemma is related to the research portfolio, specifically the pdf submission of the abstract. It\u2019s almost intentionally vague, I was just wondering if I can get away with a longer, separated abstract instead of the traditional abstract since they don\u2019t specify any requirements. \n\nHeck, they even allowed me pictures if I wanted so I genuinely think they don\u2019t expect a textbook style abstract.",
