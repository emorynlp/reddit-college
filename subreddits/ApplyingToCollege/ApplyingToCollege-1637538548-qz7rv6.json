  "text": "I just got deferred from my early action school and I\u2019m looking through all of my application to see where I could have improved. I think not taking enough APs was my downfall. I\u2019ve taken 3 APs up to my junior year and I\u2019m taking one this year. But I\u2019m also going to take 7 dual enrollment courses total my senior year. But I just wished I had taken more AP classes my previous years because I know I could\u2019ve handled them and my school offered more.",

      "text": "I have the same dilemma. I only took 4 combined in 10th and 11th. My counselors encouraged us to NOT have rigor, they really suck at our school. I wish i had a mentor or someone who told me that rigor was important. There is so much misinformation, like i had a friends parent literally tell me not to take more APs bc the GPA was capped for most UCs. So dumb. It\u2019s hard not to look back and regret a lot especially knowing i could have handled it, but it\u2019s done now. I\u2019d say look forward, and know that you will nonetheless get into college, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking.",
