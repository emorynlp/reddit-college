  "title:": "Question on UIUC Supplementals",
  "text": "For the prompt: \n\n*In the past 3 to 4 years, what experience(s) have you had (inside or outside of the classroom) related to your selected first-choice major or academic interest? (150 words)*\n\nIs this supposed to also be a \"why us?\" essay and not just a \"why major?\" essay? I was looking online for tips and found [this link](https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-2021-22-supplemental-essay-guide/) that says \"But how might the courses and professors (get specific!) at UIUC shape and help you further your goals\"\n\nI just don't think there is enough space to incorporate the experiences I have had related to my major AND say why UIUC is the best next step for me. Thoughts?",
