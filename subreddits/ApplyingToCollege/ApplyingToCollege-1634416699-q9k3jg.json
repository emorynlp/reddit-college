  "title:": "Conflicted on common app essay",
  "text": "So I\u2019ve had my common app essay pretty much finalized at exactly 650 words. My college counselor and my English teacher have also gone over it with me and told me it looks good. However, a relative of mine who attended one of my top schools has been asking to look over my essay and give me some feedback, so I sent it to them last week and they came back with a bunch of things to add. I think some of them are great ideas and I would love to add a sentence to my essay based on this, but I can\u2019t find any other sentence that I could leave out to make room for it. Should I try to eliminate something or should I keep my essay the way it is? Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking this lol",
