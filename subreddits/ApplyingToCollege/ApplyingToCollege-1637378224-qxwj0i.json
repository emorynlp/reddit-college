  "text": "i have no idea where to start sigh i'm not even sure if this is the right place to express my concerns but i don't want to open up to my friends about this so i'm writing it here instead :// so i was told today by my school admin that one of the songs my dance club was planning to do was unapproved and now we have to change formations, music, learn new choreography, etc. i've been stressed all week as co-pres because we don't have much time and we were told last minute that we have to change our song--then i lied to my parents about my act score (i've gotten a 28 multiple times, including this one) but told them i got a 30, and now i just found out that i got rejected from uchicago. i know the lying abt the act score part is on my end for not studying and not getting a good score but the last thing i wanted to do is disappoint my parents (well. when they find out they're going to be ultra disappointed lol) and now i can't even face my parents anymore because how am i going to tell them that i lied about my score AND i got rejected from my dream school? all of my other friends that applied ed to uchicago got accepted and i obviously didn't want to ruin the mood...:// i just feel like a total failure right now and now i have no idea what to do with life man lol i don't even know what i want from posting this. i guess i just wanted a space for me to vent how horrible my life is (which was all because of my stupidity). anyways if anyone even bothered reading this entire paragraph, thank you and i hope it made you feel a little better about your life :')",

      "text": "1. I can\u2019t even imagine how stressed and anxious you must feel. As someone in a dance class where parts of the finale dance were changed multiple times the week before the performance, I feel horrible thinking about you and your dance club having to learn new choreography for a whole new song. \n\n2. I hope you realize that you are a wonderful person, no matter what. \n\n3. Being rejected from your dream school is no small matter, and I hope you are able to take time to heal. Please know that you are not a disappointment for these things that have happened. \n\n4. I wish that things will go better for you in the future, and that you can eventually open up to your parents and friends about how you feel. If you feel that it\u2019s too hard to talk to them in-person, I suggest typing a letter and sending it to them, as it can help with the nerves of having to talk straight to their faces. \n\n5. Sending all my virtual hugs, snacks, blankets, whatever you need \u2014-> \u2570(*\u00b4\ufe36`*)\u256f\u2661",

This WILL require some acting lol. Casually ask them if they heard about the recent shooting/protests regarding student-safety at UChicago. Express your disinterest in attending UChicago now. Then whenever you feel comfortable, give them the good news that you 'just' got the rejection and won't have to spend the next 4 years in constant fear..",

Yes, losing all the work you've done on the dance routine is hard.  Yes, getting rejected is a gut punch.  Yes, the other things you mentioned are also challenging.  But none of those are existential crises.  Life is long - really long.  And you will get [SO. MANY. CHANCES](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qxyfzm/stressed_anxious_depressed_or_overwhelmed_this_is/) to come back from whatever setbacks you face.  Seriously - go read that post I linked; it's long, but it's for you.",
