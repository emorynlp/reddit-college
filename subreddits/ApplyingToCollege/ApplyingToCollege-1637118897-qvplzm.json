  "text": "Edit: cost difference is about $30k\n\nBoth are SUNY schools.  It shouldn't be hard to figure out what I'm talking about, but I'm not going to mention the names directly.\n\nI am currently a science major on the premed track.\n\n|Hometown SUNY|Current SUNY|\n|:-|:-|\n|\\- Less research.  But, research is available in house.|\\- Probably 2-3x in house research.  In addition, there are numerous labs within a 30 minute drive that take undergrad students as research assistants (and some of those positions are paid).|\n|$30k maximum cost for 3 years.  Parents are willing to pay the full cost.|$61k maximum cost for 3 years (after subtracting academic scholarships that I already have).  Parents are fine with paying for it all.|\n|10 minute commute.  Living at home|Dorming (which I am neutral on).  4-6 hr drive home, depending on traffic and how fast I feel like driving.|\n|I have a few old high school friends going there, also for premed.  There is a lot less diversity though.  However, I grew up nearby so I know how it is.|I have made a ton of new friends and have also met a lot of other people from my cultural background my age.  There is also a higher percentage of the student body as premeds.  So, it is easy to relate to new people.|\n|Class difficulty is about the same|Class difficult is about the same|\n|Has a few clinical opportunities.  But, it is hard to get shadowing, scribing positions etc. because the university is a similar size to my current univeristy.  But, the local population is smaller and so there are a lot fewer hospitals nearby.|Way more hospitals nearby  mean that the ratio of opportunities to opportunists is much better.  Also, since the area is much more populate, there are also more opportunities to shadow/scribe with specialists.|\n|I grew up in the area and I have good memories here.  I enjoy the nature and the slower pace of life.|I wasn't a fan of this university because of the more densely populated surroundings / concrete sea feeling.  But, I've grown to appreciate it and I see more opportunity to grow here personally and professionally.|\n\nI still want to go to my current university for academic opportunities and because I like the diverse campus more.  But, I am torn on the cost difference.",

      "text": "I'd vote stay. It's an extra $10k/yr, but it sounds like much better pre-med opportunities.  Gpa and MCAT scores are very important, but research/shadowing/volunteering is also a component of it, and Med school applicants have gone up in the last few years. You're going to have more competition, so might as well maximize your application with more research.",

      "text": "This is really a discussion to have with your parents.\n\nIf you were my kid, I'd tell you to stay where you are if you prefer it.  We had a budget for what we were willing to pay for college, and were upfront about it with our kid.  I don't want them to stress about going to the least expensive option available -- I wanted them to choose what they thought the best option for them was within that budget.\n\nThat's coming from the privileged position of being able to afford the schools in that budget without needing to borrow at all.  If the local school was affordable, but living away from home and going to a possibly better school required a bunch of loans that's a different situation.",

I was feeling a little guilty about mentioning it so it was a big coincidence that he brought it up like that.\n\nThanks for sharing!  Interesting to hear this kind of response on reddit.",

I've gotten some responses in support of transferring on a crosspost as well.  Obviously, parents are paying for it, but I don't want to waste their money.  As of right now, I'm leaning towards tranferring.",
