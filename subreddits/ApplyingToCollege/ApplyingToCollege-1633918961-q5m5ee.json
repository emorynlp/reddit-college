  "title:": "I screwed up as a Junior, what do I do?",
  "text": "My Quarter 1 report just came out, with 2B+ and 1B, the rest A or A+. \n\n1. With the APs, I can carefully balance it at 4.0 weighted, but my UW is trash. \n2.  I had all As in freshman year, and only a B in AP Macro in the first semester of sophomore year. \n3.  Reasons why I screwed up \n   1. I joined APUSH (I am very sure I am stem-based. Also, I read pretty slowly, so I could not handle the amount of homework and was only able to turn in 1/2 of the homework) (I just constantly get Bs on the assignment, so I guess the B is what I deserve) \n   2. I have a trash Physics teacher. (He never teach, so we had to basically read the textbook or watch Khan Academy if we did not hire tutors. We had to guess what is not the test because it would not be taught in his class, nor in the textbook. Inevitably, it was even lucky for me to get a B on his tests) I totally understand, and I know I have to work harder, but it just feels so annoyed seeing a B+ in a \"non-AP\" course. \n   3. As listed, as an ESL student, my English is not up to grade level.  I had a not-so-well English teacher for three consecutive years in 8,9, and 10th, while I got As in her class because she graded so loosely, I can personally realize that I did not grow much in my Literature skills. This year I have the best, but the harshest, English teacher in the whole school. She taught us a lot of things in the past month two months, however, she also grades us harshly, which means that as a person who was already at the worse end of the grade level, my grades are not supposed to be good. I totally understand, and I know I have to work harder, but it just feels so annoyed seeing a B+ in a \"non-AP\" course.  (Our school does not open ESL courses for High School students. You basically had to prove that you are worthy in seventh/eighth grade to get out of the course, and then you are fighting alone in the forest) (I had a decent English teacher in sixth and seventh grade, so I was lucky to be \"on-my-grade-level\" by the end of seventh grade, but starting eighth grade, I just fall more and more behind)   \n\n\nLuckily, my school is semester-based, quarter reports are only for the parents to know how their kids are doing at school. Please give some possible ways I can help myself (such as how to read faster, write better literature analysis, and self-study Physic.)",

          "text": "Now that it is impossible to withdraw from a class, I wish I could turn back in time for a month, and smack my face when I was persuaded by my teacher to stay in APUSH. (I am very very soft-hearted, and my teacher apparently, is a good teacher, but has great goals for his APUSH students, and tried to keep all \uff15 of us). Thank you for the advice though, it is a very genuine one.",
