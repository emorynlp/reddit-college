I don't help in making things like worksheets or creating powerpoints, I mostly just give suggestions and advice on how to deal with his classes or like things he can do for the class. Something like a, consultant, or something like that?\n\nShould I put something like \"Assisted teachers in the development and planning of online lessons and classes\".\n\nIdk am I stretching it?",
