  "title:": "Question on what I should do to improve my chances of getting into an ivy",
  "text": "I am mostly looking for whether I should improve my ecs or keep them as is. For context I am in 10th grade and attend one of the top magnate high schools in the us so there is a bit of competition for acceptance in top schools.\n\nIn terms of ecs I am an editor for two magazines and write articles each year for three. I am also part of my school\u2019s math team, Econ team, science bowl team, and swim team. I also tutor for community service(around 150hrs of service so far) and have performed nationally at math competitions. I have one published paper of university research and have another one pending for publication. I hope to do another paper later this year. I am also starting a math competition next year (planning rn) and plan to participate in 5 or 6 hackathons this year (one done so far). I\u2019ll also lead most of the clubs next year and I also run a math fair for younger students to show leadership.\n\nIn terms of academics I am doing fine. I will take 2 aps next year (bc calc and something else) and 7 in my senior year.\n\nIs there anything I can improve?",
