      "text": "I personally recommend a gap year for most international students.  It gives you WAY more opportunity to engage with your ECs, improve test scores, and grow personally, all of which can help a TON in holistic admissions.  \n\nObviously if you don't want to do it you don't have to.  You can also apply this year and if it doesn't work out, take a gap year and apply again next year.",
