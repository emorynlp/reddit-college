So I applied ED to NEU cause I loved everything about it, but the one thing that\u2019s tripping me up is how cold it gets in Boston. Is it worth withdrawing my ED app and applying RD just because of one factor? Like everything else about it is perfect, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be comfortable somewhere that cold.",

Sometimes (maybe for about 2-3 months of the year, but it depends\u2014sometimes it won't snow at all, otherwise there will be snow on the ground from November through March), it will be pretttttyyyyy cold, but in other seasons, there's nowhere I'd rather be. The spring and fall is beautiful and temperate, and the summer, though humid, is really pleasant, especially considering it's such a stark contrast from the winter weather. It obviously isn't southern california (where the weather seems to be 70 degrees and sunny every day? wtf) but it has its own charm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for if that's sufficient grounds to change your application from ED to RD\u2014absolutely. You would be living in Boston, and if that doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, then it is within your prerogative to change to RD. I think you have a win-win situation on your hands though\u2014no matter what, I promise everything will be ok :)",

Lined sheepskin boots plus good wool socks (so they aren\u2019t itchy) can keep toes toasty even in extreme cold (and can feel as comfy as slippers). If you have a good winter jacket with a layer underneath, the torso is set. Good mittens will keep your hands warm. The toughest to keep warm is the face, but a soft warm scarf works in all but extreme sub-zero temps (which would be rare in Boston). The hardest time I have in the cold is taking all that stuff off once I get indoors as a lot of places keep it so warm, I want summer clothes inside. If you decide to leave your app ED, you\u2019ll know your admission status early & have time to get the right gear (secondhand if money is tight), and the right gear makes the cold a lot more tolerable. \n\nIf you\u2019re not ready for the adventure of cold, it\u2019s ok to change, but you may find it tolerable for 4 years if you love everything else about the school. Are there other places that you vibe with as much or more?",
