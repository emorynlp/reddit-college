  "title:": "school counselor keeps trying to persuade us to not apply to US universities",
  "text": "Hey guys, so I'm an international student in Canada. Currently, out of the \\~150 students in our senior class there's only a few (like 5\\~10 including me lol) interested in applying to universities outside of Canada. Anyways, our counselor keeps holding presentations and giving speeches about how it's a a bad idea to go to universities in the US, and that no universities there are better than the ones we have in Canada (not even the Ivies...?) and that the education there is not worth the cost. And then he starts talking about how dangerous the US is compared to Canada and the quality of life etc. It just seems like he is so against us going to the US and I feel so unsupported by my school lmao.\n\nWhat do you guys think? If you lived in Canada, would you stay here or apply to universities in the US / outside of the country?",

      "text": "Cost is obviously a major issue that you would need to handle. Not all US schools give need-based aid to internationals.\n\nAlso, acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\nMaybe the US forms are more work for him.",

      "text": "If you plan to live and work in the U.S. then I might prefer a U.S. school.  If you plan to live and work in Canada then I would probably stick to Canadian schools, unless you could get into one of the few U.S. schools whose name would carry more cachet in Canada than, say, U of T / McGill / UBC / Waterloo (Eng).  However, I would probably only go to that U.S. school if I could do so at a significant discount, which is going to depend entirely on your financial situation.  Otherwise I agree with your counselor: not worth the cost.",
