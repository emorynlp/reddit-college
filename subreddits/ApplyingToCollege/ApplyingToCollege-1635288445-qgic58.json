  "title:": "Oxford University, England states that you must have 3 APs at score 5 to qualify for admission - do they have to be related or as long as they meet the required subjects, are they fine? For example, can I apply to E&M with APs in Calc BC, Italian Lang, and AP Music Theory or is it a de facto reject?",
