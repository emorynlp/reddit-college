  "text": "My twins spent a lot of time and energy deciding if and where to submit scores with their EA applications. After getting a PDF of their submitted transcripts from Parchment just now, I realized that our school put all their scores (& all attempts) right on their transcripts. I looked it up and it's some sort of state policy here :/.  Can't believe our school never pointed this out to kids/ families in our newsletter or whatever, but we have 3 out of 3 new guidance counselors since Covid, so there is a LOT of info/knowledge not being passed on from the lack of continuity.\n\nAnyway-- if we had pre-Covid style college prep communication, we probably would have known that, but our counselors are swamped with credit recovery and trying to get at-risk kids on track for graduating and our school newsletter doesn't list college prep tips or deadlines anymore.  That's all.",

Scores are filtered/calculated by their admissions technology. The AO evaluating your application almost certainly will never see the other scores.",

          "text": "Thanks. Both of my kids applied test optional at most of their schools and didn't want to supply test scores at all in those cases. But it turns out they had no choice because our state/ high school/ school district put the scores on everyone's transcripts (a huge surprise to us).\n\nAll kids in this state take the SAT in April of their junior year during a certain school day. It was canceled a couple of times and my kids hadn't particularly prepared when it finally rolled around. They most definitely would have found a way to take it again to try to maximize it if they'd known that it would absolutely be included on their transcripts sent to all schools. They mistakenly thought they could apply to their schools without any test numbers in the mix. I'm wishing kids and families would have been made aware of the test-scores-on-the-transcripts thing.\n\nEdited to clarify that they thought they were applying test-blind/optional to most of their EA schools.",
