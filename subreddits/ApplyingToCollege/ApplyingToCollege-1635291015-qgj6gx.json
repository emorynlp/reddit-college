  "text": "Is GPA improving good for college or does it look like I didn\u2019t try until later on?\n\nMy GPAs have been\n\n**9th:** 86 (3.1)\n\n**10th:** 85 (3.0)\n\n**11th:** 90 (3.5)\n\n**Overall:** 87(3.2)\n\nIm scared that colleges might see it as I only cared about junior year. Or am I overthinking it? And does it look bad that it went down by 1 in 10th grade?",
