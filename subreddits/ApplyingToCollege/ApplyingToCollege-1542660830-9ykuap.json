  "text": "Dear Student,\n\nis this you? IS THIS THE RIGHT EMAIL?\n\nI have not yet received your application to our obscure college with a funny name and an 80% acceptance rate. What gives? Are you feeling suicidal?\n\nPlease review these pictures of grassy fields and smiling college-aged students and reconsider your decision to ignore our school.\n\nStill not interested? Maybe you are poor! Allow us to waive the application fee so you can more easily seal your fate to a life of mediocrity and \"huh, I've never heard of that college\".\n\nEven though you will never go here, please allow me to conclude this email with an aggressive comment and a pretentious footer.\n\nI look forward to reviewing your application,\n\nJake \n\nSir Professor Dean of Admissions The Thirtieth\n\n3029 Middle of Nowhere\n\n<Link to our website that looks like it's from the 90s>",

At the very most, an employer might look up a school he/she hasn't heard of and see what it's relative \"peer\" schools are for reference.  Also, you generally have much greater earning potential having a bachelor's degree in a field like engineering from a respectable yet \"mediocre\" state school that's well known in that field (say, Iowa State, Arizona State, SUNY schools, MSU, or schools at around that level) than you would from a highly ranked liberal arts college if you didn't plan to go to grad school.
