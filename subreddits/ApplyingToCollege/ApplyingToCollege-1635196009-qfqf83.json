  "text": "So I just got access to my NC State portal and under the test scores section, it has my correct SAT score which I reported, and an ACT score of **14** \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nI've never even taken the ACT. I emailed the admissions office about it and I'm not really worried I just thought it was funny cuz idk how that mistake was possibly made.",
