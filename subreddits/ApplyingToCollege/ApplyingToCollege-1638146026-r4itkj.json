  "title:": "Should I continue student council?",
  "text": "Although I know I should be deciding on my own, I think it's better if I get different perspectives. I'm currently a junior in high school and this is my first year in student council. I'm wondering whether I should continue because I'm questioning the value(position and time wise)it will bring to my college application. I know this may sound bad, but I genuinely enjoy being in student council and I would like to garner more school spirit and student involvement in my low-income school. I also worry about the time it may take off from other extracurriculars. All in all I'm stuck on balancing my extracurriculars because I started all my extracurriculars in my junior year and I have to value one over the other. I'd really appreciate your tips and advice. Thank you.",
