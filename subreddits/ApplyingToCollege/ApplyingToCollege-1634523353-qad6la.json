  "text": "Read on this sub that Cornell kinda has a thing for students from rural areas but I wondered if that applies to me. I currently live in VA and have spent all of high school here but before that I lived in Tennessee for all of elementary and some of middle school. Just wondering if I get a little boost or if they will even know that info at all",

Knoxville and Nashville are some of my favorite cities; I have family in Knoxville and I love it there! Great food too.",
