  "text": "*After a long content hiatus, I'm back with a discussion on choosing majors/programs. Both Noelle and I will be focusing on more content again for A2C and our blog through the new year. Given the upcoming UC and regular decision deadlines, we hope this information is helpful to anyone still struggling with what majors/programs to apply for.* \n\nChoosing a major for college can seem like a daunting decision. The truth is that what you study as an undergrad probably WILL affect the direction of your future career. But it\u2019s not as much as some students think. \n\nCollege majors do affect career opportunities, so if you have a particular career in mind, you should try to find the appropriate program. If you\u2019re looking to become an engineer or nurse, then you definitely want to apply for those programs, as they will provide specific knowledge that is necessary for the job. But employers are oftentimes looking more for soft skills like communication, leadership, and problem solving. What\u2019s your work ethic? Do you get along well with others? If you\u2019re unsure as to what career you want, you can pick a program that will help you develop these attributes.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to go to grad school, there is definitely some flexibility as well. I\u2019ve talked to med school admissions officers who mentioned that majoring in something other than biology sometimes helped an applicant stand out in the admissions process, as long as they took the required courses and did well on the MCATs. For law school or MBA programs, it can be even more flexible as to what your undergraduate degree is in. **The point is that your choice of major is NOT going to lock you into one small subset of future career outcomes**. And keep in mind, for many programs, it\u2019s relatively easy to change your major once you arrive on campus. \n\n# Does my choice of major affect my chance of admission?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate out there about an applicant\u2019s choice of major as it relates to their admissions chances for that school. This post is my personal take on this discussion, which I hope will get applicants to at least think about their chosen majors more carefully. \n\nOverall, **I don\u2019t believe that** **an** **applicant\u2019s choice of major ostensibly affects the acceptance rate to most undergraduate programs**, as many schools don\u2019t even require that a student declare a major until sophomore year and understand that a large portion of students will change their majors. This is especially true for liberal arts colleges and top-ranked schools with core curriculum, as they are able to more easily predict class sizes due to the high number of required courses for graduation. \n\nBut there are always exceptions to the rule. Certain majors, especially those in business/engineering/other specialized programs, can have dramatically different acceptance rates - think Wharton Business School or CMU\u2019s Computer Science School. And at large institutions, like the University of California school system, acceptance rates can be wildly different from program to program.  \n\nHowever, there\u2019s more to this conversation beyond the surface of acceptance rates. I do think that **a student\u2019s extracurricular/academic work and its relation to your intended major can affect how competitive of a student you are**. For example, a student I worked with thought they wanted to study political science and go to law school for much of their high school careers, participating in the typical poli-sci ECs of MUN, debate, volunteering for local election campaigns, and Amnesty International, only to realize the summer before senior year that they wanted to study biology and go into medicine. While I do believe that achievement in the above-mentioned activities have value, regardless of chosen major, I don\u2019t believe they will be as strong an applicant applying as a biology major as they would a political science major, two programs that are vastly different. This can also be exacerbated by their choice of courses, perhaps taking AP Government and AP Macroeconomics instead of challenging themselves in AP Bio. \n\nLastly, for a more recent change of academic direction, a student might not be nearly as informed about their new field as the one they\u2019ve been working towards already for years. In the \u201cWhy Major?\u201d essays, they might be able to write a much stronger and more specific reason for studying a particular field, avoiding cliches like wanting to study biology to go to med school because they realized how much they just really wanted to help people.\n\nIn these cases, **I sometimes recommend that students consider reverse engineering their chosen major** to one they have more prior experience/achievement in and are more competitive for already. The later this shift in interest realization happens, the more likely I am to suggest this option. And this is generally just a consideration for a student\u2019s reach schools. \n\n# When should I consider reverse engineering my chosen major?\n\n1. **Students who don\u2019t have a strong preference of major to begin with.** If this is the case, then you don\u2019t have much to lose.\n2. **Students whose extracurricular profiles are really different from the academic field they want to study in.** As mentioned in the example above, I believe activities are valued somewhat differently depending on what program you\u2019re applying for.\n3. **Students applying to programs where it is quite easy to change majors once accepted.** If it\u2019s not much of a hassle, then you don\u2019t have much to lose here. \n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning: If you\u2019re applying for a BA in political science within the CAS (or equivalent) college of a school AND the biology program is within the same college, it might not be too difficult to change your major within your first or second year. For some schools, you don\u2019t even declare your major until sophomore year and will be taking a lot of required core curriculum classes your first year anyways. In this case, why not stick with your original interests in political science and prevent any situation where you\u2019re compared to another biology applicant with tons of achievement in that field - research experiences, Olympiad results, or challenging related coursework. \n\nIf you are a student who doesn\u2019t really know what they want to study, you can certainly apply as undeclared, but maybe you have a couple of interests and just can\u2019t choose between them. In this case, you could also apply for whichever program you seem more qualified for and express interest in double majoring in another program. I personally believe this to come off as more ambitious than applying undeclared. \n\n# When NOT to try to reverse engineering your chosen major\n\n1. **Students who find it hard to write passionately about your \u201coptimal\u201d chosen major.** Oftentimes, schools have a \u201cWhy Major?\u201d or \u201cWhy Us?\u201d supplemental essay that encourages you to explain your choice of intended area of study. If you can\u2019t write passionately about a possible field of study, it might come off as uninspired in the essay.\n2. **Students who don\u2019t have wildly different academic interests.** Your activities might have just as much admissions value for either of the majors you\u2019re stuck deciding on, so you might as well choose the one you think you\u2019re most interested in now. \n3. **Students applying to schools where changing majors is difficult**, like the UC school system. If you know that you really want to study something like biology, don\u2019t risk the chance of not being allowed to transfer into that program later.\n\nThis strategy is certainly school specific, so you don\u2019t want to necessarily use it for every school. Also keep in mind that for your target/safety schools, you may be competitive for your first-choice course of study anyways and you might not need to try to think about optimizing your application and would rather avoid any hassle in changing majors/programs. \n\n# A note on diversifying your chosen majors\n\nIf a student has multiple interests, we often recommend that they diversify their intended majors. Not only can you give yourself more time to decide which program might fit best, you can sometimes avoid choosing the most competitive programs at certain reach schools. Interested in all of Stern NYU\u2019s business resources but don\u2019t necessarily want to major in business? You can apply for a CAS major instead and think about getting your MBA later. For less competitive business schools at other universities, you probably have a better shot of getting accepted and can apply for the business school. We generally just advocate that for students with multiple interests or are unsure about what they want to study, that they choose the program that they\u2019re most qualified for.\n\n# What about applying undeclared?\n\nIf you really don\u2019t know what you want to study, you can of course apply as undeclared. There are a number of students in the same boat as you and many available spots open to students who want to take their time in choosing an academic direction. The only warning that I would give to students applying undeclared is that you shouldn\u2019t come off as having NO idea as to what you want to study. I believe that it\u2019s stronger in the admissions office to come off as having TOO MANY academic interests and you can\u2019t pick one. Can\u2019t choose between economics, business, and public policy? Explain these specific interests in your essays/additional information section instead of coming off as rudderless. \n\nIf you\u2019re stuck between two particular programs and are thinking about applying undeclared, you can also say that you hope to double major in those programs and can come off as academically ambitious. The point is, just make sure to explain your reasoning for applying undeclared if you decide to do so. \n\n# School policies on declaring and changing majors\n\nOverall, there are a few general rules you can follow in regards to how flexible a school is with a student changing majors. \n\n1. **Smaller, more liberal arts/core curriculum schools will usually have more flexibility with changing majors**\n2. **Larger state universities with fewer core classes will make it harder to change majors, especially between different colleges within the university**\n3. **Changing majors into special programs that are competitive at that particular school can be difficult (business, engineering, computer science)**\n4. **Changing majors within your current college is generally easy**\n\nOf course there are always exceptions to the rule, which is why we\u2019ve listed the specific policies for declaring and changing majors for the top-30 universities and top-10 liberal arts colleges below with links. Notice that the list for liberal arts colleges is short because they generally make it pretty easy to change majors as long as you\u2019re likely to graduate on time. \n\nTry to pay attention to the language used by the school to indicate how many obstacles there may be to changing majors. For some schools, they\u2019ll say unequivocally that \u201cStudents may change their majors at any time, provided that they will be able to complete the new program before graduation.\u201d (Amherst), while for others, they state \u201cPlease note that submitting these requests does not guarantee approval\u201d (UCLA) in reference to forms to request a change in major. While one is encouraging students to change majors, the other is warning of the possibility of having your request rejected. \n\n**\\*\\*\\*DISCLAIMER: These policies are complex and we may not have the FULL picture for major policies for every school\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Original Blog Post Here:** [**https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2021/09/07/how-do-i-choose-my-major-and-will-it-affect-my-chance-of-admission/**](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2021/09/07/how-do-i-choose-my-major-and-will-it-affect-my-chance-of-admission/)\n\n# Top 30 Universities\n\n**Princeton**\n\n[B.S.E. students join their departments at the end of their first year by selecting courses for the next fall with their chosen department and declaring their selection on the registrar\u2019s website in May.
