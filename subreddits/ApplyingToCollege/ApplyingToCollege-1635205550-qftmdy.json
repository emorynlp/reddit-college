  "text": "Hi, I'm a sophomore and I started to research colleges. Even though it's a reach school with such high stakes and high admission criteria, I really want to go to Harvard. So, any advice? I have a 4.0 GPA so far in HS. And if you got into Harvard (or really, any t20), how did you do it? What do you think helped you get in and what would you do if you could go back to the time you were a sophomore?",

              "text": ">will reading lots of books and mastering algebra and geometry help for the SAT?\n\nMastering Algebra and Geometry, assuming you can do that, will certainly help.  To the extent reading bolsters vocabulary and reading comprehension it can help, but I suspect the effect isn't as direct.  Learn test-taking skills, learn the math concepts, then practice.  When you get things wrong figure out why so you can avoid making the same mental error again.\n\n>I'm taking AP CSP and AP world right now. I've never taken an AP before.\n\nYou've got two more years...\n\n>Is photography impressive?\n\nBy itself?  Not really.  As a hobby it shows you're a three-dimensional person, but consider that anyone can take up photography as a hobby.  If you win contests that can be impressive but also, obviously, much more difficult.  If there is something you really enjoy and are naturally good at then considering \"pressing in\" to whatever that is and seeing how far you can take it.  Don't pick an award or competition out of a hat and decide, \"I think I'll win that one.\"\n\n>how do i appear as \"superlative\" to teachers?\n\nGet good grades for a start.  But, also, display intellectual curiosity.  Be the guy who asks \"what if\" questions about things that aren't explicitly spelled out in a lesson.  Don't ever be the guy who asks, \"Will this be on the test?\"  Ask good questions, but don't be the student who immediately shoots up his hand and waves it around every time a teacher poses a question to the class.  Don't be cocky.  Be personable.  Engage with your teachers as human beings.\n\n>How do i learn to write good essays?\n\nCultivate the ability to express yourself well in written form.  Figure out what things colleges want to hear, then figure out about how to adapt things from your own life in ways that check those boxes.",

Do you have leadership positions in extracurriculars? Do you actually enjoy your extracurriculars, and do you do well? How are your essays? Did you choose the right teachers to write your letters of recommendation?\n\nI'm a bit on the nerdy side, so I prepped for and took a lot of standardized tests\u2014mostly math/science competitions and AP exams\u2014but I was also captain of my soccer team and sang tenor in choir. Do what you enjoy, but do it well.\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to guarantee admission to any selective school. I know people who were rejected who were (in my opinion) substantially more qualified than people who were accepted.",
