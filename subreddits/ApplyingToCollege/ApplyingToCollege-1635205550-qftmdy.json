  "text": "Hi, I'm a sophomore and I started to research colleges. Even though it's a reach school with such high stakes and high admission criteria, I really want to go to Harvard. So, any advice? I have a 4.0 GPA so far in HS. And if you got into Harvard (or really, any t20), how did you do it? What do you think helped you get in and what would you do if you could go back to the time you were a sophomore?",

              "text": ">will reading lots of books and mastering algebra and geometry help for the SAT?\n\nMastering Algebra and Geometry, assuming you can do that, will certainly help.  To the extent reading bolsters vocabulary and reading comprehension it can help, but I suspect the effect isn't as direct.  Learn test-taking skills, learn the math concepts, then practice.  When you get things wrong figure out why so you can avoid making the same mental error again.\n\n>I'm taking AP CSP and AP world right now. I've never taken an AP before.\n\nYou've got two more years...\n\n>Is photography impressive?\n\nBy itself?  Not really.  As a hobby it shows you're a three-dimensional person, but consider that anyone can take up photography as a hobby.  If you win contests that can be impressive but also, obviously, much more difficult.  If there is something you really enjoy and are naturally good at then considering \"pressing in\" to whatever that is and seeing how far you can take it.  Don't pick an award or competition out of a hat and decide, \"I think I'll win that one.\"\n\n>how do i appear as \"superlative\" to teachers?\n\nGet good grades for a start.  But, also, display intellectual curiosity.  Be the guy who asks \"what if\" questions about things that aren't explicitly spelled out in a lesson.  Don't ever be the guy who asks, \"Will this be on the test?\"  Ask good questions, but don't be the student who immediately shoots up his hand and waves it around every time a teacher poses a question to the class.  Don't be cocky.  Be personable.  Engage with your teachers as human beings.\n\n>How do i learn to write good essays?\n\nCultivate the ability to express yourself well in written form.  Figure out what things colleges want to hear, then figure out about how to adapt things from your own life in ways that check those boxes.",

I never took any of them, and they do cost money, but I know some people find them useful.\n\nI spent a lot of time working through past competitions [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_Problems_and_Solutions). All those competitions are incredibly useful for several reasons. First, they're good practice for what you would see in the competition...in fact, they're exactly what you'd see. Second, they scale up in difficulty as you go along. You're not expected to get all of the last five problems in the AMC 12, but you are expected to get all of the first 5. That can give you a good mix between learning things (mostly from the hard problems) and practicing what you've learned (from the easier problems). Third, they normally provide multiple solutions if there are multiple ways to approach the problems. Even if you got it right, there's always something to learn from how someone else approached it. Maybe your solution won't work next time, but theirs will.\n\nThere are also discussion forums and some games, but I didn't use those very much. Honestly, I mostly used aops through two of my teachers who used their materials on my behalf.\n\nWhich books to get really depends on what your weaknesses are. If you're already amazing at algebra, don't bother with a book on algebra. If you're bad at geometry (like me), that would help most. Taking practice tests can help you figure out your weaknesses.\n\nI did a couple national competitions in middle school, but I can't think of any others in high school. Regional competitions obviously depend on where you are; if you're near Princeton, you should do PUMaC! (I went to Princeton and helped with that a few times.)",
