  "title:": "Should I invite my regional admissions counselor to my birthday party?",
  "text": "Hi all; I think I've just had a stroke of genius.\n\nI haven't received an interview from my ED school yet, but it's really important that the school gets to see me as a human being, rather than grades and an essay. I just designed an online invitation to my birthday party, and I'm thinking I should invite my regional admissions counselor.\n\nSince I didn't get an interview, I think hosting Mr. Admissions Officer at my Excellent Eighteen would provide a plethora of opportunities for him to get to know me:\n\n* I have prepared the following playlist:\n   * \"Two Phones\" by Kevin Gates as a metaphor for my ability to balance my academic and social lives.\n   * \"X Gon' Give It To Ya\" by DMX to warn Mr. Admissions Officer that rejecting my application with an \"X\" would put his well-being in peril.\n   * \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore to highlight my fiscal responsibility and natural potential as an Economics major.\n   * \"F\\*ck Up Some Commas\" by Future to apologize for minor grammatical errors in my supplements.\n   * \"E.T.\" by Katy Perry and Kanye West to indicate my interest in pursuing a minor in Aerospace Engineering.\n* I will serve food and drinks exclusively of the schools colors as an implicit claim that I am a clear fit for the college.\n* I have designed posters to hang in my basement bearing phrases, which clarify that academics are *always* a priority:\n   * \"Less drinking, more thinking.\"\n   * \"No Juuls. Joules only (1 joule = 1kgm\\^2/s\\^2)\"\n   * \"Don't drink and derive.\"\n* I am inviting 6% of my grade to my Excellent Eighteen to make the environment more comfortable for Mr. Admissions Officer, as he tends to invite around 6% of applicants to the school.\n* I will provide some grant-based financial aid for Mr. Admissions Officer's travel expenses to and from my house, if he chooses to fax his 2017 Federal Tax Return and 2017 W-2 forms by November 15th.\n\nDo you guys think this will raise my chances of admissions? Again, I personally think my Excellent Eighteen provides an opportunity for the Office of Admissions to complete their holistic evaluation of my application.",
