  "title:": "Are T20s really \"test-optional\"? SAT got cancelled again and Dec 4th dates is too late.",
  "text": "I was gonna apply ED to a T20 but without an SAT score. I've heard different opinions, basically \"yes it really IS test optional\" and \"no its a PR thing\". So... is it? I'm an intl applying for aid as well.\n\nSome people suggested not applying ED and doing regular instead with the SAT. But I don't really wanna waste my ED - would AOs be unimpressed if I wrote something in the additional information section something like `If I were to be deferred, I would update my application with a test score ASAP`? Feel like they'd be unimpressed for suggesting that they defer me since it's a T20",

You'll have no option left but to apply test optional in the RD cycle - so it might be a better to do so in the early cycle itself, provided the rest of your applications are ready.",
