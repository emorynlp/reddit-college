  "text": "So for my hs i think this upcoming cycle is more competitive than last yr applicants. (More qualified students and more students who applied ED) Would colleges take this into account and so admissions would be more competitive compared to last yr? So would the profile of a person admitted this yr to that school be way better than last yr\u2019s ? Or would colleges accept more ppl from our hs compared to previous yrs since more ppl applied ED and are more qualified?",
