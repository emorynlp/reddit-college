  "title:": "Recommendation Letters - Should I submit more?",
  "text": "Hi! I currently have 5 recommenders, including my counselor, my English teacher (MUN coach, has written successful scholarship recommendations), my literature teacher (has written me recommendations before), my chemistry teacher (has known me and taught me from 7th-12th grade), and my choir director (has known me for 6 years, I was club president under her).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I've just learned that too many recommendations can be a big downfall since they may think I'm compensating. Should I risk putting all of them in? If not, who should I cut out?\n\nFor context, my stats are:\n\nGPA: Roughly 3.9 in 4.0, final Year 11 average was 98.223\n\nRank: No rank, but was given an award for top 10% of around 170\n\nSAT/ACT: None, quarantine hit my country hard. Most tests have been canceled except for home tests.\n\nEC's: Choir President (stayed for a total of 6 years as of now), Club President (Basically I dealt with ALL of the clubs in our school and planned major events), MUN (basic lol, but I did win a few awards), YIRLI, published research work (again, basic), chair of creatives for a reproductive health org, and a bunch of other stuff lmao\n\nSchools: A few IVY's, and overall pretty selective schools. I'm applying to AUS and U.K, so I didn't want to apply for anything I truly didn't want to go to.",

There\u2019s nothing in the other recommendations that hasn\u2019t already been implied elsewhere in your application. One extra recommendation isn\u2019t going to suddenly make them want to admit you.",
