  "title:": "Letter of Recs Confusion",
  "text": "Hey! So I know some schools require letters from core teachers (ex: English, science, and math). I asked my AP seminar teacher for a letter of rec, and since Seminar isn't a CORE class, I'm going to include his rec in the \"other recommender\" part. However, I don't know what category AP Seminar would fall under. Arts teacher? Other? \n\nThanks !",
