  "title:": "Common App: Current or Most Recent Year Courses Question",
  "text": "On the Common App, it asks me to list the classes I am taking for my senior year. I know all of these except for one: an elective I will be taking next semester. I asked my counselor for the name of it, but was told they do not know what it will be called. Does it matter if I do not include this elective on my applications? I won't be able to find out the name of it until January, and that won't be until after I've already applied.",
