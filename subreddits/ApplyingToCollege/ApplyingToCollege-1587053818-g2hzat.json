  "title:": "My high school class is boycotting online classes. This is wrong.",
  "text": "Yesterday, my HS principal sent a blast email saying that the Class of 2020's prom was cancelled, the senior awards would be presented online, the summa cum laude recognition would also be held online, and the final sting: in-person graduation was cancelled. \n\nThis morning, in our senior class Facebook group, several of my peers decided they would organize a \"senior skip day\" for online school to express their disappointment in our administration. Just a few hours ago, another student shared a long, heart-wrenching email that she sent to our district superintendent, which went into detail about her mom who has cancer and won't make it to her college graduation, wedding, etc. The student's high school graduation, which the mom would've been able to attend, was gone. She has poured kerosene to the flames.\n\nI'm mad our graduation is gone, too. I immigrated to the States with my family when I was 8 years old, and for the past three years, I've been telling my single mom that I'd work to deliver a speech in my high school graduation to tell everyone in the stadium about the sacrifices she's made and express just how thankful I am for her. A normal thank you wouldn't convey my gratitude; a thank you in front of thousands of people, however, could. I also wanted to celebrate how much I've grown as an individual, and thank my friends who were there for me when I ran away from home, encountered a period of depression, etc. Only a proper thank you in front of thousands could express my gratitude.\n\nNo matter how disappointed I am at the news of my graduation's cancellation, I do not doubt for a second the decision that my district administration made. What if just one person--out of the thousands that would attend the gathering--brought the coronavirus? Dozens--if not more--would catch it. What if the girl, whose mom has cancer, acquires the virus and brings it home with her? What will happen to her mother with breast cancer? To the girl: I understand your heartbreak, but what would your mom do? I hope she would choose to protect the lives of hundreds, including hers, at the sacrifice of an monumental experience--a choice that I consider heroic and wise.\n\nAll it takes is one--one out of thousands--to put the lives of dozens in danger. What if all--no, just a few hundred--of the high schools across the US hosted graduations? The physical, economic damage will be unimaginable. We seniors might not even have the fall semester of college. Do we need the spring semester off as well?\n\nNow, I stay home to protect my 50-year-old mom. This is how I express my gratitude for her. I haven't seen a single person outside my family for the past few weeks in order to protect my family. Most of the students here have parents who are aged 50 or older, and let's protect them by staying home. \n\nRant over.",

It really would not be safe for her immunocompromised mother. It really is unfortunate that graduation is canceled but it is for the safety of everyone involved, not malicious I don't think. \n\nAnd you're attitude towards this situation is very mature, good luck with everything!",

I'm incredibly hurt and angry about all that I've lost this year (angry at the universe, not at the people who made the decisions; I do recognize that it was the right call) and college is the only thing I have left to look forwards to. If that gets taken away I don't think I'll even have the motivation to get out of bed anymore.",

Especially because the beginning of one's freshman year in college is an entire cultural tradition that has existed for generations, and we've been robbed of it.",

It's the same with college. I genuinely enjoy school and learning and I'm really excited to go off and learn, but I also am looking forwards to the experience of it. I want to move to a new state and meet new people and try new things. Which wouldn't happen with online classes. \n\nI'm not really sure why you think you know me or my feelings or assume that you get to decide what is and isn't a big deal or that I don't have a life worth living.

The person was putting blame on the authoritative personnel who made the decision to keep them safe, when they could have had prom and taken money from the kids instead. I have seen so many posts on social media where seniors are complaining about losing prom. While this is sad, the way some of these kids go about expressing their emotions is, to say the least, scary. A lot of these kids are trying to make this tragic time all about themselves, taking away from those actually affected by the virus. They are the future of our world, and somehow aren\u2019t able to look at the bigger picture. As a fellow teen, I find this very unsettling, hence my comment. Also, there are a lot of people that are being affected by the virus indirectly to a greater extent, that I don\u2019t see complaining as much as you guys. Example 1: people with mental health are being cut of from their professional advisors. Example 2: A multitude of people are losing their jobs. Not to mention, the other examples that you already gave. This form of self pity showcased by our high school seniors is absolutely disgusting. It\u2019s okay to be upset, not entitled.",

Once you start college a lot of people find it weird to keep talking about the things you did in high school and a lot of kids might find the event embarrassing to go to.",

If some can attend and others can't, it certainly wouldn't be fair to those who can't make it, and they will feel like they are missing out on an incredibly important occasion. The best time to hold a graduation, with everyone in attendance, is in June, but nobody can make that promise because the lockdown may still be in effect.\n\nSo basically, the only fair, inclusive, and practical method as of now is an online graduation, even if it doesn't look like it.
