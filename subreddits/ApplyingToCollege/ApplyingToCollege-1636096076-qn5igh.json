  "text": "So my AS exams (US grade 11) got cancelled in my country and I'm currently appearing in them, and will receive the results in January. A2 exams are in May 2022 ( US grade 12). On the SRAR, it doesn't allow you to put 2 years as 'In Progress'. I do have predicted grades for both of them. Should I choose In Progress for Grade 11 and provide my predicted scores for Grade 12?",
