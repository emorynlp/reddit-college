  "text": "So I didn\u2019t realize it will take College Board a while to actually send my SAT scores to my schools (huge mistake on my part\u2026). I JUST made the request to submit my scores to some of the colleges I\u2019m applying to but I want to do EA. If I submit my Common App now to the schools I want to EA to, will they get my test scores?",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. \n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. Many allow a grace period for receiving additional items like score reports.",
