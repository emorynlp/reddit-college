  "text": "okay, so I'm apparently dumb as hell and didn't realize that UT Austin doesn't accept self-reporting. I should've known it filling in ApplyTexas and there was no tab to write in the actual score. Okay I'm dumb and stupid and realizing this every second. Anyways, I just paid 13 dollars and had it sent. Should I have sent it on rush? will they receive my score before 11/1 (priority deadline)? If my other early schools didn't accept self-reporting I would've known, but they're all on the common app and I just had no idea...",

I assume it takes even longer for the normal send or whatever it's called.\n\nHowever, you could email the AO to explain your situation.",
