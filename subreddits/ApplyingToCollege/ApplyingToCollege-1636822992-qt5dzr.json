      "text": "I'm a Freshman at NYU Tisch (Film) this year, so I know where you're coming from. \n\nFirst, relax and be yourself. Don't second guess your essays or choices. Of course, proof read your work and have others look it over to spot grammar errors and spelling mistakes, but don't be afraid to just do it. \n\nBe organized. There are a lot of components. I don't know if this year is the same but last year there were 7 big things:\n\n1) Common App Essay; 2) Short Story; 3)Resume; 4) Carry On Essay; 5) Tell us about your-selfie Video; 6) Short Film; 7) Common App Supplement \"Why NYU?\"\n\nNot to mention the Common App itself. And the Slide Room application. It can feel overwhelming, but every year a lot of people just like us manage to get through it. You can too. Just take each piece, one step at a time and know that you will get through it.\n\nOne big suggestion, go through the Common App and Slide Room from beginning to end. Don't worry about filling it out as you go - you can come back to sections you skip. It's important to know how much there is in it and pace yourself accordingly. \n\nAllow time to upload your videos. Uploading on the last day risks crashing or lag times. \n\nGood luck!",
