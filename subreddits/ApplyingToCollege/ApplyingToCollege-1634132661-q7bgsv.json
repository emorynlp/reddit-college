  "text": "For my personal essay I want to write about how hard junior year was for me because of all the pressure and stress I was putting on myself to get A\u2019s in my advanced classes and keep my class rank where it was, and how I realized that the stress I was putting on myself was unhealthy and I needed to figure out how to calm myself down and not put so much pressure on myself to get those good grades. Any Feedback is greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude01",

Since it can mean that you can\u2019t handle college and the stress that comes with it. Colleges want you to take those advanced classes because it replicates the college experience.",

I could handle the courses and I did good in them, I just needed to figure out how to keep myself from becoming too stressed",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the ~strongest~ topic; however, if it\u2019s truly what you want to write about, you can make it work. It defiantly doesn\u2019t shed you/your abilities in a positive light, so be careful on how you phrase things. It\u2019s a cliche topic and AO\u2019s see this a lot, so you\u2019ll need something else to make you stand out. Not the mention your class rank and classes are already reflected on your transcript, so AO\u2019s will infer you had a heavy load and were able to maintain it.",
