  "title:": "Do colleges look down on me if I took a class called \"Automotive Technology 1 DE\" in senior yr? It's a more trade/technical career-oriented class, which I've heard severely damages your application (e.g 60% less chance). However, it's a DE class through a local CC that carries a +1 gpa boost. thx!",
