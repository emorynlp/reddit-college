  "text": "Edit: My advisor reassured me that everything is ok. Also, that I wasn\u2019t admitted because of that society/button. We both agree it was a bit premature *and*, at the same time, that the situation was a strange one, with a lot of moving variables.\n\nI appreciate everyone\u2019s advice!\n\n\u2014\n\nI\u2019m a pretty neurotic person, so I\u2019m probably getting carried away. I know the mind likes to steal joy.\n\nSituation: The other day I was accepted to the Uni of my dreams. I\u2019m an older Community College transfer student; I\u2019ve worked hard to get top grades, build a solid resume (with professional experience in my major) and am involved in the community/student leadership.\n\nThe application asked for if I\u2019m a member of a certain national honor society. I thought I would be and discussed with a counselor. Since I\u2019m a \u201csecond chance\u201d student (basically bad grades from 10 years ago are ignored at transfer), I later found out I wouldn\u2019t qualify.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, but. Could they or would they revoke my admission since I had checked \u201cyes\u201d only to find out the answer is \u201cno\u201d? Mainly, it\u2019s making me feel like I didn\u2019t earn my admission, even though I worked hard for it.",
