  "text": "Adding on to my previous post, I\u2019ve just found out about rolling admission. If some of my schools have rolling admission, are my chances better if I submit my application for Early action or rolling admission? For instance, ASU has EA Dec 1st and Rolling Admission Jan 24th. I\u2019m going to try to get my application in as soon as possible, but I\u2019m wondering which deadline is better. Or does it not matter? All help would be appreciated",

      "text": "Earlier is generally better for schools that have rolling admissions.\n\nAt ASU this is less important for general admission - if you meet their listed admissions requirements you should get in.  But there may be things like scholarships, the honors program, or specific majors where the spots get filled in the order they receive qualified applicants for them.",
