  "text": "This is going to be a long ride, so buckle up, cadets. I'm mostly too embarrassed to rant about this on my finsta and it's just a huge ball of stress my friends don't deserve to hear nor have to hear during the last 72 hours of ED/EA deadlines. I'm ranting here because it's an outlet and I'm pretty sure that people would skip right over it. \n\nI'm just really, incredibly angry, upset, and hurt right now. For context, I'm a senior who lives in a competitive area and I'm balancing gazillion AP classes, dual enrollment courses, extra-curriculars, etc. But I enjoy doing this. I'm a bit of a workaholic and it's my escape \u2014 burning myself out lol \u2014 so as much as I complain, I wouldn't really change a thing. (Yes, it's unhealthy and toxic, I know.) My parents push me a lot. They have high expectations for me as their oldest, and I'm my grandparents' favorite grandchild for a myriad of reasons so I have this really unrelenting sense of pressure to get into a good college. \n\nThey're always like \"take a break\" or \"don't push yourself too hard\" and deny that they're tiger parents but I would say that their attitude is worse. At least tiger parents know that they're demanding a lot and self-aware but my parents aren't and are always in denial that they do this. It's in the way they constantly compare me with a family friend or say that they're unsatisfied with my SAT score or control my life by preventing me from seeing friends or not getting me a phone or cutting off my access to wifi when I need to do homework or not having a room at all. I probably need family therapy at this point lol\n\nI used to be best friends with my parents. I would tell them EVERYTHING about my life. I still do but I'm forced to lie about a lot of things because I know how they would react. Sometimes they'd catch me in my lie because I'm a horrible liar and I know lying is bad but they force me to lie about certain things. Like I have mental breakdowns and panic attacks often at school now. There's a lot of pressure that's crashing down and I have to go to the office often to meet with the wellness counselor. It marks me as absent in my classes and they hound me about my attendance and I lie and say that it's my guidance counselor that's calling me in. If they found out that I was going to the wellness counselor instead, I don't know what would happen. \n\nNowadays, they're so emotionally distant and I just realize how they've never been super affectionate people. I need physical and verbal affection, that's who I am. I communicated this to them before and they just ignore me and explode on me when I break down at home. Like I've been sharing my progress during this application process with my family but they're always ignoring me and not caring. \n\nI've asked them SO MANY times to read my essays, or go over my accomplishments to show what I've achieved so far despite them being convinced I'm a \"lazy ass\" but they're only NOW read it, 3 days before the deadline because I said I was submitting it. \"It's unique, but it could use some more work. Why are you always leaving things til the last minute?!?!\"\n\nNo, YOU are leaving things til the last minute. I admit, I am a procrastinator. But never have I ONCE procrastinated on this application process no matter how many times I felt frustrated or angry at you or myself. They're telling me NOW criticism about my essay when I was done and happy with them. I can hear them cursing me out under their breaths right now. No matter the fact or the figures, I am always the \"lazy\" one out of their two daughters. I'm sick.",

The hardest part is actually doing the activities etc and you did that whole part already.",

      "text": "Just want to give you a virtual mom hug and say it will all be ok no matter how this goes. You sound like an amazing person who will be successful no matter where you go to college. Please take a bit of time to prioritize your health. Eat regular healthy meals. Get 8 hours of sleep. And confide in someone (maybe your real mom) how stressful all this is. They probably don\u2019t understand and you\u2019ve been acting so tough. I\u2019m sure they love and want to protect you even if they are grumbling. I want my kids to be successful and adore them even though I wish my daughter had started the grad school application she is working on last month. But we both know if this one doesn\u2019t work out there\u2019s a plan B. And C and D and E. It\u2019s ok not to excel at everything you try.",
