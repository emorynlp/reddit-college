Sit with good posture and act as nice and as personable as you can. \n4. Go into it with the mindset of \" I got this in the bag already.\" But also know in the back of your mind the worst thing they can say is no.",

It's very important that alumni interviewers help create a positive impression for Princeton, so I doubt there is too much to freak out about - you won't get any trick questions and there's no 'fail'. If you don't leave with a good feeling about the conversation, then that interviewer should have done more to put you at ease.  It's gonna be fine - just schedule it and get it over with. Good luck.",
