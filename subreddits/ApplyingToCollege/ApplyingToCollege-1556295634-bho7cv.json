There are fathers and mothers of elementary school children browsing here, trying to pick up tips as they push their kids down a life path that they might not even want.\n\nThis is helicopter parenting and it is toxic. Allow your kid to discover this subreddit and apply to top schools by themselves, and don't force them to apply somewhere they don't want to be. It's good to help, and this criticism doesn't apply to all of you, but please for the love of god stop being a tiger parent. It'll only mess up your child later on.",

They\u2019d have done well being pushed down the path of law or business or whatever.  Also first and second gen immigrant families (my husbands) so we see that shift often by third and fourth generation where everyone becomes a bit more comfortable off the path.",

My son's brother is diverging the short distance to *dentistry* at his mother's suggestion because she hates how her practice requires so much negotiation with health insurance companies.\n\n> those kids who go to med school because their parents pushed them are path followers. \n\nI don't know what path followers are, aside from what I divine from your post.

We\u2019re shaming helicopter parenting here, because that is a toxic amount of pressure that some of us have seen people go through. \n\nI\u2019m first-gen and was helicopter parented in elementary school. My immigrant parents had high expectations (straight A\u2019s, SAT prep, Ivy League, medical school, etc). I had a bit of a mental break in my sophomore year that exploded with my frustration towards my life being taken up with isolation and test prep books. I pushed my parents away, which was very disrespectful for my culture. The self-management I learned in place allowed me to become a partner to my parents rather than an adversary. \n\nFirst-gen kids have it rough, but desperate adults are in a position of power to manipulate a kid\u2019s life, where misinformation can be damaging. It might make you feel good that you\u2019re doing everything possible to \u201chelp\u201d your child, but without a critical eye you might just harp on old/outdated advice like assuming viewing an admitted student\u2019s profile would help mold a future in highly selective college admission. \n\nI get people asking me now \u201cso why do you think you got in?\u201d with many assuming things about race, sex, and affirmative action in place of actual achievements, which is damaging to post-applicants willing to share help. I got brushed off by a parent because I wasn\u2019t an Asian male in CS,  the profile of her son. Sure that\u2019s an extreme example, but whether it\u2019s assumed implicitly or explicitly, there usually isn\u2019t a good motivation to view other profiles. Other companies even profit off of this curiosity by collecting profiles and selling subscriptions to anxious applicants and their parents. I get the curiosity, but please stop this culture if it\u2019s going to reduce students down to lazy stereotyping.\n\nMy life is now also filled with people picking out my application and flaws because I decided to share this information. Going through a public school with a lot of helicopter parents aiming for selective admissions, you begin to hear people whispering about your test scores or confronting you about how much you didn\u2019t deserve it or something because they\u2019ve seen your personal profile. Magnify that by your profile being spread around by means of the internet or gossip, attached to your name or username, and you have a recipe for harassment. If you\u2019ve crafted your application in a personal way, it\u2019s a soul-bearing point of vulnerability. Surely you can understand the reservation that post-applicants may have with being bothered by someone picking apart their profile?",

Parents, if you're watching, please look at other schools, and dont have a ranking of pride based on them. Just because your Aunt does not know it does not mean its not good. Hell, people only know Harvard and Stanford from movies, imagine how well known idk Grinnell would be if Good Will Hunting was set there.\n\nSecondly, how are students, regardless of college, supposed to know why they got in? Yes, they could look at what admissions people said and get the application review back (you actually can under FERPA, if you ask they have to comply if you were admitted), but we have no idea regarding overall statistics, what made us stand out compared to others, etc. We dont know, and unless you plan to copy the accepted students lives EXACTLY I dont know what good itll do you. \n\nAlso, PS, if you do copy, it probably wont work because standards get harder over time",

She ended up doing fine in relative terms (still went to a decent college, got an average college grad job) but it definitely doesn't work with everyone and it just made my sister resent our parents back then. They were the typical \"Fresh off the Boat\" Asian parents who got all their information from other Asian parents, so they really thought that your future was dependent on going to Harvard or Yale.\n\nIt honestly annoys me when I hear of parents doing this. At least with my high school, most of the people who went to top schools weren't helicopter parented by their parents. A few were, but the fact that at least half weren't just shows that the stress and inevitable resentment is unnecessary.",

          "text": "> My parents never encouraged me to reach for top schools. \n\nSame for me. I'd be surprised if they ever *heard* of the Ivy League. It certainly never game up.\n\nFor me, it was a friend's suggestion.\n\nI had finished my undergrad degree at Michigan and was working for a year. Thinking of public policy grad school, I studied for the GREs and did well. When my friend heard my scores, he said \"You're going to apply to the Kennedy School (at Harvard) right?\" Like that was an obvious thing to do.\n\nI wouldn't have thought of that in a million years. I had my eye on Michigan's public policy master's program, or maybe the LBJ School at the University of Texas - Austin. I couldn't imagine *me* being Harvard material. My faint acquaintance with the Ivy League was from some J.D. Salinger books.\n\nFor my friend, though, my applying to the Harvard program was an obvious no-brainer. The difference was that his *grandfather* was a Harvard PhD, his father was a Harvard PhD, and my friend was at Harvard starting *his* PhD program. \n\nIn contrast, my father dropped out of high school at age 16 to go to work at the steel plant. My Mom graduated from her tiny town's high school, the valedictorian of a class of 7 students.\n\nI was stunned when Harvard took me. \"Why the hell would Harvard send me a *thick* envelope?\"\n\nFamily history has an effect. I have a 12-year-old son whose Dad went to Harvard. He has taken on that ambition despite my active *discouragement*. \"It's really tough to get in; Harvard accepts only a very small percentage of the best-of-the-best who apply.\" He is also penciling in MIT; his best friend's mother graduated from MIT and teaches there. \n\nBased on what I've seen of those who manage to get into Harvard or MIT *nowadays*, I don't think my son has even a remote chance. OP's stats are *incredible*. My son is a good kid but he isn't *amazing* like OP.\n\nYou don't have to be Harvard material to glean good stuff from this sub, though. I'm here picking up what I can, to help my son prepare to get into as good a school as he can get into. I'll be happy if it's one of our better state colleges. At this early stage, all I'm doing is encouraging him to read a couple hours a day and making sure he has a ready supply of books he enjoys. And pausing the anime we're watching so I can define just-spoken words for his edification.",

My focus with my 12-year-old is on getting him to read a lot, which I don't do by fiat but by explaining how that will help him and by providing him books he enjoys reading.\n\nKids are kids.

All I'm doing now is encouraging my son to read more -- which so far *no one* has reproached me for, IIRC.\n\n> You seem to assume that teenagers have no desires to pursue anything other than slacking off (which is not true).\n\nI haven't expressed that opinion. My 12-year-old (not yet a teenager) would watch anime for 8 hours a day if I let him. Do you think I should?\n\n> If your 12 year old doesn\u2019t know what to do, give him time to find himself.\n\nI really don't comprehend how a high school kid is supposed to do that.\n\nI guess you have to pick a major when you apply to college. Is that true?\n\n(1) What percent of college freshman *graduate* with that major, would you say?\n\n(2) What percent of people who *graduate* with the major they selected in high school end up *working* in that field?\n\nWhat's your guess? Mine, having spent way too long in college and graduate school and having had a 40-year career and watched my friends' careers -- is (1) maybe a bare majority and (2) a minority, esp. if their major isn't engineering, medicine or similar. \n\nA high school kid reads an article or talks to his friend Tony's father or watches a documentary on youtube and says \"I wanna be X\"! That kid will almost certainly change his mind, because of *reality*.\n\nIt's a wide world out there, with thousands of careers you've never even *heard* of, and new ones being invented every day. How is a 17-year-old supposed to pick intelligently?\n\n**I would bet that a large majority of those who end up working in their field, *chose* that field because their parents encouraged them to, and/or they saw their parents working in that field.** My son in medical school has a physician mother, for example.\n\n> Why are you berating u/etymologynerd because of his major choice.\n\nWell maybe a little bit (even though this is immature) because he berated me -- nonsensically, as far as I could tell. What I was doing was good, but was not good. Huh?\n\nBecause mostly because etymology is an incredibly narrow field that will not lead to a successful career -- IMO. Do I *know* that? No. I could be totally wrong. If I had to bet, though, that would be my bet, and I would give good odds. Am I evil for suggesting to someone that they rethink what they're doing? I suggested that he ask people wrapping up their PhDs about their job search. *That is valuable advice.*\n\nWhen my 12-year-old was in pre-school our location near the medical area (Boston) led to our getting to know a number of post-docs doing research at Harvard med or the like. For these guys, the post-doc was a way to make a *little* money while adding a *little* to their credentials in the hope that they would get a *real* job teaching someplace. Academic teaching is an over-crowded field, with a huge number of adjuncts making shit money. My nephew's wife has four adjunct jobs teaching art history in NYC. It's not lucrative, and she spends half her life commuting between schools.\n\n> Please support your son\u2019s decisions, and don\u2019t pressure him for something else. \n\nWhen you bright, hard-working organized son comes to you and says that he wants to spend $200K studying early childhood education and then get a job in a day-care center -- you'll be super-supportive, right?\n\nIf you are, then you'll be a failure as a parent, in my opinion. Plan on supporting that kid for the rest of your life.",

Even if she did the work, there's no reason to think that her parents' pressuring her wasn't at least partly the reason for her success. It would have made her work harder, right?\n\n> Another thing is that if I had a son/daughter who wanted to study early childhood education, I\u2019d fully support them.

You only live once, why do something you hate?\n\nThe problem is a high school kid who hasn't had to make a mortgage payment may place too little importance on making a decent living -- and thus might think that working in a day care center would be great. I'd probably enjoy the work; little kids are the best. It's minimum wage work, though.\n\nYour child age 40 sharing an apartment with three other economically-impaired people will *not* feel happy, even if job satisfaction is great. Money matters. Your kid wants to own a home. A car! My friends who succumbed to parental pressure and became physicians and perhaps wistfully wish they could have pursued fine arts like they wanted to -- take comfort from their large homes and nice cars and their ability to send their children to fine schools -- and they do oil-painting on weekends at the beach that's walking distance from their summer home.\n\n> Now imagine this scenario, say that your son wants to do Design (ArT? oH tHe HoRrOr!) and he feels like it\u2019s his calling/passion. Would you support him? Or would you push for a more \u201cviable\u201d job.\n\nDefinitely the latter.\n\nDo you know how to kill a passion? *Do it for a living*. \n\nMy brother-in-law did fine arts in college and after graduating found himself surprisingly successful from the get go. It turned out his art was beloved by people decorating corporate offices. One might buy every work he had at the gallery. He accidentally got himself in the art *manufacture* business. The gallery owner said \"They like the pastels best, and the geometric patterns more than the free-form.\" So he quit and went back to school to become (honest to God fact) a *petroleum engineer* -- because he knew there were job opportunities in that field. Last I heard, he was in China working for Shell. He does art on his own time at home.\n\n> You didn\u2019t helpfully offer advice to him though, you taunted him, telling him that the only job he would get would be at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nOh, maybe the advice was slightly subtle. The implication of the McDonalds remark was that he would find there are few professional opportunities as an etymologist. Surely that's helpful?!\n\nThis can be over-stated -- but college is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don't blow it by choosing to study the wrong subject. \n\nMy step-daughter went to a small liberal arts school and studied *dance*. Let me tell you *in detail* all the things she has done with her degree in dance:",

The application process is mainly about your experiences in highschool. Colleges will not consider whatever you did before highschool as an extracurricular.

In my opinion, this is not what Boy Scouts should be about. It\u2019s meant to be an organization where young boys(and now girls, too!) can learn about the world around them as they mature. I believe that Eagle should be awarded when a scout has truly matured through their time in the troop, and I don\u2019t think that a 14 year old has reached maturity of any kind. Although you might argue that a 17 year old is not that much more mature, they probably have better time management skills from high school, some degree of financial literacy from a first job, and a general idea of what they want to do in for a living. Those are some of the checkpoints, in my mind, where a boy or girl begins to become a man or woman, and they are ready to graduate from Scouts.\n\nThose scouts that I mentioned earlier who got Eagle before sophomore year were, more often than not, immature, unmotivated, and occasionally downright spoiled, having been pushed through a troop that just tries to pump out as many Eagles as possible. In many cases, their parents did their Eagle projects for them. In comparison, Eagle scouts from troops that deliberately made it more difficult to Eagle until age 17 were often more responsible, respectful, and mature. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that, if your son obtains Eagle in 9th grade, he will be irresponsible, rude, or immature. I\u2019m simply saying that he will not have taken advantage of the full extent of what Scouting has to offer. He may lack skills that he would have learned, had he taken his time in the organization.\n\nFor these reasons, I implore you, don\u2019t rush him out of Scouts. In addition to learning these valuable life lessons, he would most likely have a lot of fun and make lasting friendships during high school. After all, as an Eagle Scout myself, I would know.",

I have little interest in math, and the class I was in had no fun or friends to distract me from the horrible class I was in. Also, the teacher was sexist to me, treating the only boy like the pig in the class while all the bright girls took all the problems. It wasn\u2019t directly my parents\u2019 fault, but their pushing me to my limits so early on stressed me out immensely.

I love to sing, dance and act, so my parents let me do that on my own. They didn\u2019t encourage me to do sports, they just let me decide on my own. I tried soccer, basketball, and golf out, and they never *made* me do any of it like tiger parents tend to do to impress colleges. \n\nI do, of course, believe in parent encouragement, but not to the point of doing it for college. This is mostly due to the stressing out it tends to cause and also because very few parents actually know what colleges actually want. If I told some tiger parents that their kid should get a part time job, they\u2019d laugh in my face. Instead, they\u2019d want them to play violin, piano, tennis, and spend thousands of dollars at a college summer camp. While I\u2019m not saying these extracurriculars are bad (except the summer camp one, never do this), they are repetitive and boring to admissions officers. Differentiation is wonderful. That\u2019s another reason lots of kids don\u2019t encourage giving out their common app essays. Even if you copy a Stanford-admitted essay word for word if it applies to you, one\u2019s chances of admission are still up to luck. \n\nMy advice is to encourage your son to try new things, but don\u2019t stress them into it.
