  "text": "This shit is actually fucked up. These kids were just like us, dealing with high school stress, applying to college, and trying to trudge through teenage life. Just like every one of us, they were waiting for that 3:30 bell to ring so they could finally leave that boring english class or rush home to study for the next day's physics quiz. Instead, they were met with gunshots, sirens, and blood. A moment of silence and/or prayers please. ",

Back when it happened, I was a 7th grader, and I guess it was just back then when nothing and everything seemed like a big deal that I didn't really feel much about it. Maybe a superficial pang occasional pang of fear or something. Since Sandy Hook, there have been countless shootings, and though I've always been able to imagine the sufferings that these communities go through, the understanding has still been somewhat ephemeral. Yesterday though, I was reading about what happened and for the first time, I genuinely felt scared about going to school today. I'm not sure what was different, maybe the fact that everybody knew the shooter, I really don't know. Maybe it's just crossed that threshold of the frequency of occurrence for these kind of events that my brain has basically switched from is it going to happen to when. It barely lasted 15 mins before I moved on, but I don't know. Just sharing this cause it just felt different this time.",
