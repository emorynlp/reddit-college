  "text": "I want to ED UChicago. Even though my very long odds (1-2%) I'm scared of the financial costs. It's stupid expensive, and if I get in, I probably wont get any scholarship. I love the school extremely, and really want to go because of Molecular Engineering program, but is the cost really worth it. I feel like I'm just second guessing myself since the deadline is coming  up, but I'm scared of student loans debt. UIUC has a very good physics program too, and I probably will a scholarship if I go. \n\nAny advice for a scared hs Senior.",

That's what will matter most, tbh.  Take the money, go to UIUC, and do the kinds of things you need to do to make yourself a plus candidate for graduate admissions committees.",

Honestly, even if Chicago were at UIUC's level, it would not be worth the extra money in-state; however, Chicago's program is not even at that level. Furthermore, engineers are treated very well at UIUC and employers flock there.\n\nGo to UIUC and never look back. Talk to some UIUC ChemE alumni if you are uncertain: all the ones I know loved UIUC, are enthusiastic alumni, and are in great jobs.",

No surprise on the former; lots of work with Fermilab (and Argonne for imaging: APS is a bright light).",
