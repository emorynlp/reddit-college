  "text": "I'm an international student applying for a CS Major and one of my major ECs is music, considering I've been doing it for over a decade. I don't plan on studying music or even anything remotely not STEM oriented but I've recently released my own music. It's been a month, I have like 20K streams on my song (50+ cities, 25+ countries) which obviously isn't a lot, but I put a lot of time and effort into production and recording so I'm not sure if I should include it?",
