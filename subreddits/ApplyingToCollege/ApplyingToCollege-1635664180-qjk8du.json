  "text": "I know it's mostly the super high ranked schools that give good aid, but there has to be others right? I know Syracuse gives good aid, even if they aren't super selective like the T20s. Thats not to say Syracuse U is a bad school, but I mean, there has to be others that give great aid without being ultra selective type schools right?\n\nPS: Im a **US CITIZEN** living abroad. Whenever I make post like this people always assume im international even though I almost always state that im a US citizen.",

      "text": "Lots of liberal arts colleges.  The \"colleges that change lives\" list would be a good place to look for ones that might be around the same selectivity as Syracuse - many would be less selective.\n\nPretty much every school involved in questbridge can give really good aid too, even if you aren't applying through questbridge.  Generally those schools would be more selective though.",

      "text": "Just FYI that Colleges That Change Lives is a book that schools paid to be in. It can be a good place to start as there are many great liberal arts schools listed, but it is biased.\n\nI recommend looking at smaller liberal arts schools. Apply to a couple where you are on the higher end of their stats (70 percentile for ACT, so test score wise you are \u201cdesirable\u201d but there will still be rigor). You likely want regional schools.\n\nAlso look up need-aware schools. Those are not completely need-blind but they commit themselves to doing their best to provide solid aid packages.",
