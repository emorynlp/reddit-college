  "text": "I want to pursue B.S. in Mathematics in Canada. I am an international applicant and also this will be my second degree bachelors as I am currently in my final year of Bachelors (Computer Science).\n\nMy high school average is 91% and gpa in college is 8.0 (on scale of 10.0). I have a few questions, please help!\n\n1. Can I apply only using high school percentage and not mentioning my current bachelors?\n2. Will having a bachelors already have a negative impact on my application?\n3. Which colleges should I apply to? Do I even have any chance of getting a good college?",
