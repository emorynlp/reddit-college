  "text": "I want to pursue B.S. in Mathematics in Canada. I am an international applicant and also this will be my second degree bachelors as I am currently in my final year of Bachelors (Computer Science).\n\nMy high school average is 91% and gpa in college is 8.0 (on scale of 10.0). I have a few questions, please help!\n\n1. Can I apply only using high school percentage and not mentioning my current bachelors?\n2. Will having a bachelors already have a negative impact on my application?\n3. Which colleges should I apply to? Do I even have any chance of getting a good college?",

          "text": "Because I want to pursue academia in pure mathematics and my first degree has not much in common with that field (I know its too early to say if I would want to do a Ph.D. in future, but I really like mathematics). I have talked to some profs, they say bachelors is better if I really want to go all in and have all the basics first rather than jumping to intense courses masters have. I don't care about two extra years wasted, money wasted or jobs.",
