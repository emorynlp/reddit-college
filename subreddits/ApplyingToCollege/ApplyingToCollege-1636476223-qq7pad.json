  "text": "Im a junior in Highschool. Ive been thinking about going to an art college, or a college with a good art program. It would be really nice to go somewhere like ringling or full sail, but it would cost an arm and a leg. I was thinking about going to a state school and going for the bright futures scholarship to help me pay for it. Any suggestions as to what colleges I should check out?",
