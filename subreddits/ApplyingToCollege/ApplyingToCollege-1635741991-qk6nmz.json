  "text": " okay i ... feel like this is so dumb but. i have an extracurricular that starts later this week, but like i've already been accepted as a member (theater haha), and it's an extracurricular i've been doing since 9th. so i checked off 12th on my app (because, like... i'm starting it this week????), and i emailed my teacher to ask if she could tell me role a day early so i could mark off whether or not im a lead role (didnt tell her the second part, just asked for my role). and she was like, \"we still havent had our first meeting so you cant claim membership for your application.\" um.....?????????????????????????????????",
