  "title:": "Getting Admitted to College where HS doesn't offer AP or GPA",
  "text": "Long story short, I attend a small private school that does not offer AP Classes(Substituted with 'Advanced Classes') nor a GPA(Reports are narrative). Since I'm very focused on the top 20 schools I've self-studied for some AP classes in addition to my school workload, however I am concerned that having less APs, no GPA, and no AP Classes might affect admission. So far, I have taken AP Bio, Stat, CSA, and currently taking Calc BC, and both Physics C's. How might this look from an AO's point of view? I also can't do EC's due to Steven Johnson's so my immune system nukes itself if I get covid.",
