Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for these colleges, order official reports right now.\n\nFor AP, self-report in the Common App. (With the exception of Georgetown, which doesn't use Common App and requires an official report prior to admission).\n\nFor TOEFL, see what score reporting methods your colleges accept.",
