  "title:": "Can mentioning negative things about my sister, who attends the school I\u2019m applying to, be detrimental to her? Will they cross reference info they have from her against my app?",
  "text": "Basically, she\u2019s not been a good person. Is getting better, but has been a detriment to my grades since I have to spend a lot of time at home cleaning up after her and keeping her sane. (Suspected bipolar personality disorder and known OCD, along with a chronic pain disorder which leads to frustration which leads to outbursts) \n\nI\u2019m certain information on her apps or correspondences won\u2019t align with reality, since lying is fairly common for her and she applied at a time when our relationship was even more strenuous than it is now. \n\nI\u2019d like to discuss my increased family responsibilities due to her, but don\u2019t want to risk her knowing what I wrote or facing consequences at school (she has had a rough time and used some excuses to get leniency, but idk what those excuses were so I might unintentionally contradict them)\n\nAny advice? Is this something I should be worried about?",

I hope to live in the dorms or with roommates though, while she prefers to stay home, and she\u2019s studying humanities while I\u2019m studying engineering, so our paths won\u2019t cross often enough that we\u2019ll get on each other\u2019s nerves.

So back to your application\u2014I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend writing anything negative about a family member. Is there a way to talk about your increased family responsibilities in a positive way, as in how you\u2019ve grown or matured by helping your \u201cfamily\u201d out? You don\u2019t even need to explain fully the situation, but rather how it\u2019s impacted you in profound ways. Look for the silver lining here. How are you a better person having overcome this adversity?? Has this changed your goals? What have you learned?? I don\u2019t know if these questions apply to your situation, but there may be a way for you to write a great essay without mentioning her at all. Good luck!",

I am not controlling my tone here since it is unnecessary.\n\nI consider it useful information to include, since I don\u2019t have any other reasonable way to explain why I do chores 2-3 hours per weekday without lying or sounding like I\u2019m exaggerating, and that time commitment is the reason I am lacking in the extracurricular department relative to my peers.\n\nHer medical bills are also the reason I need to request extra financial aid.\n\nThe above reasons are, obviously, not worthy of sacrificing her college career, hence my wanting to ensure she won\u2019t be damaged by what I might disclose.",
