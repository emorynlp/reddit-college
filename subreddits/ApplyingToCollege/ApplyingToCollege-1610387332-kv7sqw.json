  "title:": "I farted during my Dartmouth interview and tried joking about it after",
  "text": "Exactly what the title says. \n\nI would make a throwaway for this story but I'm too lazy. Just don't dox me or something please. It's been a difficult enough week already.\n\nThis past Saturday I knew I had my interview scheduled for 6PM. I had written it down time after time, and had planned out my day very carefully as a result. I was going to get lunch with my mom at noon and eat a big bean burrito, so i would have ample time between eating and my interview to get out all my gases beforehand. Just as we were finishing our burritos, my mom asked if I was sure that it was at 6PM. I said yes, but then I thought for a bit. I remembered that Dartmouth was in New Hampshire, and that I wasn't 100% sure that they specified that it was 6PM PST (where I am), but that I just assumed that it would be at my time. I checked my e-mail and saw, right there in big bold lettering: 6PM **EST**. \n\nMy heart dropped. \n\nWe rushed home and I spent the next two hours before the interview hunched over the toilet trying to rush the process, but to no avail. I eventually had to clean up and get ready for the Zoom call and just pray that nothing was bad was going to happen. \n\nAs soon as he asked the first question, I felt the gas building up in me. Then the second, followed by the third. Pressure building in my intestines, begging to be released. I continues to clench. The interview was actually going well, and through all the stress I was feeling confident about my odds of getting in. However, getting close to the end of the interview, I knew that I would have to confront the inevitable. I was about to burst.\n\nI knew I had to let the fart loose and sprung to mute myself, but in a panicked rush I just ended up unplugging my headphones (as if that would do anything). I released the fart, it was the loudest one I've had in years. It sounded like a wet jackhammer, and continued for 6-7 seconds but felt like a lifetime. While I wasn't able to hear his reaction, I could tell by his change in facial expression that he was disgusted by my excessive flatulence. \n\nI saw how red my face was, and he could definitely see it too. My eyes were watering from the combined embarrassment and smell of my spicy gas.\n\nIn an attempt to save face, I quickly plugged my headphones back in and leaned into the mic and said \"I guess I just can't contain my excitement.\"\n\nHe said NOTHING. \n\nI was so embarrassed I just wanted to curl up and cry. I barely remember the rest of the interview, we didn't acknowledge it but the damage was done. I don't know how it affected my odds of getting in, but it crushed my spirits and I haven't felt right since. I'm not really looking for any advice or support, just wanted to get this off my chest. I'm done eating at Chipotle, the memory just hurts too much.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys so much for all the love and support. I wont say I\u2019m over it, but you all have made me feel much better about the whole situation. I\u2019ll do my best to keep you guys updated! LOVE YOU A2C!!",
