  "text": "ive seen quite a few ppl STRONGLY discouraging adding any sort of personality into UC piqs. i understand that metaphors and uchicago quirkiness aren\u2019t good, but do they really want just absolutely dead essays? i don\u2019t understand how you could answer a prompt like \u201ctell us how you show your creative side\u201d without ANY personality.",

      "text": "Best answer I ever got: \"UC AOs don't want to be figuring out your extended metaphor for society's addiction to technology and whatnot. They have almost 100k applications to get through, so don't waste their time and just give it to them straight.\" \n\nFrom this, my takeaway is that UC essays are an opportunity to tell the AOs exactly what you're trying to get across, and it's important to take advantage of that. For instance, that's why almost every response to the leadership prompt has a statement saying \"To me, leadership is...\" I feel like flairs are only used to supplement this point & explain its relation to you, so they should be used in moderation.\n\nalso a disclaimer: fellow senior here, so please take my advice with a grain of salt :))",
