  "text": "I saw [this article](https://theprogressnetwork.org/disrupting-higher-ed/) with the presidents of American U, ASU, and an NYU prof that I thought was really interesting, what are yall's thoughts? im a big(ger) fan of AU + ASU now \n\n(here's some quotes i liked)\n\nScott Galloway (adjunct NYU prof & founder of a decentralized business edu platform): The most frightening thing about it is that those \u201cquality,\u201d elite institutions no longer see themselves as public servants. They see themselves as luxury brands. Every year the dean stands up and brags that we didn\u2019t turn away 90% of our applicants, we turned away 94%, which in my view is tantamount to the head of a homeless shelter bragging that they turned away 94% of the people who showed up last night.\n\n>At least at New York University (NYU), I think we\u2019re in the business... of credentialing, full stop... your HR department posing as an admissions department does a lot more diligence on these individuals and makes them jump through so many hoops that you are a fine filter.   \n>  \n>When Harvard\u2019s total admitted freshmen class is 1400 people, and they have an endowment that is the GDP of El Salvador, they\u2019re not a nonprofit, they\u2019re a hedge fund educating the children of their investors. Where\u2019s the morality? Stanford\u2019s endowment has gone from 1 billion to 30 billion in the last 30 years. Their applications have tripled. They haven\u2019t increased their freshman class one seat.\n\nMichael Crow (ASU Pres): We have to be manufacturing all of these different pathways to success in the future. We\u2019ve got to start holding public universities and some private universities that take large amounts of public resources accountable for their outcomes. And we\u2019ve got to drive innovation and technology forward, or we\u2019re going to revert back to, \u201cOh, I see you went to Kings or Queens College, Cambridge. You\u2019re set.\u201d For, you know, all 300 of you that got to go to the University of Cambridge. We can\u2019t work that way across the scale of the US.\n\n>\\[about increasing nontraditional & online degree pathways\\] The main thing for us has been changing the faculty-centric model to a student-centric model, and empowering our faculty to be able to educate at scale and with speed, and to be innovative.  \n>  \n>We decelerated our rate of cost increase. Scott, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the average net tuition for our 45,000 undergraduates from Arizona is under $4,000 a year. For half of them, it\u2019s zero.",

Except for colleges in extremely rural areas, it would require buying up a lot of buildings that other people or businesses could\u2019ve used, and it would lead to a lot of displacement and gentrification. And if you just see this as \u201cthe price of more people getting educated,\u201d it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that the people harmed by expansion would be less privileged than the next cohort of Harvard students.",

Stanford is in no hurry to expand, and by pulling off something like this, they throw their weight around a bit.  If they really wanted to expand, they could have thrown a few million dollars into the county's transportation or housing funds and it absolutely would have been approved.

We've seen for the past year and a half all classes be online. Even with our modern technology, the higher education system has decided it's a better idea to have an overworked professor repeat themselves 6x times a week to sleepy students instead of making one well thought out, high quality video that can make knowledge free and accessible for all.\n\nOur current system is meant to uphold elitism, especially when you consider that degrees from one college are worth more than others, when really a degree barely says anything about whether you're capable or have the knowledge you need. We really need to rethink education to remove these barriers that are holding almost everyone, except the incredibly wealthy, back.\n\nAlso want to note that the Common App itself didn't reduce admissions rates. Sure, people are applying to more schools, but that also means more people will turn down spots at schools, lowering yield rates (except for the top few). So acceptance rates are not automatically driven down by Common App.",

But the schools we\u2019re talking about have no need or benefit to approaching education with that model. Those schools set an exceptional standard to ensure they produce only exceptional graduates, and if you dilute that required level of excellence by admitting anyone and everyone, not only would a large percentage of the students be in way over their head in terms of the required ability to be successful and graduate, Profs and grant money would leave those schools and flow to the schools which have a higher threshold for admission. Ivy League admission *should* be a meritocracy, whether or not it always works in that way is a different story.",

Also, in all of AU's virtual programming, the administration was clear in their commitment to providing excellent education without putting a premium on exclusivity. AU has been test-optional for over a decade and actually made efforts to \\*expand\\* the first-year class size--even that means the admit rate goes up (which can often lead for ranking to go down). \n\nI go to an extremely competitive public school and was the only person in my friend group who didn't apply to an Ivy--both because none of them truly suited me AND because I knew in this insane application cycle I had little chance of getting in. My Ivy/God-tier obsessed friends are all miserable with their outcomes/options because they bought into the message that anything but these prestige brands = failure. \n\nI'm glad Galloway, Burwell and Crow are having these conversations.

If cost is a problem, you can emigrate to Germany or the Netherlands and receive a free education and/or get paid to be educated. Obviously there are a number of other factors, but a majority of A2Cer's have the ability to attend **college,** the problem is they want a name-brand college. If Rutgers joined the Ivy League, people would be throwing themselves in front of trains to go there, but it didn't, and so most of us don't care so much about it.\n\nBut we care about Harvard and we act like Harvard is the only place to be. That's why tens of thousands of people apply every year, buy millions in merch, donate billions, and fatten the school and other top schools up. If you want to fix the problems outlined above, you have to get everyone to stop caring about these schools.",

And I just searched up the plane ticket cost for a non-stop flight from Seattle (one of the most west highly populated cities in America) to Munich to find that it costs between $1,300 to $1,700. A mobile phone plan in Germany for unlimited 5G data is $30 a month. That's like $6,000ish annually (assuming you go back to the US for holidays and have your phone 8 out of 12 months a year) for a top-tier education.\n\n Your cost of living in one of these countries is infinitely better than spending nearly $100k a year on top of added expenses (phone, toiletries, textbooks, etc.) for an education that is arguably comparable if not worse than the former.\n\nCollege is so accessible in these Scandanavian and European countries that [fucking life-sentence inmates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l554kV12Wuo&ab_channel=InsiderNews) can get it!",

It's a total branding schtick to label his \"everyone admitted at all costs\" as being 'pro democratic' and 'anti-elitist.' No, he's just trying to be CostCo instead of Dean & Deluca. Which is fine, though--to continue the analogy, nobody needs the latter for a good diet or to cook a delicious meal. A lot of the ingredients come from the same place anyway, just as faculty members are largely interchangeable in terms of quality. One can point to the esteemed professors at elite colleges, but few if any are actually interested in the teaching side compared to the research side. \n\nWhat bothers me is that nobody ever critiques what makes a college 'good.' Everyone turns to ranks, but US News and World Report is flawed and gamed beyond belief in its evaluation methods. And the way colleges pitch themselves to students is also based on things that have little to do with educational merit (dining halls, the attractiveness of the library, and other frivolous shit). So, not only do companies and individuals have to get off the \"Hermes and Chanel obsession,\" as the articles put it, we all have to be better informed consumers about the products we're buying.",

Look at websites of veterinarians, doctors, and lawyers at your local clinics and firms--I guarantee you they're filled with local grads. Anecdotally, I know a few lawyers as acquaintances who went out of the state to T20s, tried to come back and find a job at the firms, and were incredibly frustrated at how often they got beat out by the local ASU grads. I know it seems like the be-all end-all for people to get into the best possible schools, but the real world bears out over and over that it's not as crucial as one thinks for long-term success.",

It\u2019s their job to bring in grant money, publish, and manage post docs/grad students. A professor\u2019s research ability ultimately means nothing to most undergrads, even if they are doing some undergrad research (because they don\u2019t have access to the same resources or attention as grads and post docs). What makes Harvard special is its research at top levels, but they create the illusion that this matters for undergrads, when it really doesn\u2019t.",

For some reason, colleges have decided its better to have an overworked professor repeat themselves 6 times a week to a room of sleepy students than make one high-quality video that can be accessible to all.\n\nEven if you want to argue that degrees are necessary to help the market/companies decide who to hire (which I think basing this off a degree is pretty stupid and is only maybe relevant right after you're out of college), why in the world would you want to make something which was determined when you were 14-18 soooo important???\n\nStressing the importance of prestige means that somehow what college you went to, which you decided at 18, is more important than most things you've done after. And maybe by providing a top education to all, we can help spur new innovations that will undoubtedly improve medicine, science, etc.\n\nBottom line, everyone should have access to the best education possible, and everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to society in the way they best can.",
