  "text": "Okay, I know this might be silly or whatever but literally any advice helps.\n\nI was wondering how you guys have found internships, summer programs, academic competitions, research opportunities, and other activities in general. It sometimes feels like everyone knows where to look to find these things and I just have no idea whatsoever. Is there some sort of master list I don't know about???\n\nAll jokes, but seriously, where should I begin looking? I am aware of several programs like the Yale Young Global Scholars but honestly am unfamiliar with anything else. I am also unsure which of these programs are actually prestigious, and which are money-grabs. \n\nI do not live in an extremely urban area, but am close to several universities where I could search for opportunities. However, I do not know what qualifications are necessary to reach out and produce research - or even if that would be appropriate in the first place!\n\nI participate in clubs at school and such but am looking to diversify and strengthen my application. I love to try new things and think some experience in the categories outlined above would be incredibly beneficial. \n\nI know this is an extremely broad question but any advice is welcome. Thank you guys so much!",
