  "title:": "Question about citizenship",
  "text": "Hi guys\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question. A few colleges (like UPenn) asked me if I was a Canadian citizen, and I answered yes since I was born there and had citizenship. However I only stayed for a few years and returned to Libya. The thing is that when I logged into UPenn's portal, it asked in the financial aid section for specific Canadian wage documents for my parents even though they didn't work there.\n\nSo should I email them and ask them to change me from a Canadian citizen to an international one?",

You said \"had\" as if you are no longer a citizen of Canada - you either are a citizen now, or you aren't. If you have dual citizenship, you should also state that.",
