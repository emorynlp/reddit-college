  "text": "So, to my knowledge, any non-AP classes are counted as \"non-honors\" on the UC app if you're applying OOS even if your school calls it an honors class.\n\nSince the UCs don't require a transcript until admission, wouldn't some people have inflated GPAs if they don't read the fine print and call their school-designated honors classes \"honors\" on the application? I'm so confused as to how this works\ud83d\ude2d",
