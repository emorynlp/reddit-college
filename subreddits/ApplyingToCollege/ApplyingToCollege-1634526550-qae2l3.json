  "text": "When self-reporting SAT scores, does \"Highest SAT-R Total Score\" mean your highest SAT score without superscoring it? \n\nI think it is but I wanted to confirm. It's just that UNC accepts superscores, and I have provided my superscore in \"Highest SAT-R EBRW Score\" and \"Highest SAT-R Math Score\", so I was wondering if they were also looking at the score without superscore.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm not making any sense.",

      "text": "I put up same question last night. Someone told me the scores( which I reported on common app) were down further on the portal page,and there they were. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019ve got em. But if you don\u2019t see them or didn\u2019t report I understand your ques. I thought they only used SS and not full test of highest total score. Confused me too.",
