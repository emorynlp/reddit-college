  "text": "With many schools' early results coming out in the next week or two I think it's fair to say we'll see quite a few acceptances to some of the best schools in the world. They'll all get upvoted because woo! Accepted! And they should get upvoted.\n\nBut remember that the majority of this sub will not be getting accepted. A lot of people haven't applied early to *any* schools, and statistically speaking, those who have applied early to top-tier schools are more likely to get rejected than not (even A2Cers, according to last year's data).\n\nI think it's a good idea to post about your rejections too. We can help each other get over our disappointment and show what dealing with rejection healthily looks like.",
