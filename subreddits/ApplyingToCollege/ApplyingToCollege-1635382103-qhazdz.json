  "title:": "Will an arts supplement and my situation hurt my chances at Columbia?",
  "text": "I am ED'ing to Columbia and I was informed that I could possibly turn in an arts supplement of me directing and acting. However, Columbia's website says most people who do turn in arts supplements have national and international achievements. I go to one of the best and selective performing arts schools in the region, but my parents have physically forbidden me from performing in shows and entering competitions. I even had to quit my junior year due to high tuition costs during the pandemic, but I came back this year as a senior.\n\nSo my resume would be comical with barely any shows or awards, but I genuinely believe I have the chops for this and I really want to take advantage of my freedom during my undergrad years to pursue theatre. I have listed theatre as my third and last area of interest on the Common App. \n\nI am afraid of the arts supplemental negatively affecting my application because of a poor resume and  because I have less experience than most people as passionate as I am about this. I heard bad performances can reduce your admissions chances, and even though I do not think my portfolio would be that awful, you never know.\n\nShould I whip up an arts portfolio within a few days? Or is it not worth it? Also is there a place I can explain why I have little achievements? I have written about it on my Common App, but I am not sure if the theatre team that looks at the SlideRoom arts supplementals has access to my Common App.",

If you think the portfolio would be good, then submit it. Otherwise, don't. Don't worry about anything else.",
