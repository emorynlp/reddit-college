  "title:": "Can I Talk about Similar Topics between my UC PIQs",
  "text": "Hi, so I'm trying to finish my UC essays, and I noticed how open-ended/ambiguous the prompts really seem. For two specific prompts, one specific example fit very well into both of them, but I would obviously be mentioning different aspects regarding it between the two prompts. However, I was wondering if it would be alright to repeat a topic, even if you elaborate in a different direction, or is it not recommended to do so?\n\nSorry if I worded the question a little weird, but I appreciate any help or advice!!",
