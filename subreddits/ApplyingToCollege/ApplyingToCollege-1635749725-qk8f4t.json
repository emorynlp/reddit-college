  "text": "I just submitted my Ed app. When I was asking my teachers to write letters of recommendation, one of them asked me to write some qualities about myself that would make me a good candidate so that she could talk about them in my loc. One of the qualities I wrote that I can be a starter, such as when working to create a new club. I realize that it sounds like I was in the process of making one when I already made it back in 11th grade. Idk if she actually wrote about creating a new club in the loc, but I\u2019m now paranoid that colleges will think I lied when listing my activities because her loc might imply that I just started the club when I put that I have done the club since 11th grade. Will they reject me on the basis they think there is an inconsistency based on an implication????? Or am I fine. I\u2019m just so worried because I realllllly want to go to this university.",
