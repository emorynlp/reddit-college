      "text": "If baseball is not your only extracurricular no problem, just say you wanted to focus on your studies and you decided to drop baseball to make time for other things.\n\nIf it\u2019s your main/only extracurricular then that\u2019s tough, I\u2019d recommend picking it back up because a lot of schools value consistency. Trying new sports every few years shows variety, but doesn\u2019t demonstrate passion if you drop your main activity.",
