      "text": "I don't understand how she would ask you to restart and not provided a lot of advice and guidance.   \n\n\nThe essay is an extremely important part of the application and any private guidance counselor or consultant should be very focused on that.   \n\n\nThe essay should tie the whole narrative that your application is trying to convey. It's the central component of the application and your activities list should be arranged to support that narrative.   \n\n\nWhile it may seem obvious, it's surprising how many people fail to understand that the narrative should be about attending college. Sure, it should be personal and be authentic but it should be a story about why college, in general, is part of your story.  \n\n\nIf it fails to connect with the admissions officer's role as a gatekeeper then why would they accept you?  \n\n\nTell the best story about saving a life, helping your community but fail to connect the dots to why college is part of your story then why would they care. They're just left thinking, \"And so what?\"  \n\n\nMaybe join the military, go to a trade school, just get a job and work towards your goal without college.  \n\n\nYour essay has to do a lot of lifting, especially for highly rejective colleges. There is nothing else that will distinguish you from all the other 4.0 GPA, 1500+ SATs and excellent ECs students. Got to demonstrate the planning and effort in the essay.\n\n  \nFor less selective schools, your GPA and test scores are more important than your essays. Essays will only tilt the scales slightly.",
