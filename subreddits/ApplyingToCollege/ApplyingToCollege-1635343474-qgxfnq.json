  "title:": "College Essay about a near death experience",
  "text": "the prompt i chose : Share a meaningful experience and how this has helped shape you in your preparation for college. This could be related to your passions, commitments, leadership experience, family or cultural background.\n\n Hi! so i was wondering if it would be okay to write an essay with a beginning hook of how i almost died over a penny when i was young. and i almost drowned because of it. my sister managed to save me. I\u2019m not sure how this would relate to who i am in terms of metaphorical use. But I can maybe mention how life is short and i want to make the best out of it i feel like that\u2019s really cliche, and i can\u2019t think of any other ways it would help so i\u2019m open to ideas! \n\n\nplease! let me know any advice or ideas i need help \n\n\ni need this by the end of the week\n\n\nTLDR; two essay intro paragraphs, one about turgor pressure, another about a near death experience\u2026. any advice? (due by this week)",

      "text": "While writing about something that happened when you were little is most definitely not recommended, I myself have experienced that sometimes there are things you don't forget and as you grow up, you slowly realise the severity of what happened and what could have happened. If maybe you can write it from this point of view and show the AOs from this point of view, it might be something good. But it's still highly risky.",

If you tried to show something like \"I saw the plant push through concrete and it reminded me of how I pushed... Blaaaaah\" it definitely won't work. AOs know very well that teen minds don't work like this, and trust me, thousands of applicants make this mistake every year. In my opinion, if well done, the first one is a better choice out of the two you've listed.",

I just read a lot of stuff posted by verified admissions counselors and consultants. Those things help me write essays, so I definitely try remember them. Everything I've told you upto now is what I heard from someone qualified.\n\n\nSince I've already finished my common app essay, and I think your topic is too personal to be stolen, I can read it and give my opinions, but you should probably think about if you can trust a stranger on reddit or not.",
