  "text": "How much should I focus my short answer responses on my major (excluding questions that are \"Why major/Why us\")?\n\nI noticed that most of my responses aren't as focused on computer science (my Common App essay is all about how I became interested in it though) as they could be.\n\nShould I try to center more on CS or is it okay to have some more breadth?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Idk too much because I\u2019m a senior myself, but if I were to think about it, there are multiple facets to your personality. If you\u2019ve already told them about your love for cs, it may be helpful to make yourself more human and talk about the other aspects of who you are\u2026 I personally write only around 1 (or maybe 2) essays per college that are actually about my major because I feel like there\u2019s a lot more to me than just that.\n\nTake my words with a grain of salt though, because I have no clue whether my approach is a smart one",
