  "text": "What the actual hell does my mom have against American. Like it's a good school and has a really good journalism program, but apparently it wasn't good when she was a kid so it can't possibly be good now. She was like \"I mean I'll support whatever choice you make, but if you get accepted into American and another school you should go to the other one\". We went to DC over teacher convention to look at schools and we saw Georgetown and American and even though I said good things about both schools she is CONVINCED that I liked American better and she thinks that because I liked American a little after seeing it for the first time it is now my dream school and I never want to apply anywhere else.\n\nWow this post does not have good grammar but whatever I'm mad",
