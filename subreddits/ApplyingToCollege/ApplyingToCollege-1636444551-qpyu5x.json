  "text": "Hello , I m an international student applying to US colleges. I need almost full scholarship. My stats are 4.72 gpa and 1460 in sat. I want to apply to UT Dallas but in common app, it asks whether you intend to pursue need based aid. I have heard that asking for aid may affect admission chances. Since, I think UT Dallas as a safety, should I tick yes or no in common app where it is asking \" do you need to pursue need based financial aid?\"",
