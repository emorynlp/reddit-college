  "text": "So basically I am an American from Georgia, and my dream school is Concordia university in Montr\u00e9al, QC. I really want to get into the JMSB business school as it's super amazing and really good. I also would love to live in Montr\u00e9al as it's rated one of the top cities for students in North America, it has lots of culture, and relatively affordable. \n\nThe only downside is my parents don't want me to move so far away to a different country. I completely understand obviously but they are very hesitant and say things like \"well IF we let you go\" like they are going to decide for me. How can I make them see that it Im not moving across the world, I mean it's still the same time zone. I am just stuck like I mean I know it's going to be scary moving away for the first time but I think I can handle it\n\nAny advice? I am just \ud83d\ude10",

      "text": "Once the distance between home and school is over 6 hours away, it's pretty much all the same. You will be flying home for breaks and you shouldn't expect many visits from family or friends. No different than if you went to college in California.\n\nAnd if you hate it, it's easy to transfer back to a school in the US without losing your credits.\n\nSeems like a great opportunity.\n\nBut I strongly suggest visiting Montreal during the winter months before committing to the make sure you can handle the weather.",

I personally choose Concordia since I'm in CS (in CS, going to a non-target school is not a big deal) and it's right next to where I live. If you are business major, it depends heavily on what you plan to do after graduation. Anyway, best of luck! Also, don't hesitate to practice your French on campus.",

If you are an open person, willing to stumble and be confused and keep learning to figure it out - you'll adapt and do fine. 5 years of french might be entirely inadequate to make sense of \"Quebecois\" french, but Montreal is an international city, with many people speaking french as a second language. You'll never be entirely lost, even if sometimes you are clearly the 'outsider'.",
