  "text": "Bruh I literally wrote over 900 words for my common app essay. I know most of the time it\u2019s better to have more than less but this is just like too much. I feel like getting rid of one of my value paragraphs (did a montage essay - collegessayguy) would cut it down by a bit but i don\u2019t want all my hard work to go to waste. Just a rant \ud83d\ude25",

              "text": "The biggest thing: try to write the essay in about 5 lines (on for each of 5 paragraphs). So that ensured I got the \"correct\" content clear to myself. After that, it was mostly ensuring I get that set of messages across: check every word and ask \"what does this tell you about me?\" If it doesn't say much, consider cutting it out.\n\nThe last of that advice is from ScholarGrade from this sub (see the Wiki).",

      "text": "I totally get it! My first draft was like 1005 words. It was easy to get down to like 850/800 (got rid of fluff, my counselor looked over it and we re-arranged paragraphs to make the essay flowe better), but it was definitely a struggle to get it under 650 words. I definitely will say, it helped me to write supplemental essays in between each time I worked on my personal statement revision because w/ each essay I wrote, I became better at conveying my message/answering the prompt more concisely (but still effectively). So, by the time I was working to get it down from like 850 to 650, I had techniques ready to use to fix some of my sentence structure and sentence variety, and I also used Grammarly to just give it that final *push*. I would say at this point, have someone else read it (someone who REALLY knows you, but also understands how to write an effective essay) and maybe have them tell you what may seem redundant or necessary about certain components of your essay.",
