  "text": "I am an international student. I might have interest in getting MBA at some business school in States. Though I have no idea where to find any current students of the programs / classes I would like to attend. It might be helpful to estimate some courses from the inside before making my mind.\n\nIf anyone knows any communities on Facebook, etc where students of the Ivy League discuss specific subjects and share their experiences it would be really nice of you to provide us with sources.",
