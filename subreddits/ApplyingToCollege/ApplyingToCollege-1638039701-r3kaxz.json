      "text": "I'd say it's in the middle of the road in terms of \"competitiveness.\" California, Texas, Florida, NJ, NY, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, NC, etc are all more \"competitive\" than Wisconsin.\n\nBut it also depends on the school. U of Minnesota, UIUC, Northwestern, Loyola Chicago, UW Madison, UMich, Michigan State, etc probably see a higher percentage of Wisconsin applicants than Santa Clara or Baylor do.",
