  "title:": "Getting SAT scores in before deadline",
  "text": "So I waited too long to send my SAT scores to UT Austin which has a deadline of November 8th for SAT scores to be considered in priority application. I sent my scores on October 27th from college board which gives them 13 days to receive them. Is this enough time or should I order a rush order instead?\n\nI\u2019m pretty nervous about this as my score  took a lotta hard work to get.",
