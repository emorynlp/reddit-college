  "title:": "Should I avoid this topic?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m trying to write my personal statement (I\u2019m a senior so yes very late lol) and I wanted to talk about how being sick a lot as a kid caused me to have a lot of free time alone at home/hospital and allowed me to develop a hobby, which then became a passion and helped me w basically everything else throughout my life and became a big part of who I am.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people say not to write about illness in college essays, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s something I should avoid writing about. The thing is, this is basically the only thing I can really think about writing ab rn and my first deadline is Nov 1st. I want to make most of the essay focused on the hobby/passion and how it changed me, but I probably will need to give some context about my condition and why I got sick so often. Should I continue with this topic or completely avoid the childhood illness thing altogether and choose a new topic? Anything I could change to make it better? Thanks!",

      "text": "Yeah that sounds fine. The thing to avoid is trying to get pity so you get accepted. I think I heard an AO talk about that they said something along the lines of \" it makes me more sad if I reject them but doesn't prevent me from doing so\". From what you described, it sounds like you have a great topic in mind. Just make sure the focus is on you and you'll do fine.",

As long as you make it seem like an opportunity to grow or make it seem like you were inspired or strengthened by your past, which it seems like you definitely got something good out of it, you should be good!",
