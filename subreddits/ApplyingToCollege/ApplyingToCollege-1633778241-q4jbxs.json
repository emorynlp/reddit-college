  "title:": "How to report courses in the \u201cEducation\u201d section of Common App?",
  "text": "I\u2019m an international student from a public school in Thailand (not an international school), and here, they don\u2019t offer any AP classes or GCSE classes or any type of special classes. The curriculum is fixed for every student (everyone studies the same courses). I\u2019m wondering whether I should classify course levels as regular/standard (I fear that this might make me look like someone that doesn\u2019t strive to enroll in advanced courses) or just choose the N/A option (since my country\u2019s education system is different). Also, if I go for the N/A option, do I need to write an explanation in the additional information section? (I already maxed out the available space in section with other things, though.) Could anyone please help me on this?",
