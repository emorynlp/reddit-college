  "text": "one of the classes that i am in is a class where you get matched with an ESL core class and you go to that class and help the kids with their work or help people who are struggling. everyone was telling me i should put it in my activity section on the common app so i did. but now (after having submitted 6 applications smh) am reconsidering whether i should have put it there. technically it is a class, but i myself am not learning anything, it\u2019s a peer tutoring class. should i change it for the rest of my apps or is it ok to leave it?",
