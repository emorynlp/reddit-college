  "text": "Can I apply early decision to multiple schools? Do these schools have access to the fact that I am applying early to other schools and would this turn them off? I do not have a university which is a sure pick for me, but I do not want to wait and apply to all colleges regular admission because I could risk not getting in to a school I may want to go to. What should I do? Thanks so much!",

You agree to withdraw all other applications if you are accepted.\n\nYou can only apply ED to one school (at a time).  Notice that many schools now offer ED1 and ED2. ED1 returns an answer in December. If your ED1 application is denied in December, you are free to apply ED2 somewhere else. ED2 deadlines typically coincide with RD.\n\nEarly Action is not the same thing as ED. EA is not binding.\n\nRead the early application rules on each of your colleges' websites. If the EA school has no restrictions, you may apply unrestricted EA to as many schools as you want, while applying ED1 to one school.\n\nApply ED only if: (1) it's absolutely your first choice, (2) it's definitely affordable according to the NPC estimate, (3) you don't need to see financial aid or scholarship offers from other schools, and (4) you will be prepared to withdraw all other apps upon an acceptance from your ED college.",
