  "text": "okk context: intl super small school (like less than 100 in high school), hybrid schedule for covid (2 days on campus) so no clubs\n\n i'm pretty poor so paying to do something like MUN at another school would be tough. i'm interested in polisci but i live in a country where there is no option for teens to be involved in any sort of politics. it's also impossible to find work opportunities, so that's not even an option. my school doesn't qualify for any national awards, so all i have is awards for being the best at the majority of all my classes throughout high school (i'm not bragging, i'm just saying). i am trying to figure out a way to do some politics-related work over the summer but i honestly just need something to strengthen my application",

They will take note of your limited opportunities",

          "text": "I agree with the website suggestion. You don\u2019t even need to know how to code. Look for free website hosting in exchange for ads running on the site. \n\nAlso you could start an online book group that reads biographies of politicians or something similar. Maybe you can get a group together from Reddit. I  joined an online book group recent to read a stats book and found it really useful and enjoyable.",
