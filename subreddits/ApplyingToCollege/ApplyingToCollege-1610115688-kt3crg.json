Alabama the state is stereotyped as a land of incest, but I'm not exactly sure how true it is, certainly not to the extent of the memes. Alabama the University is joked about for the low academic standards they present their football athletes, and the circlejerk extended to the rest of the college as well. In reality, it's a pretty decent college with outstanding financial aid, especially for National Merit Scholars.\n\nSorry if this didn't help!",

Take a bowl and add: 1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder of your choice( I like Ghirardelli but Hershey\u2019s also works), and a pinch of salt. Mix that mixture around until you get a mixed mixture of mixed cocoa powder and brown sugar. Put that powder into a pan and add: 1 - 1 1/2 cups of milk (I use lactaid bc I\u2019m genetically inferior), 1 tbsp creme, 1/4 tbsp vanilla extract (I don\u2019t usually add this) and stir that thang around with a mini whisk(or a big one if you\u2019re into that I don\u2019t judge)until it\u2019s a lil less lumpy. Slap that baby on the stove on medium to low heat and keep on stirring until it\u2019s dissolved. Shower it in whipped cream, shaved dark chocolate, and love, & you\u2019re done. It sounds like a lot but that\u2019s because I like to talk too much. It\u2019ll probably add like 2-3 minutes onto a boxed mix hot chocolate routine...    but\ud83c\udf51tastes\ud83e\udd75100\ud83d\udcaftimes\u274cbetter\ud83d\ude0f.

      "text": "I had a friend who, in 2019 (year of application for me) got denied ED from his dream school (Penn) then got upset, took out a loan of around 25k (no idea how it was approved), and turned it into \\~700k in about 2 months after getting extremely lucky with some super high risk nonsense. Apparently, he took out 600k of it, lost the 100k he had left after not having the same degree of luck, then he put the 600k into safer investments and now has a few million net worth.\n\nHe ended up going to our state school but probably has more money than I'll see until I'm like 50. So much for me going to a T5 LOL, almost feels like a slap in the face (but a good one, he's a nice guy). Very chill now. Buys me food when he visits me.",

There's bound to be some wacky things getting posted.\n\nJust some back of the napkin calculations: You have, say 2, experiences in a week (opportunities to mess up or do some embarrassing shit that's worthy of getting put on this sub). Let's say for each experience there's a 0.1% chance of doing something bad enough. Then each week, there's an expected 0.002 \"controversial\" posts from just you.\n\nThere's 284k members of this sub. Assuming the 1% rule holds, there's 2.84k contributors, so there's an expected 5.68 \"controversial\" posts on this sub every week.\n\nEdit: This is very much an underestimate, especially now with many interviews around this timeframe. There's probably more experiences in a week, and there's a higher chance of embarrassing yourself at each experience. And the 1% rule is definitely an underestimate because there's a large population of people who aren't even members of this sub.",
