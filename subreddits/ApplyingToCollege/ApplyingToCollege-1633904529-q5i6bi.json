      "text": "Well because faking an application is lying while legacy admissions are a structure that some colleges set up to reward their alumni and encourage prominent people who graduate from their school to continue to send their children there so that a college will have a line of prominent individuals to adorn their plaques lol \n\nThe difference is quite literally between customer satisfaction and giving out free samples vs allowing someone to steal products from your store \u2014 either way it\u2019s a net loss in products for the store but one encourages profit and a consistent customer while another allows the business to struggle\n\nNot saying I like legacy but I support the concept because if you think of it like a college, they\u2019re trying to make money, pay their employees, and establish their name\u2014can\u2019t rlly complain about a business trying to stay in business",

Universities will usually give people with legacy more advantage(in many schools such as USC) and a higher acceptance rate(Example is Harvard), which is pretty unfair.\n\nIf the university put legacy and non-legacy with the same acceptance rate and 80% legacy won, no one will complain about that because the condition is fair and equal for both of us. However, if they gave some students more advantage just because of their parents(that is why I do not dislike athletes because I know their advantages in university admission is based on their OWN EFFORTS) it is definitely unfair",

That's not the only thing they're evaluating.  They're also considering, \"How much more $ will we have to spend at some point in the future if we admit this applicant?\"\n\nIn theory, admitting legacies brings in more alumni donations, which leads to a bigger endowment, which means more $ to spend on better faculty, better grad students, better facilities, and more $ to spend on need-based aid in order to attract the very top students from among the set of non-wealthy applicants.",

              "text": "ok, so let's be rational here in my response.\n\n1. Not necessarily--because legacy applications are marked with a special flag where legacy status gives an advantage, legacy admits do not need to be *as qualified* as regular admits. If you disagree, I'd love to see your reasoning.\n2. I don't know how this helps your argument. Once I metaphorize I don't think it will seem reasonable, but we could test this.\n3. So we agree. And I guess what you think is that it shouldn't be fair. But I do, even if that puts me at disadvantage.\n4. If Harvard didn't take into account legacy status, statement in (1) wouldn't be true. Therefore, admits would be slightly more qualified, and my hypothetical children would now have less chance to get in, but nevertheless a chance at a more qualified class\n\nLook, I really think we can agree here on some points. There are arguments in favor, I just don't think you made me aware of them.\n\n1. Legacies may understand the school better, and therefore take advantage of its resources to the fullest while there.\n2. Parents of legacies may end up donating more money than non-legacy parents, allowing for a slight increase (if at all) in scholarships for those that deserve to get in but can't attend because of the price tag.",
