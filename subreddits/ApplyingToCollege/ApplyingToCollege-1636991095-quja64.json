So when you sort by worst review you often see bad reviews just under the section of party scene or student life, which is why you might see stuff like that. You can give a 1 star review just under one section, but not feel that way about the whole school. Id suggest sorting in the category \u201coverall experience\u201d or just whichever one you care about most",
