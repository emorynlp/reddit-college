  "text": "Many of you guys are confused whether to take Duolingo English Test as an English proficiency test instead of IELTS or TOEFL  for applying to universities. I had everything ready for my application profile except English proficiency scores. I decided to take DET and now the biggest regret in my life is DUOLINGO ENGLISH TEST. I literally took the test sixth (6th) times and every time , the dumbest Duolingo team mailed me saying ' Your test was not certified because of this and that'. I was not certified for 6th times with very unreasonable statements. And now they are saying you have to pay again to retake the test. My ED deadline is November 1 and now I have to drop my ED plan as I can't take the test within 30 days of purchase. When I appealed for the reasons, they replied saying we cant do anything , this is our final decision. Please think twice before choosing this dumbest shit . Just a waste of time and fucking 49 dollars with applicable taxes. #banduolingo",
