I only took 4 APs throughout high school (AP Eng Lang, AP Gov, AP Calc, AP Eng Lit) with A's on all of them, is that too little to stand out in the application?\n\nMy school also limited the amount of AP courses that I could take, would it hurt to mention that?",

PSA, in case it's relevant: public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
