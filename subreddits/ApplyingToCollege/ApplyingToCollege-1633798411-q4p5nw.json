  "text": "A few days ago when one of my teacher know that I want to apply to MIT, i was replied\n\"MIT????????????\n\ud83d\ude26\nlol\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\"\n\nTbh I knew that that is unrealistic for me but I just thought that I will regret if I don't try.\nI know that I'm not brilliant, even though I want to apply to a top STEM school, I don't have any olympiad or research experience. \nI was just doing my best, despite having financial problems and made me had no choice other than to work, I still have good grades. I WAS kinda proud of myself. But that is not enough, right? \nI was motivated to study hard because I thought that's the only \"easier' way to improve life. I will be the first in my family to go to college and I want to change my family's life. I want to work hard and pay off my father's debt. \nBut maybe I'm too optimistic.\n\nWhen I got a reaction like this it even made me more insecure and thought that I'm just making a fool out of myself. If others find me silly, maybe I really am. I wonder if I need to even bother. Maybe I shouldn't apply? \n\nI don'f have anyone else I can talk to about this other than strangers on internet. Please tell me to wake up. I need a slap to face the reality.",

On the other hand, if you are rich but you live in the middle of nowhere, you will still have zero opportunities.",

You might be better off to look at other good undergraduate STEM programs that are a better fit for you.\n\nMy recommendations:. Look at WPI and Olin College.  Both have excellent STEM programs and higher acceptance rates.  My spouse has his Master's from MIT and both he and I were impressed by the quality of education at both of these schools.",

Not everyone here is a genius, in fact, most of the students I\u2019ve met at MIT are like a lot of other students. We think of MIT students as perfect all APs/top test scorers. That\u2019s simply not the case. I even met a freshman the other day who had never even taken a single AP class (under what circumstances, I\u2019m not sure). \n\nBelieve in yourself and work hard! Effort goes a long way. Everyone has a chance even if it isn\u2019t huge, you applying is just as legitimate as a researcher applying",
