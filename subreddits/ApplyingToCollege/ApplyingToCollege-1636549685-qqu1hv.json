  "text": "So the uni that I'm applying to wants me to send midyear grades (which come out in February for me) or provide a midyear progress report. How should this look and if I don't have it will my application be automatically rejected? The problem is that I only have written 3 tests up until now so I don't really have enough grades to make a full academic report.",
