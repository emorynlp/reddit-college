  "text": "Title. I\u2019m at basically max word count for all of my essays so I don\u2019t really have room to state the prompt number or whatever. How do you indicate which essays you've chosen? \n\nFor example, Brown's PLME essays are as listed:\n1. Committing to a future career as a physician while in high school requires careful consideration and self-reflection. What values and experiences have led you to believe that becoming a doctor in medicine is the right fit for you? (250 words) \n2. Select one of the following to answer for the second essay (250 words):\n-->A) Health care is constantly changing, as it is affected by racial and social disparities, economics, politics, and technology, among other factors. How will you, as a future physician, make a positive impact? \n-->B) How do you feel your personal background provides you with a unique perspective of medicine? \n3. How do you envision the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) helping you to meet your academic, personal and professional goals as a person and as a physician of the future? (500 words)*\n\nHow would you upload these essays in PDF form in common app? Should I have the prompt at the top even though it'll go over my word count? Or just assume that they'll know which prompt I've chosen (especially for number 2).\n\nThanks!",
