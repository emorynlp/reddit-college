  "text": "I need to submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for an honours college application. One of my activities got a little media coverage and I would like link to that article (on the newspaper's official website, of course).\n\n1. Should I be doing this at all?\n2. Is it better to write out the URL (link to article: https://example.com) or [link to it like this](https://example.com)?",
