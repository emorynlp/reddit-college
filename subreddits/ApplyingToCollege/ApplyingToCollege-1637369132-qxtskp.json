  "text": "Greetings from Cornell University!\n\nAs part of Cornell\u2019s commitment to supporting first-generation students and students from low-income backgrounds, our team is committed to being your family resource. Reach out to us with questions about the admissions and financial aid application processes, and we also invite you to join us at one of our upcoming virtual events.\n\nWe Are Your Financial Aid Resource\n\nDid you know that Cornell families with total family income of less than $60,000, and total assets of less than $100,000 (including primary home equity), will have no parent contribution and no loans in their aid offer? In cases of divorce or separation, we calculate total family income for each parent and add them together. Our glossary can help you better understand financial aid terms, and you can learn more about our financial aid initiatives here. \n\nUse Your Checklist \n\nAfter you submit your Common Application and after a processing period, you will receive access to your admission application checklist through your Applicant Status Page. You will have ample time to submit missing material after receiving your checklist. \n\nWhy Choose Ithaca\n\nThe city of Ithaca provides big-city amenities and small-town charm! Cornell students can run, hike, and ski, taking advantage of the natural beauty, lifestyle and activities found in the Finger Lakes. They can also listen to live music, see amazing shows and performances, and eat authentic cuisines from all over the world. Our intern weighs in on why she loves Ithaca on our blog. \n\nExpanding the First-Year Experience\n\nIncoming first-year students can indicate their preference to live in a program house or a residence hall, including newly built and recently opened Toni Morrison Hall and  Gan\u0119dag\u01eb: Hall (pronounced Gah-NEN-dah-go). All first-year students live on North Campus, with easy access to dining halls, fitness centers, study spaces, and cafes. First-year students are automatically enrolled in the Unlimited meal plan, which can be fully covered by financial aid for eligible students.\n\nWe are your resource. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to finaidoutreach@cornell.edu with questions about financial aid and diversity@cornell.edu with questions concerning the admissions process and student life here at Cornell.",
