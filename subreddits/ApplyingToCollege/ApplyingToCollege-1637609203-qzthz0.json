  "text": "I had my Hamilton interview the other day, and oh my god I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a more successful evaluative experience. I only knew of and liked the open curriculum and some of the programs at Hamilton, but my hour long conversation with my interviewer had me word vomiting to my friends and family for twenty minutes about how much Hamilton excites me and fits me and my learning style. Also, the girl interviewing me was basically me four years in the future. She wants to go to law school, she studied the program I wanted to study, she studied abroad in the same country I want to, and the way she carried herself was very similar to me. The college process had me feeling really down lately, but this experience reminded me why I\u2019ve worked so hard over the past four years and why I can\u2019t quit now. There\u2019s opportunities out there that I\u2019ve been looking forward to for years, so I\u2019m going to push myself for just one more month. If not for me, then for my freshman, sophomore, junior year self who worked her ass off. Time to jump back in to doing those supplementals :)",

          "text": "i\u2019m definitely with you there, i do prefer a not-as-small, closer to the city college. that being said, i am willing to make those compromises mostly bc of the open curriculum which i love but also the fact that there are semester study abroad and internship programs that would allow me to get away from the rural setting and be closer to cities i love. (there\u2019s this one particular Washington DC internship that caught my eye). there\u2019s enough stores and restaurants 10-15 minutes away and Syracuse is 45 minutes away; i\u2019m from TX so i\u2019m used to traveling long distances. it really does comes down to each person and what they value more in a college campus, but it is certainly something I spent a lot of time thinking through. nothing is set in stone, so i might not even end up going there even if I get in, but i thought it was worth it to at least apply.",

              "text": "ty for the response! honestly with the times you mentioned, thats not really as rural as I thought (I don't even think the times you mentioned are really long distances either tbh). Is it possible that you could go into more or link some of the internships? That really intrigues me (for context, If I went there I would probably major in geosciences and minor in computer science). \n\nI want a small school as well is the thing, I'm just kinda worried about the location - but with your comment it doesn't seem that bad tbh. Are these study abroad and internship programs avaiable to freshman? and hows the transportation/offcampus life from what you know? Sorry for asking so much I'm just pretty interested now :,",

                  "text": "(sorry this is about to be a long comment lol) no problem at all, i love talking to people who are interested in the same schools as me :) \n\ni don\u2019t know a whole lot about either of those areas of study but from what I could gather, the senior program for geosciences does involve research that takes students to various countries. additionally, Hamilton does offer lots of opportunities to connect with summer internships so there\u2019s that.\n\ngeosciences program: https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/departments/Senior-Program?dept=Geosciences\ngeosciences research: https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/departments/Research?dept=Geosciences\ninternships opportunities: https://www.hamilton.edu/after/student-internship-news\n\nand yes those study abroad programs are available to freshman. i talked about it in length with my interviewer who actually was a January admit to Hamilton because she spent her whole first semester of freshman year in a London study abroad program. how Hamilton works is that they have three Hamilton programs in China, Spain, and France and two domestic programs in Washington DC and New York (closer to the city) but they have over a hundred pre-approved programs to various countries which are in coordination with other organizations but still allow you to travel with hamilton students. I don\u2019t remember the exact number but I think my interviewer said something around 65% of student study abroad at some point bc it\u2019s encouraged and supported. it\u2019s popular regardless of major.\nstudy abroad: https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/offcampusstudy\n\nfinally, on transportation, i don\u2019t know much, but there\u2019s a shuttle that goes into the city on a regular schedule and there\u2019s also seem to be car rentals. if i were to attend, i would probably purchase a small car because that seems to be the most convenient. but that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t transportation options.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about off campus life either, but it seems like the campus makes up for their isolation by making on campus life much better. they have activities like concerts, comedians, an art museum, student organizations etc. and as far as my interviewer goes, she says the people at Hamilton are amazing so it makes up for it. they also have a campus orientation which my interviewer was really excited to talk about, where you go on either an outdoorsy or community service trip for one or two weeks. all that to say, i feel like the campus does a decent job of making sure their students enjoy themselves. \n\nmy favorite part is that you don\u2019t have to declare a major until second semester sophomore year because it gives you ample time to experience all the different classes and opportunities. i hope that helped! if you have any more questions i\u2019d love to answer them, so feel free to pm me :)",
