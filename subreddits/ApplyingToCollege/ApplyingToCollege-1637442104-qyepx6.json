  "text": "I\u2019m applying to Bryn Mawr and just found out that they encourage interviews. The only ones left are on this Monday and Tuesday and I don\u2019t really feel prepared. But, should I register anyway? Idk. Also I just looked at their common data set and it only has interviews as \u201cconsidered\u201d with a bunch of other factors above it in the very important/important tiers. Is it worth it to do a last minute interview??? I\u2019m just getting mixed messages on its importance.",

She only asked me like 4 questions and then we talked about her experience. She told me to email her anytime and announce her where I decide to go in the spring. It's a very low pressure interview and you have nothing to lose by doing it.",

I took a gap year so she asked me what I am doing this year. Then she asked about 2 of the activities on my resume. Then she asked me about how covid affected my community. And the last question was how I found out about the school and why I want to go there.",
