  "text": "I live in a county that was added to the FEMA Declared Disasters post during the current application cycle, so I'm eligible to get my fee waived, but I'm from an affluent area and my family wasn't really affected at all by the disaster. I feel guilty using the fee waiver, it feels like I'm using it under false pretenses even though technically allowed.\n\nNo idea why I'm sharing this on A2C, idk where else to do it though.",
