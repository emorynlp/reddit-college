  "text": "Some teachers at my school allow students to write LORs for themselves or will let them edit the letters before submitting. I\u2019m genuinely curious - to all the AOs: can you tell when a teacher rec has been modified/written by a student? Also, are you familiar with the teachers at different schools from their names and do some teachers\u2019 recs hold more weight than others?",
