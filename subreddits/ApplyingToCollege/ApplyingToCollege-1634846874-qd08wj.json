  "title:": "Letters of Recommendation and Naviance",
  "text": "Please help! In July I had requested general Letters of Recommendation from 3 teachers and didn\u2019t choose any colleges.  One of the teachers was able to submit and upload the letter. One of them says I had cancelled the letter while on my end the letter was still requested.  For the other teacher, they got the notification that I had requested the letter of recommendation but I do not show up on their Naviance. I\u2019ve emailed my counselor about this but after I actually went in and cancelled the letters and then re-requested them she said to wait 24 hours. I\u2019m unsure whether that will actually work or not.\n\nIs there anything I can do or am I screwed?",
