  "text": "Title. I know I shouldn't have left everything to last minute but I was checking and re-checking every essay. At 11:50 I started the submission process for my EA school and as soon as I reached the payment tab, it took me to a new website to pay. I was able to do it fine but when I clicked return to common app it made me sign in again. Then when I went back to my EA school to continue the process I was put back at Stage 1. I repeated everything again several times only to continuously be sent to Step 1. Each time I reach the payment screen it tells me I have paid but returning to common app just logs me out. I don't know what to do at this point. One of my schools was priority deadline for November 1 so that's just completely out of the picture now.",
