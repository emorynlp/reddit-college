  "title:": "so I \"created\" a plural that's not officially accepted",
  "text": "I was talking about the multiple identities of everyone in my common app essay, and I had to mention the multiple \"mes\". It made sense in the context, but how should I write this word?\nI originally wrote it with quote marks, and then normally in the following uses throughout the essay. However, a friend said I should write it in italic, or maybe write \"MEs\" but i don't think that works.\nThis is my final draft, and I'm completely satisfied with the essay, so I really need to take this rock out of the way. Tips?",
