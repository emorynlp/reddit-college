However, if you\u2019re an engineer and you got a degree from a state school with a good engineering program (like U of Delaware or someplace), that could make a difference over getting an engineering degree at a liberal arts college. \n\n2. Whether you plan to go to graduate school, law school, or med school - if you\u2019re not law or med, where you get your undergraduate degree means nothing if you\u2019re planning on getting a graduate degree. It may mean something if you\u2019re trying to get into a good law or med school though. If not law or med, where you get a graduate degree is much more important than undergraduate degree. \n\n3. How much you put into your college education - No matter where you go, you get out of college what you put into it. Diving into your studies and actually learning and expanding your mind and meeting your potential matters. Getting to know professors and taking advantage of what the school has to offer is so much more important than where you go. ",

What I will tell you is that some faculties have specialized scholarships based solely on grades (which was nice cause I dont enjoy writing essays about my own splendor). Whether you can receive these outside of a direct transfer after graduation I do not know. I will say that short of a Schulich or Loran (I actually know 2 ppl from my school who got said award so maybe it's not that hard) You will surely have better luck getting good scholarships from uvic. Remember that ubc has a huge population of wealthy immigrants which allows them to be much more picky with who they bring and allows for higher tuition and less scholarships to still yield strong results. If you can keep a 95+ average in high school, and for bc schools that's easy enough, you will probably get a sizable scholarship from uvic. at the very least $2000 and that is with grades in the high 80s.\n\nEdit: I can never honestly say that UVic is better than UBC and am only a student myself so dont have any real credibility. What I say about the importance of where you get your bachelors is from what I have been told by parents and parents' co workers and employers in the professional field that required postsecondary education. Also it's worth mentioning that the scholarship I got was as a relatively local student (BC) going into engineering. I dont know what they offer for arts humanities. Nor even what they offer for sciences because engineering faculty is lumped in with computer science more so than pure sciences.",

Not even a box to check. I got fucked over because of a paperwork error and had to pray that they would give me the scholarship after paying my final deposit for acceptance of a few 100 dollars. Good luck tho, university is a fun time and definitely worth it especially if you can get the university to pay some of your way. ",

Unless you do a CS major or minor simultaneously  or something you won't be doing that much more than the science students who also happen to share many courses with you. Dont do what I did. Be nice.

      "text": "You kids need to learn a very important lesson because I\u2019m tired of this mentality.  I\u2019m sick of you all (on this sub and in real life) shitting on anything that isn\u2019t the absolute most greatest university ever.  You act like not getting into your #1 is the end of the world and going elsewhere is going to ruin you.  Yes it sucks not getting into the school you want, it sucks feeling like you have to settle for 2nd or 7th.  But that\u2019s not the fucking end of it.\n\nYou didn\u2019t work hard in high school and in your personal life just to gain admission.  You\u2019ve got 4ish years ahead of growing, maturing, learning, experiencing.  You feel like you\u2019re getting screwed because you might end up somewhere as somebody who didn\u2019t try as hard?  Welcome to life.  But you know what?  They may not have tried as hard and that may carry over into college.  You\u2019ve established some good habits, you\u2019ve learned, you\u2019ve explored and that will follow you.  There are an absurd amount of opportunities waiting for you at any school and it\u2019s up to you to take them.\n\nThe school doesn\u2019t make you, and if it does I am sorry for you.  Relying on where you went to college later on in life is rather pathetic.  That\u2019s just the next step up from that one person in their 30s living in their HS glory days.  You make yourself and wherever you go it\u2019s on you to do that.  Join clubs, meet people, study abroad, go for that internship in DC/NYC/SF, do research, work at the front desk, spend time with your professors, start a non-profit, start a club, help solve a problem.  Those things are infinitely more interesting to talk about in job interviews than \u201cI went to Yale and didn\u2019t do shit.\u201d\n\nYour value isn\u2019t based on the name of the university on your diploma.  Your resume doesn\u2019t end with where you graduated from.  That person who did minimal effort may continue to do minimal effort and that\u2019s gonna hurt them down the road.  But they may grow up and put in the effort which is great, good for them.  What they have done and what they do should have next to no impact on you and your decisions on life.\n\nEngagement is one of the biggest factors in college student success.  Being engaged in class, on campus, with people, in your own life.  Do things you want to do.  Study and put in your effort.  You\u2019ll get out of it what you put in.  But that is up to you to decide.  If you don\u2019t get into Harvard and end up at UMICH what are you gonna do?  If you don\u2019t get into UNC and end up at Clemson what are you gonna do?  It\u2019s your choice.  Either moan about how you didn\u2019t get into your #1 and ended up at #4 for 4 years and let all those amazing opportunities pass by or are you gonna dive right in, grow up, and become who you want to be?",

So they can get good money, save up for a nice house, drive a nice car. That's completely fine, and lots of people would strive for that, but that's so short sighted. One day your obituary is gonna be read. What's gonna be on it? Nobody's gonna remember you for the college you went to, or the money you saved, or the house you had, or the car you drove.   They're gonna remember you for what you've built, what you've accomplished, what you've done that was noteworthy. They'll remember how you treated others, and the way you carried yourself. They'll remember you for how you enriched their lives, the way you've touched their hearts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a teacher. I have a laundry list of ECs or reasons to jerk myself off to. But what I consider to be my greatest accomplishment in the world? When the father of one of my students told me how his daughter was excited to come to my class. She wanted to learn. And she was taking the topics I've taught her and actually applying it to her life. Why is that so important to me? Why do I consider that to be my greatest achievement? Because I'm thinking beyond myself. Inspiring others explore their interests and instilling passion into them, is purpose that's greater than I am. And that's what will stand even if my gravestone has become illegible, or long after my body has perished from this earth",

          "text": "But when you're pretty young and you won't remember much before the age of 8 anyway, I'm sure the very few years they've been working is most of their living memory. They literally have trouble remembering a time before high school or middle school because their brains have been in various stages of construction that whole time and are *still* not complete. The prefrontal cortex is the last bit, and that's barely started when you're even 17. They rely on the amygdala and these emotional responses because their brain simply isn't fully functional yet. To recreate that landscape in a fully-developed adult (>25), you'd have to give them a brain injury. \n\nBut it'll be a shock when they get to the end of university, having \"worked hard\" for at least double the amount of time, and they'll still fail to get a position in that top law firm or software company. They'll scrape their way into a shitty, casual job. The cognitive dissonance will be overwhelming: they got the degree and did all the work, but no one else seems to realise just how fantastic a person they are. So it's either their fault or everyone else's. In reality it's neither, they just had wildly incorrect assumptions about how the adult world works. \n\nHow hard we work is quite irrelevant to the final outcome. It takes time to learn that you deserve nothing, no matter what you do, and that that isn't a reflection of you as a person. If very few people outside of your family, friends, school, or town have heard of you, you've probably done jack-shit in life. That's to be expected. People easily spend 5 years in a low-paying entry-level position, so if 5 years of hard work is not \"enough\" to be promoted from peasant to CEO, then why the hell would 4 years of work as a literal child be \"enough\" to deserve absolutely anything at all? And for many, those 4 years were spent supported fully by their parents, with food, bills, and the roof over their head all paid for by other people, all of the nitty-gritty details managed by other people. It's like having a team of assistants 24/7. That'll decrease the important of *anything* you do in HS. ",

They believe that they're somehow entitled to a position in my research group because they got an A+ in their introductory physics and calc 2. They can be overly demanding, believing that all resources and effort should be diverted towards them because they somehow deserve it. They think that they have earned a spot on a journal paper because they downloaded a few files, or they think they should be higher up in the author list for their trivial contributions. They expect us to be impressed by whatever pointless shit they did in HS. They expect us to be impressed by their 4.0 in a bunch of introductory classes. They demand respect despite having never done anything to earn it. \n\nThat sort of mindset is the sort we *kick people out* of the research group for. It's the sort that we'll deny entry for if you're already notorious for it or if you display it in your email to us. It's the sort that makes people dislike you, and if we dislike you, then you're shut out from opportunities. ",

Unfortunately, the holistic review includes candidates that THEY need to create their best diverse class, which means that they might overlook grades and extracurriculars if you are a particular race or offer something unique. A standardized test score will never define an individuals success no matter if you go to Yale or Community College. Ideally\u2014 Top tear schools have the \u201cbrand name\u201d that can help with the job search post college, but more now than ever there\u2019s acceptances to schools based on uniqueness or something that looks good for their community. \n\nI started test prep at the end of my sophomore year and I only had a 28 composite by the time I took it 4 times. I worked my ass off but standardized testing isn\u2019t one of my strengths, and I\u2019m glad I have other things to offer. So if the lack of a high test score defines minimal effort for you, then I think it\u2019s fair for colleges to view a student for everything they have to offer rather than an individual number. \n\nHowever, I understand other aspects that are out of our control. The college process nowadays is mainly luck, and I don\u2019t know about you but as I\u2019m finding out where more and more people of my class of 2023 are going, I\u2019m questioning what colleges are really looking for.

Some won't make much of it.  A hard worker will.  And once you leave high school, it's a restart--I wouldn't put too much stock in assessing people's potential or \"worth\" as your peers based on how hard they worked in high school.  Some students will find college more motivating and will put forth more effort than they did in high school.  Some students will revel in the freedom and autonomy of college and do less than they did in high school. \n\nAnd as others have said, even if some students on campus didn't have stellar entry credentials, there will be others whose credentials are just as good as or even better than yours.
