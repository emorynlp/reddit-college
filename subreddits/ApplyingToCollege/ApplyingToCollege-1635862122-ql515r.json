  "text": "I turned my Purdue application in on the 31st and was looking through it and noticed that I couldn\u2019t find the optional essay in my application. I emailed the admissions office but I found out about it 20 min after the deadline so I\u2019m worried that the admissions office might think that I emailed afterwards because I didn\u2019t have the essay done. Will this impact my chances of admissions by a lot? I\u2019m applying computer science, but my stats are in the same range as the kids who usually get accepted to Purdue from my school.",
