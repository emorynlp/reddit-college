  "title:": "Should I send SAT scores as a Junior?",
  "text": "This is my first post here so I apologize if I accidentally break a rule.\n\nI received my SAT score yesterday and let's just say that it is high enough in Ivy League standards (I verified in College Board). The problem is, if I send those scores to my preferred schools would they even respond back since I'm a junior? A bigger concern is that if I send those scores once to those schools, would it seem bad if I sent them again in my senior year (on the chance that it doesn't work the first time)? I can't seem to find any score-based scholarships for juniors either so I am not sure if I should wait to send or just do it now. I really want to secure some scholarships and would be happy to know if schools were interested in me. Some websites say this is possible but I'm not finding anything to back them up. \n\nCould you guys help guide me in what I should do with my score now? Note: I don't plan to take the SAT for the rest of my high school career.",

      "text": "No. Wait until fall of senior year, when you are done testing (and therefore know what scores you want to report), your list is relatively final, and you know what score reporting methods each of your colleges accepts.\n\nIf you are applying to a test-optional school, the rule of thumb would be to not report a score below a certain threshold. Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th. Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/).\n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.",

              "text": "Yes wait. Most will accept self-reported scores anyway - no need to send an official score report. And your list might change anyway as you determine affordability...\n\nOutside scholarships? Check the deadlines. Those tend to be small amounts and for some colleges, outside scholarships may reduce calculated need.\n\nIvy-level schools may offer little to zero in merit scholarships, but offer generous need-based aid instead.\n\nA copy and paste:\n\nSome general thoughts on paying for college:\n\nPublic universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nSome public universities offer large merit scholarships to out-of-state students.\n\nSome private universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state.\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
