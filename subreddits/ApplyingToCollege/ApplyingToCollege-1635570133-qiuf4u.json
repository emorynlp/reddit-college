      "text": "Applicant B.  \nChances are they will also be able to write a stronger essay that shows why college is part of their life/career plan. That will make the entire application come alive and make sense.   \n\n\nThe essays are critical and Applicant \"A\" **may** not have much to write about.   \n\n\nThis is for highly selective/rejective schools. There are literally thousands of students with 4.0 and perfect test scores. The top ten schools could simply fill their freshman class every year with just those stats. Otherwise, it's a toss-up of what kind of profile they need to make a solid well-rounded class profile of students. Colleges are a business and they need people in every sector/major.",

Also, recommenders probably would have more to write about.   \n\n\nHowever, it's nearly impossible to make all things equal. Maybe \"A\" had a job and supported his family as an EC and teachers knew about his hardship. Maybe \"B\" had a mediocre relationship with his recommender but was outstanding in every other way but it just didn't show in the application.   \n\n\nThe entire application must be considered and LOR is very important and a bit of a black hole. No good info whether that makes or breaks an application. (Note, I said application, not the student. Don't judge your worth on getting into school. we can't control everything.)",

This can be shown through the main essay, supplements and strong support in your recommendation letters. There are a ton of students with perfect grades so colleges so it is hard to differentiate between them. Essays help them to see what kind of person you are, as a student and as an individual. If you can make college admissions like you for you then I think you are a strong candidate.",
