  "text": "Hello lovely people from Reddit \u2661\ufe0e\n\nI was checking the Clemson application on CommonApp and it states that the CommonApp essay is optional and that there\u2019s an optional supplement as well. I can\u2019t find it though. Is the supplement the additional personal statement or resume?",
