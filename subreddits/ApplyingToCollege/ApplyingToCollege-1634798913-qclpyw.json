  "text": "I have too many ecs and only 10 slots available. I want to add more but idk how I should sprinkle it in. My essays are airtight. And Recommendations are already written. Maybe I can talk a little about it in my interviews but I won't be giving every interview to every uni. Any suggestions?",

Colleges want to know what is important to you. Think quality, not quantity. There is no need to include every single thing you ever did in high school.\n\nConsider whether you can combine similar or related activities into a single entry. For example, if you had more than one type of community service, you could have one entry for all of them.",
