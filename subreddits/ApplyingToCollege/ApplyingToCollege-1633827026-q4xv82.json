  "title:": "Sending my 9-weeks grades to colleges?",
  "text": "Basically, my situation is freshman and sophomore year I sadly didn't take any AP classes, as I didn't really care too much about school. Junior year I challenged myself and tested the waters of AP by taking 3 AP/DE classes. This year as a senior I am now taking 6 AP/DE classes. My school does grades by semester, but we get report cards every 9 weeks. Within this report card, I had all strong A's and my lowest grade was a 90 in AP BC Calc. Would it be a good idea to send my 9-weeks grades to some more competitive colleges? I feel like in doing so, it would allow colleges to see I'm more capable than I may seem based off my previous courseload and class rank. I talked to my counselor and she said if I wanted to I could, and I was planning on just sending an email with the grades and a link to my counselor's phone number and email. Is this a dumb idea? I've heard of people doing this for some competitive schools like UPenn, Princeton, etc., but I'm not applying to any Ivys. Mostly just T50 and T30 schools like Wake Forest, Boston College, UT Austin, etc. Thanks so much for your advice!",
