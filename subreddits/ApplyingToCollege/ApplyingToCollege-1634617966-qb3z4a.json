  "text": " I am applying EA nov 1st for a few colleges and I have opted for them to not consider my SAT scores for admissions because one of my seniors told me that my application will be considered separately. Since I am taking the SAT in dec I decided to go with his advice. However, I plan on sending the scores once I get them. Is it a good idea?",
