  "text": "Would majoring in biomedical engineering be the best path for me?\n\nI am a high school senior and I have been thinking about what I would like to major in. I want to go down the premed track and eventually go to med school. I was thinking about going into biomedical engineering. I am confident I could do well in the major since my favorite subjects are math and science and I excel at them. Also I couldn't decide between a life science or an engineering major, so biomedical engineering looks like a good mix of both. I would appreciate some insight into this major and whether this would be the best choice for me.",

      "text": "Yes, I think it\u2019s a great choice. You can be on the premed track and then go off to med school. But if your plans change and you decide that med school isn\u2019t the next step, you\u2019ll have a lot of outstanding career opportunities with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering.\n\nYou can search for colleges with accredited biomedical engineering programs (which are sometimes called Bioengineering) via the ABET website:\n\nhttps://www.abet.org\n\nAlso, one of our biomedical engineering professors at Syracuse University is hosting a sample class next week (Nov. 3, 7pm Eastern) called \u201cA Day in the Life of a Biomedical Engineer in the Hospital.\u201d This could give you some good insight about the field.

          "text": "They don't, but the engineering background is fantastic for training you to think better and to see the world more holistically. It pays dividends when it comes time for the MCAT and med schools also respect people who pursue their passions and have done things outside of the traditional premed tracks (e.g. chem, bio, neuro, etc)",
