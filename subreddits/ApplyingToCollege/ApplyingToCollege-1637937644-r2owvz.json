      "text": "Remember that even in college you'll need a life outside of it. What's the point of getting in if you're not living a life you like? Currently you're doing things you like, and, while they may not be college apps, they're helping you relax.\n\nBesides, if you're that burnt out you aren't going to get much done anyways. Take a breather, relax, and double back when you're ready.\n\nIf you need someone to talk to I guess my Reddit dms work as well as anything.",
