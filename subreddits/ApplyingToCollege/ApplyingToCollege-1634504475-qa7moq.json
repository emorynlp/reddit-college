  "text": "I'm applying to a Canadian uni which asks for 5 activities to help them understand more about who I am. I have currently decided on 3/5, and need to list 2 more. \n\nOut of these 3 options, which 2 do you think I should include? \n\n1) Trivia Club/Team - 10th and 12th grade (Present); 2-3hrs/week. We usually just do some practice amongst ourselves and have occasional games vs other schools, and an annual regional tournament. No significant achievements, but it was really fun/enjoyable. \n\n2) Volunteer work experience at grocery store/pharmacy - 90 hours total. I wasn't paid for this so I guess it's volunteer work, although it was set up through the school and I used some of these hours for graduation requirements. Worked in retail and pharmacy doing basic work. I could talk about skills I learned on my application.\n\n3) Volunteering at food bank - 30 hours total. I have only been doing this for three weeks and by the end of the application period I will have 30 hours. Unlike the grocery store this one was not for any school credit, I just did it for experience. Obviously this sounds more impressive than the grocery store experience but the only issue is the 30 vs 90 hours. There's no way for me to quickly boost the 30 hours that have been planned unfortunately. \n\nClearly I was not on top of my extracurricular activities during high school, but I have to make the best of what I've got. Which of these are the best 2 to list? Thanks so much for reading this.",
