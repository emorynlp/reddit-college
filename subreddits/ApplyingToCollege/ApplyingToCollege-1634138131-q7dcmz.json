  "text": "so my parents are surrounded by some individuals who are very snobbish. they basically degrade others all the time and always brag about their sons/daughters who have perfect everything (gpas, sats/acts/ecs). they genuinely believe with all their heart that their child has a 98% guaranteed admission at any ivy league and make it 1% higher for t20s. did I mention that they had the audacity to make fun of my parents because I had a 3.9 gpa with a mid 1400 range sat which I worked hard for and am proud and content with? they think anyone\u2019s stats that are below their child\u2019s stats are just trash and have no chance at any top college. they told me I should go to a state school at best which made me furious and this was said straight to my face with a smile. don\u2019t degrade and discourage people like that especially when you don\u2019t know how hard they worked for it is my point.\nanyways just a few days ago I heard that one of those individual\u2019s son has one safety and ironically, nyu is his safety school. his top choice is columbia but my only question is since when was nyu a safety???????? also he brags to me about his rigor courses and I literally have nothing to say. taking many aps/ibs and great standarized tests dont guarantee you admission at any reach. nothing can guarantee you admission. please stay humble and don\u2019t degrade others or flex like this individual and her son.\n\nedit: thank you so much to all the kind words. I just wanted to add because someone commented about my parents. my parents told me specifically that they don\u2019t care about prestige. they want me to go to a school that I\u2019ll be happy in, where I can meet diverse people and become friends with, and one that will let me reach my dream of becoming a neurologist.",

But when you apply to colleges where you\u2019re an amazing fit, colleges where you\u2019re somewhat of a fit and colleges that you\u2019re reaching for, the chances that you get rejected by all of them is extremely low. You\u2019ll likely get acceptances at places where your profile is at the top of the pool/middle of the pool. And the chance of this increases by volume. For example, I have a greater chance of being entirely rejected if I apply to one reach, one target and one safety vs. 10 reaches, 10 targets and 10 safeties.",

But in that scenario, a person probably wouldn\u2019t need it anyway. Because they aren\u2019t choosing it. In hindsight, it did the applicant no good. The safety was an insurance policy it turns out they didn\u2019t really need. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone believes they\u2019re T10 material and goes 0 for 10 or 1 for 10 there, they\u2019ve probably overestimated themselves. And their chance of admission to NYU isn\u2019t 80%+...because they overestimated themselves. NYU is no better than a target.\n\nIn other words, a safety isn\u2019t just an 80% chance. A safety is only a safety when you have a very strong possibility of acceptance in a scenario where you would actually consider it/need it, ie, when you\u2019ve probably overestimated your chance for admission at your most highly desired schools.\n\nYou don\u2019t assess insurance on the odds it will protect you when you don\u2019t need it.
