  "text": "I have two households: my mom at one and my dad + step-mom at another. \n\nI'm planning on filling out the fafsa based on my mom's income. \n\nWhen completing my applications, should I set my home address as my mom's address? How much would that matter?\n\nThe coalition application, for example, has one field for home address and one for mailing address. I put one house in the first field, and the other in the next.",

      "text": "Yes, if Mom has custody/primary caregiver then use her address for all. If you put coalition app mailing address with your dad's then any mail from coalition app colleges would go to your dad's. So it's probably best to use one address and share the information inperson with your dad.",
