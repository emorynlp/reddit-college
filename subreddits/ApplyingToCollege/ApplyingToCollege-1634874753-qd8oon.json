  "text": "Background: Indian (12th grade) doing Indian School Certificate Syllabus. Applying to US Universities.\n\nWith reference to academics, my school is uploading my First Term Examination scores which aren't up to mark. However, a friend of mine who has more or less scores the same as me in these exams believes his AP scores will give him a greater advantage and increase his chances of getting into a good college.  \n\n\nIs his statement correct? Do colleges weed out students by academics first and then look at standardised test scores like AP? Thanks!",

                      "text": "So there are a couple of different benefits of AP courses. \n1. Taking the course and getting a good grade shows you can handle very rigorous coursework. This helps with admissions. \n2. The score you get on the AP exam can help with admissions (but is not as important as the grade from the course). You can choose which AP scores to submit as part of your application. People will usually submit if they get a 4 or 5 (sometimes a 3 depending on the school). Generally rule is submit the score if the college would give college credit for it. \n3. Completely unrelated to admissions the college, once you are accepted, may give college credit based on the score you received on the exam.",
