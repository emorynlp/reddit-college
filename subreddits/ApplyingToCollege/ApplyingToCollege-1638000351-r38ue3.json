Right now I am currently attending UC Riverside for Computer Science and would like to give a shot in transferring to a higher ranked college. Also I do not like the vibe in the college, so a new place anywhere would be good to start. I looking for anything above UCR for Computer Science. Please help me out. Thanks in advance.",
