  "text": "Hurricane Ida caused my dad to lose his house. We\u2019ve had a place to stay since the hurricane, but with repairs & relocating, money is very tight & application fees are not something I was considering until very recently. My family income is not one which qualifies me for most fee waivers otherwise. Would these circumstances qualify me for one? Through CommonApp or through direct contact with the colleges to which I\u2019m applying.",
