  "text": "Since most college apps are due Jan,\nAnd spring semester (for me) starts late December\nWill there even be a point to these classes? \nHow does it work exactly, I live in GA if that helps \nI hope it does count or that AP Physics is useless suffering",

      "text": "If you\u2019re taking an AP class, the AP test is in May, which can earn college credit. You likely won\u2019t do well if you blow off classes starting in January.\n\nCollege acceptances are also contingent on successful completion of your courses. Get a D in Physics and you might see your college acceptance rescinded.\n\nSome may have valedigorian/salutatorian and various HS awards based on late grades.\n\nGetting sloppy in late high school sets you up poorly to start college, which will be much more rigorous than high school.",
