  "text": "I will start by apologizing for my English, I am neither a native nor fluent speaker. I'm sorry!\n\nHi guys, so I am a Brazilian student who graduated from high school in 2018 with satisfactory academic grades, however, I have few CE activities that are really relevant to my community, let alone academic awards, which mostly boil down to elementary school. I live in Brazil, and in the schools I attended during my life, I was not encouraged to do different CEs and ended up not having the aspiration to participate in regional competitions. The most relevant being an Olympics that i participated in the middle of elementary school. I lived my entire high school life to take the national Brazilian vestibular known as ENEM (National High School Exam) and other state vestibulars.\n\n  However, when I graduated from high school, I decided to take a sabbatical year (2019) to think about what I really wanted to do in my life and what my goals were, I really at the time was very undecided about my options for a college, until one thing I dreamed of in school came back to my heart, but thought impossible for a teenager who wasn't a \"genius\", which was to study at an American university. I was quite frustrated because of the strong academic curricula required for an application.\n\n  In 2020, the pandemic came, and I unfortunately went through a terrible period with brutal anxiety attacks, while my father was in ICU because of Covid, by this time I was going into a fear spiral. Fortunately, I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder), something that has negatively influenced my life since childhood, and I am sure that social phobia prevented me from doing much leadership and volunteer work in my school years. I believe that the pandemic changed me a lot as a human being, I would say that I had an \"epiphany\" in relation to my life, my social circle, and my dreams, I felt deep in my heart (without bs here) that I wanted to make cinematic arts. The area of cinema has fascinated me since childhood, but as I said above, I was never influenced to follow this path in my academic life. Here in Brazil, cinema is still a very discriminated and undervalued area, so the schools and mainly the parents, don't give much incentive, it's always medicine, law, engineering, so I really chose not to follow it. Because of this epiphany in my life, I fell in love with USC, I loved everything I read about the university (ok, I also found out about the frauds, but anyways) and ended up getting frustrated, because even if I did an application, it would be impossible to be approved, even if I could pay for the college, which I also know offers little or no support for international students. So, I ended up thinking about studying dentistry in Brazil, since it is an area that I like, and then follow a post-graduation course in the USA, which I haven't talked about in this post, but it is a place that I really love since childhood and would like to live. I had this idea in mind for a while, always thinking about dedicating myself to the academic milestones and activities of university life, but there were always doubts and uncertainties about this course, I don't know if I really want to do dentistry and I think that all this is making me enter a spiral of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). \n\nA fact that marked me this week was the death of the singer Marilia Mendon\u00e7a (rest in peace) also a Brazilian born in my state and raised in my city, Goi\u00e2nia. She was so young and had a bright future in her career. This made me rethink my last attitudes and think about what I really want in my life and yk we are fragile and transient, so I wanted to be happy as I am, with my aspirations and my dreams. Last Sunday I ended up finding out about the international diploma that is offered in some Brazilian high schools, but I never had the opportunity to participate, I felt quite frustrated with something that was out of my reach, and unfortunately now my age and school diploma already prevent me from trying the IB. So I was really \"envious\"(not in a bad way) of the kids who had this opportunity, which definitely opened a lot of doors. I ended up learning about community colleges in the USA and their transfers to universities, but I don't feel that my entire academic life so far would serve for me to follow this path, plus I imagine that a post-graduate degree, especially at USC is very difficult. So I've been daydreaming about some career possibilities: I intend to enter a Brazilian university, and dedicate myself a lot in the academic environment, besides looking for extracurricular activities and projects that are related to my aspirations and my university core, and who knows, maybe in the future transfer or apply to study in the USA, and... maybe USC. I am looking for tips and advice from everyone to follow my path, but especially from international students, I feel like I lose hope every day to realize this dream and also feel like a failure academically and as a human being, but anyway, I appreciate anyone who can read this post and help me out on what you guys think. \n\ntl;dr: international student on sabbatical years with dreams of studying cinematic arts especially at USC in the future, I need advice for someone who has not been encouraged in academic life to participate in many projects and extracurricular activities in the community.",

      "text": "As a Brazilian guy myself, I can pretty much relate to everything you said. It is so unfortunate that Brazilian schools often do not give enough information about studying abroad. However, **this, by no means, represents an academic failure.**\n\nAlthough it could've been way easier to study abroad if you had discovered the whole college application process by the beginning of your High School, you are not too late or too old to pursue this dream. Indeed, it is harder to go to undergrad schools now (especially because you've already enrolled in a Brazilian university), but you still have the possibility of pursuing exchange programs and/or post-graduate degrees.\n\nIf I were you, I'd DEFINITELY learn more about studying abroad after college. Some great resources to get started are [BRASA](https://www.home.gobrasa.org/) (they actually have a Facebook group for people interested in pursuing graduate degrees abroad) and [EducationUSA](https://www.educationusa.org.br/).\n\nAlso, I do appreciate your interest in going to USC, but I believe that affordability is a key factor for choosing a university. As far as I know, USC doesn't offer good financial aid for Brazilian students\u2014and this is something you should be aware of. If you're looking for more affordable opportunities, I'd definitely consider applying to schools in Europe\u2014there are many universities offering courses in English.\n\nAnd, also, please, NEVER apologize for your English skills. Your English is great, and even if it weren't, you have no reason to be ashamed of it. Speaking a foreign language\u2014even if poorly\u2014only demonstrates effort, courage, and intelligence.\n\nKeep grinding! I hope everything will end up fine for you! You are not a failure!",
