  "title:": "Rising seniors: The college application process you\u2019ve been taught is a lie.",
  "text": "It\u2019s the start of the application cycle, and I can already see the stress building on this sub. \n\n*Is this a good essay topic? When should I start drafting? How many supplements should I expect to write?*\n\nMany of my high school classmates told me they felt overwhelmed with their applications. They sacrificed hobbies, clubs, time with friends and family, and sleep to complete them.\n\nI had the opposite experience, and it\u2019s because I broke from the traditional application timeline taught in schools and (often) on this subreddit.\n\nThe **traditional application process** looks something like this:\n\nComplete a polished Common App essay in the early fall.\nScramble to write supplements before the deadlines because they\u2019re untouched until the personal statement is complete.\nFocus exclusively on college applications until January.\n\n**There are multiple flaws with the traditional application process.**\n\nFirst, the Common App essay is the most intimidating essay for many people. It has a high word count, an almost unlimited range of topics, and is \u201cthe biggest deal.\u201d If you\u2019re not used to writing, especially not about yourself, this is a hard place to start.\n\nBecause so much emphasis is put on starting out with the Common App essay, supplements aren\u2019t given the attention they deserve. You\u2019ll often draft them at the last minute or Frankenstein them together. The traditional timeline doesn\u2019t give you much wiggle room if you struggle with a specific supplement, need more time to come up with a good idea, or realize you\u2019ve missed an essay entirely. \n\nThis timeline also makes it **harder to focus on scholarships.**\n\nMany major scholarships (GE-Reagan, Elks, Cameron Impact, Coke Scholars, Equitable Excellence, Point Foundation, Daughters of the American Revolution) have deadlines starting in September. There are tons in December, and the major national scholarships mostly wrap up by mid-January \u2014 right when the average senior is still scrambling to finish their college applications. Local scholarship deadlines start to trickle in during January (though there may be a few before), but most deadlines are in March and April. \n\nThe result is a packed application period, and because EA and RD deadlines overlap with some of the biggest national scholarship deadlines, you\u2019re likely to miss a scholarship you\u2019re a good fit for because you don\u2019t have the capacity for additional essays. \n\nFinally, cramming essay-writing leads to burnout. By January, when the most convenient, low-hanging fruit of local scholarships starts to pop up, you might be too exhausted to pull together more essays.\n\n**Here\u2019s an alternative application timeline.**\n\n**June:**\n\nMake a spreadsheet for your college applications that lists the deadline, supplements from last year, and prompts. Some prompts may change, but the vast majority won\u2019t.\n\nCreate a schedule for supplement drafting. Divide the number of essays by the number of weeks you have until the end of September. If you\u2019re writing over 40 supplements with 150 or more words, you should consider extending that by another month, but that will be pretty rare.\n\nBegin writing the supplements, starting with the ones you feel most comfortable with, and keeping in mind any early application deadlines you have.\n\nStart to brainstorm Common App essay topics. These may come to mind as you\u2019re drafting the supplements and think of an alternate essay idea. Lots of reflection; reading memoirs, fiction, and autobiographies; and journaling will all help, but don\u2019t focus too much on this step.\n\n**July:**\n\nContinue writing supplements and brainstorming Common App essay topics.\n\nDraft your activities section, honors section, and additional information (if applicable). This shouldn\u2019t take more than a few hours for a first draft.\n\nStart a spreadsheet for scholarship applications and their deadlines. Keep those essays in mind during the following months.\n\n**August:**\n\nContinue writing supplements. \n\nStart focusing on a Common App essay more seriously. Read through the resources on the A2C Wiki. Start reserving time to think of potential topics, even if it means you\u2019re staring at a blank Google Doc. Think about elements of yourself the AO can\u2019t learn from ECs, recommendations, and other essays. By mid-August, take the essay topic that sticks out to you the most (or the two), and write a messy draft. This doesn\u2019t have to be your final product.\n\nPolish your activities, honors, and additional information sections.\n\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next.\n\n**September:**\n\nContinue writing supplements. You should aim to finish by the end of the month.\n\nStart the Common App essay. Write the first draft. Revise it. Get a second look. Write another draft. Revise it. Get a second look. Rinse and repeat, possibly with multiple topics. By now, you should be done with your supplements (or at least very close to done).\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next.\n\n**October:**\n\nContinue the Common App essay. After focusing exclusively on it for a month and practicing with other essays, you should hopefully be done by the end of October since early action deadlines often start in November.\n\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next.\n\nUpdate your activities, honors, and additional information section with any new information you want colleges to know for early action deadlines.\n\n**November:**\n\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next several. \n\n**December:**\n\nUpdate your activities, honors, and additional information section with any new information you want colleges to know for regular decision deadlines.\n\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next several. \n\n**January - May:**\n\nWrite any scholarship essays that are due this month, or that you have time to work on for the next several.",

I'd like to add (and people can tweak timing on this):\n\n**June/July**\n\n* Check with each university/college to see if interviews are required, especially if you plan to apply to an honors program. Might be extra essays and different deadlines also.\n* Check with each university/college to find out what their preferred deadlines are for those seeking merit aid.  Sometimes it's earlier than the regular decision deadline.\n* Schedule visits (if possible and convenient) and (potentially) interviews.\n\n**August/September**\n\n* A couple of weeks after school starts, ask your teachers for letters of recommendation if you haven't already.\n* 3 weeks before your plan to submit your application, put in a request with your counselor to have your transcripts sent to the school(s).\n* 3 weeks before you plan to submit your application, check in with the people writing your letters of recommendation to make sure they've done it or will do so soon.\n* Check with your school counseling office to see if the transcripts they send include dual-enrollment transcripts from the college involved. Some do, some have the student request them themselves.\n\n**October/November/December**\n\n* About a week after you submit your application, make sure the university/college received everything that should have been submitted by everyone.\n* Check your email or portal frequently for updates on your application status.\n\nAfter that keep checking your email or portal frequently for updates. CHECK YOUR SPAM OR JUNK MAIL FOLDER, too.",

That serves to remind them of your strengths and involvement in activities. It also helps in case they're not sure what to write and aren't particularly good at writing letters of recommendation. Include a deadline for them to submit - and make that deadline a week or longer before the letter is absolutely due to your university/college just in case you end up needing a little longer to nudge them to complete it. \n\nThen follow up a few weeks later to make sure they get submitted.",

My high school requires 1st draft of essay by May 1st (as part of English class), in order to get feedback from teacher and counsellor before summer. They also require a list of the schools you want to apply to (safety, goal, reach) so they can give feedback as to whether they are realistic, and guide you on related gaps/testing requirements for each in April. Additionally, requests for reference letters (with accompanying resume) must be submitted by May 1st so teachers have the summer to write them thoughtfully. \nThen the refining begins over the summer and you are done in the fall in time for ED & scholarship apps, and those that need to boost their SAT scores can focus on that!",

A personal statement is a very different piece of writing with a very different set of goals than what most students do for their English classes (usually). Attaching a grade to it, or having students complete it within the context of a class, can push students into topics, style, and structure that aren\u2019t conducive for impact in an admissions process.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s the deep and often invisible person growth students go through. If we\u2019re talking about the maturity and intellectual prowess of a teenager, there\u2019s often a BIG difference between  May and October of that year. Start too early on that essay and you\u2019ll anchor yourself in a version of who you are that isn\u2019t as interesting or compelling as the person you\u2019re about to be.\n\nMy two cents.",

So many of these situations depend on the student. \n\nI think assigning the essay for a class *can* be helpful if done thoughtfully. I know many students who wrote something directly in the text box and called it a day; for them, some structure, intentional exploration of resources, and adult feedback can be transformative. But for a typical A2Cer who would go out of their way to iterate and learn about the process, I can see the exact issue that you\u2019re referencing play out. \n\nSimilarly, if the student is willing to treat a May draft as a first draft and explore other ideas that come along, then getting some early practice isn\u2019t a bad idea. If it\u2019s a situation where they\u2019ll stick with what they\u2019ve written the first time around and avoid other potentially more captivating topics, then it would be a problem.\n\nWhether or not most students can accurately evaluate where in the balance they fall in both of those situations is a different matter entirely.",

Update recommenders on the writing process, and draft scholarship essays/do scholarship research.\n\nAugust/September: Finalize supplements and scholarship essays, and drop all essays in. Ensure that recommenders have at least a month before the EA deadline to write for me. Turn everything in as soon as possible afterward (even RD choices- I\u2019m really trying not to delay the inevitable here). \n\nSeptember-May: Look for third party scholarships, and draft/edit at least 2 every week.",

      "text": "I mostly agree but here's my two cents (with a big caveat that everyone's different):\n\n\\- when you make that spreadsheet with prompts put in word count + bold any that double up or are very similar (save yourself some writing!) \n\n\\- check the deadlines for being considered for merit aid\n\n\\- I would DRAFT your common app essay first. Why? Because every school will get it. It's the foundation of your application. The supplements are the walls and decorations. You can't decorate a house that doesn't exist. Do not try to perfect it! But, it's good to know the information schools will already have when drafting supplements. \n\n\\- Set aside a certain amount of time a day to write. I would write for an hour a day and just bang out as much as I can. This way I got the drafts in + then could spend more time editing + not get in my head while writing \n\n\\- CHECK THAT YOUR SCHOOLS HAVE RELEASED THIS YEARS PROMPTS BEFORE WRITING. By June/July enough schools will have released to keep you busy. Do not be me and be stupid and write an amazing essay you can't use bc it was last years prompt! You will be sad! \n\n\\- Don't forget about the common app questions + college specific questions! \n\n\\- Think about who you are. Your application is basically a 12 page letter to the AO saying \"You want me on your campus because I am \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" Come up with a list of some adjectives that describe you, some activties that are most important etc bc this is what you should come back to when you're stuck on an essay",

I would just start working on those first (+ wait for your other schools to release prompts for this year). I think it's a good idea to have some sense of what your common app essay is about first, but writing them either way is fine",
