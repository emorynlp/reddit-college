  "title:": "Will SAT score send issues affect my EA UMD application?",
  "text": "I ordered an SAT score send to Maryland on 10/29 (my fault for not sending early but horseshit that CB both makes you pay for doing something that is free and has delivery time for sending 1s and 0s) and CommonApp said that you just needed to have sent it by the time you submitted your application. I just got my Terps Application Portal checklist and it says that my application is incomplete because my score reports are not there. On the CB score send site it just says that the date next is N/A and the status is pending. Will this situation affect my application status? Will I not be considered for Early Action if the score sends after the deadline (I have the receipt for ordering it before the deadline). If my app is not considered, will it be bumped to the general pool or would I need to apply again?",
