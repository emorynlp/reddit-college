              "text": "No, you would update your scores in the admission portal you receive after submitting your app, if the college accepts self-reported scores. Other colleges still require an official report prior to admission so for those, you'd need to order a score report after your score is released.\n\n(When you submit an app to a college, the college receives whatever is in the app at that moment in time. Later changes to the common app are not transmitted to the college.)",

I have a dilemma because the Oct 23 ACT is my first ACT, but I don't know if I should choose to have my colleges review my ACT score or not because I don't have the test result yet.",
