  "text": "The recommenders ferpa part has a green check even tho my counselor has not written her recommendation and my applications are due this Friday bc my school makes us submit them two weeks earlier so they can process everyone\u2019s stuff in time. Since the application technically isn\u2019t due until November 1, if I submit it on Friday can my counselor still be working on and submit my recommendation?",

      "text": "Yes. The few schools that actually want EVERYTHING in house on deadline day make that really clear in their instructions. For most, they will accept supporting documents from teachers and counselors for a looooong time after deadline. \n\nCase in point, [this call for missing credentials](http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/2015/11/missing-credentials-emails-from-uva.html). The application deadline was November 1. Check the date on the post.",
