  "text": "I applied to the University of Vermont. I have plenty of extracurriculars, solid leadership, and above average GPA and above average SAT scores based on their past reported ones. I am also in an academy (my school district has public school academies based on fields of study). I have a very good personal essay (in my opinion), which is the required one.\n\n\nHowever, for the Why Us optional, I wrote about my experience in New England (as a Southerner with family from Maine), and how it positively affected my mental health, and how the University of Vermont offers a perfect environment, culture, and area for me to grow in the next 4 years of my life. Based on other advice I see here, I'm basically concluding that was the worst Why Us essay I could have written. \n\n\nTo what extent will the UVM admissions office judge my application overall based off the Why Us essay? Will it negatively impact my chances as a whole?",
