  "text": "Hello.\n\nI just want to preface this by saying most of my extracurriculars are incredibly common, but I have one in particular that I want to emphasize in my EC descriptions.\n\nHow should I word them? It is a software project I have with my country's largest software NGO, but I've been told writing \"working on a software project with the country's largest software NGO\" makes me look too arrogant.\n\nIs this true? If it is, how should I word it? This EC really becomes a typical EC without the software NGO part, so I want to emphasize that it is the largest in the country.\n\nI'm not looking for alternatives, but direct answers to how I should word this extracurricular to preserve its significance while not coming off as a braggart.",
