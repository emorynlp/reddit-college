If you don't want a college to consider your test scores, simply delete them from the Testing section of the Common App before submitting to that college.  Then re-enter the scores before submitting the app to a different college where you want them to see the scores.\n\n(Of course, this is in addition to checking, or not, the test optional box in the app or portal.)",

You can answer yes for some and no for others.\n\nIf you want, you can enter scores, release the app to those you want to use the scores, then delete them and release to the other schools. When you release an application, it sends the current state of the application. Changes are not sent to schools that have already been released.\n\nBut there\u2019s no real need to do so.",
