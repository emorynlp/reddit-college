  "title:": "Does the IB actually help with university?",
  "text": "(this is actually actually a copy of a post I made on r/IBO) \n\nSo, I'm a Canadian student living in the Province of Ontario. I'm thinking  about doing the IB program for high school but I heard conflicting  advice about whether or not the IB actually helps to get in prestigious  universities/do universities actually consider the IB. I heard that most  Canadian universities would only look at your Ontario report card and  your grades and don't care about the IB when choosing who to accept.  Attending the IB would actually disadvantage you as the more challenging  courses amount to lower percent grades when translated to the Ontario  report card.\n\nFurthermore, does the  IB facilitate getting scholarships? Preferably, I would want to go to  the US for uni but I know that tuition costs a fortune there. Would  going to the IB help me get a scholarship in the US(even if it's for  less prestigious universities)? What about in Canada?\n\nThanks!",
