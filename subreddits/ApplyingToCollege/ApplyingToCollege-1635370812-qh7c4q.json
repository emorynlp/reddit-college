      "text": "Applicants may submit two portfolios in the Music & Theater Arts category if they, for example, play two instruments equally well, or they both compose music and perform music and would like to submit a portfolio for each. Since the SlideRoom only allows one submission per portfolio type, to submit multiple Music & Theater Arts portfolios, applicants must create a separate SlideRoom account using a different email address for each account.  \n\n\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ask-me-anything-about-portfolios/",
