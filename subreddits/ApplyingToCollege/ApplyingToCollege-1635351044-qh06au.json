  "title:": "Is not having a CSS non-custodial parent waiver form accepted grounds to back out of ED?",
  "text": "I want to apply ED to Northwestern, but I fear that if the waiver form isn't accepted I'll be locked into a tuition rate I can't pay for. The form *should* be accepted, as my father hasn't been a part of my life for years and there's been abusive situations, but in the case that it doesn't I need to know that I'll be alright financially. Any insight would be appreciated!",
