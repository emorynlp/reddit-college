  "text": "I am taking 15 credits this semester, and I took a 3 credit class over summer. I am doing well in other classes, but I am struggling through this 5 credit calculus class. I missed the deadline to drop a class without it showing on my transcript. But if I drop the class, I will not be considered as full time enrolment, but my advisor says that it doesn\u2019t matter. I am currently enrolled in a top50 university and am aiming to get into a top25 school, especially USC. I am wondering whether I should drop this coure or not, and does full time enrolment matter when applying?",
