My No. 1 school is super close, and the most prestigious, but likely the most expensive. My 2nd choice should give me decent money and is relatively close, but it hasn't given me that feeling yet of wanting it to be the place I go to. My 3rd choice has me hooked with almost everything about it, it's just that it's the farthest away school I've applied to, and I think I won't be receiving a ton of aid compared to other schools.",
