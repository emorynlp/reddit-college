  "text": "I really dont know what to believe because some people say test optional doesnt hurt chances, and others say that test optional will hurt chances. I have a 710 in math, and im applying to a decent amount of ivies. My composite score is a 1490 supescore, with a 780 in E&R and 710 in math. Im applying for finance...but im wondering if I should just apply test optional to the ivies? Because as far as I know, my math sat score may be below the 25th percentile///",
