There's very little information to make any good guess on whether she cheated academically or not. She might've or she might've not. People are different. You can't guess what she mightve done from what \"people normally do\" in such situations in your own views.\n\nBut for one, people are here emotionally support the poster, and for that it's better to assume that she did cheat. Also, most people think with their emotions. And I'm saying all this knowing that I'll be downvoted to hell after this.",

For example, I took this as a joke that had little meaning in reference to the accused ex-gf, so i did not see her as terrible or a cheater, and i took it as OP just drawing funny connections. I\u2019m showing you the other side. and yes, i do frequently enjoy \u201cironic\u201d bigotry on the internet because i enjoy humor all around and i think it is among the most vital windows into human experience, culture, and differing perspectives and worldviews. But I do see much of what you are saying as well, I just disagree with some of it, like that people who read OP\u2019s statement take away from it that the ex-gf is \u201call around terrible and doesn\u2019t deserve any success\u201d.

                              "text": "Immense[value in online bigotry]. I don\u2019t routinely, or really ever, participate in it myself, but yes, I believe it has great value. Mostly for the reasons I listed in the previous reply(experience, culture, perspectives, blah). I should also mention that i\u2019m mainly referring to bigotry intended to be humorous, like classical racist jokes for example. I don\u2019t find them all funny, but they always have revealed meaning to me, since I was young. For me, this has always came from the thought that not everything you hear or see is true, but at the same time everybody can have their own truth through deciding what is valuable or meaningful to them. This is displayed well with jokes or statements that you would refer to as bigotry, because there is a radically wide spectrum of views and feelings when encountering, creating, or deciphering these things. That\u2019s why I see them as unbelievably fascinating and useful for diving into human thought. Also, I believe since you downvoted my earlier reply(or maybe someone else did), it is giving me a timer before I can send this reply. I never use reddit so didn\u2019t know about this. This might be the stupidest feature of any application or website I have ever seen.",

I lost an award for an AP class to the person I gave free tutoring in the class to, when we had the same grade, because they had a .02 higher GPA than me overall. I lost a national competition due to a biased jury, which the director of the competition sent me a personalised apology note for saying that I had been done wrong. There will be scholarships, schools, and what not as well.\nBut you know what? That\u2019s okay. \n\nIt\u2019s too embedded in especially American culture, \u201cthey ARE a researcher, they ARE a genius, they ARE valedictorian, they ARE the x junior fellowship recipients, etc.\u201d The focus on a title in insanity. Let us frame these as they are: \u201cthey study and then write about a field they are passionate about (researcher), they have had many failures but some amazing creations within those (genius), they worked incredibly hard and did well in their classes (valedictorian), they assist in study with a think tank (fellow), etc.\u201d \nBeing passed over for things hurts at the moment, but this isn\u2019t your end goal. If this was your dream, then move on - because you already achieved it. You did incredible things that put you in an excellent spot for your next move. Screw the title. No one in five years is going to ask about your high school ranking. No one is going to ask what scholarships you got - a mentor of mine apparently received Fulbright incredibly young, but never mentions it in academic settings. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t matter. They are vehicles to _help_ you achieve your dream. And if this was your dream, then find a bigger dream.\n\nCongratulations",

It is by no means a straightforward and objective process which effectively allocates admissions solely based off merit. I will admit, getting into a good college is generally a strong indicator of your worth; however, when you factor things such as people's private connections and privileges, you instantly realize how corrupt and unfair the system can get.\n\nTl;dr\nJust because she got into Harvard doesn't mean anything at face value.
