  "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] \u2014 Brown University will make significant investments to expand financial aid and improve college access, bolstered by the extraordinary performance of the University\u2019s endowment and the success of its BrownTogether comprehensive fundraising campaign.\n\nIn a Monday, Oct. 25, letter to the Brown community following weekend meetings of the Corporation of Brown University, President Christina H. Paxson announced initiatives in three areas. Brown will (1) significantly increase scholarships for moderate-income students, and also reduce the summer earnings expectation for high-need students; (2) move toward need-blind admissions for international students; and (3) develop a program that prepares talented students from public schools in Providence for college.\n\nWith the new investments in financial aid, Brown will fully cover tuition for families earning $125,000 or less with typical assets. In addition, students of families making less than $60,000 a year with typical assets will receive scholarships that cover all expenses\u2014 tuition, room, board and books \u2014 and additional scholarship to help support other expenses. \n\nAnd becoming fully need-blind for international students in the coming years will significantly expand the University\u2019s ability to attract and educate the most promising international students from all socioeconomic groups. \n\n[Read the full press release here.](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-10-25/access)",
