If you have concerns, call them. \n\nAre you a domestic student applying and submitting FAFSA/CSS? The FAFSA scrapes your parents information directly off the IRS database. The CSS has you input similar numbers directly off tax returns- only the current year numbers are estimated. If you have an error in estimating current income, call the schools for how to correct.",
