      "text": "Demonstrated interest most likely means whether your regional AO notices you or not. Are you emailing them insightful questions, are you showing up to webinars, are you signing up for stuff, etc. I don't know about you, but if a certain student's name keeps showing up to the point where you recognize them, I would think it's a good indicator that they're keen on attending said college. Whether the school actually factors it in or not is up for debate, but it's exactly what the term says, \"demonstrated interest\". If they specifically state they factor it, they wouldn't lie about it though.",

      "text": "It's my understanding that some schools track the interactions between potential students and the school, but just for marketing and research purposes. They want to know what's working and have aggregate data about their reach, but they don't break it down by individual or at teach a person's name to it.\n\nIf a school states that they don't track it and have reported that on the Common Data Set, then you can believe it. Many large schools don't have time to take a deep dive into individual applications that way. They don't need to.",
