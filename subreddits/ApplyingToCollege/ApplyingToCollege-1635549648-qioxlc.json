  "title:": "Too much stress for you student... it'll all be ok.",
  "text": "I've witnessed too much stress from students. Students tell me about their major mental and emotional health issues. It's far too much to get into here. As a father, it makes me really concerned.    \n\n\nI know not everyone can afford it but get help. Whether it's a therapist or private college consultant or whoever, reach out and ask for help. Get some adult perspective. Life always seems hard and insurmountable but there is so much to it than some \"top school\". Please don't value yourself by your achievements.    \n\n\nIt takes a village to \"succeed\" (however you define success). Life isn't like taking a test in school or SATs. Getting help isn't cheating! That's how everything in life and business works. No one person does much of anything alone.  \n\n\nGet help and if you can't afford it that doesn't mean you can't ask.   \n\n\nI'm in a unique position right now and I'd help any of you pro bono that ask. Check out my user history. I haven't been here long but I'd love to help.  \n\n\nGood luck to you all!",
