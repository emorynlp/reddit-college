  "title:": "I feel bad for those kids that never got to go to college",
  "text": "I know I'm a little late, but I've been thinking. The parkland kids never got to go through all the stress of high school or college apps. Someone pointed out to me today that they lost their lives in the very place that was supposed to be a set up for the rest of their lives. They were supposed to go into the world, pull all-nighters, and drink gallons of coffee with friends. Now they can't. I just hope that anyone who sees this will take a moment and stop to think of the seventeen people who died three years ago and will never get to enjoy the small things ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd please don't make this a political argument about gun control. This is purely for remembrance sake. Let this be your reminder to have a moment of silence and honor those kids. And be thankful that even though we're incredibly stressed now, we get the opportunity to be stressed. Appreciate that you have a future.",

She knows some of the students who became activists and have been the subject of witchhunts. \n\nThose 17 victims were real people who had families and friends and lives they were supposed to live. Even all the students who weren't killed were traumatized for life by sitting in a dark room, hearing gunshots, not knowing if they were going to live to see their families again. \n\nAfter meeting her, I don't know if I'll ever see Valentine's day the same way again.",
