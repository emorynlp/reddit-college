  "text": "Its already December and I've just begun the college application process. Truth be told I either blocked the stuff out of denial or didn't have any knowledge about the process to begin with. Now that I'm backed into a corner I've been trapped in this feedback loop of looking back at what I was doing 3 months ago and crying about how I should have spent my time. I don't have any friends atm so I really don't have anyone to ask for help apart from screaming into the void here. Scholarship applications for schools are basically due in two days and so are the application deadlines for many places. This plus finals week is taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nI feel as though I was never told about how all of this stuff works in the first place. I didn't hear my parents talking about it nor my classmates and teachers.  I was just focused on getting good grades (not even that great fyi). I was never in a close relationship with my teachers and although I joined my schools national honor society chapter and did some community service, I didn't join any clubs that I was passionate about. Then boom. here I am in the end of thanksgiving break of my senior year just beginning to realize the situation I'm in.  Is there anything that can be done? idk this is the first time posting on this subreddit and I'm trying to vent somewhere.",

You need to apply to at least some colleges which admit 50%+ of their applicants. \n\nStart with a search on one of these:\n\nwww.Cappex.com\n\nhttps://bigfuture.collegeboard.org\n\nAlso, start working on the FAFSA for financial aid eligibility. Note that some colleges also require the CSS Profile for financial aid.",
