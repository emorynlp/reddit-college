There's a big difference between being unable to apply because the cost is too high and being unable to apply because your parents said so. \n\nED is binding but with an exception. The exception being that fin aid is too low. No matter what an AO says, that's how it is. Schools can't force you to attend especially if you don't have the means to pay.",
