But freshman and senior year grades are NOT included in the GPA calculation.** UC-approved Honors, AP, IB and community college courses are weighted. For out-of-state applicants, only AP, IB, and community college courses are considered advanced coursework, honors courses are not weighted (but be sure to label your honors courses so they can be taken into consideration when your application is evaluated). **Competitive UCs like Berkeley and UCLA look at both unweighted and fully weighted GPA. Keep in mind that only your semester grades (or whatever grades that show up on your high school transcript) are used in the GPA calculation so don\u2019t worry too much about what\u2019s on your progress report if you expect your semester grades to be good.**\r  \n\r  \nThis content is copyrighted and retrieved from https://askmssun.com/academic-preparation-high-school/\n\nIndia\r  \nAdmission requirement \r  \n\r  \nYou must complete both year X and XII state board or CBSE examinations, with average marks above 70 and no mark below 60.
