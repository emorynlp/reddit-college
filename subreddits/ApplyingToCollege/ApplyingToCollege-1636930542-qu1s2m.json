  "text": "I looked up this question on the internet, and they suggest that if you are privileged that I should basically pull the \"I have black friends\" card. That is so fucked up to me. Yeah I'm a girl. Yeah I'm gay. Yeah I'm Jewish but having trouble connecting to my culture because my family isn't devout since they moved to America. But I don't want to write about that. I'm privileged and not special. And the fact that I have friends from africa shouldn't make me special either. I have to turn this short response in tomorrow (but my goal is today) and I am stuck. I think it's a stupid question. I feel so fake writing it.",

I think we just gotta pick a more conceptual identity outside outside of race/religion/gender/sexuality and just run with it. If you have an activity that you're really involved with, think about your role in it. How you fit in to different groups of people, that kind of stuff.\n\nBest of luck, manifesting inspiration for both of us!",

I'm diverse because I'm a Patriots fan in the middle of Kansas City. I didn't write about my Judaism or black friends, I wrote about something completely nonpolitical. I'd be willing to bet most admission officers are reading supplement after supplement and thinking \"another story about politics\" and then it's like \"finally, something that isn't political\"",
