  "text": "currently, my parents have enough money to send me without aid. but, i\u2019m honestly afraid that they won\u2019t have money for all four years because my dad has a track record of being \u2026. unreliable \u2026\n\ni know i could just ask for aid right now since yale is need-blind, but ive heard so many people speculate that this isnt necessarily true.. i dont want me asking for aid to weight my application down\n\nso, can i ask for aid in the future if i say no right now?\n\ni\u2019m applying to yale by the way",
