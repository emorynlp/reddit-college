  "title:": "Seniors applying to college are damn toxic",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been eavesdropping in class for the past few weeks, and the loudest group has been discussing college apps and college choice and whatnot. Whether heckling someone they overheard or talking about somewhere they want to go, they just can\u2019t fight the urge to express their opinion that non-prestigious = worthless.\n\nAs someone applying to \u201ccrappy\u201d schools because I\u2019d rather not be in debt for nearly equivalent education, and someone friends with people in a similar boat, it gets on my nerves when they loudly shout \u201cif you get into (second best school in state) but not (best school I\u2019m state), you should just take a gap year and try again\u201d \u201cjeez, (non-T20) school is **terrible**, I\u2019d kill myself if I had to go there\u201d, or any time a teacher mentions doing bad in class or anything related, they\u2019ll joke \u201cwelp, guess you have to go to (2nd best in state/local cc).\u201d As if that\u2019s the end of the fucking world.\n\nAnd they literally never talk about anything else. It\u2019s one thing to joke about it once or twice, but it\u2019s like they\u2019ve made their entire life revolve around state schools/ccs being hell on earth and UCs (oos) being the pinnacle. \n\nI know the words of one group of friends isn\u2019t the sentiment of everyone, but when a 30-strong group at a school with 100/grade can\u2019t drop it, it starts to seem more like a theme than a one-off. \n\nThey\u2019re generally nice people too, so I guess imma bit disappointed in them.",

My friend got into UO and she'll definitely get into \"better\" colleges as well, but I still told her good job since it was the first college she's heard back from. She just kind of scrunched up her face and said \"It's not like I'm gonna go there\". I know people who would be happy to get in, so it was pretty annoying. I wish people talked about college less at school. It gets so stressful and everyone compares themselves to each other.",

I have buddies from HS that went to state schools and do well, one that did community college and then a university that isn\u2019t top 100 for his bachelors and is now at a T10 grad school. I also have a buddy that did the ivy route for undergrad and grad. None of us think less of each other, and if anything, we are just happy with the paths that we took.",

      "text": "I graduated decades ago but I remember these same conversations. Interesting to meet these same classmates at the class reunions. I recall our senior class president went to Stanford. She is married with 5 kids and I don\u2019t think she has worked in a while. Half of my classmates are lawyers but a good percentage are home makers or working in other professions. What is important to you in high school fades away later in life. No one has those conversations anymore we have moved on to the question of the post high school journey what you learned in HS and how it shaped your life. At every reunion we have a classmate panel interview that\u2019s separate from the bar crawl, family picnics, and group hikes. This year we invited a English teacher to the mix who grew into the school\u2019s elderly prophet. He certainly enjoyed seeing how his teachings and style shaped our adult perspectives.",
