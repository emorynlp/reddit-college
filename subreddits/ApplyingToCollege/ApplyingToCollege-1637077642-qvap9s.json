  "text": "As an international student from India, I wonder how important it is to be in a school that is well known and that sends students to US universities each year. I am fairly confident that I am the only one applying from our school, and I don't think anybody has applied to US universities before.  \nWill this, in any way, prove to be disadvantageous to me?",

So even if your school didn't have a lot of opportunities, they would (most likely) take that into account if they wondered why you didn't have a lot of honors classes, extracurriculars, etc. \nSo assess how well off your school is with funding and opportunities like tutoring, internships, high level classes, and try to max out how many of those opportunities you take up!",

Cuz.. well, \"feeder schools\" is usually a reference to only those schools which send kids to T20/30s. So while it will be extremely unlikely to get into a T20 as an international from an unknown school, there are still lots of amazing schools where this doesn't matter so much.",

We sent one guy to Yale, but that's nothing compared to the famous small international school in our country which sent three Yale applicants - all accepted EA. Keep in mind, the number of people who applied for Yale early in that school was four. Literally, 3 OUT OF 4 YALE APPLICANTS GOT IN EARLY ACTION FROM THE SAME SCHOOL.\n\nAnd when Yale usually accepts 3-4 of us from our country every year, you know what's up.",
