  "title:": "A Website I Made For A2C With Simplified Common Data Sets For T30s",
  "text": "Website: [http://commondatasets.com/](http://commondatasets.com/)\n\nSo a few months ago I wanted to code a website, so I asked this sub what to make. I got a comment saying how common data sets were too unaesthetic and difficult to navigate, so I have been working on a website that lists the common data sets of Top 30 Universities in a way that is hopefully easier to digest than the current common data sets. I honestly left out a lot of information from the CDSs and I probably made a lot of errors along the way (if you catch any please let me know so I can fix them), but this was my first ever real project that I have done outside of school, so I tried my best. I did most of this as a side project, so sorry for posting it so late along the application process, but hopefully it can be helpful to future applicants or just a cool thing to look at. The page where you compare colleges is still in the works, as it is a bit more difficult to code, so I will hopefully eventually get around to it. I just hope the site works for now as I have never done anything like this before. Thank you guys!\n\n(Also if anyone is wondering, this is a repost. First post was taken down, but I received approval from the mods to post this link this time around).\n\n(Also Also I do not want to claim everything here is 100% factual, but the numbers should all be pretty close to reality (unless I made a huge mistake somewhere), sorry it is not perfect, I hope to improve in future projects. I will get around to fixing errors later tonight or within a day or two as I am grinding through my applications right now, so I might not have the most time to make edits, either way thank you for any feedback!)\n\nEdit: Just woke up again, and thank you guys so much for all of the support and I am glad you guys seem to be enjoying it. I will try to respond to all questions/input, but sorry if I miss yours. Hopefully I can get around to working out some of the issues you guys mentioned tonight, but I apologize in advance if I can not get to it until a day or two, as I have like 4 applications I need to complete in like the next 3 days haha. Once again thank you guys for the feedback, and I am happy to be able to help out the community.\n\nEdit 2: I will try making a list with all of the things people have mentioned could benefit the site. Once I fix any issues with the site, I will try implementing the features/visual changes people recommended (might be a bit later in the month).\n\nAlso, I've realized I keep saying \"thank you\", but I genuinely mean it to each of you guys. I am really grateful for all of the feedback and support, and do not really know how else to respond haha.",

The annoying part of constructing those graphs was the fact that CDSs were all in different places. Having them all collected in the same spot is very useful and powerful.",

      "text": "Nice website! It loads fairly quickly (only the images on the main page can slow down a bit).\n\nI just want to offer two small, humble suggestions:\n\nOn the main page, the title \"A2C Common Data Sets\" can be moved to the top center, since that is where most people look for a website title. If the visual balance with the buttons \"Data Sets\" and \"Compare\" on the top left is a concern, the \"2019-2020\" part can stay in the top right and maybe as something like \"2019-2020 Data\".\n\nSeconding what carlyc999 suggested, I agree that the school names can look indistinct on the school-specific banners (e.g. MIT, Stanford, and Cornell).\n\nOverall, my two suggestions are minor and easily resolvable. In regards to what meaningless-human stated, it would also be possible for you to transition this project into a community-wide one if you make the code open-source, but this is really down to your personal preference.\n\nThanks for your contribution, and have a nice day!",

It would make more sense to have A2C Common Data Sets as a title, and just leave the year on the side for balance. I will try testing out how it looks once I have time, thank you! \n\nAlso,  yea some of the banners blend in really poorly, so I will either add the same border/background to all banners, or only edit the ones that look really bad (I remember Cornell's banner definitely needs some work haha). \n\nAnd yes, I will try to eventually open source the code once I sort out some of the bugs/issues and fix the visuals. It might be towards the end of the month, and I might need some time figuring out how to do so haha. \n\nHave a nice day as well!",

And yea I was looking at cloudflare for SSL verification, but since I am hosting through godaddy I am not sure how to get SSL verification through other sources. I am unsure if I am missing something and can use services like certbot with godaddy, but I kind of wish I looked more into hosting services because godaddy charges a $60+ fee for their SSL. I may eventually just pay the fee out of pocket if I cant get a free SSL, but I will definitely look into it thank you!",

Also for the geographic breakdowns, I believe most (if not all) colleges should have parenthesis saying \"exclude international\" next to the percentages of instate and outer state.

Sorry if I am not making any sense or if I messed it up on UNC, I will take a look.\n\nEdit: Basically the in-state and out-of-state percentages are out of 100% but they only account for admits from the US. The international percentage is the total admitted from the entire freshman class.",

Could you possibly also add SAT subject test requirement and if I could add one suggestion, could you possibly shift the fast facts and tables a little more to the left so as to not require scrolling to the right. Take that with a grain of salt though - not that big of a deal at all. I understand it'd also be very difficult to do the shift (done some css, and changes like that are a huge pain in the arse). Anyways, appreciate the effort. This will help big time.  \nEdit: Oh, sorry, now I seem very picky, but just one suggestion on fade in/out when hovering over each university's box: I think shortening the fade-in and adding a short fade-out would make it seem a little smoother. Sorry, trivial things. Just makes for a slightly better experience.",

      "text": "This is really nice, great job OP! \n\nTwo small suggestions for edits if you have time: \n\n1. Can you add the names of the schools in white text at the bottom of each photo? The buildings / pretty campuses end up looking pretty similar to each other lol. \n\n2. Can you specify on each page which year the data is from? I assume it\u2019s all from the same year (latest year data is available), but if different tables are from different years, it would be good to specify that in brackets. Or even if all the data is from the same year, just add a sentence at the top specifying the year.\n\nAgain, really nice job!!",
