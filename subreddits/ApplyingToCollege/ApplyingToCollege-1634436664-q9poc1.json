  "text": "hi! I've been trying to form a college list (for tours and such) and I absolutely adore Brandeis. I like everything about it, the size, the type of campus, the environment, and the academics.\n\nI was wondering what schools are similar to it. any type of school, safety, match, or reach, are fine (why I'm not including my stats). I'll probably be a history major if that helps :)\n\nthanks!",

I loved how half the students double majored (a fact that was brought up multiple times)- I thought it showed how so many ppl had different interests. I also liked that the campus felt so welcoming? (albeit this was probably bc I was on a tour lmao), but they even had a kindness day, which I found rlly nice. also the clubs have to accept everyone or else they don't get funding which I liked so I can try out a ton of stuff if I want",
