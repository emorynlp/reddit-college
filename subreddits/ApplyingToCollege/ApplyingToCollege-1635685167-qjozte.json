  "text": "I have two awards that are QuestBridge related, personal statement alludes to it, additional info has some details on it; does this hurt my application at need blind schools? Would you advise removing the two QuestBridge awards? I won\u2019t have anything to replace them with other than general honor roll, PSAT stuff\n\nAlso, this doesn\u2019t matter for need-aware schools, right? Since they\u2019ll already look at how much financial aid I\u2019ll need.\n\nThinking about this is really stressing me out \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Schools that are need-blind are genuinely need-blind philosophically. Once a school makes that commitment in a big-picture fashion, there\u2019s no practical benefit to trying to sniff out one or two people who might need aid.\n\nThe reality is that schools could get a pretty good feel for every applicant\u2019s need just by looking at their zip code.",
