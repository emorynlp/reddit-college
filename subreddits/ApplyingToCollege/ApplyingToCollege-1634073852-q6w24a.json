  "text": "I\u2019ve just started my common app as a transfer applicant. My community college lets me send my electronic transcript for free or 2.5$ for physical one. That\u2019s fine.\n\nNow, some other colleges require highschool/GED transcript, I have Hiset and it costs 15$ for 1 electronic copy. Like WHAT THE HELL? I have completed ~50 credits btw.\n\nP/S: I apologize, the process stresses me out and I\u2019m like lower middle class and not qualified for fee waiver, and the application fee is not insignificant at all.",
