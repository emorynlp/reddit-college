  "text": "My anxiety is getting the better of me. This college application has been a little long with the school asking me for more and more info because they can\u2019t understand/process what I have. I feel sick. I feel like I\u2019m going to get rejected I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I could call it a gut feeling or if my brain is just being crazy about it.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s the deal. College decisions might not go your way. It\u2019s the honest truth,  but you\u2019ve done your part. Put forth your strongest application, nurtured your little baby bird application, and now it has to go do its thing. It\u2019s hard not having control\nOver the process for sure. But just know this. A little pain and heartbreak won\u2019t hurt you. In fact it can make you stronger. So hope for the best and prepare for the worst. It\u2019s called emotional planning \u2014 and know that you will be ok no matter the outcome. You might be devastated for a while. It might feel awful. And you might need to do a lot of pillow bashing. But then you\u2019ll work through it. You\u2019ll eat a lot of ice cream and you\u2019ll know that you are way more than any college admissions decision. Your life has more meaning than the name of a college. And you\u2019ll find out that you are so much stronger than you ever imagined. I promise. I see it every year.",

Life is full of ups and downs and part of that is learning to deal with the inevitable suckiness life brings you at times. But it\u2019s ephemeral. It will pass.  \n\nAnd this is why I really discourage the idea of dream schools.  I want you to think about what it is you like so much about your dream school. What do you see yourself doing there? What experiences are you having? Then I want you to take that knowledge and find other schools where you can have those experiences because I promise you that dream isn\u2019t in the form of a school. It\u2019s you \u2014 so go find and apply to a list of schools where you can find dream you and forget about the dream school.",
