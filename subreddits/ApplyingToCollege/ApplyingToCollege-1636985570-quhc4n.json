A lot of the same questions tend to come up such as: \n- \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n- \u201cWhy x college?\u201d \n- \u201cWhy have you chosen your intended major?\u201d   - \u201cWhat activities do you enjoy outside school/academics?\u201d \n\nThink about how you would respond to each of these, and maybe write a few bullet points. Remember the interviewer is trying to gauge your interest in the school, but also trying to get to know you. \n\nAlso prepare some Yale specific questions to ask the interviewer to keep the conversation going, and learn more about the school. \n\nGood luck! lmk how it goes\u2026",
