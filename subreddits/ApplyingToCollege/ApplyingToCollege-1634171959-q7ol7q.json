  "title:": "Self Reporting SAT Scores on Common App",
  "text": "In the testing section of the Common App, the first question for those choosing to self report SAT scores is \u201cNumber of past SAT scores you wish to report.\u201d\n\nAt first, I assumed this meant that, if you have multiple SAT scores, you only needed to report the scores you wanted to report. So, if I selected 3 but took 4, I would only have to input the scores for 3 of the 4 SATs I took.\n\nHowever, I then noticed that, regardless of what number I selected, it still only ever let me input the my highest ERW score and highest math score. Even if I said I took the SAT 5 times I still only could give them 2 scores. One for max ERW and one for max math.\n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure anymore if the Common App is asking me to report all of the past scores that I WANT to report or if they are just asking that I report ALL of them. After all, if students only report the number of scores they want to report and Common App only asks them for their maximum scores, why would anyone report a number of attempts greater than those that made up the maximum component scores?",

      "text": "The CommonApp testing section is kind of flawed, but you can try to work around that... If a school superscores, pick 2 as the number of attempts and enter your highest section scores... If they don't superscore, pick 1 as the number of attempts and enter both sections from the same date.",
