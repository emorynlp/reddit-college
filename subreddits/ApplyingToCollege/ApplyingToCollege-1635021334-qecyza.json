  "text": "Hi! Is anyone else here applying to the Barrett Honors College at ASU? I'm really confused about what they want to see in the essay. The two prompts are fairly creative in nature and don't seem to be related to why someone would want to attend Barrett, but it also says \"We have a deep interest in knowing why you are considering Barrett, The Honors College.\" and \"A successful essay will be the result of closely examining your own ideas about your education and about the Barrett experience.\" Do they want a why-us here? Thanks y'all, any advice is appreciated.",
