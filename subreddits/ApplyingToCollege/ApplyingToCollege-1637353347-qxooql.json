  "text": "I haven\u2019t taken any ap history classes so I\u2019m looking into history classes that will save me some money for college. Is AP Gov a requirement for college students in stem? Should I take it? I was always recommended for ap history classes but I felt that I was stretching myself too thin. My schedule is also getting very ap-filled so would it be worth it?",
