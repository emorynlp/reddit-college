      "text": "Computer engineering deals with both hardware and software - it's kind of a cross between electrical engineering and computer science. It's definitely the more hardware focused degree, but a lot of grads still end up in software development.\n\nComputer science is software, and thinking about computing in general. You might have classes that cover circuits, but it's not the focus of the degree.\n\nYou might also see software engineering as a degree.  That's usually very similar to CS, but focused on the practical aspects of being a software developer - it might cut some theory and add classes on best practices. Look at a degree map and compare at a given school to see what the differences are, as they vary.",

      "text": "You could major in CS or CE and get a job where your title is \u201csoftware engineer\u201d or \u201csoftware developer.\u201d The main curricular difference is that CE students learn hardware (in addition to software) and they learn how hardware and software components connect or communicate. My students in CS and CE get jobs in big tech companies, finance, defense, consulting, and many other fields. These are degrees with nearly limitless career possibilities.",
