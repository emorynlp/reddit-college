      "text": "Georgetown has their own separate application, and does not use Parchment. (Kinda like how UC schools don't use the CommonApp but have their own application, etc.)\n\n[*https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/transfer-secondary-school-report/*](https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/transfer-secondary-school-report/)\n\n\"The secondary school from which you graduated will need to provide your final high school transcript and a completed Secondary School Report form. **Please note that Georgetown University prefers to receive its own Secondary School Report form.** ~~Transfer applicants are strongly encouraged to use the electronic request form (Step 3 of the Transfer Application Menu) to request submission of their Secondary School Reports.~~ If a hard-copy form is preferred or required by your high school, you can download a PDF copy of this form below.\n\nPlease notify your secondary school\u2019s guidance office of this request well before March 1 to assure timely arrival of your high school transcript and a completed Secondary School Report form on or before March 1.\n\nIf you have been out of high school for a considerable period of time and the counseling staff at your high school has since changed, please know that the transcript is the most important document for us to receive. We recognize that a completed Secondary School Report form may not be feasible for all transfer applicants to submit.\"",
