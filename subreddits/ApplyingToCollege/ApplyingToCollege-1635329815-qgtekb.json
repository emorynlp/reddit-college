  "title:": "ED or RD for low UVa with low GPA? (In State)",
  "text": "Seeking advice on ED vs RD!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my current GPA is \\~3.6UW 3.9W, which is far below the average at UVa, my dream school/top choice. However, I have a severe upward trend (Freshman 3.2, Sophomore 4.0, Junior 4.7) and am pretty confident I'll maintain at least a 4.5 for senior year (currently have all As with 4 APs). Outside of my GPA, I'm pretty statistically average (1460 SAT, but was dumb and submitted my 1330 from last year as well. ECs include leadership in honor society related to major + student government, sports (club and varsity), music, work (paid) etc. all pretty typical).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm wondering, should I apply RD with an improved GPA (should be at least 4.0 cummulative with first semester grades) or apply ED since I know its my dream school?\n\nAs a side note, I haven't started my common app essay yet but am confident I can write at least an average one by Nov 1st :P I've finished my supplementals for UVa and believe they're above average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP BOOS",

      "text": "We are more concerned with the four years of course selection in each core subject and the specific grades in each course than a GPA. GPAs are fairly meaningless in my world since they aren't standardized and don't provide the detail I need to make a decision. \n\nMy advice is to only apply when you feel your application is in it's strongest shape. Between the upward trend and an unwritten essay, it sounds like RD makes more sense for you. The EA pool is the strongest of our three pools (and we are pretty clear about that in presentations, so I'm not sharing secret info!).",

          "text": "Thanks for the response deanj! So just to be clear, students who apply  ED have no competitive advantage? Because I know UVa is my top top choice and would love to ED especially if it were advantageous, but like you said, it makes more sense to apply when my application is the best it can be\u2026\n\nJust one more question: if I apply RD (Jan 3rd) but my Senior semester 1 grades aren\u2019t available until Jan 13th, is it still possible that my Semester 1 grades would be looked at? (hoping they are)",
