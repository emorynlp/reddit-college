  "text": "Basically, my spacing on some of the supplemental was messed up. Sometimes I got rid of the spaces between my paragraphs since on the pdf version u see right before you submit it showed up as a fat double space. So basically in the common app pdf the spacing is normal looking but on the actual place where u fill out the supplemental, the spacing is jacked up and looks sloppy.",
