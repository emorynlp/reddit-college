  "text": "I've been researching a ton for a few months now because I'm super interested in pursuing CS.\n\nAll the online rankings are pretty different, so I wonder \u2013 which CS school did you choose and why? To be specific, I'm interested in schools where many CS majors end up at FAANG, but not one that's incredibly cutthroat (where I'll suffer).\n\nRight now, I'm looking at Princeton and Cornell, but I'm sure there are many more.\n\nThanks!",

I\u2019m taking my first CS course next semester here :)  \n\nPlease elaborate (sincere request).  \n\nMy understanding is that CS @ UC Berkeley is highly impacted and congested with students to the point that registering for required higher-level classes can be a painful scramble.  \n\nThe 100 and 200 level giant lecture hall classes aren't the problem. It's the uncommon 200, and a majority of the 300 & 400 level classes with caps on the class sizes that are the problem.  \n\nAm I misinformed?",

                  "text": "It is sometimes annoying with class registration and yes the class does fill up but then people drop the course usually within the first week or even before that during an adjust period. The real issue that occurs is with lower division courses where it is hard to get a spot. Upper division courses for CS are more accessible for those who are on the CS track since a majority of people by then have things figured out. Also, for people majoring in CS, im pretty sure there are reserved seats for their major. There are also reserved seats for juniors and seniors so they can take their upper division courses. The reason I got into my CS class which is a lower division course is because there are reserved seats for freshman and sophomores. Usually within the spring semester if you could not get a spot in the fall the classes are readily available as well if there is truly an issue with enrollment. For example, Chem1A is known as a weeder course here and fills up quickly. This semester, a higher number than usual dropped the course within the first week and others who needed to take it had the opportunity to do so. Also during the adjust phase, If the course is in high demand,they will decide to add more seats to the course. I just wanted to mostly comment on the culture at UC Berkeley where people make it out to be extremely cutthroat when In reality it is not and I have found myself to be surrounded by extremely collaborative people.",
