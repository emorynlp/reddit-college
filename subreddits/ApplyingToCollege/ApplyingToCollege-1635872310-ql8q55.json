  "text": "I've been researching a ton for a few months now because I'm super interested in pursuing CS.\n\nAll the online rankings are pretty different, so I wonder \u2013 which CS school did you choose and why? To be specific, I'm interested in schools where many CS majors end up at FAANG, but not one that's incredibly cutthroat (where I'll suffer).\n\nRight now, I'm looking at Princeton and Cornell, but I'm sure there are many more.\n\nThanks!",

It is largely a reflection of a. the caliber of students admitted to a given program and b. the degree to which that program's students are even \\*interested\\* in working at FAANG.\n\nRe: #1, that the caliber of students to school A is lower than the caliber of students admitted to school B doesn't necessarily imply \\*your\\* prospects will be significantly limited by attending A.\n\nRe: #2, consider the case of MIT, which sends a lower % to FG than Rice.  Is Rice the \"better\" school for CS?",

It's the uncommon 200, and a majority of the 300 & 400 level classes with caps on the class sizes that are the problem.  \n\nAm I misinformed?",

                  "text": "It is sometimes annoying with class registration and yes the class does fill up but then people drop the course usually within the first week or even before that during an adjust period. The real issue that occurs is with lower division courses where it is hard to get a spot. Upper division courses for CS are more accessible for those who are on the CS track since a majority of people by then have things figured out. Also, for people majoring in CS, im pretty sure there are reserved seats for their major. There are also reserved seats for juniors and seniors so they can take their upper division courses. The reason I got into my CS class which is a lower division course is because there are reserved seats for freshman and sophomores. Usually within the spring semester if you could not get a spot in the fall the classes are readily available as well if there is truly an issue with enrollment. For example, Chem1A is known as a weeder course here and fills up quickly. This semester, a higher number than usual dropped the course within the first week and others who needed to take it had the opportunity to do so. Also during the adjust phase, If the course is in high demand,they will decide to add more seats to the course. I just wanted to mostly comment on the culture at UC Berkeley where people make it out to be extremely cutthroat when In reality it is not and I have found myself to be surrounded by extremely collaborative people.",

Of course, Google is extremely prestigious, but the career prospects and climbing up the ranks is just a drag; you're often stuck with stock and bonuses that are locked for 3-5 years so you are trapped in the job unless you give up that 25-50k (proactively).\n\nAlso 150k is relatively low for hard-working CS graduates out of decent schools. Don't get me wrong, it's A LOT of money, but just from the people I've met (skewed upwards) and my peers, 250k+ seems common especially at hedge funds or trading firms.",

Your post is full of contradictions.\n\n\"almost slave labor-like job 80-120 hour weeks for the first 5 years so you can finally make 200k\"\n\n\"Can't speak for FAANG but everyone I've spoke to in CS recruiting say it blows.\"\n\nQuestion: why do you insist on sharing your opinion when you have no clue what you are talking about? Is this the consequence of being at Harvard? It is funny how you try to accuse of me being obsessed with HYPSM 2.0 *when you literally go to Harvard*. No where in my comment has I ever advocated working for FAANG over startup.\n\n\"Harvard not being 1 is just selection bias\". More like CS doesn't give a shit about prestige and you are not as special as you think buddy.\n\n\"Not waking up before 10 AM and hopping off at 5 PM makes no sense, unless job contracts are inaccurate and my friends lied, or they are also dumb\"\n\nLol. How about you get a software job first and actually be handed contract before you start talking? This isn't a FAANG thing. Most software jobs in Silicon Valley don't have work schedule written explicitly in their contract. Welcome to software engineering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" All I know is that none of FAANG was over 200k (hell, 150k) while all of the late-stage startups were over 220k\"\n\nFunny because I and all my friends at a certain company all received rough 220k total compensation for the first year. Like, you are not special for having friends that interned at FAANG buddy. All of this is public information. Go to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) and see how wrong you are.\n\nOnce again, love how condescending you are. You are only getting upvotes because you are misleading a bunch of high school students who are pretty clueless about the software engineering industry. Make the same comments on r/cscareerquestions and you will become a laughing stock. Absolutely hilarious how someone contain so much confident without any actual first hand experience to the point where he is arguing with people actual in industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nThe highest offer I seen is close to 400k a year working as software developer for high frequency trading. Funny how you mention your hedge fund offers when hedge funds are known to be stressful. Absolutely hilarious. Your view is probably the most elitist view I ever seen.",

The big money rn is with data science at these hedge funds. Quant work isn't straight CS (lots of math/physics majors get into it) but there is overlap and some coding but it's not the same as a job at FAANG.\n\nFAANG deals with a lot of standard coding. Object-oriented stuff that's mostly centered around a consumer product. The stuff that everyone who codes as a hobby is interested in. Involves very little heavy math that isn't standard.\n\nQuant/data science is entirely centered around math, stats, and physics concepts which is potentially more interesting but definitely harder work. It's the big money right now especially with AI popping off. \n\nIt's incredibly important in CS to specialize in something as you get older. Specializing in AI, full-stack, networking, low level, data science, etc. is critical to being able to find work as you age and want more salary/managerial positions/fulfilling work.

      "text": "I graduated from USC this year and am now a software developer.\n\nI highly recommend going for a college with good course availability. At schools with big CS programs you don't want to deal with seat availability for required courses. It's also nice if you can squeeze into the electives you want (AI by far being the most popular). You can lurk college subreddits to figure out the situation.\n\nIf you want the most job prospects I recommend going to a big city (where many companies and startups are/travel to). If you want to do research, look up the faculty and see how many take on undergrad researchers. Not all research institutions can give undergrads opportunities.\n\nIt might be a little early but think of the kind of career or hobbies you want to pursue. The student culture can be a huge advantage if it aligns with your goals. For example, at USC many students use social media as a platform to get ahead socially and professionally. The school I transferred from was in a rural setting where social media had little value.\n\nThere are other things to consider if you want to get real picky. Universities in the same area can lead to partnerships and bigger networking opportunities. Big companies like Amazon are funding machine learning research in universities which could cause opportunities to trickle down to undergrads, or at least be an indicator of which schools companies favor. But until you have a goal more specific than studying CS I think the exact school doesn't matter, so long as you can register for classes and get your resume out there.",

      "text": "I'm CS at Georgia Tech and just wanna throw our name in there as a top CS school. Students are collaborative here as some of the classes are just ridiculously tough and most classes are largely graded on a group project and a few HWs/tests. Also pretty much everyone is engineering/CS (with maybe 25% in business/architecture/sciences combined) so if you're into that it can be cool\n\nI think we're ranked like 6 or 7 which is really good for being notably less of a crapshoot than MIT/Stanford. Everyone here gets multiple internships before graduation with the majority of grads getting a good pick of full-time positions. Name any big company I likely know 2-3 people who work there. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are by far the biggest ones with Facebook and Apple up there too.\n\nOne major leg-up over Cornell is that we are in Atlanta. Being in a tech area like Berkeley/Stanford/MIT is a massive deal when it comes to getting internships as pretty much every big tech company has offices here or is building them (Microsoft/Google built some this past year). A lot of tech companies are hiring in ATL rn because of this, and Tech CS students are eating rn because of it.\n\nPersonally, if I was to reapply I wouldn't go to school for CS anywhere that wasn't in or near a major tech city especially if you're gunning for FAANG. It's not worth having to either leave campus every time you wanna work or exclusively look for remote opportunities (which admittedly is much more common rn but will be 100% transitioning back by the time you start looking in the next year or 2). For this reason, I personally wouldn't consider Cornell as much as I would Princeton/Columbia/UW/Berkeley/Stanford/MIT/CMU/GT :).",

I really don't think the school you go to will change the quality of education, but it will change the atmosphere, alumni network, connections, etc. \n\nFor example, at Cornell there are a decent amount of research opportunities, good classes and professors, etc. One of the best things that I think Cornell has is [project teams](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/special-programs/project-teams/active-project-teams). Most of the project teams have pretty advanced CS subteams, like AppDev, DTI, CU Data Science, and some of the automation ones have great CS subteams as well like CUAir or CUAUV. Experience and connections from project teams are also really good, many of the alumni from project teams have gotten really good placements (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, JPL, etc.). \n\nWhen you look for a school, don't just look at the quality of the research that comes out of the school, cause chances are you are not going to be doing any of it (unless you do, and then good for you). Look for a school that has good connections, research opportunities, opportunities for experience, and more.",
