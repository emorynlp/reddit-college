  "text": "Hey guys! Recently my dad has been trying to go back to college but he has no idea where to start (nor do I \ud83d\ude14). We live in Texas and are trying to stay relatively close to that Dallas metroplex area. \n\nRegarding logistics my dad has no access to his transcripts from highschool nor other colleges he went to but didn't graduate from... so he and I are a bit lost in his next step. He is a veteran if that can help bolster his chances and he isn't looking for anything fancy just a degree!\n\nIf anyone has tips for my dad please send them my way.",

I bet there are people both in the military and at every college willing to help. \n\nHe should look also on the website for each college to find their registrar\u2019s instructions for applying for transcripts. A decade later I emailed the foreign college I attended as a nondegree student and it turned out I had grades they were willing to send. He might be surprised too.",
