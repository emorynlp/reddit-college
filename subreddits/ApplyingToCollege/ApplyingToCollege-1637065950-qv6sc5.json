              "text": "The feedback is a rating on various personality traits but it essentially is just pass/fail. The only way it has any impact on your admissions file is if your interviewer thought you had such egregious personality traits (i.e. you're just racist, incredibly rude, etc.) that you should not be admitted. You also write a brief paragraph at the end of the interview submission saying what their main ECs, focuses, major, etc. are just to make sure it lines up with what they wrote on app. Probably like 4 sentences.\n\nI did student interviews last year and my brother above me also does interviews for the past few years, and you can see who got admitted and there is absolutely no correlation. Also if you think about it rationally, the interview process is completely unstandardized and there are probably thousands of interviewers interviewing a few kids. It's just for you to learn about the school, and also good experience talking in general since interviews will obviously come up in the future. But no they are not evaluative in any sense, at least not in a way that will impact admission.\n\nAlso some kids get in without interviewing so it obviously can't be that important.",
