  "title:": "Should I submit now or wait for second letter of rec?",
  "text": "I'm applying to Northeastern for RD and I already have the required counselor letter of rec and teacher one. They also let you submit 1-2 optional rec letters. However, I don't have my second teacher letter of rec in yet. I kind of want to submit my application to Northeastern now just to get it over with since I know I have a lot on my plate these next few weeks, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to wait so I can include the second letter. I don't think it would be particularly amazing but it could add depth to my application. \n\nSo should I just submit it now? Should I wait? Or is there a way to submit my extra letter of rec later than my other transcripts? \n\nAlso does anyone know if Northeastern needs official ACT/SAT score reports lol",
