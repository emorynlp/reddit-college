  "title:": "Should I withdraw applications?",
  "text": "I'm currently applying to schools at the moment and since I want to work in the animation industry, I've been applying to a handful of art ones. However I got a bit cocky and began to just apply to schools for the ego boost I'd get after receiving an acceptance letter. There are a few schools I've applied to but have yet to submit my portfolio/essay and quite honestly? I don't want to go to those schools, being accepted just feels nice. \n\nI regret applying because I have only have 2-4 schools I truly want to go to and don't want to waste my time writing essays for schools I don't care for. Should I just say \"screw it\" and back out and focus on my main schools? Or, since I've already gotten this far, should I just submit them and get the applications finished up?",
