  "text": "Hey everyone, I want to apply for some UCs but I\u2019m thinking about how it might be way too expensive ever since I read about how they took away financial aid for OOS students some years back. I *might* have some external help so I\u2019ll still apply, but I\u2019m also interested in a few CSUs (particularly san diego state and csulb). Google said that the oos for these two schools is about $18k-19k which wouldnt be bad, but do they still give at least some financial aid in comparison to the UC system?",

      "text": "The CSU's are very similar to the UC's in terms of financial aid to OOS students, in that it is pretty much non-existent... The only good thing is that they're generally much more affordable - but check the actual university websites instead of Google for better cost estimates.",
