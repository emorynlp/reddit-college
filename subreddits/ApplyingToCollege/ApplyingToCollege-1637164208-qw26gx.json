  "title:": "Submitted an Essay 50 words over the word count.",
  "text": "I was writing an essay for a scholarship for a low tier state school and the word limit for the essay was 500.  I had my essay at 490 or so but, then I made some last minute changes and forgot to recheck the word count.  My current word count is 552 for the essay part.    Also, the prompt had to be on the page and that's why it didn't do a work count check automatically.  The scholarship application is closed now, do you think I am better off leaving it alone and hoping for the best or is it worth emailing a second version to them.",
