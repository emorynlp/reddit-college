  "text": "Graduated hs a while ago but one of my friends happened to mess up on her 1st quarter under an AP course. The teacher apparently decided not to grade labs due to deadlines and well, her grade for that subject stands at a 'F'. Sucks cuz her record all junior year (and the ones before) were decent.\n\nBefore she meets up with her counselor, I just wanted to know whether there is a possibility she could decide to not send her grades for the first quarter.",

      "text": "If a school requests first quarter grades, or requires a mid-year report for RD, not supplying it would likely result in an incomplete application that wouldn't be completed.\n\nEA/ED decisions are often made based on only the transcript through Junior year, but an F on an updated report could still cause issues after an acceptance.",
