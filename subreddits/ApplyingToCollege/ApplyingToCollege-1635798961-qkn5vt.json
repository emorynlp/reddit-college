  "text": "So I know this is pointless to ask bcuz obviously nobody can tell for sure but....\n\nI guess im asking is this a reach, a mach, a safety, whatever....\n\nIm applying to Gatech and Umich (instate)\n\nECs - tons of leadership and volunteer related to my intended major; Electrical Engineering\n\nFeatured in a magazine for my inspiring creations that got millions of views.\n\nStats: str8 4.0/4.0 not counting my APs (7) and honors courses (2).\n\nSAT: its gonna boil down to a score between 1400 and 1470 depending on this next one. Im confident though.",

              "text": "They're both T10 EE programs with acceptance rates around 20%. You have strong ECs but nothing out-of-this-world incredible like IMO medalist. Your stats are good but your SAT in particular is lower than a lot of the students applying to the same schools. You're OOS for Georgia Tech, and UMich doesn't factor in-state vs OOS that much. \n\nYou're a competitive applicant, but so are all of the other competitive applicants, of whom there are many, and they can't all be accepted.",
