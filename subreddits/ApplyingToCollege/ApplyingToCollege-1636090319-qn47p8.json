I would hire someone with solid GPA to work for me who has demonstrated balance between academics, sports than someone from a UC, for example, who had solid grades but boring life outside of school. You just don\u2019t know the back story behind people who do this and don\u2019t know their long term plans.",

Besides, being a college athlete and getting your tuition paid for beats taking out 80k of loans",
