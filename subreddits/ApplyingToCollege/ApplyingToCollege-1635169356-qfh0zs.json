  "text": "The title has said it all, should I apply ED to TCU? I planned to only apply ED/EA to TCU and UH, however as UH doesn't offer need-based financial aid, I'm scared that I won't be able to afford it. So I'm thinking about just applying to TCU only, then should I go ED? What if I got admitted but TCU wouldn't offer me enough the amount of financial aid that I need?",

If  you  are  not  100%  comfortable  with the  amount  the  NPC  says  you  will  need  to  pay\u2026  don\u2019t  ED.  I\u2019d  even  say  don\u2019t  apply  at  all.",

If you would prefer to hold out for a possibly better number elsewhere, then don't ED.\n\nWhen you run your stuff through the NPC, document exactly what information you input and what value it spit out.  If you are admitted ED and they offer you significantly worse aid, then you will want that information when you ask them to let you out of your ED obligation.",
