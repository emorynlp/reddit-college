  "text": "The title has said it all, should I apply ED to TCU? I planned to only apply ED/EA to TCU and UH, however as UH doesn't offer need-based financial aid, I'm scared that I won't be able to afford it. So I'm thinking about just applying to TCU only, then should I go ED? What if I got admitted but TCU wouldn't offer me enough the amount of financial aid that I need?",

If  you  are  not  100%  comfortable  with the  amount  the  NPC  says  you  will  need  to  pay\u2026  don\u2019t  ED.  I\u2019d  even  say  don\u2019t  apply  at  all.",
