      "text": "PSA, in case this is relevant for anyone:\r  \nPublic universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\r  \nSome public universities offer large merit scholarships to out-of-state students.\r  \nSome private universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state.\r  \nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",

My dad and grandma want me to stay close to them but I feel like I need to (and want to) get out of here if I want to start my life. I'm very codependent and I need to push myself. I'm planning on just going 1 state up (9-hour drive). I'll be close-ish to my siblings and not too far from my dad and grandma. If I fell in love with a school in my state I'd stay or maybe if it's undoable financially.",
