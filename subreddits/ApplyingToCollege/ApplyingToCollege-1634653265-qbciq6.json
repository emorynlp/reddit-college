  "text": "Hey!\n\nSo some colleges let me include a resume. The thing is, most of my activities can be covered by the activities section. There is one though (an activity about entrepreneurship, we designed a prototype for a product for deaf people and won some competitions, we were also written about in like 3 newspapers). Where do I put it all in?\n\nCan I do it in additional information? Or should I make a resume despite not having much extra to say about every activity?\n\nAlso, can I include being on the newspaper in the honors section? How do I do it / word it if I can?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
