You qualify for these awards based off your PSAT score in Junior year!\u201d \nThe thing is\u2026 I have already applied to like 6 colleges. \nDo I let them know I am qualified? Or do I only inform them if I get the award? (Presented in Dec when most of the College acceptance/rejection letters come in)",

I would also revisit your safety options -- there are some decent schools that offer full tuition scholarships for the national recognition programs, which might be worth an application.",
