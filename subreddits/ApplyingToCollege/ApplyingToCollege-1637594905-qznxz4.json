High school has been absolutely miserable for me because all I\u2019ve done is study and neglect any and all personal relationships. I was sad\u2014if not downright depressed\u2014for the majority of the past 4 years.\n\nI realized that if I were to get accepted to Dartmouth, it would not only cost my family $320k (we don\u2019t qualify for aid), I would also be miserable because I\u2019d once again be surrounded by people who are used to being at the top, used to competing with each other to the extreme. I don\u2019t want another 4 years of rat racing, and I certainly don\u2019t want to drop $320k on a degree that I could get at my state school for an eighth of that (it certainly helps that my career does not by any means look for applicants who attended selective schools). \n\nI\u2019m looking at schools right now that are likely to give me a decent amount of merit: UMass Amherst, UVM, CU Boulder (though, if I ended up really wanting to go there, I might consider spending a year in Colorado to get residency first for that in-state tuition). I also love UW Madison.",

Letting go of the idea that attending a prestigious school would serve as a tangible representation of my hard work was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had  to do in this life, especially with it being at the forefront of my goals for the past few years. What\u2019s helped me the most was having a lot of conversations with people who are far older and wiser than myself, who have the life experience to say that everything works out no matter where you end up. \n\nThese days I\u2019m a much calmer, happier person. I think the realization might have saved me from myself.",

I regret to some extent coming to UNC and wish I went to an \"easier\" school like RPI. UNC is still quite prestigious, and it is reflected in its students to a degree. I've met a girl who cried in my arms over receiving an 88 on a quiz in a class I had a 73 in. Prestige comes with a lot of pressure, so unless you want to be under constant intense pressure to perform well, it's definitely not bad at all to go to a less prestigious school.\n\nThis sounds fucked, but I really appreciate now being rejected from Duke, because the people who literally try and game the system to get in... I don't think I could stand being in classes with them if they were successful. UNC has the better shade of blue anyways ;)\n\nTL;DR: This subreddit is kinda swamped with the \"need for prestige\" students, so don't be down on yourself because you're not looking for that :) If you need any help, feel free to DM me",

More so if she prepped for the exams at all. 24 is the kind of score people with 4.0s at my high school would get on their first ever ACT in 9th grade. I'm not personally familiar with the new 1600 SAT, but 1210 converts to an 1820 on the 2400 scale, and let's just say that 1900 is the absolute minimum cutoff for athletic recruits. (Unless her school has insane GPA inflation, which is a different story.)\n\nIf her school doesn't have insane grade inflation--I'm not saying that she has any learning or test taking disabilities, but perhaps it's worth getting her checked especially if she shows other non-school related symptoms? ADHD, for instance, is under diagnosed in women, and many women (me included) don't get seen for it until adulthood. It impacts not just your attention span, but it also comes with an assortment of comorbidities, like OCD, auditory processing disorder, and various learning and language disabilities. If she shows other symptoms around the house and in her social life, and there's a childhood history, it's worth looking into.",

      "text": "So my senior applied to Denison and was rejected, they applied to some state schools and private schools. Got into a few, still waiting on a few, rejected from a few. They have a few that are high in their list, but really haven\u2019t found a \u201chome\u201d in any thus far.\n\nMy daughter who took a gap year applied to 1 school, Cleveland Institute of art. She\u2019s still waiting on a decision but she\u2019s all in and if she doesn\u2019t get in, idk what she will decide. \n\nMy sophomore well..he\u2019s planning on the early college route at the community college for junior and senior year. He pointed out that there are 5300 schools in the USA and over 100 in Ohio so we will need to tour a good deal of then before making a decision. He could give a flying frack about prestige and branding, but for what he wants to study (philosophy & theology for UG and leaning towards law school) the place for him is tbd. \n\nPulling from my son, there are over 5000 schools and universities in the country, they all want students and the money that comes with them. No reason to drool over an Ivy unless you truly feel like it\u2019s where you belong, and as a parent-virtual tours don\u2019t give you that feeling. You need to tour in person. Feel the vibe, breathe the air and know without a doubt that\u2019s where you want to be for the next 4 years of your life. \n\nForge your own path, whatever it may be, and be happy wherever you wind up.",
