  "title:": "Application for the Pearson Lester scholarship and early Uoft Application",
  "text": "My school has not been verified yet but the form for the verification has been sent today. The deadline for Uoft to nominate me is 30th Nov and they can only nominate once the verification is done. The OUAC application deadline is 15th December but they recommend submitting before 7th Nov which is why I am worried because if I will only submit my application after my school has been verified and nomination is done because otherwise I would be wasting money as I need a scholarship to go.\n\nSince I am applying for computer engineering I will also need to submit a supplemental application and I think the deadline for that is 15th December. So because I can only start working on that after 30th Nov I would only have 15 days for my personal statements and everything so I would maybe only be able to apply by the 10th. My question is is it too late to apply to a program like engineering at that time or can I still apply?",
