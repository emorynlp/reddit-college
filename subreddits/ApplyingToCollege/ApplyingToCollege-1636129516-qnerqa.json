  "text": "my school has a terrible grading system (e.g. not giving any A's sometimes) so I have a low GPA. To be more specific I don't even have an actual GPA because our school simply does not have a GPA system. They just give us grades, and that's it. so I can't even use the acceptance chance calculators out there :(",

Why are US admissions so centered on something as subjective as GPA, with 4.0 (perfect GPA) being seen drastically more often than good standarized exam scores? I can\u2019t believe half of american students constantly score 95% or more on EVERY exam from every subject for the entire 4 years of high school, because that\u2019s what perfect GPA would mean in my country (so even literal geniuses who win olympiads dont have the equivalent of 4.0 here)",
