  "text": "my school has a terrible grading system (e.g. not giving any A's sometimes) so I have a low GPA. To be more specific I don't even have an actual GPA because our school simply does not have a GPA system. They just give us grades, and that's it. so I can't even use the acceptance chance calculators out there :(",
