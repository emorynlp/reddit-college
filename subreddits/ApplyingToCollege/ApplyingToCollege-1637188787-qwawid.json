Unlike other less populous states with strong public flagships, the level of investment may not be there, including historically.\n3. Its reputation isn't that bad.  AAU member, US News T100, etc.",

          "text": "The funding difference is a pretty big deal.  CU Boulder gets around $100 million from the state, and has a budget of around $2 billion (CU system as a whole is $5.2 billion, $290 million from the state).  UMN gets almost $700 million from the state with a budget of $4 billion. UW Madison gets $530 million from the state, with a budget of $3.4 billion.\n\nSome of that difference is easy to understand - the CU med school isn't part of CU Boulder for example and combining that would make the overall budgets much closer. But even accounting for that the funding for Boulder from the state lags way behind so they look to fill it in other ways, like attracting a lot of well off out of state students.\n\nI am kind of curious what the differences were before Colorado passed the TABOR law which usually gets blamed for this, but I am too lazy to look for 30 year old numbers.",

There are some exceptions (UCLA) but Michigan, Berkeley, Wisconsin, Virginia, North Carolina, etc. have been \"good\" for a long time.\n\nWisconsin, Michigan and Berkeley were founding members of the AAU in 1900.  Virginia joined in 1904 and North Carolina in 1922.  Colorado didn't join until 1966.\n\nIn the initial two US News rankings in 1984 and 1986 (that were 100% reputation survey based and only ranked the top 25) the only public schools to make either list were Berkeley, Michigan, UVA, UNC, Wisconsin and Illinois.  37 years later and the landscape at the top is mostly the same except for UCLA.",
