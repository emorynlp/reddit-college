  "text": "So three people from my school are EDing to Penn- that I know of. Myself and two others. All three of us are EDing to wharton and I am also EDing to M&T (one of Penn\u2019s dual degree programs). \n\nI\u2019m starting to flip out but I was wondering how does multiple ED applicants affect chances at acceptance, especially at Penn (wharton)?",

      "text": "Colleges don\u2019t have a strict quota on the number of applicants they accept from a given school. But you will be reviewed in the same school\u2019s context, so if one person has clearly not taken advantage of the school\u2019s opportunities (APs, clubs, etc) that another candidate has, that will of course be comparatively detrimental. I would also look at historic data about how many students Penn tended to accept from your school each year if that data is available. If Penn usually takes 5 students from your school, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll take 15 this year, for example.",
