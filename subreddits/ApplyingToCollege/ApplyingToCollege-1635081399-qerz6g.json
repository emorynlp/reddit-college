  "text": "So, I\u2019ve added pretty much all of my activities in the activities section in Common App, but there is this option in Additional Information under the writing section where I could attach my CV in the form of a google drive. Should I attach my CV there? It basically consists of all of the activities + a few more, their descriptions in detail and evidence pictures.\nIf I add my CV, eill it seem like I\u2019m just trying to add more words to the activities where they\u2019ve given only 150 words for each activity? \nHelppppp",
