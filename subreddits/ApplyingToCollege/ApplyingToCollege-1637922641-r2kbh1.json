  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm a junior from india aiming for T-20 schools. I wanted to know if summer schools (like the ones Stanford and Columbia offer )are really that important for my application. One, they're extremely long and offline and my school wont let me be on leave for that long. two, I dont know If I'll be accepted. I'm extremely confused. On the other hand, I could do an immersion program tat counts as community service. Which one should I do?\n\nwould the summer school credit be better or should I do neither. For background, I have decent extracurriculars (nothing too great) and avg test scores",
