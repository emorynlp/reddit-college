              "text": "To clarify, the GPA included in the app is the one on the transcript. Whether the colleges consider the updated, cumulative GPA from the mid year report will depend on the college's specific admissions process as well as on the timing of the application review. Often the mid year report is not available until close to Feb.\n\nMy personal guess is that the senior grades are important from a qualitative review standpoint rather than quantitative. In other words, grades in rigorous courses > GPA.  Admissions officers will absolutely look at senior grades, but may have multiple fields in their system, and for most highly selective colleges, I doubt that an updated cumulative senior GPA overrides the 6-semester GPA, to the extent that the college places importance on the numerical GPA for comparing applicants. For large publics that may care more about quantitative comparisons, typically the 6-semester GPA is the one used. Hope this makes sense.",
