  "title:": "\"Did you graduate from a North Carolina high school?\"",
  "text": "I'm in my senior year in an NC high school, and this question is in my application. Technically I haven't graduated yet, but the question is ambiguous in that if I put in a \"No\", it could be interpreted as me graduating from an out of state high school? Do I put in a yes or no?\n\nSide question, will my parents be able to view details of my Common App? There are certain things (such as clubs I'm attending) that I'd rather they not find out about.",
