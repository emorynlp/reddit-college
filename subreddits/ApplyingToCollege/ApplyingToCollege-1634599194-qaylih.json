  "text": "title\n\ni used to have an INCREDIBLE college counselor at my school who understood my motivations and goals as far as college goes. he would answer all of my nitpicky questions and was honestly just so great. he had a very high success rate too.\n\nthen he got promoted, and now he is gone :(\n\nwe have a new counselor, and she is pretty new, and though i do recognize that she is still adapting to the new environment, sometimes her answers can be a bit vague. in sum, i feel like i could be getting better help.\n\ni can still contact my old counselor via email, but it takes a looooooong while for him to respond (even if you follow up a couple of times) and i don't think i can keep that up throughout this year and senior year. plus, i don't want to bother him at his new position.\n\ndoes anyone know where i can find a high-quality, but not overly expensive (or manipulative, as I have heard in some cases) college counselor? basically someone who i can trust throughout the college process without breaking the bank.\n\nthank you!",

      "text": "\"high quality\" and \"not too expensive\" don't go well together, especially with something as big as college admissions. You're going to have to dig into your pockets if you're looking for a private counselor.\n\nBesides, it really depends on what you're looking for in a counselor. The majority of public high school counselors are just there to answer basic \"How do I do this?\" type questions, submit relevant documents, and occasionally guide students on what they should do to be more competitive. Private high school counselors are all of the above but with much more hand-holding, i.e., individualized guidance, essay help, resume building, and most importantly vast connection network with universities across the globe.\n\nI am assuming you seek the latter and if you don't go to such a school, you're really not going to find high quality for cheap. Counselors know their worth and will charge accordingly.\n\nSorry it's not much of an answer.",
