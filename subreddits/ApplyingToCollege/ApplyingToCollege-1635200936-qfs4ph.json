  "title:": "so my teacher just decided she isn't writing my letter of rec",
  "text": "title.\n\nmy teacher had a kid last week and decided that she would take a maternity leave, which is cool and whatever. we all knew she would take a break from giving us school work and grading and all but what she didn't say is that she wouldn't do any more letters of rec. my issue is that she was the person i selected for all the schools that only allow 1 lor and she hasn't written mine yet. i've already submitted my application and because of ferpa or whatever my counselor said he would put in the lor and my grades for me through naviance. my school also has a policy where teaches can't accept lor requests within 2 weeks of the deadline. so basically i have no lors and a lot of the schools i'm applying to \\*7 days from now\\* require one.\n\nwhat the fuck am i supposed to do.",

      "text": "I'm really sorry this is happening to you.  That's completely unfair, but it is what it is.  Is there another teacher who can write one? (with you supplying a comprehensive cheat-sheet including maybe a paragraph written by your parents on what your parents would want a teacher/counselor to know about you?  That's what we have on our school counselor questionnaire, and I honestly think they just cut-paste that paragraph.)\n\nThese things can be written in an hour or so (no-one wants to spend more than that on one single letter), so hopefully if you find a sympathetic teacher, and they send it to your counselor, or upload to Naviance directly, then you should be fine.\n\nGood LUCK!!",

They can directly email the school AO with your information attached to it (name, DOB, maybe a Id number on the portal). That\u2019s the easiest way out of the current situation you are in. And so sorry about all that you had to go through.",
