  "title:": "\"Social Good\" Theme Too Broad?",
  "text": "Hi all! I'm proofreading and finishing up edits my personal statement and supplemental essays right now, and I was wondering if \"social good\" would be a good theme for my overall application? I'm planning on talking about my passion for public policy, mentoring others, and implementing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within my school community, all under this overarching theme of \"social good.\"\n\nIs social good too broad of a theme? Should I focus more on a sub-theme in my supplemental essays, like policy?",
