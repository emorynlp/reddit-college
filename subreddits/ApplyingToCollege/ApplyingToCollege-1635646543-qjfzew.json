  "text": "I have spent half of my time in high school overseas, and when I look at my transcript, I realized some of the good grades that I earned overseas are translated to some barely passing grades on my American transcript. How can I explain to the college admission office that my grades aren't actually bad? \n\n(Like an 80 seems crappy here because the passing grade is 70 here, but an 80 in where I came from is pretty much a grade that can make you the 1st in class. And for sure the thing they teach overseas is much harder than America )",
