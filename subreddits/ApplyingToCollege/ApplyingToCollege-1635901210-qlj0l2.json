  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust looking for some reassurance/advice bc I am currently feeling like complete shit. So I submitted 6 early apps this past month, and looking back on it, I feel like on some of my activities I kinda underestimated how much time I put into it/represented it in a way that made it look like I didn't put in as much work as I did. For example, for one of my research activities, I put an avg. of 6 hrs/week, when in reality I was in the lab for upwards of 17 hr/week, so w/out that context it feels like I didn't put in the effort I actually did. I know that I can represent myself better for RD, but I feel like I fucked myself over when it comes to getting in bc of this.. overall my application is fine I just feel really dumb :/ If anyone has been thru a similar situation lmk what you did/how things turned out. How much do colleges weigh hours when it comes to decisions?",
