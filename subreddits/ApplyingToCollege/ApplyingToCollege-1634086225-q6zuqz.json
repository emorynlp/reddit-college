  "text": "Hi, filling out the CSS Profile rn and I'm really confused. I'm on the Parent Tax Return section and it lists several options: \n\n- Married, filing joint returns\n- Head of Household \n- Single \n- Married, filing separate returns \n- Qualifying widower with dependent child \n\nI'm not sure whether to put 'Head of Household' or 'Married, filing separate returns' even though they've been long divorced. Can someone help??",

      "text": "Unless your custodial parent remarried, they are probably filing as head of household. (They might be filing as single, in which case a later discussion on filing as head of household might be wise.) Filing status should be on page 1 of the tax forms.\n\nFor the non-custodial parent: They need to create a College Board account and then fill in their own profile. Make sure to give them your CBFinAid ID from the first profile.",
