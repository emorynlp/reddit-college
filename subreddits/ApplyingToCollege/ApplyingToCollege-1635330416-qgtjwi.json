      "text": "I think that the two factors that draw students to a college in the **initial** stage of the college search process (generally sophomores) are:\n\n1. **Prestige**. If you're just starting the process, you probably don't know that many schools, so when you think of schools, Yale, Harvard, Princeton etc come to mind.\n2. **Fun locations/Favorite sports teams etc.** The other factor for people who are just starting out the process is the school having a fun location or having a good football program or another factor like that. I've noticed that UCLA, NYU, UNC, etc are common dream schools for sophomores. (generally sophomores are just beginning to look at colleges.)",

Location - both geographic and cultural fit\n3. Colors - no joke. You\u2019ll be wearing this the rest of your life\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Personally I would save the T10 stuff for graduate degrees.
