  "title:": "Should I take action?",
  "text": "I want to get an idea of how serious this problem is, because I plan to take action soon.\n\nI go to a private high school that costs $20k to $30k annually, and I feel that the teacher that teaches AP Calculus AB is terribly unqualified.\n\nHere are a few reasons why:\n\nHe doesn't know the Quotient Rule. He tells us he doesn't remember the Quotient Rule, and tells us that it's important for us to remember the Quotient Rule. Three classes after that, he still doesn't remember. He's proud of it.\n\nHe only knows the derivative of sin, cos, and tan. He does not know the derivative of cot, sec, and csc.\n\nHe gets confused with one dimensional physics (e.g., acceleration vs speeding up). Keep in mind, he once taught high school physics before.\n\nHe makes basic algebraic and arithmetic mistakes in his demonstrations. None of us can actually pay attention because it's just a whirlpool of mistakes, correcting mistakes, rationalizing his mistakes, and not bothering to go further. He gets mad at us for not correcting him earlier.\n\nKeep in mind, I do not come from a particularly wealthy background, so the tuition I pay is a lot of money. I wouldn't listen to this teacher's class even if he paid me. Do you think I need to take action to request for a new teacher? The whole class of AP Calculus AB shares the same sentiment.",

      "text": "From my current experience with my Calc BC teacher: talk to him first. If you don\u2019t then the higher up people are less likely to listen. I know it probably won\u2019t do anything, but I think it\u2019s something to just get out of the way. Afterwards email or talk to the head of the math department; if it\u2019s an email CC every student who would vouch for you that he sucks, if it\u2019s in person then bring a couple friends but not too many so it won\u2019t be confrontational. This is about as much as you can do and while it hasn\u2019t worked for me (even though this dumbass said 50-5 was 44 for my test grade) it might work for you (my sister and her entire class complained to the administration and got their AP Physics C teacher removed)\n\nGood luck! In case nothing changes Khan Academy and various YouTube creators are great resources if you have to teach yourself and if you have a quick question over something I can\u2019t promise I know how to do it but i can try and help",
