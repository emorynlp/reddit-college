  "text": "From all the guides I've read, a common app essay must show growth from an event that happened in your life. It must give a hint to the college about who you are as a person and how you tackle life.\nMy question is, does the common app essay have to be emotional? I mean does it necessarily have to be deep in order to convey a message to the reader. Or can I just write about something normal which was important/unique to me in making me grow as a person.",
