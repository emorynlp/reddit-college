  "title:": "Balancing the immigrant parents narrative",
  "text": "Inspired by u/self_composed \u2018s important post.\nI\u2019m not the son of immigrant parents, but an immigrant myself, double immigrant in fact. When I was 6 and when I was 12, my parents have uprooted our entire lives to move to a different country (im in the us rn). I hated it both times, but I see now that it was entirely for my sake, both grew up very poor- literally without running water, and made it on their own. For years i\u2019ve seen them work day and night to make it again, and they have, entirely for me and the better quality of education and life that I would receive.\n\nGiven this background, you would expect them to fit A2Cs traditional immigrant asian parent narrative, but they don\u2019t, far from it. They\u2019re far from perfect, but they havent once told me what I should do or where i should apply, i bring up money and they refuse to discuss it, they dont check my grades and assume they dont know best when it comes to college apps. Throughout this process they\u2019ve been nothing but completely supportive and reasonable. \n\nHearing the horror stories on this sub and from my friends lives, I could not appreciate them more. But I\u2019ve come to realize that regarding them as the lucky exception is a mistake. There is no excuse, nor basis, to be a shitty parent. Suffering through an immigration experience does not preclude you from being a decent and logical person, no cultural values are set in stone, nor are they so blinding that they should take precedence over a child\u2019s happiness. Immigrant mindset is real but it doesn\u2019t have to make you a tyrant.\n\nNow that I think about it, I have two goals with this post. A) to prove that immigrant parents are not a monolith, nor do they have to be defined by their \u2018ethnic-ness\u2019. But also that you shouldn\u2019t write off bad parenting as \u2018immigrant behavior\u2019 because that rationalizes and justifies it. \nIt is not justified, it is not rational.\n\nImmigrants built this country with their tenacity and determination, and both of those traits are exclusive of abusive and narcissistic behavior.",
