When you apply to reaches...it is very important you realize that when they publish stats the school is being candid. What you may focus on is that you meet or exceed the midrange, but miss the other 40,000 applicants for those 1532 freshman slots do also. And if denied, no one is going to be able to offer a \"reasonable\" explanation why. It is really about several moments in time...nothing else. So, concentrate on anything but your reaches. ..better yet...get outside and just get some air/exercise. Walk the dog, see friends who are not a hot mess! Ultimately, you will be just dandy!",

If you dig deeper, you might find students just like you. If your worry is more on the rational side, maybe apply to more safer schools? Do you have a good local community college?
