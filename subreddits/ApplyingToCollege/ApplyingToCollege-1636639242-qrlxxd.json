  "text": "I've been using College Xpress and Cappex to help me reach out to more colleges and help me to find colleges that match my academic records. Lately, they've been giving me a list of colleges that are interested in me. Few are Ivy League schools like Harvard and Princeton. I know it doesn't mean much. Just colleges trying to get to know their applicants and demographics. Do you think it's wrong for me to attend their info on admission and academic sessions? \n\nTo me, I kinda see it as an opportunity to get to know the school and possibly transfer to their school for graduate study.",

And don't discount yourself because you aren't \"qualified.\" Have a little confidence in yourself OP. Would an unqualified applicant be considering going to an ivy for grad school or be this conscientious about attending info sessions?",
