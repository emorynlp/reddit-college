  "title:": "Can you link your GitHub to the Common App and if so, where? How useful is it for AO's?",
  "text": "Hi guys, so from the title you might have realized that I love to code. I have a few projects on my GitHub and I plan on adding more to it. I was wondering how you would list it. If anyone has put their GitHub on their applications, where did you list it? \n\nAlso, how helpful would it be to put it on a College App? I'm sure the AO's would not understand the true value of the projects on GitHub without actually having CS experience.",
