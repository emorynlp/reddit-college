  "title:": "should i bother applying to any of the UC\u2019s if they\u2019re not giving financial aid to out of state students?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve started my application for UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, and UCSD. I am a senior in Maryland, and I\u2019ve been looking into the UC\u2019s. I planned on applying to four just to widen my chances of getting into at least one. However, I saw an article that claimed the UC\u2019s don\u2019t give scholarships or financial aid to out of state students anymore???? I did google it and found more articles saying they stopped in 2016. I don\u2019t want to waste my time and start completing the essays for the UC\u2019s if my chance of getting any funding is slim. I checked their net price calculators, and all but one school shows that I won\u2019t be receiving any aid. I\u2019m trying to find info on merit but I haven\u2019t seen anything pertaining to our of state students. Are there any other out of state students applying to the UC\u2019s too? What\u2019s your take on this \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14. I\u2019ve already applied to Umass Boston, Delaware state, and Hampton University. Wondering if there\u2019s a chance for my application or if I should just stop the UC application dead in its tracks and continue with perfecting my other school apps.",

      "text": "PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nOOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid.\n\nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply. Most of the time, as long as the applicant correctly entered their state of residence, the NPC will catch the issue and show no grant aid, just loans.\n\nIf the UCs are not affordable, why waste the app fees? On the upside, at least you found out now, before applying. There WILL be posters in this subreddit in the spring who failed to check the NPCs, but post about how thrilled they are to be accepted OOS, and then ask why they can't find their financial aid package.",
