Which is why you should tell a story with your extracurriculars. They should speak to your story. Just thought I'd throw this out there.",

I'm passionate about hunger relief because my neighborhood has been suffering from famine for years so why are you? That's what matters. What sparked your interest. What motivates you. Not what you're passionate about or what you did. Would you rather have a refugee kid who cooked 200 meals for his camp to help with hunger relief or a rich boy who bought 1 million meals and distributed them? My point is what you do doesn't matter. Impact is not measured by numbers. It's measured by your story. Impact is how you used your experiences to better those of others.",

Once that happens you are screwed. A lot of the time, once you achieve to that level, you are USUALLY doing it for college application. From there, genuinity and coherence is lost, since what you did was not out of your heart.
