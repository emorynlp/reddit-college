  "text": "please help me choose a topic. i want to write about the disorder i have, which influences my life a lot, and i would describe how i feel about it and fight it every day. but i don't want an admission office to think smth like \"we don't want this weirdo in our community\" (especially, because sometimes i may have troubles with people i meet bc of this disorder). but it's a very big part of me and my life, so it's kinda important and a big challenge that i overcome every day. \n\nor should i not talk about this? i also have an idea of writing about losing my friends and how it influenced me, changed me and what conclusions i made.\n\nwhich one do you think would be better?\n\nthank you.",

      "text": "This is just what I\u2019ve heard but be careful if the disorder is something learning related such as ADHD or dyslexia. I\u2019m personally choosing not to mention my ADHD anywhere on my application because I don\u2019t want to seem like it\u2019s going to be a liability in the future. Also, be careful with mental illness. If you don\u2019t show that you have overcome this issue then it may also be seen as a liability by colleges. I would spend a lot of time writing it and show it to some other people to make sure",
