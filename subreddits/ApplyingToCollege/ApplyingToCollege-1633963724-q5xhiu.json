  "text": "International student here. Was going through the honors section of the common app today and started doubting myself. I have 5 national honours including being 5th in the country (jointly) in the national examinations (among 200,000 students) and 3rd in the country in another prestigious competition (Also: cash prize in the NCO and a rank of 73 rank in a national mathematics competition among 8,000 participants)\nIs that enough, or should an international award MUST BE present in order to have a chance at top universities? \n(brb having self esteem issues)",
