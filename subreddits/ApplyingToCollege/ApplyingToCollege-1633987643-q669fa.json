  "text": "I switched schools for Sr year, but want to use recommendations from teachers from my old school. My new school uses Naviance so it's connected to the CA.\n\nHow do I officially request these recs from my old school (I've asked them personally already). And should they be teacher evaluations or letters? This part is so confusing and any help is appreciated!",
