However, her school only issues progress (unofficial) grades at the 6 and 12 week marks. With official grades at the end of each semester (week 18). As the 12 week mark would be too late for ED, her counselor submitted her 6 week progress report and then sent a letter saying if they wanted her 12 week report to reach out to her.",
