  "text": "My school is on a semester system, and we get a letter grade for Sem 1 and a letter grade for Sem 2. On the Common App Courses+Grades, however, it lists a S1 grade, S2 grade, AND a \"Final Grade\" that has to be filled out for all of my classes. What should I list in this \"Final Grade\" section, considering my school only gives S1 and S2 grades, not an overall Final Grade to students?",
