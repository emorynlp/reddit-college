  "title:": "How important is school performance vs district-wide performance in the admissions process?",
  "text": "So I attend school in one of the top 20 largest public school systems in the U.S. As such, we have 20+ high schools and usually with very different student bodies and achievements. The wealthier and magnet schools have very high achievers with regard to test scores, ECs, basically everything. They send 30+ students to ivies + T20s if not more, each year.\n\nHowever, I attend one of the lower performing schools in the district and do more than most of my peers, have an SAT score 400+ points above my school avg, was one of the first NMSF in 3 years, etc. Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that I am very high performing in the context of my school, but am just average when compared to the students at the wealthy and magnet schools w/ 1600 SATs and take Calc BC as sophomores.\n\nHow important is this in the admissions process at ivies/t20s? Will it benefit me that I stand out against my peers or will it hurt me that I don't attend one of the better schools that has a history of sending students to ivies? Considering apps are read by regional admissions officers, how can they truly distinguish between schools that are 20 min away from each other, even though they are vastly different? \n\nWhile the schools do send a school profile, how important is this really? It's not like each ivy is going to take one student from my school. Any thoughts?",

Furthermore, the \u2018School Report\u2019 aka \u2018School Profile\u2019 will typically have the average test scores, demographics, typical range of GPAs, number of APs offered etc. If you have an opportunity to meet your local AO in person, at a school event or virtual event, do so.",
