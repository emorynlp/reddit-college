      "text": "MIT and Cornell both provide a top-tier CS education.  \nYou will be academically qualified for any undergraduate-appropriate job opportunity in the US, if not the world as as a graduate from either institution.  \n\nMIT and Cornell both provide top-tier recruiting opportunities.  \nMajor employers who desire top-talent to help solve serious problems know they can find great talent at either school.  \nSo you can access more or less equally excellent employment options at either institution.  \n\nSame for internships.  \n\nBut not necessarily the same opportunities for Co-Op work engagements.  \nMIT being on the fringes of Boston gives it an advantage there.  \n\n-----  \n\nIMO don't decide between the two based on who is a better CS institution. They are effectively equals in that regard.  \n\nFocus on the other aspects of your college experience instead.  \n\nCornell is way up in Northern New York, like an hour away from Niagara Falls.  \nIthaca, NY is a nice town, but it's not Boston.  \n\nMIT is a mile away from Harvard, and a mile away from Fenway Park and the Red Sox.  \nThere are **Fourty-Four** colleges+universities in the greater Boston Area.  \n\nCornell has some of the very highest qualify campus food in the US.  \nWhatever MIT lacks in quality of on-campus food, Boston can make up for.  \n\nCornell has a nice $7 Billion endowment fund.  \nMIT has an $18 Billion endowment fund.  \n\nMIT can certify you as an authentic pirate.  \nCornell has those awesome gorges & waterfalls.  \n\nMIT has the Media Lab which is always perking up something awesome.  \nCornell has a shiny new Technology Campus for Graduate studies in NYC.",
