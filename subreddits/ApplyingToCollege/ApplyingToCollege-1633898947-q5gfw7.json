  "text": "Ea apps are due soon and my grade in ap stat is a D. She only put in 3 hw grades and I forgot to do 1 of them. She hasn\u2019t updated the grade book since September 20th. I wanna submit apps in 8 days but common app asks for mp1 grades. The marking period doesn\u2019t end until November middle. I know that my grade would be much higher if she updated recent grades but she won\u2019t do it till later. What should I do?",
