  "text": "As an international student from Azerbaijan, I want to live in the US after I finish college. However applying to the US as an international student is really hard, plus, our family does not make a lot of money, so it would be really hard to sustain paying for tuition. But if I do go to China, it would take a lot of time and be really difficult to get a permanent visa to work in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were to be accepted to the US, its unlikely that I would get into a university as good as Peking. However it would be easier to get a job there. What do you guys think? Would it help my case if employers in the US see that I went to a good college and hire me? China isnt exactly the free-est country so there is that too. I apologies if this isnt the kind of questions that you normally get on the sub",
