  "text": "My grandfather got Covid and was in a coma for 4 months. When he fainted, the doctor said he is in a very critical state and to prepare for the worst scenario. And with that country\u2019s mandatory quarantine law, we were gonna to miss his funeral if we were to leave on the day he passed away due to the mandatory 2 week quarantine. Therefore, we had to fly to that country and stayed there for 4 months doing online school, which was done in the opposite time zone. Asian time zone to the Pacific Standard Time. I was starting school at 1:30 AM, which completely messed up my body. Although my grades did not drop of anything, is this still worth mentioning in my Covid disruption essay because of all the mental instability I went through last winter?",
