  "text": "I'm an Int'l student and since I've basically got no one to check my Common App and other uni essays, a friend told me about Grammarly. \n\nSince then, I've been getting 100s and 98s on almost every essay I cross-check with the app, cuz I am also applying to unis that are wayyyyyyy out of my league atm because of where I'm applying from.\n\nSo my question was, is the app reliable for people like me? And what's the average score for a Common App essay on it according to you?\n\nThanks for the help in advance! :D",

      "text": "i typically get a score within the range of 92-99, and i'm usually okay with that, because certain suggestions are for word choice and sentence structure, and since i make those choices for stylistic reasons, i'm okay with not making those changes according to grammarly and don't end up with a 100. i'm still okay with the writing i've produced, whether i end up with a score of 93 vs. 98 :) and also, sometimes, grammarly just doesn't make correct judgements (like in comma use, for example, bc it doesn't understand the context that the comma is in), and so when i ignore those suggestions, i don't receive a perfect score.",

      "text": "grammarly is sometimes ass about word choice even when the word u chose to use in the context of the sentence is fine. and they dock points from your \u201cwriting score\u201d bc of it. that\u2019s the same w passive voice. it\u2019s kinda understandable bc it\u2019s all ML/AI stuff checking your essay, not a human. tbh as long as you don\u2019t get the yellow lines for major issues with punctuation, you should be fine. the overall score isn\u2019t as important.",
