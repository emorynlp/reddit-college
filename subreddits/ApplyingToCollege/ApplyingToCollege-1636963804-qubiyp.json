  "text": "I\u2019m applying to a college on Common App that has a Dec 1 deadline. My counselor has been saying that if we\u2019re applying to a school with a Dec 1 deadline, then we need to submit the applications by Nov 17 if we want our transcripts and other documents submitted on time, but I always thought those documents could be sent after applying, even if the deadline has passed.",

Not sure if I should even apply anymore bc I still have two supplements to write and even if I were to submit the application now it could take days before I get my portal link so I can get my counselor to send the documents.",

      "text": "A December 1 deadline does mean materials must arrive at the college by December 1.\n\nI understand why a high school has an earlier deadline for a request to get material submitted by a deadline, especially with the Thanksgiving holiday. Our school says a request for a transcripts must be in 2 weeks ahead of when they need to get it to the college.  I wouldn\u2018t expect to request a transcript from the high school on 11/30 and expect the transcript to be at the school on 12/1.\n\nBut I don\u2019t understand why it means the actual application, which you submit directly to the college, has to be anywhere else, earlier.",
