To me, the info on the USC website seems pretty unambiguous:\n\n>December 1\\*  \n>  \n>Consideration for Merit Scholarships:  \n>  \n>All first-year applicants who submit a complete application by December 1 will be considered for USC Merit Scholarships.  \n>  \n>Final first-year deadline for the following programs:  \n>  \n>All Cinematic Arts and Music programs, the Dance program, all Dramatic Arts BFA programs, the Iovine and Young Academy, and the World Bachelor in Business (WBB) program. See Additional Major Requirements for information about your intended program.\n\nThen:\n\n>January 15  \n>  \n>Final first-year application deadline for all other programs.\n\nIf you want to be considered for merit scholarships or are applying to any of those programs listed under December 1, then apply by December 1. Otherwise the deadline is January 15.",
