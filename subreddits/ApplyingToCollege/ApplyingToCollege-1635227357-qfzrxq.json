  "text": "I'm applying ED to either WashU or Brown in like a week (oh god) and I wanted to know if there were major differences in the type of education you'd receive at Brown/WashU for an arts major. Does Brown's slightly better name affect internship/job opportunities? Also, what are other details abt the schools (like what are the dorms like or is travelling to class convenient etc)?",

      "text": "I'm not in the fine arts program, but both are very strong. Personally I'd have to favor Brown for their partnership with RISD.\n\nBut I can say that WashUs dorms are really nice, we're definitely grateful for comfy mattresses and a great res college system. And there's plenty of single rooms in case you don't want roommates. Walking to class is nice, though time consuming (up to 20min) but there's a free shuttle that'll take you anywhere you need to go.",
