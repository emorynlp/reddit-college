      "text": "well that actually quite makes sense imo? if you're very passionate about a **super** specific field (just like what the post says about a history major applicant: a specific era of a specific region) it's eaiser to showcase ur intellectual vitality and ur \"professional knowledge\" (if this is the right way to phrase this). in this case, it's much easier for them to build a class with truly diverse interests.",

      "text": "Not exactly related to the subject of the article, but one thing I've noticed from the Naviance scatter plots at my kid's school is that there seems to be a GPA threshold past which GPA is no longer predictive of whether a student is admitted.  The campus doesn't have enough kids apply to T10 to generate scatter plots, so I'm basing this on the next tier down.  Northwestern, Rice, etc.\n\nThe threshold seems to be around 4.2 (weighted, overall).  At this campus the max % of classes a student can take weighted is around 60%.  It also uses fractional grade points, e.g. 100 = 4.0, 99 = 3.9, etc.  So if we assume top students have about 60% weighted, then 4.2 corresponds to an unweighted numerical average (over all courses) of around 96/100.\n\nAbove that seems to provide little to no benefit.  Below this level and the odds approach zero; above it and they're somewhere in the 25-40% range.",
