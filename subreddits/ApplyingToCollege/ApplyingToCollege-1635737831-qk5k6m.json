  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm trying to transfer to USC for Music Composition at the Thornton School of Music. I'm pretty scared about the admissions. I have a 3.9 GPA from my classes so far after 3 semesters in CC. I'm still trying to build my portfolio for the application. I'm not done with the portfolio yet but I think I have good musical experience with piano and producing music. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks.",
