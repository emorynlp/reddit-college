  "text": "Hey guys, I am not a very extroverted person, who can easily joke around with teachers and stuff, so I don't know any of my teachers that well. Also, I just shifted to USA an year ago, so I am an immigrant kid in my high school and haven't completely gotten use to the whole American high school thing which is why I can't don't talk to my teachers that openly, but now that I am applying to colleges I need good letter of recommendation from teachers but I don't know who to ask them from. What should I do?",

      "text": "You don't really have an option here - try to reach out to the teachers who you think might know you best, and request a couple of them to write a recommendation for you... Since it is already quite late, some of them may not have the time to do so before the regular deadlines, so please try and start the process right away.",
