  "text": "Ok, bear with me on this one. So I run a service on a game where I manage people's sales of rare items since the game itself has little infrastructure to support item sales that aren't just flatsales; I work with them to determine rules like sale duration/accepted payments/etc, reach out to interested parties, and then proceed to run the actual sale. Think manually-run eBay here. I've run 100+ of these so far and have spent a couple of years building up people's trust in me to do this; the priciest item I've helped sell this way was worth a few thousand USD's worth in in-game currency. Do you think this is at all viable as an EC if explained well enough, even if it doesn't involve real-life currency transactions?\n\nP.S. If you think you know the game I'm talking about, please don't comment the name - I don't feel like getting doxxed over there haha.",

      "text": "Any activity that shows initiative, problem solving, critical thinking, community support, time, leadership, and dedication etc. belongs in your EC list.  The issue here is the space you have to describe this activity.  You might describe it in familiar terms like the way eBay works.  Maybe something like this: \"Created, facilitated, and managed currency/goods exchange forum for online gaming community.\" It's just a start, but it might help you articulate your experience.  Good luck to you.",
