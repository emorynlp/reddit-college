  "text": "Please help. So I'm currently stuck between like 2-3 majors (finance, comp sci, space engineering). I don't know which one to pick and I need to start writing the 'why us' essays for my early applications. The finance/business programs are really competitive so should I apply for finance since it'd be harder to switch into it later on? Or should I just pick the most appealing major as of now\n\nThanks in advance!",
