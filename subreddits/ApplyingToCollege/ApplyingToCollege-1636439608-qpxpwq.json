  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently in \u201cInteract Club\u201d (Rotary Club) and I plan to join NHS next year. What I\u2019ve realized though is that NHS seems to involve a lot of community service in it, so I was wondering if it would actually be more hurtful than beneficial if I took two community service clubs instead of one. What do you guys think? Do one or the other affect applications?",
