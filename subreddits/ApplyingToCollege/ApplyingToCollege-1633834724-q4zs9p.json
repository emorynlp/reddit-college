  "text": "I really need help and ideas on what to major in and careers. I\u2019m a senior in high school so i kind of have to decide. I was gonna put Comp Sci and Business but idk if I should do comp sci. I want to learn to code and think it would be cool, but i really don\u2019t want to have a job that consists of sitting in front of a screen all day. I want to interact with people and do interesting things. But comp sci pays well and i\u2019m good at math. And i figured if i don\u2019t like it i can just switch to business ( planning to either minor in it or possibly double major). Or i could always get and MBA if i wanted to. So idk if a business major would be worth it so i settled on CS. But i really do like science and would do something in the medical field but i don\u2019t want to spend another decade in school. So i was thinking of just taking a couple of science classes and other things i\u2019m interested in as elective credits and/or minor in a science. I\u2019m not wanting to do liberal arts because i don\u2019t want a career in that. Also the things i\u2019m more passionate about i don\u2019t need a degree for (stuff like art, design, food). I thought a business degree would be useful if i ever want to start one. But then again i\u2019m not sure if a business undergrad is worth it. So i just don\u2019t know what i wanna do :(. Any advice would be appreciated. Also leave your major and why you chose that (or your experience with) so i can have ideas.",

That doesn't necessarily mean you have to go into the medical field. You could major in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, biomedical engineering, bioengineering, chemical engineering, and definitely more that I don't know about.",

          "text": "yeah i was thinking of that but i don\u2019t really want to do engineering. And idk what the career prospects for a science major are without grad school. I\u2019ve seen that some ppl regret that as a major because there\u2019s not many jobs available if you\u2019re not doing premed or healthcare so I wanted to be practical and major in something versatile and just take science classes for the fun of it. I mostly just like how you get to do hands on experiments and learning about how things work and then seeing that is interesting to me, but i\u2019m not sure how that would translate into a career. I do however want to start a business in the future so i\u2019m definitely going to do either a major or minor in that, but i was thinking maybe i shouldn\u2019t do a major in that because i could always do an mba if i really wanted to without needing a business undergrad.",

      "text": "A somewhat liberal artsy school sounds like it could be a good fit for you, not knowing exactly what you're interested in career-wise and having a wide variety of interests otherwise (CS, science, business, art, design, etc).\nAnyway, have you thought about architecture or something similar for the design aspect? Or maybe you'd enjoy some sort of managementy job for the people interaction. What things make you excited about biology/sciency stuff? Are there any books, websites, yt channels, people you know, shows, podcasts, etc that you like and that relate, even loosely, to a career? What experiences do you have that stick out to you? What people do you look up to and why?\n\nPersonally, I'm interested in engineering, either mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, or nuclear. I don't know exactly which one yet since I don't have experience super specific to any. I did have an engineering ish internship over the summer that was really cool and fun, though. It involved a wide variety of stuff, including working in a lab with a bunch of cool equipment, but also a lot of cool co-workers. I was surprised how cool the people were, tbh, so maybe your people interest could be quenched by jobs that you wouldn't normally think of as having a ton of social interaction (though idk if CS would be that....). Anyway, the internship and my general interests (math, science, and problem solving) make engineering an obvious choice for me. One thing in particular that excites me is a YT channel called Applied Science. He has a ton of crazy cool videos that make everyone else on yt look like idiots with three braincells. Like, he made an electron microscope, a mass spectrometer, has a vacuum system for pvd, and every other crazy thing you could think of that basically nobody else just has in their literal garage. These videos have amplified my engineering/science interest and broadened my understanding of what sorts of things are out there.\n\nIf engineering for some reason doesn't work out for me, another thing I'm interested in is meteorology and ocean wave science. I read a book called The Wave by Susan Casey that talked about a bunch of cool wave stuff that is never really thought about before - giant \"rogue\" waves in particular: how scientists are working to try to predict them, how they impact shipping/boats, how surfers chase them, etc. Sounds boring but it really wasn't. There were some other industries related to shipping, weather, etc that actually sounded really interesting too.\n\nLastly, maybe look on indeed or LinkedIn to see some actual jobs for some ideas.",
