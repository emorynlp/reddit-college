  "text": "So for the state school I\u2019m applying to, I am well into the average range of SAT scores, but for the Honors program, I am about 100 below their average. \n\nMy main goal is to do Honors College, but I have to submit an SAT score that would be considered for both or not submit a score which will not be considered for either.\n\nI\u2019m just afraid not submitting my SAT score to my safety and state school would look bad.\n\nSo should I submit the score or not?",
