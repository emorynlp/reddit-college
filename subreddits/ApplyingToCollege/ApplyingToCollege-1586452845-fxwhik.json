We're now officially closed until April 24th. They're waiting to make bigger decisions because they just don't know and because initially I think they didn't want to panic people. But honestly there's a pretty high chance we aren't going back at all.\n\nI don't know where you live but I'd be very surprised if they're actually able to follow through and have school in early may. Even the optimistic estimates expect the worst of it to be over at the end of May.",
