  "text": "I asked my counselor for a recommendation letter but she didn't respond after a few days.\n\nSo I pushed her by emailing her 1 time more and came to 1:1 meeting today because the deadline was November 1st, but she wasn't available at that time. \n\nBut when I accidentally made eye contact with her today, she made big eyes + upward eyebrows + downward lips facial expression. It wasn't a bad facial expression, but it seemed like she felt awkward by me.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I am thinking about not asking for a recommendation letter from my counselor and receive it from my English teacher.\n\nWould college wonder why I didn't get a recommendation letter from my counselor?\n\nAnd is counselor letter more valuable than the teacher rec letter?",

I asked my counselor and my volunteer service vice principal. It's total 4 rec letters so it is a lot more than I planned now :( I hope it doesn't hurt my chance because the site said I can send up to 2 rec letters. (But I can upload more than 2.) IDK how it will affect me tho.",
