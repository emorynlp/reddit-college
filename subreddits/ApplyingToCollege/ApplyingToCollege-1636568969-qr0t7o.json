  "text": "I had an interview today with Barnard, but I never received the link. Around 13 minutes after the interview was supposed to begin, I received a follow-up link. The interview was cut short, and the interviewer didn't know that I hadn't received the link until the end of the interview, which is when I told her:( Even though I clarified that I didn't receive the link until after the interview began, could this have messed up my chances? Even if the circumstances were out of my control? I answered however many questions we could go through well for the most part, but I'm still scared that this might mess up my chances of getting in. The interviewer didn't even ask me the \"why Barnard\" question, which is basically a given for all Barnard interviews:/ Barnard is my top choice and I've been prepping for the interview for weeks, I just don't want this to mess up my chances of getting in. \n\nI also wasn't able to take down the interviewers email in time, so even though I mailed askastudent@barnard requesting her email to thank her and ask her a few questions, I just don't want to give her a bad impression:'(",
