  "text": "What are the best Dual Enrollment Courses to take for a CS major? In context, I quite like CS/Math, and have an underwhelming amount of AP's for my school, so I would like to use the extra time I get from not having those extra AP's in Dual Enrollment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would be the best Dual Enrollment Courses to take, for becoming competitive for T20's?",

I'm trying to take Data Science next quarter (winter), Data Structures and algorithms after (spring). Since I'm behind on Calc BC, I can only do Multivariable Calculus in the summer session. After that I'm not sure, because college apps. So yeah do you reccomed anything for Math? Is MVC or Linear Alg the best, or is there anything better? I heard discrete mathematics is cool and related to CS as well?",
