  "text": "Hi! So I recently had all my teachers (three in total) submit their recommendations on common app/Naviance. It says on common app that all 3 have been downloaded, but on my harvard portal, it only shows two recommendations? Should I assume the third one is there? Or do I need to have a third teacher utilize the additional rec link? Thank you!",
