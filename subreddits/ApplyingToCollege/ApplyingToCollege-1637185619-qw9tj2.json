      "text": "Watching survivor has prepared me for this because there are some people who are so chaotic that they have quotes for any type of people. Check out all of these by [Tyson Apostol](https://www.ilovesurvivor.com/2012/08/tyson-apostol-famous-quotes.html?m=1). Some of them are mean, some are funny, a lot of these are from his older seasons before he became a dad and mellowed out. [Abi](https://www.ilovesurvivor.com/2013/01/abi-maria-gomes-famous-quotes.html?m=1) also had entertaining moments on the show.\n\nContenders for my senior quote from this list (not actually contenders):\n\n>When it comes down to it, I want that million dollars. Exotic, expensive furs on my shoulder. Jewels on these pretty fingers. We're talking big time. I'll wear a tiara... a man tiara. Do they make those? \n\n\n>So, I kicked ass, like I always do. And...uh... if any ladies want my phone number... I guess... uh... Ask! \n\n>I am your friend but if you f*ck with me you're dead. Seriously you are done! Just letting you know.\n\n>I don't wanna cook but I definitely do wanna eat. I don't wanna starve to death.\n\n>If you tell a lie long enough everyone starts to believe it and I'm convinced in my own lie. Even I am believing myself right now.",
