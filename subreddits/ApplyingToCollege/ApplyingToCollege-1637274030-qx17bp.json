  "text": "I\u2019m probably just being excessively paranoid but how can you prove to colleges you actually did something? My family is from a 3rd world country and prior covid we used to visit there every summer. the summer after freshman year a kind of family friend had a school he worked at and i started volunteering there. the issue is that he moved and i can\u2019t contact him anymore. i keep calling other members of my family but they all don\u2019t have his updated number. i put this in my activities section but idk how i can prove it and now im paranoid cause my deadass only proof is me saying i did it(and ig my family too). it\u2019s nothing prestigious but do i have to worry about having no proof? this is prolly stupid but it\u2019s bothering me cause what if they think i\u2019m lying??? how can i prove it in a way that isn\u2019t just like my family being oh yeah he did it. i wrote about it in my common app because it was important to me but now i\u2019m worried because i have no guarantee i can prove it. there\u2019s always the change i manage to contact him but what if i can\u2019t???",
