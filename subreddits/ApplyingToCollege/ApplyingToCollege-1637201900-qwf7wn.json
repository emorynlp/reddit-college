  "text": "Filling out my fafsa and it\u2019s asking for net worth of my current business. I have a sole proprietorship and it was just me working, I don\u2019t even work full time for it but I do still have it going, was wondering since it doesn\u2019t have 100 full time employees and it\u2019s owned by me if I\u2019d report the net worth of assets or not, bc it says if your family owns 51% or more and it has 100 or fewer employees, but in the definition it only talks about family members and doesn\u2019t mention anything about me, the student applying, so if anyone could help that\u2019d be great",
