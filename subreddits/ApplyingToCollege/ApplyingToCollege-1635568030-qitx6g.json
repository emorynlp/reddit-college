Very soon all posts will go back to being about RDs for everyone.",

Don't worry about it. \n\nYou really have to love that school and if you don't then that's a major commitment (like marriage, lol). Better to have choices and see what kind of financial aid packages and leverage that if you're not in love with the college and wealthy.",

      "text": ">i\u2019m not applying ed anywhere- am I doing something wrong??\n\nIMO the main reason not to apply ED anywhere is money.  That is, if you want to apply many different places, get financial aid and merit scholarship offers from each of them, then take price into account when choosing between them.  If you're someone who will pay whatever it costs to attend the most prestigious school possible then you should just pick a favorite and ED to it.  Though, I'm certainly not endorsing that mentality.",

Ofc, it's also slightly different for me since I need to know what type of fin aid I will get, so I would rather not go into a binding decision.",
