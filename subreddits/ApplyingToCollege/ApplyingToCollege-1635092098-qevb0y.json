  "title:": "Should I Mention that my school makes me take Calc AB before BC?",
  "text": "I'm applying to some really tough schools (MIT and Caltech) and some of them (Caltech especially) seem to really care that students excel in math. I'm not applying for math or anything (most likely going for biochem/BME) but I still think it might look bad that I had to spend 2 years doing calc AB and BC putting me behind a bunch of other applicants whose schools let them skip straight to clac BC. Do you think its worth writing a blurb in the additional info section about this? (A already wrote about research I did in this section so it might be a bit awk)\n\nP.S. I don't think my school's report mentions course prerecs. I've seen an old copy and it just seems to list which courses are offered.",
