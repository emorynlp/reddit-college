      "text": "Probably early next week. Some schools do not send confirmations on the weekend. Some schools take a few days. It is also extremely common for confirmation emails to end up in a spam folder.\n\nIt appears as though Common App batches a college's submitted apps at 11:59 eastern, and then the college automatically downloads the batch a few hours later.  So if you submitted after midnight eastern, your app may not be downloaded until middle of the night tonight, in which case you'd get your confirmation tomorrow (if they do weekend confirmations) or probably early next week.",
