  "text": "Im 16 years old and im from India . I dropped out in 10 th grade as my mother had some health complications and i was Mentally unstable,  had episodes of Panic attacks and Crippling anxiety .\n\nAfter being in Hiatus for a year or so i am continuing 10 th grade in India , as passing 10 th grade is mandatory for applying a Non-ECR Passport . \n\nI'm planning on getting a GED and English proficiency test after finishing 10 th grade here in India and moving to the US  . I want to purse a undergraduate degree in Software engineering/Development . \n\nIs it possible to get a undergraduate degree without a SAT  in a average university ?\n\nWhat are the things that i need to know for the above , \n\nAny advice is appreciated :) Thank you",
