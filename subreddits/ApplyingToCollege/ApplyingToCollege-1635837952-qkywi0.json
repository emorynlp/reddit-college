  "text": "I\u2019m currently trying to build my school list but I\u2019m struggling to find schools that are a good balance of quality and price. My stats are honestly above average and my ECs are pretty good too, but a lot of tier one schools are out of the question just because of price. My family is middle class, but my EFC does *not* reflect that (estimated like 45k per year) and I know even 25-30K without aid is seriously expensive for my family. \n\nBasically I can\u2019t expect much financial aid, merit aid is generally thin for any school (less than 6k), and it will be hard to afford school. \n\nIs there anything I can do to lessen the financial burden? What schools are both *actually* affordable and good quality?",

      "text": "Run your financial data through Harvard's and Princeton's net price calculators.  They're known to be generous with financial aid.  If the numbers they return aren't affordable, then you can pretty safely assume no school that costs more than you can afford is going to give you enough need-based aid to become affordable.\n\nSo that leaves:\n\n1. Full price at an in-state school.  Depending on your state of residence, that could be in the $20-30k range.\n2. Non-need-based (i.e. merit) aid.\n\n\\#2 splits into two types:  guaranteed and non.  Some schools have a grid that tells you exactly how much they'll give you based on your SAT/GPA.   Others will have competitive merit awards.  The more selective the school the harder it is to win one of those awards.\n\nAlso:  \"good quality\" is highly subjective.  There are plenty of schools the median A2C poster would turn up his nose at where the median student \\*enrolled at that school\\* nevertheless feels the experience he's receiving is of \"good quality\".\n\nWhat does \"good quality\" mean to you?  Also, what's your state of residence and how good are your stats?",

I don't know what \"tier 1\" means to you, but there are a number of R1 research universities using the Carnegie classification, including members of the AAU, that are still generous with merit aid.",
