  "text": "and it made me realise (now more than ever) that getting rejected from a top school honestly does not say anything about you as a person, student, or candidate. \n\nthere are rich people getting their below-academically-average children into T20\u2019s every single year and most of them are still under the radar. \n\nso with admission decisions rolling out - I just want to say that you should not base your self worth on getting into a school. and while getting rejected from a school might be because there were more qualified candidates, there is a greater likelihood that it\u2019s not because of that at all - but just because the american college admissions process is far too unpredictable and unequivocally corrupt. \n\ngood luck, and stay sane.",

She observed that their parents would not accept a college whose \"pretige ranking\" was a true reflection of their children's academic goals--they were not proud of what their kids could do on their own if it meant failing to keep up appearances. Essentially they didn't love them for who they were.\n\nThen she said she was proud of me no matter where I go. I carry that with me this admissions cycle.",

Though, it is certainly the most progressive/holistic system in the world by a long shot (with respect to standardized testing at least; the legacy system definitely is not progressive).",

You either pay up front with a big donation (most expensive), do something shady like these people did (pay off a coach or cheat on the SAT), or the most common and least talked about, buy your kid the opportunities and help necessary to craft a perfect application <----- this one is why there are more people from the top 1% at Harvard than from the bottom 60%. People who have money and go to a fancy private high school or even just a rich competitive public high school where there's tons of opportunities/help make it soooo much easier to get in. Colleges do this because they WANT to serve the upper class. In order to keep up their image as prestigious schools they know they can't let in ordinary people, or at least not in even proportions.",

The rich have an advantage in every possible way that a student can be evaluated, unless you're pitching banning *being rich* (which as a socialist I'm pretty amenable to) you can't completely remove money from the equation. You have to ask yourself what metrics schools could replace standardized tests with.\n\nEssays? A rich kid has all the same advantages that they do for the SAT in the form of tutoring to optimize them, plus if you're writing about experiences it's easier to have cool experiences if your parents are taking you around the world for \"charity work\". It's also an area where a rich person can directly pay someone to write the essays for you. This means that overall it's worse than the SAT as a metric.\n\nGPA? This is an okay metric, but keep in mind that private schools basically build themselves to get rich kids into colleges. If GPA becomes the singular (or heavily dominant) factor in admissions, grade inflation at private schools will explode. Also GPA is a flawed metric because, as anyone who's hung out on this sub knows, there's a glut of people who have 4.0s (or 3.95s or whatever). Also, it has all the same tutoring issues as SAT. Overall this is a good metric to keep using somewhat, just so you don't end up with college being full of people who were slackers at school completely but just did well on the test, but it needs to be viewed alongside the SAT to determine if it actually reflects a student's scholastic ability.\n\nExtracurriculars? While getting an award for a sport or competitive club is impressive, if you object to the extra coaching that money can buy you, this one needs to be dropped too because it can apply just as much as the SAT also, this inherently shouldn't be a big metric because at the end of the day, school should be about academic performance and factor athletic performance in around the edges, not center it. Then you've got to factor in other kinds of clubs, or things like charity work. A lot of these can easily be faked with money. \n\nThe SAT/ACT is bullshit. The SAT is particular is a product from a scammy monopolistic company, and the fact that it costs money to take, retake, and send out scores is bullshit. You're totally right that the rich have an advantage with it. Ultimately though, just by nature of the fact that the rich kid has to actually learn the material, and having someone take the test for you is actually risky, means that it's probably the best metric there is. If you ask me, the recent push for getting rid of the SAT almost certainly comes from people with wealthy backgrounds trying to get rid of the only factor that they couldn't buy their way past, but using progressing language to mask that fact.",

It is one of the most affordable universities in the country, with tuition only 1900 a semester. The education there was AWESOME. I never felt like I was missing out or less than. And my husband is 2 years out of school and working as a supervisor at an awesome company and we made some great contacts and friends along the way. He is happy at work and we are getting ready to buy a home! (If the market ever improves lol). What my point is that most universities are really just as good or pretty close to as good of an education as those higher ranked schools. Go easy on yourself!",

I also have 0 debt. \n\nNot knocking those that graduated from prestigious universities, go for it, but it\u2019s not the end all be all.",
