  "text": "Hello! I was wondering, should I put somewhere in my application I'm a 2e student?\n2e means twice excepcional, which refers to a gifted folk (IQ of 130+) and a learning disability (in my case dyslexia)\n\nI wanted to say that as a way to explain some of my low grades, but wouldn't it be counterproductive? \n\nI also need a full ride scholarship - would any university consider a dyslexic international student for such a big scholarship?",

It isn't going to help if the situation hasn't been \"fixed.\" If you do choose to disclose, it might be best for your school counselor to do that.\n\nYou would not indicate anything about IQ in the app, so you would not indicate 2e either.\n\n(It must be the time of year, as seemingly every five minutes another new international student posts asking how they can get a full ride to schools in the US. Try r/IntltoUSA and google extensively.)",

I wonder where the idea that US colleges give out all these free 4 year educations valued at $300k came from. \n\nIt\u2019s rare for any kid to get a full ride to college these days. Even low income US kids are expected to take out the federal loan each year as part of any aid package.",
