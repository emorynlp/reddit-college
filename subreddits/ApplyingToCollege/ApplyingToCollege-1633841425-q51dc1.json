  "text": "In my case, I do not feel there is any such thing that I didn't really have a chance to share in the rest of application. However, my brain also does not allow me to leave a 650-word space blank. A friend suggested me to consider it as free real estate and told me to write about some EC activity or achievement that I'm proud of in detail since the activity section barely gives any space to do so. However I was a bit conflicted over this idea... Any suggestions?",

      "text": "I don't think AOs really want to see another essay. If they did, they'd add an actual essay prompt. I think most people that use the additional info section write about things that affected their grades, explain why parts of their app are like they are (ex: why you stopped doing a certain significant EC or something.), or expand on something else really significant. Like you said, the point is to fill in any major holes that would make your application seem incomplete in your eyes.",
