  "text": "Hopefully this doesn\u2019t come off too douchey. \n\nMy school does grading by quarter and our guidance counselors just sent us a survey to choose whether we want to send our Q1 grades to our colleges. \n\nI got all A/A+ with a B- in Calc BC this quarter. I\u2019m applying to UVA and Yale EA with a major not related to math at all. \n\nSo my questions are:\n- Would it be wise to send my grades given that I don\u2019t have to? (my grades have been pretty consistently in the A range) \n- Would not sending my grades suggest that my report card is actually bad as opposed to one mediocre grade?\n- Do either of these schools require Q1 grades? I can\u2019t seem to find that info. \n\nI\u2019ve seen enough of these posts that I know not to freak out over a B- but I\u2019m just curious. Thanks lol",
