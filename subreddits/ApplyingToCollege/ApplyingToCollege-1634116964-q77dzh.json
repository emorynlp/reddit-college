  "text": "I am a highschool senior currently enrolled in the IB diploma. I have a 39/45 predicted grade in IB. I have a SAT score of 1390. Activities are average like some internships, 3 research papers, 9 muns with 3 best delegate 2 chairs and 3 vice-chairs, a personal blog with 20000 views, chess and table tennis - district level player. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I think if I give a reattempt on the SAT, I will be easily able to score a 1500 and improve my activities a lot. **So,** **Should I apply RD or ED,EA for the universities?**\n\nMy prospective University List - UIUC ,Gtech ,Umich , Wisconsin, UMD, all UCs. \n\n(This is not a chanceme post just asking for advice)",
