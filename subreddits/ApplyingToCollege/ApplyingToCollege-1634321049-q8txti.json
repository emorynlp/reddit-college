  "text": "I\u2019m applying to UA on Common App and one question is confusing me. It asks, \u201cDo you intend to use one of these school specific fee waivers?\u201d One of the choices says \u201cNational Merit/National Recognition Waiver\u201d. Does this mean if you qualified as a National Merit Semifinalist you can check this? Because I did qualify as one but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what it means. I\u2019ve tried googling but I can\u2019t find any answers.",
