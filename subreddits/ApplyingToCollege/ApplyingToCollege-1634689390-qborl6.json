  "text": "I have a lot of programs like Discord bots ranging from 2k-500k users that I've worked on over the course of the past few years but are now defunct and wouldn't show up on any Google searches even if they weren't. Some of my defunct programs have user counts listed that are basically just me searching through old Discord logs for numbers and adding them up. I'm sure they're all accurate, but I wouldn't have any definitive proof if a college were to ask me about it other than maybe screenshots of the programs and some chat/operation logs (though that wouldn't be solid really). I understand that colleges don't really check, but I have heard that some will contact guidance counselors (my guidance counselor doesn't really know anything about this since I've done it all outside of school) on occasion, and I'm worried that I'll be stuck with nothing to show for it. How strict would they be about proof if they ask for it, and is it worth risking listing them if I have no solid way to verify them except screenshots?",

      "text": "Talk to your guidance counselor!! That\u2019s incredibly important not only in the off chance that colleges will contact them, but because they literally write a LOR for you and it\u2019s important that it\u2019s not a generic one. Set up meetings, be up front and proactive and visit them every once in a while. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re applying ED but if you are then the time to start doing that was months ago, and the second best time to start doing that is now.",
