Coming from a random high school in upstate new york i really have ti make my application stand out. The elder of my church went to Michigan and is good friends with my family and I\u2019ve listed some of the things I do at church on my app. I wish I asked for a letter of rec before I applied but now it\u2019s too late, is there anyway to send additional formation or could he submit like an unofficial letter somehow just basically saying like \u201chey ik this kid who applied let him in\u201d",
