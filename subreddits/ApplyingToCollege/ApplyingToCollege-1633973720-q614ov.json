      "text": "CS is [very good as is most of engineering and the sciences](https://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-ranked-42nd-overall-and-14th-best-public-college-by-u-s-news/). Madison is both [nice (the state capitol is nearby) and very relaxed](https://www.midwestliving.com/travel/wisconsin/madison-wisconsin/36-hours-madison-wisconsin/). People tend to like nature a lot and there are [lots of good hiking and bike paths](https://www.visitmadison.com/things-to-do/outdoors-and-recreation/biking-and-hiking/) ([Trek is based near there](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/inside_trek/heritage_global/)). As for attitude, people tend to be relaxed and [some are very mellow](https://www.celebstoner.com/news/marijuana-news/2021/03/29/madison-wisconsin-allows-public-marijuana-smoking/). The university is in a [pretty location between two lakes](https://admissions.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/462/2020/03/campus-aerial-1600x500-1.jpg) [with a terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/) that overlooks one of the lakes and [where they serve food, drinks, and have live music or movies](https://union.wisc.edu/assets/Uploads/EventImages/FINAL-GeneralTAD4.jpg).\n\nLots of healthy food, vegetarian, but also some great Indonesian, Thai, and Hmong places. The [Thai government even donated a pavilion to the local botanical garden](http://www.olbrich.org/gardens/thai.cfm) in thanks for all the Thai students who had attended Wisconsin. Back when satire was not reality, The Onion came up with headlines crazier than reality from the HQ in Madison (before moving down to Chicago).\n\nAnd yes, lots of beer and cheese. Lots of cheese, and it is tasty.",
