I\u2019ve been looking for Cal States that have great Journalism programs\u2014while I am still looking, I am also at the point where I want to branch out into other universities and states if necessary. \nNevertheless, if I can get some suggestions that\u2019ll be great!",

      "text": "**Arizona State** \\- very affordable as an OOS student. Their journalism school is consistently ranked in the top 10 in the USA. Gorgeous campus, great facilities, large alumni groups, so many clubs/organizations/activities, being that it's such a large university.\n\nI'd also look into **Chapman, Cal Poly, Loyola Marymount, CSU Long Beach, San Diego State, San Jose State,** and **Point Loma Nazarene.** Note that Chapman, LMU, and PLNU are all private, and might be pricier to attend compared to a CSU like San Diego State or CSULB.\n\nBest of luck. :)",

      "text": "I'll agree with Arizona State being a good OOS option.  Missouri is really good too, and WKU is outstanding for photojournalism.  You would have to look at scholarship options for transfer students, but all of those can be pretty generous generally.",
