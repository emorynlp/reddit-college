I literally have two months, two and a half, tops. This definitely is the time to get moving! \n\nRight now, I doubt I'll be able to score even a 1200 if I were to appear for SATs tomorrow.

December the last SAT date before January deadlines.\n\nSee additional testing requirements such as TOEFL in the international section of college admission websites.\n\nYou can find the deadline options for any college on the college's admission website. You can also make an account on the Common App website, where you can look at a chart with the different deadline options. (The early deadline option for fall 2022 for many colleges is literally tomorrow, Nov 1. You should look at Regular Decision deadlines, most of which are in January.)\n\nSee the wiki at the top of the subreddit for general info about the admission process. See r/IntltoUSA. If you need financial aid to attend, that will be the most important factor in your college search.",

I spent the last few months (received my result in mid-August) just wasting time, not looking for colleges, or anything for that matter; I'll have to look for SAT resources as soon as practicable; sucks!\n\nWill check it out, thank you so much!",
