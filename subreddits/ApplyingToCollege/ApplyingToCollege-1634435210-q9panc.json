  "text": "Hi!  I'm considering submitting an optional art portfolio for some top schools, but am not sure whether it's worth it or not.  I'm not national level (haven't played at Carnegie Hall or won any major award), but I've finished all the levels of CM and consistently made Branch and State honors.  Would you guys recommend I submit a supplement or not - I'm probably going to not but would love to hear what you guys think!  Thank you!",

Or a recording of a song they co-wrote with two friends and recorded?",

              "text": "If you're applying just for general admission (not to a music major that requires a portfolio), it really can't hurt you to submit a portfolio. Even if it's reviewed by a faculty member, you're not applying to their department specifically, so they have no real say in the admission process. The best that could happen is that the faculty member says, \"Wow this student is incredibly talented and I'd love to have them on campus\" and then that will be taken into consideration by admissions. The worst case scenario would be the faculty member reviewer thinking the student isn't talented - even in this scenario, it just won't be a positive in your application (but it won't be a negative - it will be neutral). I hope that made sense. It's a bit hard to articulate in writing.\n\nThis is all very very different if you're applying to a program that requires portfolios for admissions. In that case, the faculty member is likely the deciding factor.",
