But a significant overstatement of GPA, SAT, and rank is too much to overlook or explain away.  If there was an explanation (e.g. the student's school provided the student with the wrong data) then that should definitely be explained and could resolve this.  But the explanation and details would be important in this case.\n\nEDIT:  I messaged with OP and there actually is an explanation for this that makes sense.  Please don't rake them over the coals for this.",
