      "text": "I usually suggest sending a resume to schools that allow you to submit one.  Normally it\u2019s optional though so if you don\u2019t have much to add beyond what\u2019s on your activities list, it\u2019s not necessary. \n\nMy students organize the resume in a way that shows what\u2019s most important to them and to be able to not be restrained by character counts. \n\nHere\u2019s the very simple basic template we use https://docs.google.com/document/d/11kJuiEKciHJyTLaNnvsDNYwW0tFA7DbSTogVcuvHVaA/edit\n\nYou can make a copy and then edit it to work best for you.",
