  "text": "I am wondering how my lack of extracurriculars will affect my competitiveness.  It isn\u2019t entirely my fault because of COVID happening during my sophomore year but also my parents getting a divorce that hasn\u2019t been finalized yet.  The only extracurricular I have as of now is student council so what can I do in my junior year of school with little time.",

      "text": "explain the situation about the divorce in your additional info.  but not having ecs will make you massively uncompetitive for better schools.  they will definitely not take covid as an excuse because, trust me, people have done A LOT online.  right now you're still in gr11, you have time to get involved with more things, anything that you care about.  things like case competitions (deca fbla hosa) are relatively low time investment and high reward if you manage it well.  or leadership positions with organizations, if you can manage to get high leadership, it's not too much of a time commitment, rather a responsibility commitment.  whatever you can have fun doing will be fine.  its never too late, you got this!",

I\u2019d recommend using the opportunity to explain your circumstances where possible on the application. I know the coalition and commonapp have sections where you can explain your situation.",
