  "text": "I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing when it comes to picking a college. I think I\u2019m decently smart in term of test scores (36 on the act 5s on AP tests) but I\u2019m not a super nerdy guy and def below average at a place like mit. I\u2019m leaning towards engineering but could just as easily go for anything else STEM or finance. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!\n\n(This is my first post too so let me know if I\u2019m doing this wrong)",

      "text": "My kid is like you \u2014 had the grades and test scores, but very little STEM-related (or even academic) extracurricular activities. We discovered most candidates for top engineering programs have been doing math competitions or science olympiads or robotics contests or all of the above for years. It is a personal choice, but my kid didn\u2019t want to end up in a highly regarded but cut-throat program competing for the first two years of college against national science prizewinners just to get admitted to the desired major.\n\nAs a result, the decision was to apply to (1) programs where you can be directly admitted to a major and not have to compete for it, and (2) more schools ranked in the top 50-150, instead of mostly top 50 schools. My kid also moved away from engineering both because of how competitive the majors often are and because it is more difficult to switch in and out of engineering majors in many cases \u2014 decided that math and/or business with an accounting focus was more flexible.\n\nEspecially if you are pretty sure you are going to grad school, you might also look at majoring in physics at a liberal arts college and/or doing a joint 3-2 program offered by a liberal arts college and engineering school. That way you bypass the weed-out classes in engineering programs at large, competitive universities.\n\nGood luck. It\u2019s really hard to know what you will like when you haven\u2019t done it yet.",

As for culture I like the tightnitted community I have right now but I would prefer a more active social scene. The biggest thing is I\u2019m an in the middle kinda person. Like I like to be nerdy sometimes and have provoking discussions but I don\u2019t like to obsess over school. And I\u2019m not a party animal but I would like to have something to look forward to on the weekends if that explains me any better. Location isn\u2019t much of an issue but closer to Ohio is better. Thank you so much for you\u2019re help!",

      "text": "Welcome to read it. We are a group of redditors who all praise Alexis Ohaninian. I too was quite clueless what university I would have liked to attend, though my growth and maturity through my alma maters core curriculum was fantastic. I wouldn\u2019t concern myself with stereotypes and maybe try and visit the universities you are applying to. Spark up some conversation with random students ask them if they like attending what they would change etc. most people are willing to give you that much. \n\nDon\u2019t worry yourself with your major I think most students decide that after their first year so diversify your first year class load and see what intrigues you and then dominate your classes and conquer the world. Never forget that nerds always win because they actually are prosed, articulate, and will make loot if properly directed. Wishing you all the best bob the lobster. Don\u2019t forget to get on Twitter and thank Alexis with some moderate spam he likes it he\u2019s in there talking about non fungible Tolkien\u2019s everyday\n\nAlso consider student debt. I don\u2019t know if you have scholarships being offered or how you intend to pay but never forget the opportunity cost of attending",
