  "title:": "Do I have to put SAT essay score in Common App?",
  "text": "I got a 1460 (690 math, 770 reading/writing) on the SAT but a fucking 13 on the essay. Now, I wasn't even supposed to take the essay and it was about football (which I know nothing about) so it wasn't a spectacular piece of writing, but I still think it was graded poorly. Do I need to put it in my CommonApp? It asks if I took the SAT with essay and then asks me to report the score. Can I just say no?",
