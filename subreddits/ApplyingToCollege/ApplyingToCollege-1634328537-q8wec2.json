I\u2019ve been seeing people with 1550+/35+ scores, and it\u2019s honestly so thrilling to know you did that well, so I don\u2019t blame them.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the people who\u2019ve posted about their SAT/ACT scores, I\u2019m really proud of you :) you either worked your butts off for that score or have some mad talent \ud83e\udd70",

And for some people to be posting \" should I send a 1500+ (or even 1550+) score?\", I just feel like they want attention, when they aren't explicitly satisfied with it. \n\nI totally agree with you about celebrating your scores tho, it just doesn't feel like some people are when they post about it. (it's sorta like an indirect way of posting \"yay, I got a 1580\" vs \"should I send a 1580 to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ , not shitpost\") IDK, I just feel that way.",
