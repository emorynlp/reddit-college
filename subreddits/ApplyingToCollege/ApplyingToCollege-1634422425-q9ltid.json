  "text": " Hey guys! So basically, I was confused between CMU and Cornell for EDing. \n\nCMU is my dream school and I would choose it over Cornell any day. CMU does not give an advantage for ED, so I was worried if I would get in. Cornell has a 24% acceptance rate for ED (it prolly includes the recruited athletes and stuff), but it's still pretty high. \n\nI am scared that if I ED CMU, I might not get in and I won't get into Cornell RD. So I will end up going to a public university I don't like much.\n\nOn the other hand, if I apply ED to Cornell and get in (hypothetically), I will always regret not applying ED to CMU.\n\nPlease **HELP ME** what should I do\n\nHere are my stats from Chanceme just in case:\n\n**Demographics**: Male, South Asian, **US citizen (Illinois) living in India**, Private school (464 students in the class), Income 75k/yr\n\n(I will apply for financial aid, but I don't think I will get a disadvantage as I am a US citizen)\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Science\n\n**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1460 - 800 maths 660 EBRW (yeah, I know I messed up); **Applying Test-Optional**\n\n**UW/W GPA and Rank:**\n\nClass 9: 90% (CBSE)\n\nClass 10: 97% (CBSE)\n\nClass 11: 96.8%(CBSE) Probably topped in the school\n\nClass 12: Predicted 97%\n\n**Coursework**: We don't have ap exams in my school. AP Calc BC (5), AP Phys Mech (5)\n\nPlanning on taking AP CSA, AP Stats, and AP Physics E&M next year\n\n**Awards:**\n\n\\- Scholar blazer for 7 years of academic excellency 2011-2019\n\n\\- Perfect score in Class 10 CBSE Boards in Maths and Computer Science\n\n\\- Top 10 in 11-college national level competition \n\n\\- Principal's Recommended Scholarship \n\n\\- Nominated for \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Only 10 highly motivated students from all over India were invited to attend this prestigious workshop (Was selected by my school)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extracurriculars:**\n\n***Computer projects:***\n\n\\- Created an automated report card generator for my school using javascript (My school uses it now). (This helped me impress my cs teacher)\n\n\\- Created a covid resource chatbot\n\n\\- Created a Voice Assistant\n\n\\-Creating a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-One more computer project (can't disclose)\n\n\\- Internship at a renowned Company\n\nProficient in Python, Java, MySQL, QBasic, C++\n\nMachine learning course by Andrew Ng (ongoing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Karate***\\*:\\* International 1st Degree Black Belt\n\n(All individual category medals)\n\n\u27a2 Gold Medal at International Karate Championship (Kumite)\n\n\u27a2 Silver Medal at International Karate Championship (Kata)\n\n\u27a2 Silver Medal at National Karate Championship (Kumite)\n\n\u27a2 Bronze Medal at International Karate Championship (Kumite)\n\n\u27a2 Silver Medal at District Championship (Kumite)\n\nTrained new students for exams and competitions with a 100% success rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Founded 2 clubs**\n\n***Guitar:***\n\n\\- Over 6 years.

      "text": "apply ED to CMU.\n\nthe ED boost is misleading -- so many factors result in the seemingly higher acceptance rate, like the fact that recruited athletes and most legacy applicants apply ED. There's no reason for a school to accept more students ED than they would EA or RD, especially not Cornell or CMU, schools with a major surpluses of qualified students. They're not scrambling to fill seats. Plus, you need to remember that applicants aren't chosen at random -- a student that got rejected RD wouldn't have miraculously gotten in ED. The boost you see in Cornell's acceptance rate is marginal, if anything, to that of CMU's acceptance rate.\n\nas an additional note, please find safeties and matches you like. There's a good chance you'll get rejected from CMU and Cornell regardless of how you apply, so you'll need to have schools you genuinely like.",

      "text": "Go with CMU ED. As others have mentioned, the point of ED is to confirm your interest in this one school over any other in the world.\n\nI know the higher acceptance rate seems tempting but it's mostly a sack of shit. Cornell only considers legacy status at ED round and ED applicants are usually much more qualified than the RD. Therefore, it probably won't even lead to a higher chance for you personally. \n\nThat would be a giant waste especially considering that CMU is your preferred option.",
