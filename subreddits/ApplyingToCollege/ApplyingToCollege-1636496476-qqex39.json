  "text": "I know this is not good, but I want to know how much this is hurting me. My senior year grades aren\u2019t the best right now. I have 2 As, 3 Bs, and 1 C halfway through my first trimester. I applied ED to Duke and they require a first semester grade report and these grades are horrible. Im really stressing out right now. Could someone be brutally honest with me and tell me how much this is going to hurt me?",

With 4 B's, your chance of getting rescinded is a lot lower than if you get a C, but they're going to want an explanation still. It really depends on your past grades. If you have never gotten B's before, it will look really bad.",
