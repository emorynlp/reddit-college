  "text": "Hey all, im a senior in high school and I messed up the first three years by messing around. I have straight A\u2019s right now, and Im trying to see if there is any way that colleges can see and make their decisions including my 1st semester grades? I hope they can see my improvement. \n\nWould applying regular decision to most of my colleges allow them to see my semester 1 grades?\n\nAny advice is really appreciated.",

Also, there should be a section in common app where you can I guess- advocate for these grades\u2026.I mean, you can\u2019t straight up say you were messing around. Nonono\u2026 just point out the fact that you were able to commit and have drive for bettering your grades and that shows because you see improvement. \n\nIt would be helpful for counselors or teachers to say \u201cyes I see improvement in this child.\u201d",
