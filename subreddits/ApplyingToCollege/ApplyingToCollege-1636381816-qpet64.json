  "title:": "Should I try and transfer in 2 years to yale instead?",
  "text": "Let's just say I messed up 11th grade. Like I was a straight-A honor and AP student and then in 11th grade I failed a few classes and got a bunch of Cs. If I go to a community college or state school freshman and sophomore year and get good grades to show that junior year in high school was an anomaly, is there a way I can transfer to one of my dream schools? And since I have time to prepare I would even be willing to save up money from my job to get a private college counselor (do they even work for transfer students?). plus I'm an FGLI student so hopefully, that will help? Yale is my dream next to Stanford and I've heard that yale at least is pretty generous to FGLI students?",

      "text": "Rehabilitating your gpa at community college or a local state college is always a good idea \u2014 especially if you have financial concerns as well, so I\u2019d definitely keep that in mind as an option \n\nSome other options are to look at smaller liberal arts colleges that give lots of financial aid and really learn how to become a student, so I wouldn\u2019t limit your list to just community college right now. \n\nThere are hundreds of amazing colleges out there and many of them will give you the same level of educational and intellectual opportunities as Yale. \n\nNow, as far as transferring to some of the most highly rejective colleges in the world, you just have to accept that acceptance isn\u2019t likely. Just as it isn\u2019t likely for the thousands of applicants for first years \u2014 but for transfers the teeny tiny likelihood gets even teenier and tinier. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be a goal \u2014 but you gotta be real. \n\nOne goal that might be just a tinge more realistic is work your ass off in undergrad and go somewhere that will give you great academic and educational opportunities and make hella good grades and then apply to some highly rejective colleges like Yale for grad school\n\nRegardless your plan is moving in the right direction. Make really strong grades this year \u2014 finish out the year solid. Then make bad ass awesome grades in college at whatever college you go to so you\u2019re preparing yourself for future opportunities \n\nIf you like Yale, check out these colleges \n\nTrinity College\n\nConnecticut College \n\nSewanee\n\nHendricks\n\nUnion \n\nU of New Hampshire \n\nIf you tell me a little more about what you\u2019re interested in and looking for in a college I can suggest a few more",

          "text": "Since I plan to go to grad school I would like it if I could attend a university that has research opportunities like case western or Williams & mary. I also love the residential college vibe of yale & rice university. The reason I was interested in Stanford was because of its reputation for students initiating startups; I haven't really heard of other universities with that type of atmosphere. My ability to obtain internships would also heavily influence where I want to go; ideally, I would be in or near a big city because of the sheer amount of opportunities available. I'm interested in business, software engineering, and law (so polysci for undergrad I guess). Any schools with strong backgrounds in these would fit in nicely with the list of colleges I'd hope to go to. Oh, and one last thing that would trump all of these is the financial aid they give out to FGLI students.",

      "text": "Possibly, but the top few schools are notorious for being stingy with how many transfer students they admit.  Getting straight A's at a reasonably reputable university (not CC) would be a strong signal to Yale et. al. that you're capable of doing college-level work at a high degree of competency.",
