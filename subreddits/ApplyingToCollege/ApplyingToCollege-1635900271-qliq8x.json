  "text": "Does it matter how I wrote it, or is the information included the most important thing? Basically, for the position section of some of the activities, I wrote full sentences like, \"I'm a middle distance runner on the track team\", while in other sections just wrote it like, \"Track runner.\" Looking back on it now the transition just looks awkward, and it's clear that I was intended to not use that space to write full sentences, but I still did include all of the necessary information. I know it seems like a small thing, and it is, but I'm just trying to settle my nerves",
