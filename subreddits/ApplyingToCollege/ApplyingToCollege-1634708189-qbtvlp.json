  "text": "I've been trying to work on college apps since summer started (and I've done a little work: I've written 1 essay, brainstormed some essay ideas, and  researched a few schools I might want to apply to), but overall I've hardly gotten anything done and I'm freaking out. I've complied my problems into a list of questions so hopefully it's easier to help me out.\n\n1. I haven't figured out what schools to apply to. I've researched so many colleges and they all seem like great schools. idk what exactly I should be looking for/how to tell if I actually want to apply there. I don't understand how people can just look at a school and know they want to be there.\n\n2. I haven't decided on a major (which probably contributes to the difficulty of choosing schools to apply to). I have quite a few different majors I'm interested in, but I'm not sure if I wanna dedicate the rest of my life to any of them.\n2.a. I'm thinking of applying undecided, but I've heard that applying with a major can be beneficial. Should I choose one of the majors I'm interested in, or just go with undecided?\n\n3. Is it ok that I'm not doing any early action/early decision? (I know it's \"ok\", but will it cause much of a negative impact on my chances of getting into more selective schools?)\n\n4. The main reason why I'm behind on this is because I keep getting very stressed out just from thinking about my future and knowing that I don't know what I want or where I'm going, and knowing that what schools I get accepted into is out of my control. Any advice on how to manage this stress?",

      "text": "As far as deciding your major is concerned, think about what you like or love to learn about. Do you enjoy economics/history classes?? Perhaps you\u2019re into social sciences then. Interested in the world of science?? Then science might be the one for you. The thing is, no one\u2019s ever a hundred and one percent sure about what they want to study, even those who are tend to freak out here and there bcz they feel undecided. Just take a deep breath, clear your mind and read up on potential majors you\u2019d like to study (you can do this by going to any university website, for eg if you want to apply in state then go to any state university website and read the details on the potential majors). Once you feel comfortable selecting a major, research on schools that have amazing/good/normal programs in regards to that and simply list down the college names. Then one by one go to each college\u2019s website and do thorough research and see if it\u2019s meant for you, if it\u2019s not cross it of ur list. Talk to a councilor they might suggest universities according to your academics/ECs etc. As far as applying ED/EA is concerned, I was on the same boat not to long ago. Everyone around me is applying for ED/EA and I felt as if I wasn\u2019t being smart in my approach to the process but the truth is it\u2019s just the concept of wanting to fit in/ wanting to be included that makes you feel more pressured. And last but not least, it\u2019s October rn, so you still hv a good 2 and half months before apps get submitted. Just take a breather, clear your mind, go about everything methodically and categorically to keep yourself from getting stressed and you\u2019ll be good to go. Good luck on your process and if you need any help you can always DM me <3",
