  "title:": "AOs Can't Actually Detect \"Authenticity\" Or \"Passion\": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior (repost)",
  "text": "Last year during decision day I posted an essay about why I think elite universities like Stanford or Harvard can't actually detect authenticity or passion. I thought I'd share it again this year to console all you seniors about your rejections. I'm on a new account because I couldn't log into my throwaway account again.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.\n\n\"So, what do you like to do in your free time?\"\n\n\"I like hiking and naturery stuff\" I said.\n\n\"That's not academic enough. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Uh idk. I like art I guess,\" I choked.\n\nAfter some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something \"community-minded\" with my interests. \"How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?\" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some \"buzzwords\" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said \"yes, (my name) would love to do that.\"\n\nI remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how \"I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,\" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they \"could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.\"**\n\nSo yeah, \"an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color\"... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**\n\n**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. \\*\\*Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.\\*\\*Sure, there are some exceptions.\n\nBut for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of \"ditching your high school self\" and \"getting to live a little for the next 4 years\" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.**(There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).\n\nThat's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some high school students say \"just follow your passion\" and \"we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about\" or \"to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;\" and the worst one, \"be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself.\" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***\n\nSo if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.\n\nTL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit from this year: A sophomore at Stanford who's kinda Twitter famous had this one tweet that read:\n\n***Elite universities are pillars of a colonial past, present, and future. Institutions like st\\*nford, h\\*rvard, etc. are not meant to mold free thinkers, only the next generation of capitalists & imperialists.***\n\nThink about that the next time you see a Stanford or Harvard grad proclaiming to do good for the world in their college apps only to do a complete 180 flip (\\*cough [pete buttigieg](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) cough\\*).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: thank you for the best of a2c award!",

Elitist institutions serve to perpetuate a type of elitism that is toxic to our society, and tbh I wish I knew that before I sold myself to one.\n\nI've been really contemplating the importance of earnestness in work though. For example, let's take your art project; although you didn't deeply care about it, it still made a real and material impact on society. In my high school, dozens of kids put in hundreds of hours of volunteer work not because they inherently care about the homeless or disabled communities or wanted to make an impact on soceity; they only volunteered because they want to improve their resume. I agree, their intents are kinda shitty, but the work completed has done volumes in my own community, and I am sure in many others as well. At an individual level, I don't believe elitism will ever change; universities will either admit a student who founded a fake non profit or a student from a millionaire family. Elitist institutions will remain elitist, and how they admit people won't ever be fair anyway. However, their \"value\" of community work has pushed many high school students do more for their community, and by exposing students to more community work, at least there is a chance that someone finds their passion in philanthropy.",

I instead discovered such things through summer math programs that I found because, well, I liked math.\n\nI spent the rest of high school taking the undergraduate math curriculum at the big state school I grew up near because my high school didn't have that many AP classes or cool elective classes, and math was what I was really into anyways. I got to the end of high school and applied to all of these well-known schools that my friends from summer applied to: if my peers can go there, surely I can. I had a 4.0 (my school didn't weight GPA and idk how to calculate that) and perfect test scores, but I assumed everyone applying did. I focused mainly on smaller schools, especially liberal arts colleges like haverford/colby/etc, but also many well-known research universities. The results came in: 1 acceptance, 7 waitlists, 7 rejections. With the waitlist, I ended up with two options: UCLA and UC Berkeley, two huge schools (which again, I really didn't want).\n\nFast forward to my time at UC Berkeley and I am completely shocked. All of my peers don't really care about what they're studying and all went to these schools where they were trained to do things just to get into famous schools (and many of their classmates did). Together with the fact that it was basically impossible to get professor contact in my first two years (even during office hours), I was more miserable than I've ever been, so I dropped out and returned home. I've now applied to transfer for the third semester in a row and just losing hope. I have straight A's in college and was taking only graduate courses for math (mixed with some cool other classes). I tried going to my state school and I actually like it there (people actually ENJOY what they're studying) but they didn't have any math courses they would allow me to take (they restricted to just graduate students), so I just took some non-major classes.\n\nAnd now I just don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can return to UCB because I'm at the point where I really should be doing research (the only courses to take are graduate topics courses, intended to help with research), but it was too crowded for any professor to actually take me on. And of course I hated the people I was around. But I can't do math at my local school, and I don't have an undergrad degree so no graduate school will take me. I would love to go to a place like uchicago but they won't take me (if only I had gotten off that waitlist). It's been miserable, but your post consoled me.",

Professors are incredibly swamped with emails and meetings, while a lot of grad students are swamped with teaching obligations with not enough time to devote to research. Professors don't necessarily have undergrad-accessible projects handy, or the time available to work with them. On the other hand, grad students would love the help but don't necessarily have the resources to put out feelers, plus may have trust issues turning over their work to a random stranger. But if they taught you before, and you did well...that's a way in.\n\nAlso, try URAP. It's unnecessarily competitive and I didn't get in to any that I applied for...but a lot of great undergrads in my research group found us that way.\n\n> All of my peers don't really care about what they're studying and all went to these schools where they were trained to do things just to get into famous schools (and many of their classmates did). Together with the fact that it was basically impossible to get professor contact in my first two years (even during office hours)\n\nI'm sorry you had this experience. That sounds a lot like my first year and a lot of my second year, too. I didn't feel like I fit in because everyone was grades-obsessed, and my room in Unit 3 got bedbugs twice (apparently they live in the walls and are practically impossible to eradicate from college dorms). It wasn't until I found my research position and met like-minded people from that and from my upper-division classes, that I felt like I belonged. In addition, I signed up for smaller classes outside my department, and spent a lot of effort trying to find like-minded friends my second year. (I lived in Martinez Commons the year it opened, and by the end of that year had probably talked to *everyone* who lived there. I found like a couple people.) I have a lot of fond memories from undergrad, but getting there was definitely a process! It's only looking back that it's clear what I tried ended up working out, because at the time a lot of them seemed rather pointless, but I tried them anyway because I was on the verge of transferring.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, I hope you take good care!",

I have done directed reading with grad students, but all of them clearly couldn't lead to research under those students. In math, sadly by the time grad students themselves complete substantial research they are getting their PhD (although they usually *started* all the way back as undergrads).\n\nAlso, I have unfortunately never taken a math course that had a GSI since all of the courses I took were graduate courses.\n\nI moved around a fair bit while I was there and sadly everyone I ended up living with, even in the coops, were people I really hated being around. But now that I am a nondegree student elsewhere, I have really enjoyed the people I've been around (all of my classes are humanities classes). Unfortunately it seems that a very large portion of the political science (my main non-math interest) students at Cal have a pretty toxic culture and aren't that interested in theoretical political science (just there to be pre-law or hold an elected office some day)",

What surprised me is that the most toxic people were the first to wash out, and by my fourth year, my pre-med friends actually enjoyed biology, and pursued research because it interested them, etc.\n\nAlong the way, I also ended up taking a lot of humanities classes and ended up with a minor.

Went to Harvard and then on to become a Rhodes Scholar and work as a very well-known management/consulting company, well known because they're known to be pretty immoral and seedy. \n\nIt talks about how his memoir discusses all of this, but instead of reflecting on the immorality of Harvard, such as the homelessness of Boston or the fact that Harvard janitors don't get a living wage, Buttigeg doesn't seem to care about this at all. He doesn't define his policies clearly, instead marketing himself as a good candidate because of his qualities (gay, from Indiana, small town but went to Harvard). \n\nAnd when he describes being mayor, he discusses his technological sewer advances, rather than even mentioning or seeming to care about the poverty, racial inequality, or gentrification. The article basically says that Buttigeg doesn't actually care about progressive ideals, and rather is just another non-free thinking Harvard-educated business tycoon.",

Top schools create the best workers, those at the top of the system, who become accomplished by stepping on the other workers.\n\nSad reality is that going to these schools will get you places in a career that's based primarily on networking, especially IB and business roles in general. They have high placement. \n\nTop schools don't necessarily want people who are incredibly invested in their work in high school, partly because those kind of people don't always buy into the employee/worker mindset. A kid who can win awards and grants while doing something they don't love at age fifteen will also be able to fake it out in a hedge fund at thirty.\n\nI'm kind of rambling.

A lot of elite colleges also try to diversify their classes touting that 50% or so students are on financial aid, but given that the other 50% are not, they're likely on the top 10%-20% of income earners, most likely the top 1-5%. So you have 90% of the student demographic getting 50% representation, whereas the top 1-5% gets 50% representation too (and this is in the absolute best case at places like Harvard, whereas at other institutions like Penn, it's worse at something like 70% in the top 20%). Though elite colleges have been trying to diversify their student bodies (and succeeding to some degree), I doubt that they'd actually be able to accurately represent the socioeconomic demographics of students across the country, just because wealthier families have legacy connections, money to game the system, money to donate, and there'd probably be a ton of backlash from elites if a lot fewer rich kids were getting in.",

I wonder if there would be a case for nationalizing/making a lot of these institutions public, since a lot of public institutions with cheaper overall tuition and higher acceptance rates (ex. UC Merced, Kennesaw State) have more low-income students and a decent level of social mobility.",

Looking back at my post, I realized that the girl from Amherst isn't necessarily the best example of what I was trying to say, especially because I have no clue who she is or what her background is. However, I do believe that some people might not understand where their true interests and motives lie until graduating from college and being exposed to the job market. I could totally see someone firmly believing that they would devote their life to an academically interesting and/or niche field, only to find that financial success when entering the workforce is more enticing. Pretty similar to your first point except that this can also apply to someone who doesn't necessarily need to support their family. Idk though, this is coming from a HS senior who hasn't been exposed to too many college kids.",

If you take a look at another comment in this thread, you will see that I took back my original use of this Amherst girl as an example because it isn't fair to judge her without knowing really anything about her. Also, to your point, the prospect of making six-digit salaries fresh out of college is too enticing for many people to pass up. It's just unfortunate that people feel forced to sell out when their true passions might lie somewhere else. I also think it's strange that some people who sell out or recognize their interest in finance before applying to college (as opposed to recognizing that interest in college) are sometimes disadvantaged in the admissions process because colleges might not like their conventional career interests which encourages kids to be dishonest in the admissions process. I guess this is what I was trying to say originally. Let me know if you agree or not.",

For example, having a business extracurricular isn't bad at all and people love to see that. I think the issue is there is a disconnect in high finance between passion vs. results in that there aren't many programs or opportunities for students to show real passion in high finance. Outside of the few HS programs that exist that ladder you directly through a bank throughout your college years, and having your connections really pull for you, you're realistically not going to be doing finance research, you're not going to get a banking summer internship, etc. There are exceptions of course, but it's just that there isn't some impressive investment banking accolade you can get similar to all the various possibilities in STEM if that makes sense. The other issue comes from the fact that as I mentioned, the ecosystem of support typically revolves around wealthy students so you wouldn't have exposure to banking typically without coming from the \"right family,\" so nurturing this career interest typically requires a lot of contacts and advantages most people will never have.",

I also live in the bay area, and I also went to a college counselor who told me I that I don\u2019t have enough community service and leadership accolades on my resume, and advised me to start a \u201cnon profit\u201d. I really hate even using that term because it\u2019s such a fucking buzzword - all I do is teach \u2018underprivileged middle schooler\u2019 math. It has no organizational structure or paperwork, but I guess colleges want me to market a house cat as a lion.\n\nSo when I started the venture, I wanted to teach mathematics in a very non traditional way - analyze the prisoners dilemma, do counting brain teasers, etc - all in all, the goal was to develop problem solving skills in a fun way. Even this was looked at in disdain by the counselor because, and I quote, \u201cit\u2019s not scalable\u201d. WHAT! WHO THE FUCK CARES? I am essentially forced to do this thing, and the one aspect that makes me excited about it is shot down because I CANT FUCKING EXPAND THE \u201cnOn PrOfiT\u201d. Fucking absurd. \n\nHonestly, I think the entire system is fucked. Especially in the Bay Area, the only thing people seem to care about is getting into a good college. Hell, I was talking to a teacher who told me her former student\u2019s parents refrained from telling others which college he was going to because his acceptance to \u201conly SJSU\u201d was too embarrassing. It seems like for the past three years, all I have been working towards is getting into college. Its almost as if even one second of the day didn\u2019t get you one step closer to going to Stanford, or Berkeley, or an Ivy, the entire day was a waste.\n\nI think, and this is especially true for the Bay Area,  waaaaaay too much is expected from high schoolers and waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis is out on college. It\u2019s fucking nuts, dude, and it really sucks.\n\nEdit: I know I deviated from the OPs point about passion, but I connected with the topic, and I guess lost track of wtf I was saying.",

      "text": "TL,DR: A comment about my experience as a student from a high-income and affluent area\n\nI'm only a HS sophomore and probably should get off this sub. Whatever, I want to support the Juniors and Seniors as they're getting into colleges and moving on with their lives. They need support as they make difficult decisions. Anyways, I think I might apply as a Philosophy, Anthropology, or Sociology major to college and then go on to law school or something. Those subjects are based on topics that just come naturally to me. \n\nThis post and these comments did freak me out. I'm considering applying to UPenn and maybe another Ivy one day, and I haven't founded a nonprofit or won some sort of national competition. I'm a UPenn legacy (mom went to their graduate engineering school) but I'm not sure how much they'll care as she was a grad student and we'll be studying two completely different things. Nobody should count on legacy status to get you into an Ivy anyway. \n\nI've been doing theater productions since the start of middle school, am a member of my school's mental health awareness club, plan on joining my school's mock trial team and plan to be heavily invested in my summer camp's year-round activities, along with two smaller extracurriculars. I don't play a sport or have lots of community service hours. These aren't that many extracurriculars compared to other people on this sub, but I care about each of them. Especially the summer camp one, I plan to work there at least through college and maybe even make a career out of it. They all make me happy. \n\nI'm also from one of the richest towns in my state. Plenty of people apply to Ivies, at least a dozen or so ultimately attend them. **The** **stress to get into a top school is real in any major area** (I live in the DC area) but I don't think it's as high as a place like the Bay Area. Parents drive around with Ivy league college bumper stickers. Middle schoolers wear Ivy league sweatshirts. We have five excellent local universities that won't accept slackers (UMD, AU, GW, Georgetown, Howard). Plenty of us get into those universities, especially UMD, but nonetheless we have to work hard and keep our standards high. It rubs off on me and can even make me anxious. \n\nThe people on these subs who have a dozen year-round ECs and half a dozen national awards actually worry me. You sleep, right? You have a social life, right? You at least have downtime, right? Do these people actually get into all the Ivies they apply to?",

      "text": "> This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.\n\nThere is a serious problem with AOs.  No offense to anyone, but these are people who on average make $35-45 a year and who would not be considered highly successful people by the majority of the public.  Yet they somehow are supposed to be able to magically detect through a cloud of BS the best and brightest, the next generation of leaders, top scientists, and businessmen.  And they are expected to do all that by spending a few minutes reading your application (UCLA mean time spent on an application is less than eight minutes).  They look for a variety of special snowflake traits in applicant, but the true relevance of those traits to the success of these students in their majors and life in general are highly dubious.\n\nContrast this to the other extreme, where in many countries students take entrance exams that get graded blindly and those grades alone determine who gets in.  How impersonal, but these same elite schools are so eager to recruit those \"impersonal\" students for grad school over the undergrads they admitted based on warm and fuzzy feelings of being \"passionate\" about something.\n\nThis also brings me to another point.  What determines the prestige of a university?  Is it the social class of the student body?  That was probably the case 50+ years ago.  But nowadays, I suspect it is mostly the high quality research output and the quality of their professional school graduates.  In other words, their prestige is essentially NOT due to the undergrads who raised money to bring some supplies to a remote village in Africa.  Having spent many years in such an elite university as a graduate student, I have to say the baseline academic caliber of the undergraduate students is indeed rather high.  But I have also seen many of them just be vapid people, cheaters, very selfish and self-centered, and students who can quickly churn out BS papers/essays they started a day before it was due.  The latter being their most useful talent.\n\nHaving said all this, there is no doubt that on average the student bodies of these elite schools is of very high caliber.  However, there are many more students of similar or sometimes even higher caliber who end up in less prestigious schools.  Why?  Because they didn't play the special-snowflake profile-shaping game as well, either because they were unaware of its importance, didn't care, or didn't have the means to build it up.  The undergrad admissions process has clearly some flaws.  But maybe this is an opportunity to understand that life is not and cannot be 100% fair.  And those exceptional students who get rejected, but who keep up their course, often end up achieving good things in their academic and professional careers, including ending up at some of those elite schools that rejected them as undergrads :)",

Most of the people who applied to Harvard from my school had 3.9+ UW GPAs and 1500+ SAT scores and 2-3 of those people got in. Shit, one year they literally rejected everyone. Not sure what that 3.5 person did, but the Harvard admissions officers liked it or something.",

      "text": ">After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something \"community-minded\" with my interests. \"How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?\" she suggested. It seemed like she literally just pulled out some \"buzzwords\" that would look good on my resume, and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said \"yes, (my name) would love to do that.\"\n\nHi! Your private college counselor told you to do this in part _because it's the kind of advice s/he can sell you,_ not because folks in the profession can't ever detect that kind of packaged stuff. In fact, it is often _precisely because_ folks in our profession have seen so many people roll out packaged initiatives that folks who go to the private side of the desk know what to recommend as packaged initiatives! \n\nI'm not saying some people don't get duped, and I'm sure there are things that I have read without skepticism that were deployed strategically. I agree with several of your observations, but wanted to point out that analysis somewhat ignores the way expensive private college counseling typically functions, i.e. through the classic misdirection of amplifying the salience of the superstructure while ignoring the basic priorities that mostly determine admission.\n\n>So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity. I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.\n\nAiming for excellence would not likely have led you to Stanford either! By your own admission, you got very lucky at several points in this process, and ascribing your opportunity to your own decisions and strategies and not good fortune, survivorship bias, and lizard-brain Calvinism is both an analytical error and bad life advice.\n\nLook, I think, based on your post and most of your comments in your own thread, that we share a lot of the same basic critiques about elite institutions and their methods of self-reproduction. But I find it odd (or maybe inevitable?) that your endgame conclusion is not to suggest a different mode of engaging with the system as opposed to how to cynically try to play it under unfavorable conditions!",

The point of that post was this: \n\n> If you get into MIT, it will be because you followed these steps. If you do well in school, you will be smart and prepared for an MIT education. If you are nice, then your letters of recommendation will convince us that MIT would be a wildly better place with you on campus. And if you pursue your passion, you will have developed a love for and skill at something that helps distinguish you from other applications \u2013 something that is your \u201chook.\u201d\n\n> But what if you don\u2019t get into MIT?\n\n> Well, you may be disappointed. But you learned everything you could, so now you\u2019re smarter; you were a positive member of your community, and you made people happy; and you spent high school doing not what you thought you had to do to get into a selective college, but what you wanted to do more than anything else in the world. In other words, you didn\u2019t waste a single solitary second of your time.\n\nMaybe it's quarantine aggression and no deadlifts for weeks but the reason OP's post makes me slightly angry is because the idea of aiming for excellence in order to get into HYPS+ is like reorienting your entire life around buying as many lottery tickets as possible. Sure, it will work out for some people through random chance, but that doesn't make it a good life decision! \n\nYou _can_ play the college admissions process as a game you're trying to win. I can't stop you. But the odds are stacked against you, and that's a bad way to play a game of chance. So you have to change the way you think about the game.",

I have my criticisms of the AOERC (branded dodecagonal plates and no platforms? gtfo of here) but I'm desperate at this point. \n\nI do want to reemphasize one thing, though, that maybe didn't come through in my post: \n\n>i feel like anyone in that position of power who quits and switches to private college counseling is inevitably going to be very good at packaging people successfully bc they've seen what flies in an admissions office and what doesn't. my private college counselor had an insane rate of kids going to ivies/stanford (way more than the acceptance rates show) which goes to show how this type of packaging is effective.\n\nFrom what I've heard, from people who go work on that side of the desk, it's actually mostly not the packaging. It's the _selection of clients,_ like an expensive lawyer who can afford to only pick clients with good facts on their side. A good private college counselor is one who only works with clients where they seem them as _already_ being competitive applicants on the material bases that drive (most) college admissions, like having affluent parents who won't require aid (which is self-selecting if you charge a lot as a counselor), or other attractive markers that they 'know', from their prior work in admissions, institutions select for. The counselor then focuses attention on clubs/essays to make them more salient to the client, because that is where the counselor can be seen to be providing hidden insight or secret knowledge (whereas they can't change a family's wealth or legacy status or preexisting talent in a particular area), when these are at best marginal aspects of the application's candidacy. This is why I said it's classic misdirection: it literally works the same way as a magic trick. \n\n(I'm glad to hear you/your counselor don't think this works at MIT, either because we have inhuman acumen or, more likely, we really really really try to avoid the unconscious, unthinking reproduction of a socioeconomic elite on the base indicators that confounds the polished essays. who knows maybe no legacy alone gets you 90% of the way there) \n\n> i guess you're right in that we should be trying to subvert the elitist system of college rankings and college admissions first tho\n\nThat's really my big point. We can't go on this way, as a society. Or rather I fear we can, and pray we won't.",

That sounds horrible but, I don\u2019t feel the system will change. I know this is a terribly complacent mindset. But I don\u2019t think art majors will suddenly be making 6 figures (minus the few ppl who make it big), and I\u2019m here for a short time, so if I have to do a big corporate job or go into a well paying profession because of the money and I\u2019m reasonably good at school and networking then I will. Hopefully the financial cushion will give me time and money to do the things I do love that I\u2019d never make a living off of.\n\n\nTo be clear I hope I don\u2019t come off as a republican (lol), just because I go along with the system doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I like it.

I was passionate about it, it wasn\u2019t for college. It was for me and my community. My whole life, I\u2019ve only been sure of one thing- I want to change the world. I thought the only way I could do that was to get into Harvard or Cornell ILR to have the platform, resources, connections, etc. Last Thursday, I got rejected from both. I was absolutely crushed- I had the scores, the extra-curriculars, great essays, amazing interviews. I was the perfect candidate and was crushed. I felt it was a reflection on me. I\u2019ve worked as hard as I could for as long as I can remember. I felt like a failure. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do now. I can only afford one school but it\u2019s my least favorite. But this helped me remember that Harvard and Cornell aren\u2019t everything. \n\nIt\u2019s been killing me to see these rich classmates of mine have everything handed to them. Where they get tutors in everything and advisors, I\u2019m working my ass off. These people are mean and bullies. I don\u2019t think I deserve to go instead of them, I\u2019m sure they worked hard at some point, but you can\u2019t deny the role that money plays in having access to resources. \n\nAnyways, thank you!",

      "text": "I don't really agree. While yes, you absolutely can get into a college like Stanford doing something you don't care about\u2014why the hell would you want to? When I set out to do something, I want it to enrich me personally, I want it to make me a better person. I want to actually have goals for what I'm doing beyond just padding an application to impress someone I'll never meet.\n\nI was accepted to Stanford and Harvard this year, and I'll tell you, I cared about every single thing I did in high school. I've written an entire novel (only a first draft for now), I've written short stories and submitted them to magazines, I've written for my local newspaper. Why did I do that? Not because I thought it would get me into my dream college, but because I cared about the words I was committing to paper. Those stories were ones that I believed needed to be told. Those newspaper articles drew attention to outstanding citizens and serious problems in my community that needed the spotlight. When I started writing, I didn't think about college, I just knew that I had a voice and I wanted it to be heard.\n\nThe activities I participated in college were ones that I authentically enjoyed. Drama Club, HS Band, Spell Bowl\u2014I engaged in those activities with some of my best friends. I never applied for National Honor Society, never started a non-profit that didn't really set out to do anything, I just did what meant something to me. If I'd been rejected from my top choices, I would still have that. I would still have all of the effort that I put out into the world and all of the dreams I worked towards. I wouldn't feel like I'd wasted the last four years of my life trying to impress admissions officers. Sure, if all you care about is getting into a college with a fancy name, selling your soul, and doing no particular good for the world, then by all means do what you don't really care about. But you're lying to the world and you're lying to yourself, and if there's anything I believe in, it's honesty.\n\nI'm not trying to diminish your achievements in the slightest, OP. It's incredible that you went to Stanford, and I hope you go on to do great things. But I want everyone here to understand that no matter what you do, something you care about or something you don't care about, it's incredibly difficult to get into these schools and most of you reading probably won't. If that's the case, then wouldn't you rather have spent your time on something worthwhile, something you care about and are passionate about, rather than something that meant nothing to you? The difference between those two is a rejection letter that leaves you empty and hopeless, vs. one that leaves you with a wealth of accomplishments that actually matter to you. You're left with something instead of nothing.",

I come from rural Indiana, and no one at my school's ever been accepted to an Ivy before; we've only had one person even go to Notre Dame, and that was our most significant achievement.\n\nBut I don't want people to think that your strategy is an automatic acceptance to Stanford or Harvard. Even if you didn't particularly have a passion for the work you did, it's obvious from your post that you put a lot of work and effort into it, and I don't doubt that you help changed some lives. Not everyone is willing to do that for something they don't care about. For every success story like yours, I'm sure there are dozens of non-profits started that see their founders go off to their state university. I think that's why people should do what they care about, because I just reject the notion of doing things only to get into HYPSM. That's like taking out a loan to by lottery tickets; 99% of the time, you'll end up disappointed.",

Stanford has more students from [the top 1% of the income spectrum than the bottom 50%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html) and Harvard is similarly skewed.

If you create a legitimate non-profit early in your high school career with tangible impact and keep at it for all of high school, it'll make getting into an elite school significantly easier (although obviously not automatic). Remember when I said I got an award from Princeton my junior year recognizing my non-profit? Almost all of the people who get that award get into elite colleges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if you made a bullshit non-profit that doesn't really do anything, that's a different story.

Unless you're Immanuel Kant, it doesn't really matter what your motivation is if you're doing concrete good for the world. Not only that, but you've shown that you're a driven person who can accomplish great things if given the resources and the time. You could be a cold-hearted sociopath and you've still bettered your community and impacted lives.\n\nI suppose we just have differing philosophies. I don't think it's wrong to approach things as you do, I just wouldn't do it myself. For those whose be-all end-all goal is HYPSM, your strategy may work better. If you're striving for meaning though, if you really would rather do something that you care about, then I would say do it. The name on your diploma doesn't matter nearly as much as being true to yourself and accomplishing your own goals, doing what *you* believe is important. And that's my hot take for this subreddit.",

He insists that everything Pete has accomplished and the manner in which he has done so make him and everything he was done inherently bad. Again, not true.\n\nMy first issue with the article is when Robinson asserts that Pete has no clear policies based on ONE interview. Now I know that\u2019s false, because I would never support someone if I didn\u2019t know what they stood for. If the author had wanted to give the full picture, he could\u2019ve instead established [what Pete stood for](https://www.axios.com/pete-buttigieg-2020-presidential-election-factsheet-indiana-mayor-020c5afc-c8a2-4691-940c-b271e63306b1.html), which is actually very clear. Pete doesn\u2019t only have ideas, though. He has plans. This is my favorite thing about the way he speaks. If you read through [this article\u2019s](https://www.axios.com/pete-buttigieg-2020-presidential-election-factsheet-indiana-mayor-020c5afc-c8a2-4691-940c-b271e63306b1.html) first question and answer, you can see for yourself. I was pretty bothered by the way Robinson tried to portray Pete in a false light.\n\nI also have a problem with the way Robinson tries to act like Pete is actually conservative. He looks down on the fact that Pete thought that more people should join the military. He accuses him of conservative thinking here. What he completely neglects to mention is Pete\u2019s reasoning for believing more people should serve. In the book, Pete talks about how he decided to join after campaigning for Obama in 2008 and meeting many young men in poorer areas who informed him that they couldn\u2019t caucus because they were leaving for military training. Pete joined because he was struck by the extreme wealth divide in the military. He was so behind the idea that those in a better financial situation shouldn\u2019t look down on those serving that he didn\u2019t just argue for it. He went and joined because it\u2019s something he believed in. Wanting to eliminate class divides and criticizing the elite? Does that sound conservative to you? Robinson acts like Pete doesn\u2019t understand war at all, implying Pete thinks America didn\u2019t make mistakes in the Middle East or Vietnam. Some of the passages from Shortest Way Home that stuck with me the most were the ones in which Pete discussed the awful mistakes America did make in these wars and the needlessness of the deaths (like the death of a soldier at 10:59 a.m. during WWI because the armistice wasn\u2019t supposed to go into effect until 11:00). Robinson doesn\u2019t quote any of these, but that\u2019s not a surprise.\n\nRobinson also says, \u201cWhen Pete Buttigieg reports having meetings with people, it\u2019s usually party bosses and advisers rather than ordinary voters, around whom he often seems uncomfortable.\u201d If that were the case, then why do I remember so many stories talking about Pete with ordinary people? Another one of the passages I remember most is when Pete went to the scene of a shooting the day after it happened and met with the mother of the victim. He had happened to run into her there, and they spoke and he did what he could to comfort her. Pete\u2019s meetings with ordinary people in South Bend are actually a really key part of the book. They\u2019re not key to Robinson\u2019s case, so they\u2019re not included.\n\nRobinson criticizes Pete for always \u201cfollowing the data\u201d as mayor. He ignores the fact that Pete writes a lot about how he USED TO BE data-oriented but learned during his first term as mayor that that isn\u2019t always the right approach. Robinson only cites things from the time BEFORE Pete made an effort to be less about data and more about people. Again, because this \u201cafter\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the case he\u2019s trying to make for \u201cno more Petes.\u201d\n\nHe argues that Pete\u2019s progressivism is too quiet and not enough. Pete\u2019s effectiveness as a politician proves him wrong. Too few people are actually enough of progressive Democrats for the elected officials in federal, state, or local governments to decide that they want \u201call or nothing\u201d for progressive policies. Pete is pragmatic and understands this. He works across the aisle because he\u2019s in Indiana and knows has no choice. Idealism simply doesn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s even more damaging time the progressive cause than compromise is. What\u2019s important about Pete is he wants progressive reform, and he understands how to get it. Quiet rebellion is EVERYTHING. That\u2019s how you get stuff done.\n\nAnd maybe what you\u2019ve heard most about Pete is from conspiracies or hatred in Twitter. I guess there\u2019s no one who can address it better than Pete himself in [this interview](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/politics/the-exit-interview-pete-buttigieg). I\u2019ve said this a lot, but I really think people who dislike Pete most are people who don\u2019t know him. Personally, I think he\u2019d make an amazing president. I\u2019m still a supporter for 2028, 2032, or who knows.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this got a little long-winded. I hope it helped :)",

With that being said however, the knowledge a person can gain from these schools can contribute significantly in finding ways to dismantle systemic barriers. The different perspectives a person can learn from their peers can drastically alter one's worldview, and this along w other outside factors influence a person's way of thinking once out of college.\n\nIt's one of the main reasons I want to pursue things outside of the uni I'm attending so I'm not living in a bubble.",

Why do you think the presidential campaign of an African-American progressive would pick a moderate white segregationist as its VP, if not to appeal to moderate whites?

It seems incongruent, then, for anyone to claim capitalism and imperialism aren't conformist. \n\nIn all honesty, I think this is a difference in our political views that'll take a lot more than a reddit thread to discuss.",

Musk was born in a incredibly rich family and if it weren't for the enormous of money he got from his family's apartheid emerald mine (basically slavery) kick-starting him he wouldn't have been where he is today. That doesn't make him a brave risk taker that differentiates him from the rest of ivy students.\n2. Musk had to invest a large sum of money into tesla in its early stage and then basically acquired it and paid the founders to give him the title of founders, that's not really freethinking of him my man.\n3. The original tweet contrasts freethinkers to capitalists and imperialists because our current system supports capitalism and imperialism; billionaires are billionaires by keeping their money through playing by the rules, the same behavior elite institutions train students to do, despite whatever ideal is being preached. Revolutionary thinking comes from climbing out of the hegemony and creating our own values instead of swallowing down capitalist and imperialist ideology.",

And when they don't get in, they complain about the system. \"After all that I've done, I still get rejected! This system is so messed up!\" But they forget they are the ones who made the choice. They could've done something that makes them fulfilled and proud no matter what the admission results are. But they chose to waste all the time, effort, and money on something they are not in to at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they do all the things they're passionate about and don't get into certain schools, then it's okay that they're a little mad. Though I highly doubt they'll still complain about the results if they follow this route. But if they choose to play the system but fail, then just shut up because they're the ones who decide to screw themselves up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in China, and lots of these parents and students' default mindset is to play the system.

I know plenty of Econ/finance/pre-med people who don\u2019t have a single passion besides money, but outside those fields most people I meet here are pretty genuine with their passions. Sure, most of us did a few activities in high school we were only moderately interested in to round out our applications, but our main ECs were things we really did care about. Ultimately, admissions officers want to admit people who are interesting, and people who say \u201cI want to go to Harvard and major in biology so I can go to med school and become an anesthesiologist so I can make a lot of money\u201d are decidedly not interesting. Someone with that goal might just lie about their passions on the application, but that still makes them a more interesting applicant.",

He\u2019s a committed leftist, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, he\u2019s obviously going to oppose Buttigieg\u2019s political ideology and rhetoric. Again, that\u2019s not a problem in and of itself, but we should evaluate the essay accordingly.\n\nSecond, the essay presents short, out-of-context quotes from a much longer book to make points about how, since Buttigieg didn\u2019t join a campus protest movement and worked at McKinsey, he is morally compromised and hypocritical. That\u2019s simply not a fair standard to hold a person to. No one should be making broad conclusions about one\u2019s character or morals based on clips from their book and paragraphs of rebuttal from an ideological rival. No wonder Buttigieg seems like a villain!\n\nWith those two points in mind, to hold this article up as an objective, accurate view of Pete Buttigieg is simply dishonest. It should be considered, but I\u2019d hope one would read more than just this article when making conclusions about one\u2019s moral character. \n\nAnd, just for the sake of it, let\u2019s realize that Buttigieg has helped tangibly improve the lives of his constituents in South Bend. Nathan Robinson has not improved the lives of anyone in that way. Let\u2019s keep that in mind too.",

My older sister was an investment banker for a few years after graduating from Princeton. So no, I don't think going into finance and consulting is automatically a marker of weak moral character. I do think that choosing to join Mckinsey after completing a master's at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar shows (at best) a lack of imagination on Buttigieg's part, which **I think is indicative of the hoop-jumping nature of so many students at elite schools.**",

As it stood in 2018, it was meant to mean any kind of universal health care program, however in 2019 Sanders took it over to mean specifically his single-payer plan. Here's a source on that: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/2/17468448/medicare-for-all-single-payer-health-care-2018-elections\n\nTo expand on this: if Buttigieg were 100% signing on to single-payer at that time, why specify \"as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered\"? There are measures that get America universal health care, hell, there are even measures that get America to a single-payer healthcare system that aren't specifically Sanders' method. The reality is that in 2018 M4A was not synonymous with Senator Sanders' single payer bill.\n\n> likely because he took millions of dollars in fundraising from pharmaceutical executives. \n\nI find it quite curious that your source on this is a campaign fundraiser. You've acknowledged that his source of fundraising is individual donations. Are you aware that individual donations are capped at $2,800 by the FEC? You claim that he \"took millions\" from pharmaceutical executives. 1,000,000/2,800 is about 358, so it'd take about 358 pharmaceutical executives to give Buttigieg even a million dollars, much less \"millions\" as you claim.\n\n> While he didn't explicitly take PAC money, he did have a Super-PAC and his campaign was nearly outed, (which is illegal) for coordinating with it sometime near the Nevada primary.\n\nThis is the most ridiculous claim that you could make. Buttigieg did not have a Super PAC, however a Super PAC (VoteVets) supported him, and he didn't refuse their support. (Just like Bernie Sanders has 3 Super PACs supporting him -- their names are Make the Road Action, Dream Defenders Fight, People's Action (source: https://www.wral.com/fact-checking-the-sanders-biden-primary-debate/19013458/ )).\n\nFurthermore, what he did concerning the communication between the two PACs was not illegal. The PAC was never mentioned at all, they were just putting it out there publicly, which is explicitly the only legal way to do so. \n\nThe Harry Reid staffer's quote makes no sense. Are you arguing that $2,800 can buy a policy?\n\n> Similar to Obama, he publically promised \"change\" via soaring rhetoric, but privately took big industry donations with likely zero intention to make any transformational change if elected.\n\nObama passed the ACA, Dodd-Frank, and established the CFPB, so I don't know what you mean when you say that he didn't make any changes. Also, you have no precedent when you say that he would \"likely make no transformative change\" -- he wasn't elected, and you are basing that almost entirely off your predisposed opinion of him. \n\n> Given all that, I'm just surprised more people didn't catch his grifting earlier.\n\nGood thing that all the evidence for his \"grifting\" is based off of incomplete or inaccurate information!",
