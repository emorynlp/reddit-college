I have a 3.7 u/w and a 3.86 weighted on a 4.0 scale and i\u2019m not even sure if i\u2019m competitive at some of the schools i\u2019m applying to. I guess what i\u2019m really asking is do schools report average GPA on a 4.0 or 5.0 scale and is it weighted or unweighted.",

      "text": "I\u2019m convinced PrepScholar uses a random number generator for some of it\u2018s data.\n\nUnfortunately, the best source, the Common Data Set, has no standardization, so it\u2019s data is similarly not useful.  Iirc, at least one school confirmed they re-calculate every applicant\u2019s GPA with an honors weighting of 5.0. They reported an average GPA over 4 while less than half of their applicants were in the top 25% of their HS class.",
