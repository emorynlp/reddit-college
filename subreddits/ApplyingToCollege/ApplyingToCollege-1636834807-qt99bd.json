  "title:": "Georgia Tech First Name Changed to Middle Name",
  "text": "I applied to Georgia Tech EA, and on my portal/in all the emails they send me about my application, they refer to me by my middle name. Is this something I should contact the admissions office about, and has anyone else experienced this issue? I've checked on Common App and the Georgia Tech portal, and I did put my actual first name in the \"First Name\" slot and my actual middle name in the \"Middle Name\" slot. Thank you!",

      "text": "Hi there! We\u2019ll use your preferred name if one was given to our office at any point\u2026 for example, if your auto fill added your middle name as a preferred name if you ever signed up for a visit, that might be the culprit. \n\nDouble check your preferred name in your application portal- there will be a button that should say something to the effect of \u201cupdate biographical information\u201d. If you don\u2019t see it listed there, at that point I\u2019d recommend going ahead with an email. -Sammy",
