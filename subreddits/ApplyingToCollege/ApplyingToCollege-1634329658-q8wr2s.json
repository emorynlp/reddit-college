  "text": "i just got back my results for the oct. 2nd SAT, and i feel a bit conflicted because my score went down from a 1500 (730 reading 770 math) to a 1490 (780 reading 710 math), BUT my superscore did go up to a 1550 (very happy about). i'm applying to a lot of schools that do superscore, but would they (especially the more selective ones) see me as worse because of the decline in scores (even if it is slight)? or would they only see/consider the superscored version?",
