  "text": "I\u2019m not the best student but I had all As last year, and the year before Bs in Math and Science. This year as a Junior though, there was an incident with my health and now I have C-s in AP Chem (my first science ap) and Honors math 4 precalculus and my programming teacher has an F put in my transcript for now (she\u2019s going to change it, there was a mishap with my labs being turned in incorrectly so she couldn\u2019t grade them and gave me 0s) \n\nAm I correct to believe my current semester is why I got rejected by NHS? I\u2019m considering dropping AP Chem and just sticking with 1 AP even though it is junior year because I\u2019m not that intelligent. My heart is completely torn because I have a 3.9 gpa before this semester. \n\nShould I try appealing after dropping the class and my programming grades get corrected? I\u2019m really scared to face people at my school, every single one of my friends got in. My parents are even considering transferring me to another school. \n\nPlease help,\nA scared junior.",

      "text": "It depends on what your NHS actually looks at. \n\nAt my school as long as you had a 3.6 at the end of the previous semester were alright grade wise - current grades didn\u2019t matter. What mine looked at was your extracurriculars and volunteer work - and what was considered to count as either was extremely strict so it\u2019s near impossible to even have 1 or 2 of either even when you were a hard overachiever. If you had 1 or no in either section you were immediately disqualified.\n\nBut honestly. NHS is kinda useless. At most depending on the quality of your chapter it could provide you opportunities for volunteer and extracurricular hours and that\u2019s it. The being in NHS part of it doesn\u2019t really look that much different from just having qualified for it at some point.",
