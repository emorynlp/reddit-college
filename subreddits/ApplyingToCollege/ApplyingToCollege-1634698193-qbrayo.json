  "text": "I\u2019m studying as a psychology major, Bay Area community college transfer (getting my ADT in psych this December and transferring Fall 2022). Plan is to go to graduate school for social work after I finish my bachelors and work in mental health - either get a therapy license, work in rehab or a mental hospital, or whatever I discover along the way. \n\nApplying to only CSU\u2019s (California state university) and my list, as rated by preference, are \n\n1. CSU Long Beach \n2. CSU Fullerton \n3. CSU Northridge \n4. CSU Channel Islands \n5. SJSU\n6. SFSU \n\nI think my college list is pretty solid but maybe a second opinion would be nice. Defiantly want to be in SoCal, I love the area and weather, I have family down there and friends at Long Beach, so I have a support system, it\u2019s far enough but not too far from home, in state so tuition isn\u2019t too high, and I\u2019ve just wanted to live there since middle school.",

          "text": "Couple reasons 1. I am a general psychology major, and most UC\u2019s have the more scienc-y psych major and not as good of a general liberal arts psychology major. They are more research based too and the CSU\u2019s provide more internship opportunities if I want to apply to a MSW program and also teach a more hands on approach, which is the career I want. 2. More expensive 3. Since I\u2019m a cc transfer, all the UC\u2019s have weird class requirements to transfer there. UCSB was the only UC that appeals to me but they don\u2019t have a psych major so I wasn\u2019t gonna bother with taking extra classes for a major I don\u2019t want\n\nAlso CSULB is pretty popular so I consider it a reach (will transfer with a 3.65ish? after my ADT bump)",
