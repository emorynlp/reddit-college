  "text": "With all the news around space recently, I\u2019ve gotten really interested in the subject, and as a teenager who is now looking at colleges, I was wondering if someone could shed some light on it for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking at Europa and the rover landing happening in a couple years, and I want to be one of the people studying that moon, but I don\u2019t know what major I should look at to get there. Astronomy? Astrophysics? \n\nIf someone with a bit more knowledge could help me understand the fields I could look at that would fantastic. Thank you!",

      "text": "- Astrophysics, if you're interested in black holes and nebulae, stargazing or something of that sort. - you can also look into applied or theoretical physics in this direction, and one more alternate major would be CS + Astrophysics (offered in UIUC for example)\n\nKeep in mind that most jobs in Astrophysics/physics or any other above mentioned majors have majority of the jobs in academia/ research and more often than not require a PhD, and at minimum a master's degree.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Aerospace engineering if you're interested in rockets, maybe the starship development, propulsion fuels or related topics. As a backup you could also go into Mechanical engineering (it's easy to get I to the aerospace industry with mechanical as well)\n\nAerospace engineering often requires you to get a master's, but a PhD is not the norm (not rare, but not expected of you to get jobs as far as I've heard)\n\nEdit: I would highly recommend you look into universities like Embry riddle, Caltech, USC, CU Boulder, Purdue, UIUC and University of Florida if you're interested in either major.",

But remember there is a very very high chance you don\u2019t end up as an astronaut, you need to be in tip top physical and mental condition, your vision needs to be perfect, along with a bunch of other factors completely out of your control",
