  "text": "Just a bit confused on the word \"unconditional\". How unconditional is an unconditional offer cause i got half of my US friends saying that they are going to just pass IB/school if they get an unconditional offer but my counselor telling me that schools can takeback an unconditional offer.\n\nSo my question is, is there a bar which I can't drop below for an unconditional offer? Do i need to worry about performance after an unconditional offer?",
