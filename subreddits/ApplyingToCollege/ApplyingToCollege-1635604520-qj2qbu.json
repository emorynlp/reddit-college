  "text": "I\u2019ve been fascinated with this school for a while. I\u2019m from NY but moved away to NC so I would be an out of state student :///\n\nI couldn\u2019t rly find anything abt their English program (English education specifically) apart from their website. If I do attend a NY school (CUNY specifically) I am considering either living with my aunt who lives in Brooklyn or my dad who lives in Jersey City.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nHow is the scholarship/merits for ppl from out of state? Since my main focus is the costs of everything and I would rather not put my parents through financial debt.\n\nAny information about the English program?\n\nIf not CCNY, what other CUNY schools do u recommend for English (education) majors?\n\n*also sry is this isn\u2019t the sub to post this question*",

Try doing their NPC to see what you get as a result some schools have their merit aid as part of that.",
