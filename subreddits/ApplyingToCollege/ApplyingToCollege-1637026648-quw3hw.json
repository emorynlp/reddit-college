  "text": "I was completing the IDOC but had to take a break to complete the documents now CB is not letting me log into my CSS profile access my IDOC saying that there\u2019s an error and I tried contacting them to no avail. Either way if I do finish uploading the IDOC documents I remember seeing on the websit it taking a few days to process will I still get financial aid if I submit the IDOC late but my CSS profile early?",
