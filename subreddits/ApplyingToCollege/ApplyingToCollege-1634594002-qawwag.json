  "text": "In the CommonApp activities section, they ask how many \u201chours per week\u201d and \u201cweeks per year\u201d you worked, but I am confused on what this exactly means. \n\n\nWould the weeks per year mean how many total weeks I participated or how many weeks the total hours I participated would equal to? \n\n\nFor example, If I worked 15 hours per week, what would I put for weeks per year?",
