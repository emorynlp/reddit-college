  "text": "I recently gave grade 12 exams and am awaiting the results. Should I start applying to colleges from now even though I have literally nothing but my previous class' grades? I am giving the SAT on March 2022 and have pretty good GPA in all grades till 11. Should I register for the common app? I'm an international student btw.",

      "text": "If you're already done with your Class 12, you should've applied last year, unless you were planning to take a gap year... If you're looking at the Fall 2022 intake, you should be working on your applications right now, since most of the regular deadlines will be around early January... Taking the SAT in March might not help you since many schools with January deadlines won't accept such late scores.",
