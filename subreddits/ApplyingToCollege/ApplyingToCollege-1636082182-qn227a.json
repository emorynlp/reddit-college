It would be completely normal to matriculate with a prospective major that you don't know much about but you're interested in exploring. Please don't worry that your profile looks weird in any way.\n\nAlso: your interviewer doesn't know what you put on your application. They have your name, email address, and school. That's it. \n\nThey'll ask you about your prospective major, and you can *tell* them about the philosophy and religion thing, but you can deflect the religion part by asking them how they got into their chosen field and whether they majored in it in college.",

Outside of it probably not being a big deal, most people aren't experts in the majors they're in. \n\nReligion is very interesting and you can easily spin it as part of your interest in philosophy (given that philosophy and religion have historically been *very intertwined.* Off the top of my head, Descartes, Aquinas, Augustine of Hippo, Kierkegaard, etc. wrote philosophy as  a way to think and explore their religiosity for example and there are still many Christian philosophers today, such as Plantinga (probably the most famous one that comes to mind.) As a side note, highly recommend reading Plantinga's arguments for the existence of God because even though I'm not convinced by it, it's fascinating and something most people have probably never really thought about.) Nobody who has done in depth study of either would at all be surprised that someone from the other side would share interests in both.",

      "text": "In case you actually *did* want to learn about judaism, here\u2019s some things I enjoy about the religion as an atheist of Jewish heritage:\n\n- They make a big point of including children, and children are not seen as \u2018lesser than\u2019\n\n- You are *absolutely* supposed to question the existence of God- it\u2019s required\n\n- Seders! These are basically Thanksgiving, except in the spring, and you\u2019re thanking God for freeing the slaves from Egypt. Lots of singing, lots of catching up with family members. The Afikomen and the Four Questions are the most fun parts of the \u2018ceremony\u2019- the rest is your older relatives trying to one-up each other on how much Hebrew they know. The only religious song you will remember is \u2018Dayenu\u2019, which is the same word repeated for a whole song. There\u2019s also one about goats that everyone else half-remembers that goes on for like 12 verses (maybe it\u2019s called Two Zhuzim?).\n\n- Hanukkah. Lots of presents and singing and candle lighting. You *will* end up with a lot of chocolate coins.\n\n- Other highlights include Sukkot (where you build a little house out of sticks in you backyard and eat in it) and Rosh Hashana, the Day of Atonement (where you symbolically throw bread into a river).\n\nHope this is at least interesting to you, if not helpful!",
