  "title:": "Why is there a Congratulations On My Rejection Letter?",
  "text": "I can't believe it, guys. I, little old me, got into Amherst!!! Can you believe it? Because I can't. I can't believe it. How did this happen?!!! \ud83d\ude02\nI saw the email. A decision has been posted on your application checklist thing. So I thought, Well, that must be a rejection. But God, please, let them have deferred me to RD. Please. \nBecause whenever I see people posting acceptances... it seems that they get a straight-up Congratulations! e-mail. So I thought that \"a decision has been posted...\" email was a rejection or waitlist. Which was all the decisions I got last year.\nSo, when I opened the e-mail, and I saw Congratulations... I actually frowned, momentarily confused. Why is there a Congratulations on my rejection letter? Then it hit. I'm in!!!\n\nFunny thing. When I texted my Education USA advisor in October that I was applying to Amherst ED, she sent me a voice note, 2 minutes, telling me not to. I am a very realistic person, she said, you won't get in. Be smart, do not waste your ED spot. Amherst is the no 1 liberal arts college in the US (I actually was not aware of this). Apply ED to a school where you stand a chance.\nShe only wished me well and I love her for her practicality; it has seen me and countless others through the process. But I did not listen to her, because I loved Amherst too much.\nI thanked my advisor, then I told myself that if Amherst would reject me, they were welcome to. But that I will not reject myself before they even got the chance. I will try. If they said no, and I thought they would, then fine. But I will try. I will give the future I want an opportunity, no matter how foolish. I love this school enough that a sliver of a chance to attend it is worth the risk of my ED spot.\nSo I closed my ears, held my breath and applied.\n\nI am so happy, Can't even say. I can't wait for the financial aid award so I can accept my future and tell my mother I'm going to school!!! I am international and my mom is busy, so she has never really got the entire application thingy. Lol.\n\nThank you to God. Only He could have done this. \ud83d\ude0a. Thank you to EVERYBODY!!!\nI wish everybody here the utter best as we open our decisions!!!",
