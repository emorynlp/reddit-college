T30 colleges also have edges in financial aid and retention rates, and generally attract / can select for students who are set up to succeed. It would be weird if they *didn't* have edges in ROI and grad school placement, but that doesn't mean prestige is driving that (can't hurt, sure). \n\nPrestige is just one factor among many, and while it's true that prestigious *schools* tend to offer a series of advantages, that doesn't mean prestige itself should be what drives decisions on where to go.",

I read this yesterday and found it to be really interesting:\n\n>\"To assess the effect of the Ivies, it makes more sense to compare the student who got into a top school with the student who got into that same school but chose to go to a less selective one. Three years ago, the economists Alan Krueger and Stacy Dale published just such a study. *And they found that when you compare apples and apples the income bonus from selective schools disappears.*  \n\u201cAs a hypothetical example, take the University of Pennsylvania and Penn State, which are two schools a lot of students choose between,\u201d Krueger said. \u201cOne is Ivy, one is a state school. Penn is much more highly selective. If you compare the students who go to those two schools, the ones who go to Penn have higher incomes. But let\u2019s look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set *it doesn\u2019t seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school.* Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse later on. But they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n**Source:** https://web.archive.org/web/20131013143513/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/10/051010crat\\_atlarge?printable=true&currentPage=all",
