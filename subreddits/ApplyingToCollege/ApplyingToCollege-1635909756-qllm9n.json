  "text": "I have sent the official score reports for my SAT and TOEFL three weeks ago (Oct.12nd) and on the Northeastern portal it says \"required\" instead of \"completed\". I know they ask you to self-report your SAT/ACT again on their portal but how do I know if the official reports have been sent? Thye also say it will take 10-12 days for the TOEFL score to be sent to their office but it's been more than two weeks lol.  I'm so confused...NEU your portal is build different :(",
