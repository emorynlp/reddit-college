  "text": "Basically in my junior year, I am currently taking 6 AP's in school as well as 4 AP Classes online that my school does not offer (and are related to my major if that matters.) Next year, I plan to take only 2 ap's and 3 post-ap classes. how much will this drop in course rigor affect me in terms of college admissions? Should I take more ap courses that I am not really interested in to balance it out? it doesn't seem really wise to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, If i started the online AP courses during the end of 10th grade, but ended it in the beginning of 11th, would that count as me taking it in 10th grade or 11th?",

      "text": "i may just be so far removed from this process but is it standard for kids to be taking 7+ AP classes a year now??? if for some reason even that's not enough for highly ranked universities then the next generation is absolutely fucked\n\nI took 4 harder APs junior year, decided I wouldn't survive another year of that shit and dropped down to 2 senior year. I don't think it affected me and I still got into a T5 ECE program w/ Honors + a T20",
