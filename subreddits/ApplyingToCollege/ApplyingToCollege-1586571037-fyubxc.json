  "text": "Literally every single YouTube video on my recommended is \"how I got into ____! Stats and ECs\"  and then go on to say \"I didn't have perfect stats. My SAT was only a 1590!  I honestly don't think SAT and GPA are important just be passionate\". Like bro stfu we get it you're smart. No need to rub it our faces. They act like they try to give people hope but really end up discouraging people even more. Only make those videos if your stats are ACTUALLY not perfect. Then, your videos would help people. And emphasize the video on your essays rather than your stats since \"that's what matters\"",

As long as you have over a 3.0, most schools look at your APs and SATs - to them GPA is a useless metric.  There's very few schools that need really high GPA if you have good test scores, good sports, strong portfolio, etc - MIT, Cal Tech, Ivy Leagues.  Most state schools could give a fuck.",

This was twenty years ago.\n\nA lot of the recruiting I got had to do with my major. I got offered a better AFROTC scholarship than others as well.\n\nIn the end I got rejected by Clemson because I never got the College Board to send my SAT scores. I ended up going to the one other school I got accepted to and wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. Not sure that helps you but just thought I would put it out there.",

Needless to say he ended up getting like a 1520 or something, yet said something to the effect of \"kids focus/stress too much on SAT scores, you should just chill out and yannow it doesn't really matter that much anyway.\" I was like bruh most people would need to like, oh idk study a lot more than one night leading up to the SAT to get close to that high. Just because you don't have to stress at all to get a respectable score doesn't mean thats how it works for lots of other people.",

Personal memoir is super tricky and daunting, but I do think if you read some good essays and put in hours trying different essay approaches, you can do something solid. It's not about being the best writer, but being genuine and concise. (I have actually seen smart \"creative\" people be so try-hard in their essays it actually backfires, if that helps.)

I applied to the T20 colleges and a few equally tough colleges to get into with a 3.3 Weighted GPA, 3.0 UW and a 1240 SAT. No subject tests. Had average ECs: 2 Biomedical research papers (Not published), 2 clubs at school (No position), Top 2% national wide in chess and state-wide in piano. Great letter of reccs cuz of the research papers and I knew them very well (AP Biology and AP Lang Teacher). I applied to all UCs (Got rejected from all of them except UCSC, UCR, UCM) for Biology. I got rejected from CWRU, Gatech, BU, UW Seattle and a few more. I was accepted to American University (Scholarship), Baylor University (Scholarship), Texas A&M (Scholarship) and University of Chicago (Yes, Ik surprising) all for Biomedical Engineering. For the why U Chicago essay, I wrote a poem (Rhyming) to express my interest which clearly set me apart from the thousands of other students who had perfect stats and stellar ECs. I wrote about my passion and expressed my true self. I am an Asian Male (Indian) with no legacy, no alumni, none of the BS that gives me an advantage. I am currently studying at the University of Chicago!!!!!! Never LOSE HOPE. YOU GUYS CAN DO IT!!!!!",

Obviously that\u2019s just for a public school with lots of low stats applicants, but US colleges love IB kids ([here](http://pages.crimsoneducation.org/rs/039-NBM-750/images/FL-10-2018-ib-student-acceptance-rates-at-top-us-universities.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWTJaalltRTJOV0kzT1) you can actually see a better list including Stanford). As for your IB score, that is an absolutely fantastic score and you must have gotten good recognition for that. Your SAT is very good and above average at Stanford, but nothing super special or unheard of; same goes for your subject test scores which are lower than most people receive. You aren\u2019t being pretentious at all in my opinion and assuming you had as good of essays and ECs as you said, it surely make sense that you would get into Stanford.

Don't think about it from a discouraging standpoint, practically too, its just very hard to chase these stats down - unless its standardised testing. Just a thought.",

Speaking of scores, I hope some day the notorious standardized tests are abolished from the admission system because they WILL NEVER accurately assess someone's success at at university. :/ The admission process is a joke. \n\n(damn I'm getting heated LMAO)",
