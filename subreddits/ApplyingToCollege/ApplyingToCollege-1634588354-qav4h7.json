  "text": "I\u2019m applying to Dartmouth early decision as an FGLI student and obviously plan to apply for financial aid. I understand that the CSS fee is affordable for most people, but I\u2019m from of a family of eight with a joint yearly income of around 12,000 dollars. I requested a fee waiver from Dartmouth and apparently I\u2019m not eligible even if I\u2019m basically living from hand to mouth. I get that I\u2019m not entitled to anything but it\u2019s just really disappointing to me. Sigh, just felt like sharing because no one around me really understands.",
