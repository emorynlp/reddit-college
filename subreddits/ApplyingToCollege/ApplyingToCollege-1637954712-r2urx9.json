  "text": "Randomly stumbled upon this school reading some article about the hardest colleges to get into in each state. The stats of this school make no sense to me? 35% acceptance rate which makes it fairly competitive, but a 3.2 average accepted gpa, 920-980 sat, and a 17-18 ACT. Also has like a 30% graduation rate. How does such a competitive college have requirements on the lower side?",

              "text": "yea yea ik what u mean, i have wondered the same about other schools with low acceptance rates yet the average stats for the school aren\u2019t that competitive. idk about u of west alabama but it might be popular for in state students and many probs apply to it as a safety and maybe they don\u2019t accept students that have very high stats for that reason??? idk tbh but it does make me wonder",
