  "text": "In my school (Decent public, sends about 10 to private T20 and Cal/UCLA feeder so like 30-40 there), I feel like pretty much everything is said to look \"really good on apps\" and make you \"stand out from the stack!!\" like doing debate (not getting awards, but just signing up for the class and getting it on your transcript), being a student senator of your 10 person homeroom (of which there are like 70 and in our homeroom we literally drew sticks to try not to be it) NHS stuff, signing up for clubs and doing nothing, it just feels really dumb and misleading since there are a lot of kids who are genuinely believing this and investing time into these things - until you realize like 60 people are the same as you from your school that also did all these resume fillers. ONG IM IN A ZOOM CALL RN AND SOMONE JUST SAID IF YOU HAVE <XX LARGE COMPANY THATS RUNNING THIS> ON YOUR RESUME YOUR GOING TO STAND OUT. **BUT THERES 208 PEOPLE IN THIS CALL MY MAN**.\n\nThere's way too much capitalizing on kids just realizing college is a thing, and making them do dumb things, especially at the school level.\n\nThere's also stuff that i sort of cringe at, not because its false, but because college has gotten so skewed, like my research advisor telling me how nice being published in a decentish journal is, and I'm just like *maybe in 2010 but its just so sad that everyone is now D:* Like obviously it's cool and way more genuine than \"signing up for a class and getting it on your transcript GG EZ HARVARD\", but it's just sad to hear and hurts me on the inside.\n\nWhat people need to realize, is that yes things can look \\*good\\*, but *if everyone has something, it makes it NOT a differentiator*, so stop saying \"make you stand out from the rest of the applications\".\n\nI'm not going be naive, I literally would not do 99% of what I do if it wasn't hard college simping, and I know thats the same for the vast majority of the people here, but if people just keep capitalizing on this ugh. its just awful to listen too and hear. It's to the point where even hearing \"it'll help you stand out\" for things which are actually extremely unique and probably actually do help you stand out alot, feels wrong and annoying.\n\nsorry for the incoherent ranting, this just annoyed me so much.\n\n*But hats off to my homeroom teacher who told some guy \"why are you wearing a cal shirt your never going to get in no one gets in. (our schools a feeder tho lolll keeping expectations low)\" and always calls out the school's bs*",
