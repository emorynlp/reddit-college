  "title:": "[urgent] is it okay if I take LORs only from teachers at my old school(till grade 10)",
  "text": "no because of quarantine and my new highschool being extremely shitty there's no way I can get good LORs from my new highschool(11-12).\n\nI've been a good student but my new HS gave absolutely no scope for students to develop any sort of relationship with teachers or counselor. we barely even had classes, we alone know how difficult it was to do everything by ourselves and pass exams. \n\nteachers and the principal at my old school know me amazingly well and will be more than happy to write LORs for me. I am willing to explain this in the additional info. will it be fishy to colleges if I don't have any LORs from my recent highschool? I really want my application to be authentic\n\n\nplease help me out, thank you",

      "text": "Yes, your high school years are from 9th to 12th grade. So, you can ask for LoRs from your 9th or 10th teachers. And, I read somewhere that colleges themselves (yeah, I read at one of the MITs blogs) recommend students to do whatever they think is the best.",

              "text": "yeah, they used to say that 11th and 12th are better but since it's the pandemic times and most of the classes were conducted online, student didn't get a chance to interact with teachers, so to get the best output, it's better to get one from the one who know you better (be it 9th or 10th)  \nYou can add the LoR of 11th and 12th teachers as well, an optional LoR. And, stress them to write about how you were able to interact with them online. Your behavior in online classes and stuff. This will help colleges know that you were not only good during pre-pandemic times but during pandemic as well.",

      "text": "I think that's probably fine, but maybe try to get more letters from your sophomore/year 10 teachers instead of your freshman teachers just so the information is a little more recent. I think a ton of people are getting rec letters from their sophomore teachers this college app season, and I think they'll be definitely be understanding about COVID. But maybe try to have other parts of your app that show involvement in your new school just to be safe",
