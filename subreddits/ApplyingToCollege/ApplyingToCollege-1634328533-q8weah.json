  "text": "Hi guys! Title there. I\u2019m .1 GPA point below the average admitted to this school I\u2019m applying to, and for my best chance of admission they would have to be more on the holistic side if I\u2019m being honest. That being said, only 2 letters of rec are required, but I can give them up to 4. Should I do this? I am by no means a bad student, I just come from a low income areas where opportunities are sparse. I am genuinely desperate to go to this school because they sent me a letter saying that I can potentially attend for free. So, any tips on how to better my chances will be appreciated! If you have any questions for me feel free to PM me.",
