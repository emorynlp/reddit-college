  "text": "I'm currently a senior, and want to apply to Cornell early decision. I really like the school and has one of the best CS programs in the country, among other things such as the campus. But, as an in-state Michigan resident, the U of M, which is also a very, very good school, is 3 times less expensive than Cornell, so I'm wondering if Cornell is really worth it. It is also important to say that my family can definitely afford Cornell, as they are pretty wealthy and already pay a couple dozen thousand a year for my sister's private middle school, which they'll stop paying after this year anyways. But I'm just curious about saving some money here.",
