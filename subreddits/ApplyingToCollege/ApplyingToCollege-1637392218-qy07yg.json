  "text": "Students who are from China or speak Chinese at home can start out in honors level Chinese classes. From 9th-11th they can do\n\nHonors Chinese 4, Honors Chinese 5, AP Chinese, so 3 weighted\n\nThen other people who do a completely new language can do something like Spanish 1, 2, 3.\n\nI think this is unfair what about you?\n\n(i did the chinese thing, its one of the main reasons why im in the top 3%, if i didnt do that it would probably be top 8-10%)",

Honors classes start at the second year, so everyone has had the opportunity to be in an honors foreign language class in the 9-12 grades that count for your HS GPA.\n\nThose who speak Chinese growing up and then take Chinese language and AP tests (or any language) aren\u2019t impressing admissions officers. They\u2019re not stupid.",
