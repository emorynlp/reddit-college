  "text": "i was told by my college counselor that i should not bother retaking the sat and apply test optional, but with the last few months i have been debating heavily if it will negatively impact my chances.\n\ni have a high gpa and a low sat, and i\u2019m really struggling on whether i should apply for the november sat with a fee. i\u2019m afraid that the score difference will make me look boosted.\n\ngpa weighted: 4.56\ngpa unweighted: 3.66\n\nsat: 1140, but i\u2019m debating on either retaking it or applying test optional for the fall 2022 applicants :/\n\nthanks in advance!!",
