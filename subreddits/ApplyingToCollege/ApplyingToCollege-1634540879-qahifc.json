  "text": "okay, so i've seen a lot of people advise against taking the sat/act multiple times because the chance it will improve ur score is low and its a waste of time + money. but to the juniors out there, if you are able to take the sat/act many times, DO IT!!\n\nmy psat score was no where near nmf. my math section was 640 and r & w section 650. i wasn't happy with these scores-- i felt that i could do much better, that i had scored better in practice and was convinced this was a fluke. so, when i took the sat a couple of months later with very minimal prep in between, i was surprised and disappointed at my scores: 770 math, 600 r & w. pretty big fluctuations with basically no change in my knowledge. now, i was determined to get my r & w score up. i mean, i'd gotten a 650 on the past, so i should be able to raise my r & w sat score too, hopefully. i took the sat for the second time, with the only prep being a couple of practice tests for the reading section and one of those 10 minute videos on how to improve your sat reading section score on youtube lol. anyway, i got my sat back from oct 2nd, and my r & w score improved 120 points from 600 to 720. 120 points without substantial prep. after taking the sat for the first time, i thought there was no way my score could actually help my app, but i'm glad i decided to sit another time.\n\nbasically, if you are able to take the sat/act another time, just do it. it's not a waste of time to spend 4 hours on a saturday morning when the possibility of raising your score is very real. these tests are random and scores fluctuate, so don't see a discouraging score and think that determines your abilities or intelligence.\n\ngood luck y'all :)",
