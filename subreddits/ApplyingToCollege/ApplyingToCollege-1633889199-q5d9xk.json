For example, you can graduate from the Kelley School of Business by attending IUPUI. It\u2019s probably the most confusing university ever. My second cousins live just outside Indianapolis so they like to rant about how long the name IUPUI is, and then I tell them about \u201cUniversity of Maryland University College\u201d which is now called UMGC.\n\nhttps://international.iupui.edu/admissions/academics.html\n\nThere\u2019s a photo on that website of what their diplomas look like.",
