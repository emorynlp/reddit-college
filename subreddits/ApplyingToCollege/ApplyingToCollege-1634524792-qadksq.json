  "text": "So my mom is obsessed with college prestige as most uneducated ones are, and she doesn\u2019t care how bad a school is for me as long as she gets to boast to her family friends about how \u201csmart\u201d i am. She acted shocked and disappointed when i told her i\u2019m not applying to MIT or Harvard when i know damn well i\u2019m not going to those schools nor do i want to. I\u2019m majoring in computer science and I found a really good school for me which is also a safety (UW Madison) and I would like to go there if i don\u2019t get accepted into ut austin or uiuc. For some reason she just hates the idea of me going to uw madison and says the environment there is messed up for some reason? Then i find out this reason is because she can\u2019t boast to her friends about the prestige because to her standards it\u2019s not prestigious even after i explained it\u2019s number 12 for computer science which is better than her beloved harvard and rice. She instead wants to keep me trapped near home and go to utd instead of uw madison if i don\u2019t get into any others she likes. How do i deal with this insanity",

You tell your mom that while you respect and appreciate her input you\u2019ve done the research, talked to your college advisor and know in your gut that Madison is the right school for you. \n\nYou need to live your life. Trust your intuition. Your mom no doubt means well and equates T10 with the best education and thus wants whats best for you. Reassure her that you\u2019ve done your due diligence.",

For example I\u2019m in illinois, they\u2019ll admit more kids from here than texas because all the schools have sent kids to UW Madison before so they\u2019re more likely to go statistically",
