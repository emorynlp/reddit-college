      "text": "I really don't see a problem with it as long as it is well written and thought out. \n\nAt first, I wanted to write my essay on being forgotten, memories, and summertime feels. I just couldn't get everything that I wanted out. I decided to go with an essay talking about how moving 40 minutes away from my old house caused me to lose my friends, families, and happy memories in 3 years along with how I developed and grew from it. While it wasn't my first choice, it did include a good amount of stuff from my first idea. \n\nYour idea should like a good topic because it brings interest and personalization that I wish my essay had more of.  \n\nIf I could take about one of my future dreams (an open-world Naruto game haha) it would not only be practically a book but they wouldn't understand it at all. I'm sure you can really nail it down.",
