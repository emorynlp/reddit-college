  "text": "My common app essay is about a hobby that I've had for a while. It also happens to be the reason why I am interested in the field I am applying to. Should I talk about this same hobby in the supplemental essays that ask how I developed the intellectual curiosity for what I want to study as well, or is that too much about one topic?",

Or, find some way to incorporate another aspect of you into your personal statement and lessen the amount of time spent talking about that one hobby maybe? Without knowing exact specifics I can't be totally sure what would work.",
