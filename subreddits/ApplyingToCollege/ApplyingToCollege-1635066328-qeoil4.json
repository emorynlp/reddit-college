  "text": "So I\u2019m submitting a dance portfolio for schools that offer it because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing for all my life and I basically have a video montage with clips of me dancing from 2010 to now\u2026 the only problem is that the audio is sorta harsh, I don\u2019t want the AOs to have an unpleasant time having to listen to it, but I\u2019m also not sure whether I should mute it and put another song or something. \n\nIg it\u2019s helpful to mention that I do kathak which is an Indian dance and the music along w the anklets we wear tend to make the entire audio really loud, and also the videos are stage performances. But not including the audio may get rid of the entire essence of me doing kathak, especially keeping track of beats and stuff. Im already sending 2 other videos but I really want to include like a growth montage thing\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think I should do? I\u2019ve already reduced the volume by 50% and it still feels loud. Any suggestions?",
