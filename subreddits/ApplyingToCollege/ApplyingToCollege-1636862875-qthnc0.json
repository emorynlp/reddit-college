  "text": "1. Do Honors students get first priority for class enrollment, dorms etc.? \n2. Does applying for the Honors program hurt my chances or have any downside? \n3. After graduation, how much of a difference does graduating with Honors make? \n4. People who have graduated with honors, what is it like? How hard is it to actually get a 4.0 with honors? \n5. Is there any way to join the Honors Program after enrollment?",

Making connections with faculty that were facilitated by your being in the honors program could be meaningful.\n\n\\#4: Shouldn't be much harder to get a 4.0.  On the other hand, statistically speaking, you probably won't get a 4.0 anyway.\n\n\\#5: Depends on the school, and potentially on the particular honors program at that school (some have multiple different programs).",
