      "text": "It depends on sooo many other factors but think about it in terms of what a top college looks for for their self interest. They want kids who are intellectually deep/knowledgeable and societally impactful to bring merit and prestige to their name when that kid goes and does something incredible. There\u2019s no one way to accomplish that but in general if you can show that you want to positively impact the world and have already pursued that, that\u2019s the largest thing",
