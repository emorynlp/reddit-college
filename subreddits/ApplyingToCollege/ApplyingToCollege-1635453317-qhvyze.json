  "text": "I currently live in McKinney Texas, and I'm a junior with 3.8 GPA, and I am shooting for UT Austin with enough time. Because I was homeschooled in Asia for seven years, my credits were not accepting and I spent months retaking freshman, sophomore, and junior year, but they still put me a year behind, as a junior.  I was only given the chance AP class, and while I have a hundred in it, they must've screwed up my transcript because my weighted is lower than my unweighted :/. My current plan is to get a bachelors in nursing. From the information that I've gathered, I have a few options:\n\n 1. Apply to a non-competitive community college with high acceptance rates\n\n 1a. stay for 2 years, then apply for a more competitive college to finish my 4 year major \n\n 1b. stay for 4 years and complete my major\n\n 2. Bust my ass off in senior year with as many APs and dual-credits as I can possibly manage, and shoot for a very competitive college like U.T.\n\n2a question. will they care that I am a year behind and took senior year to apply?\n\nI am willing to work hard to achieve the best possible outcome, but right now I am so illiterate in the pros and cons of different colleges, so it would really be amazing to see if anyone could tell me what's the best effort-put-in to results-shown to my specific needs. Thanks so much!",

      "text": "As a fellow Texan student, I can tell you now that a LOT of texas kids who apply to UT Austin that do not qualify for automatic admission usually end up getting capped (having to go to another University of Texas school with guaranteed transfer to UT Austin after some time). At the same time, if you have great scores and essays, letter of recs and all that and really explain your whole situation, then you MAY be able to get in. I think ppl need more info before giving you advice on what you should do like why do you want to go to UT Austin in the first place?",

              "text": "Well if you want to major in nursing, I\u2019d take a look at Texas A&M, UNT, Texas Tech, University of Houston, and Texas Christian University as I\u2019ve heard they had some pretty solid nursing programs! There\u2019s probably other great schools out there for nursing as well, those are just some that came to mind. Just really explain your situation in the special circumstances box during applications wherever you apply because it\u2019ll provide a lot of context into your circumstances",
