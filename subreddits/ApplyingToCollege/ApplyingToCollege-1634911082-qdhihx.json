      "text": "A few additional thoughts: understand the difference between a full ride merit scholarship (merit scholarship that includes tuition, room, and board) and need-based financial aid at colleges that meet full need, according to their need calculations. These colleges tend to be extremely competitive. Keep in mind that acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\nFor merit scholarships, you would want to look at less selective schools. True full ride scholarships may be harder to find than scholarships approaching full tuition. Schools that offer large automatic scholarships may have charts or calculators that show the levels of merit scholarships for different levels of stats.",
