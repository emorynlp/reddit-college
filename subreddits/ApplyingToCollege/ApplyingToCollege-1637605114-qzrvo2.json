  "text": "Hi, I have Cs in two college courses (none in high school), one of which was taken the summer after 8th grade.  I have  reasons for both (health issues for one, serious family emergency the second), which I'm going to list in the additional information section.  How much will this impact my application, and will they consider the class taken after 8th grade since I wasn't in high school yet?  Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: The first class was an algebra based physics course, I later took AP Physics C Mechanics and got an A both semesters and a 5 on the exam, I'm taking AP Physics C E&M and am projected to get an A.  The second class was linear algebra, which I retook and got an A.  Does retaking/taking similar classes and doing well in them help at all?",
