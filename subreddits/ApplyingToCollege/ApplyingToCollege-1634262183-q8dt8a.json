  "text": "This is killing me; \n\nI'm a hobbyist video creator. I love creating and editing YouTube videos + tiktoks, it provides a solid creative outlet. I spend a lot of time and thought on these videos, and they probably have amassed \\~3hrs a week during high school as on average - a fairly big EC. Though, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable sharing any of these vids with an admissions officer - I basically haven't told anyone even in my closest circles. The TikToks are really not the type I'd want to share with a potential college, although the account does have like 10k followers and a video with almost 10mil views so that could be impressive? \n\nI'm applying for computer science so it helps to drill in the fact that I like working with computers and do it on my spare time often - I barely have any other ECs relating to computers so this would be pretty important.\n\nAny advice? ??!",
