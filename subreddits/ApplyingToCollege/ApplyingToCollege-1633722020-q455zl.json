  "text": "Hello Seniors (and Parents who love them),\n\nHappy October! Not only does October mean stressing about getting in early admissions applications, midterms, and Halloween, it\u2019s also the beginning of Financial Aid Season.\n\nIn order to receive need-based aid from colleges (and merit-based depending on the college), you will need to fill out the FAFSA. At some schools, you may also be required to fill out the CSS Profile. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get any aid, you should still fill these out. In this post, I\u2019ll be going over the basics of the FAFSA and CSS Profile.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with some College-Admission- Financial-Aid Alphabet Soup**\n\n[**FAFSA:** ](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)Free Application for Federal Student Aid\n\n[**FSA ID:** ](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm)Federal Student Aid ID\n\n[**CSS Profile:**](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/) College Scholarship Service\n\n[**TASFA:** ](http://www.collegeforalltexans.com/index.cfm?objectid=A3119543-CBF8-C202-F1B0EEFD5F4B9805)Texas Application for State Financial Aid (for non-US citizens)\n\n[**SAR:** ](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/review-and-correct/review)Student Aid Report\n\n**NPC:** Net Price Calculator (use the college-specific net price calculators on their websites to determine your predicted cost)\n\n[**IDOC:** ](https://pages.collegeboard.org/idoc)Institutional Documentation Service (For CSS profile)\n\n**EFC:** Expected Financial Contribution\n\n**COA:** Cost of Attendance\n\n**Need-Based Aid:** aid awarded after filing FAFSA and CSS Profile (if required)\n\n**Merit Aid:** awarded based on merit, not financial need\n\n**Loans:** Money that will need to be paid back in the form of a subsidized or private loan\n\n**Grants:** also called Gift Aid (no need to pay back as a loan)\n\n# What do I need to fill out the FAFSA?\n\nIn order to fill out the FAFSA, you\u2019re going to need some documents. Make sure to gather the following before filling out the FAFSA:\n\n* Social security numbers of both yourself and your parents (or alien registration number if you\u2019re not a U.S. citizen)\n* Driver\u2019s license number (if you have one)\n* Federal tax information or tax returns for you and for your parents if you are a dependent student\n* Foreign tax returns (if applicable)\n* Records of assets, Bank statements, and records of investments (if applicable)\n* Records of untaxed income (if applicable)\n* An FSA ID to sign electronically. -- Do NOT create an FSA account on behalf of someone else. That means parents should not create FSA accounts for their children and vice versa. Doing so may result in issues signing and submitting the FAFSA form and could lead to financial aid delays. (Also, it\u2019s against the rules to create an FSA account for someone else.)\n* List of colleges you\u2019re considering. You can list up to 10 when you first fill out the FAFSA. Once a school has listed that they\u2019ve received your FAFSA, you may remove them from your list and replace them with a new school.\n\n# Who completes the FAFSA and/or CSS?\n\nFAFSA: If you are a dependent student and a U.S. citizen, you will need to give some information about your parents along with your own on the FAFSA. If your parents are married or live together, answer the questions about both of them. If your parents are divorced or separated and *don\u2019t* live together, answer using the parent you lived with more during the past 12 months. If you lived the same amount of time with both parents, give answers about the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12 months or during the most recent 12 months, you received support from a parent.\n\nIf you\u2019re an independent student and a U.S. citizen, you only need to report your own information and your spouse\u2019s (if you\u2019re married). For more information on what type of student you qualify as, check out [this link](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency) for the FAFSA.\n\nCSS Profile: Dependent students, regardless of if they\u2019re U.S. citizens, must complete the CSS Profile if their school requires it. If your parents are married\u2014or live together even if they\u2019re not married\u2014answer the questions about both of them, whether they\u2019re the same or opposite sex. If your parents are divorced or separated and *don\u2019t* live together, [some colleges ](https://profile.collegeboard.org/profile/ppi/participatingInstitutions.aspx)will require that both the custodial and [non-custodial parent ](https://www.proprofs.com/training/course/?title=completing-the-css-profile-for-noncustodial-parent_5f4e96f16e6a3)fill out the profile. Independent students must also fill out the CSS Profile.\n\n# What types of aid can I receive?\n\nAfter filling out the FAFSA or CSS, you may be eligible for the following types of aid:\n\n* **Grants:** Grants can be based on financial need (need-based) or academic merit (merit-based) and can come from the federal government, the state government, or from the college/university. Unlike loans, grants generally do not need to be paid back.\n* **Loans: Federal Loans** offer the lowest interest rates and are both **subsidized** (interest covered by the government while in college) and **unsubsidized** (interest builds). **Private Loans** depend on credit history. Parents can also take out [Parent-Plus Loans](https://www.edvisors.com/college-loans/federal/parent-plus/introduction-to-federal-parent-plus-loans/). Private loans tend to have higher interest rates compared to federal loans, so try to use your federal loans before resorting to private loans.\n* **Work-Study:** Work-study can be done on campus or off. Students must indicate their interest on the FAFSA. Just because you\u2019re awarded federal work-study doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get a job, so make sure to be diligent so you can secure one!\n\nYou will also receive your expected family contribution (EFC). EFC is a six-digit number that represents how much money your family is expected to contribute to the cost of your college education. Schools will consider your EFC when calculating your financial aid package. Your EFC may differ between the FAFSA and the CSS Profile.\n\n# What about other types of aid?\n\n* **Scholarships:** Students and families should not pay for scholarship services, but they should look into local scholarships. Outside scholarships can add up, but they can be a lot of work. Similar to grants, scholarships don\u2019t need to be paid back. But also, be aware that some colleges will reduce your financial aid if you bring in outside scholarships.  So before you spend a lot of time looking for scholarships, make sure your colleges don\u2019t do that.\n\nIn my college counseling groups, I\u2019ve heard people mention the following websites, but I\u2019ve never explored or used any of them:  [RaiseMe](https://www.raise.me/),  [Unigo](https://www.unigo.com/), [Cappex](https://www.cappex.com/), [Merit More](https://meritmore.com/?fbclid=IwAR1ETRly4KkYbU_-y2ToTuJ0fLgrocfmCjodVTcqDQ1Z2pU8aL1XJ6Uj3Ps), [Tuition Fit](https://tuitionfit.org/), [Going Merry](https://www.goingmerry.com/), [College Express](https://www.collegexpress.com/scholarships/search), [www.CollegeScholarships.com](http://www.collegescholarships.com/), [Fast Web](http://www.fastweb.com/), [College Raptor](https://www.collegeraptor.com/?fbclid=IwAR3PaykhTrpmtiMF274N7TgSftaTITVQSxzAzizvWf5HzsTMikSKq3ULyV8)\n\n# How do I create an FSA ID to make my FAFSA account?\n\n* Visit [https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account).\n* You\u2019ll need a Social Security number, full name, and date of birth.\n* You\u2019ll also need to create a memorable username and password\n* You\u2019ll be required to provide either your email address or your mobile phone number when you make your FSA ID.\n\n**Important:** A Social Security number, email address, and mobile phone number can only be associated with one FSA ID. If you share an email address with someone else, then only one of you will be able to use that email address to create an FSA ID. Go to [https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/creating-using-fsaid.pdf](https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/creating-using-fsaid.pdf) to find more info.\n\n# How do I create a CSS Profile Account?\n\nTo create an account: Use your College Board username and password if you have one or sign up for a new account. If you created an account for the SAT or to view your PSAT or AP scores, you should use the same username and password for your CSS Profile application. [https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/pdf/css-profile-student-guide.pdf](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/pdf/css-profile-student-guide.pdf)\n\nYour first CSS application costs $25, with additional applications priced at $16. However, if your family income is under $100,000 or you\u2019ve qualified for an SAT fee waiver, then the CSS Profile is free.\n\n# What do I need to fill out the CSS Profile?\n\nTo fill out the CSS Profile, you\u2019ll need the following documents:\n\n* Last year\u2019s tax returns\n* W-2s and income records from both this year and last year\n* Records of untaxed income for this year and last year\n* Bank statements\n* Mortgage info\n* Records of savings, stocks, bonds, and trusts\n* Info on small businesses and other assets\n\n# What\u2019s the difference between the FAFSA and the CSS Profile?\n\nWhile the federal government\u2019s FAFSA program is universal for schools in the U.S., College Board\u2019s CSS Profile isn\u2019t required by all schools (although hundreds use it). Schools are able to customize the CSS Profile, allowing them to gain a different understanding of your financial situation. The CSS Profile also costs money while the FAFSA is free.\n\n# What does Verification mean?\n\nIf you\u2019re flagged for verification, then you need to supply the requested documents. Many schools verify everyone and some do it at random. There are some red flags like incomplete or contradictory data and inconsistent taxes and exemptions. Go to [How to Review and Correct Your FAFSA\u00ae Application](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/review-and-correct) for more info. Be sure to stay in contact with the financial aid offices and respond quickly. Ask for help if you need it \u2014 you don\u2019t want to miss out on valuable aid.\n\n**Documents you might need to provide for FAFSA or IDOC verification:** income tax forms, W-2 statements, and 1099 forms, IRA deductions, untaxed IRA distributions and pensions, food stamps, number in household.\n\n# What\u2019s the difference between need-blind and need-aware schools?\n\nNeed-blind schools will not consider your finances when choosing whether or not they\u2019d like to admit you to their school. Need-aware schools will consider your finances. For international students, only five schools are both need-blind and meet full need for international students: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst. Georgetown and ~~Cornell~~ (Edit -- strike through because I was corrected by u/VRTheDerp in the comments) are also need-blind for international students, but they don\u2019t meet full need of all students. (However, don\u2019t limit yourself to these need-blind schools if you\u2019re looking for aid. Definitely apply to a wide range of colleges because many will offer substantial merit aid.)\n\n# How do I  compare financial aid award letters?\n\n1. Here\u2019s a [SAMPLE College Aid Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1O0aifNPW7Ro6pEN6n7Ua5Og-C6_Fe1PKHB7d7jXQLQM/edit)\n2. **Find the cost of attendance.** If it doesn\u2019t say on the offer from the college, contact the financial aid office. Make sure it includes both direct costs (tuition and fees) and indirect costs (living expenses, books, supplies, transportation).\n3. **Subtract the grant and scholarship amounts** from the cost of attendance.\n4. **The remainder** is your net cost or what you\u2019ll have to pay (either out of pocket or through loans).\n5. **Compare** the net costs for each school.\n\nGo to [https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/comparing-aid-offers](https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/comparing-aid-offers)) to get more info and details.\n\n# How do I do a Financial Aid Appeal?\n\nIf your financial award doesn\u2019t fit what you need to be able to attend a college, don\u2019t give up if it\u2019s a college you\u2019d really like to attend. It\u2019s always ok to appeal and see if it can work out for you. The worst thing that can happen is you won\u2019t get more aid and you\u2019re exactly where you are after the initial financial aid letter. But, I\u2019ve shared the following resources and heard back with many students over the years who\u2019ve successfully appealed their financial aid awards, so I definitely think it\u2019s worth the effort for colleges you\u2019d truly love to attend. Just, as always in college admissions, hope for the best, but expect the worst.\n\n[FormSwift](https://formswift.com/swift-student), [Merit More](https://meritmore.com/compare_offer_and_appeal_letter),  [New York Times article from April 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/your-money/financial-aid-offers-college.html)\n\n[Comment on r/A2C from u/a12435 about financial aid appeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nmybct/financial_aid_appeal/gzrehbb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAlso, [College Essay Guy has a great resource about how to write the financial aid appeal letter](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/financial-aid-appeal-letter)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Whew! That\u2019s a lot of information.** Look,  I\u2019m not even close to a  specialist in financial aid, so I hope that some of our many financial aid wizards will correct me or add on where I\u2019ve missed.  I just like to collect resources and share them!  \n\nNo doubt you will still have lots of questions. Edited to add: Be sure to check out u/BrawnyAcolyte's comment below where they remind you that \"Almost any question you have about filling out the FAFSA is answered somewhere on [https://studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) .\"\n\n# Where do I find more resources and information?\n\n[Financial Aid Resources Presentation/AdmissionsMom's Advice ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IspxZkXycyIG7-fApoLtPA49nzQemxZi/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[About Financial Aid Presentation/AdmissionsMom\u2019s Advice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xJZXCDu7sNeybagapViR1GkZueX62Qdl/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Merit Scholarship/Financial Aid Folder of College Lists and Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O0aifNPW7Ro6pEN6n7Ua5Og-C6_Fe1PKHB7d7jXQLQM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# What\u2019s the tl;dr?\n\n* Financial Aid season is upon us, so it\u2019s time to get moving on your FAFSA and CSS profiles (where appropriate for you)\n* There are tons of resources available to you, so be sure to do your research.\n* Get your parents involved.\n* Act early, because sometimes for some rolling admissions schools the earlier you act, the more aid you\u2019re likely to receive\n* Don\u2019t hesitate to appeal if the aid doesn\u2019t work for you and it\u2019s a school you want to attend but there\u2019s no way you can at the amount you\u2019ve been awarded.",

Your parents aren't US citizens so they don't have a SSN? You live overseas and your family income isn't in dollars?

      "text": "I've read everything I can on CSS and divorced parents.  Has anyone had any experience with making an appeal to leave off the non-custodial parent from the CSS profile when the student has not had contact with them since 9th grade?  The non-custodial parent does pay the state mandated child support, but that's it.  There is not, and has never been, any contributions to extracurriculars over the years or any funds for student's tuition, etc., only the court ordered child support payments.  I have also had sole custody for over 10 years.\n\nUsing the net price calculators, we *can* make this work if it's based on just me (the custodial parent), but as the non-custodial parent is well off, their income and assets would eliminate any tuition adjustments we would merit on our own.\n\nI know that the obvious answer is \"just apply to FAFSA schools,\" but my student is striving for  selective small liberal arts colleges and between myself and grandparents - we can make this work if there's just a bit of adjustment.",

Not sure how to get a list of those or if it\u2019s just by researching school by school. \n\nAlso maybe look at some of the public liberal arts colleges like Fort Lewis College, college of Charleston, St Mary\u2019s College of Maryland, the college of New Jersey, new college of Florida,\nTruman State, U of Mary Washington, and UNC Asheville",

              "text": "Yes - it's tricky, each college on my student's list is a dual parents CSS school; the College Board has a list of \"no\" non-custodial on their website, but not infrequently the school's own financial aid website will contradict that or they will have a separate form for the non-custodial that is just not the CSS form, but still asks for their income and assets.\n\n(Thank you for the school suggestions!  We are in the PNW so we're looking at  West Coast schools and going as \"far east\" as the Minnesota/Iowa schools; that makes us a little provincial but for \"reasons,\" it's the right fit.  Currently it's first choice Carleton, and 2nd Macalester, followed by Reed, Grinnell, St. Olaf, Whitman, Lewis & Clark)",

No AP classes offered, but takes \"honors\" option in all available classes which involves extra work and rigor but doesn't give them a full 5.0 scale).",
