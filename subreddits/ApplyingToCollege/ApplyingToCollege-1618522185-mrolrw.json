  "text": "About 3 months ago, my classmate and teammate passed away due to an accidental fentanyl overdose. Today, I found out he was admitted to UCLA, Davis, and more. He was so smart and I know we would have gone on to do amazing things. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThat being said, if you are currently struggling with any sort of substance abuse, know that there are always people there for you. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\nEdit: I was also happy to hear the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at UC speak about how vibrant and personal his essays were as well as share his condolences.",

That, as in this story, could be laced with or mixed with anything. It could also be a different strength than what is implied, or a completely different drug altogether. It is beyond not worth it.\n\nMy career directly deals with the subject, so I feel passionately about expressing the fact that people should not *under any circumstances* take anything in pill form that they did not personally pick up from the pharmacy themselves.",
