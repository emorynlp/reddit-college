  "text": "Does the amount of aid required matter or is it just the fact if you're applying for aid or not?? I'm EDing to Cornell Engineering as an international and I need minimal aid. I want to know if I should just apply without aid and if that exponentially increases my chances..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",
