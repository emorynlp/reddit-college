  "text": "guys im an international student, and i\u2019m applying for the class of 22. now the problem is that my dad feels that my application is amazing and he has made me add like 20 schools out of which 17 are so so difficult to get into. even the other 3 aren\u2019t safeties. idk what to do. i did stanford rea but i feel my application is just ok (definitely not the best) because i have low grades in my freshman year and grades ranging from 90-93% in sophomore junior and senior year. my ECs are the only good thing on my application, but i don\u2019t think they\u2019re enough (for schools i have added)",

This way, even if you strike out at all the reach schools your dad is making you add, you'll still have options.\n2. Give up on your dream of attending undergrad abroad, go to school in your home country, then try again if/when you apply to graduate school.",
