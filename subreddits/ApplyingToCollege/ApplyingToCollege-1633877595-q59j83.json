  "text": "intro, i\u2019m 15f, with the highest british grades possible (all 9s), and i want to work for NASA, which requires american citizenship. Assuming i continue on with top grades and get the qualifications to join an ivy league college, would it be obnoxiously difficult to move from the Uk to the US? what kinds of barriers are there? insurance? how does the system work in terms of government loans and accommodation?",

      "text": "Working for NASA absolutely does not require you to be a US Citizen. UK citizenship will not be a barrier to working in the civilian US aerospace industry. Obviously that may be different if you end up working on the defense side, but as a UK national there will be many opportunities to work in the European defense industry.\n\nSource: worked at NASA with *many* foreign nationals.\n\nEdit: to study in the US, you need a student visa, which does not lead to permanent immigration status. If you're serious about immigrating to the US, you need to speak to an immigration lawyer. No one on this sub is qualified to give you immigration advice.",

              "text": "There is no uniform citizenship requirements for NASA employment. If you go to the careers page, or look on USAJOBS (the US government hiring platform) you can see what the requirements are for individual positions. Some jobs do require US citizenship, and all will require you to pass a background check. Many NASA employees are also contractors with private companies or universities, and those largely do not have citizenship requirements. It really depends where your ultimate career goals are, but trust me when I say that having UK citizenship is not something you need to be concerned about. \n\nIf you graduate with a STEM degree from a US or UK institution, you'll have plenty of opportunities to pursue a position at NASA either in the US or in Europe. If I were you, I wouldn't write off ESA either, the Europeans do things that are just as amazing as what the US does. As a college student, you can also plan to study abroad or apply for internships with NASA or affiliated university labs in the US. That might be a good way to get some experience and learn more about what the process would look like to get a permanent position, even if you study in the UK. \n\nIt's much more important right now that you focus on being successful in your coursework. Trust me when I say that if you do that, you'll have the opportunity to live and work where you want. Immigration isn't easy, but science and aerospace is very international and there are plenty of opportunities around once you have a STEM degree.",

                  "text": "the requirement that i\u2019m referring to is becoming an astronaut. i wanna be one of the first women who go to the moon. i have pretty big dreams but i think they\u2019re totally achievable with the grades and past experiences i have. assuming that being an astronaut with NASA does require american citizenship, and its really expensive and complicated, i may have to go with ESA because i don\u2019t have the most privileged background. I don\u2019t see ESA as a downgrade, they\u2019re amazing, it just feels like a bit of a betrayal to my childhood dreams so NASA would be preferred. \n\ni was also considering applying for dual citizenship. Maybe i\u2019ll study in the UK where government loans aren\u2019t so complicated, then reside in america. I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\n\nyeah for now i\u2019m going to focus on my coursework, i can worry about this in maybe 2 or 3 years instead. Thank you so much for your comments!! i really admire you, as someone who worked at NASA",
