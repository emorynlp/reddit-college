  "text": "My parents are upper middle class/ (both work in faang), and are incredibly well off. I don't want to take their money however, so as to not burden them and be indebted to then. How will this affect my chances? I'll be sending in their income, but I'll still be applying for financial aid. \n\nI think I can get into an Ivy and most uc's if that helps in any way (Ik ivy's give some good aid).",

      "text": "Most top schools use a need-based aid system, so you likely won't qualify for much. Usually the breakdown is something like this: \n\n-family income under $65k, full tuition + room & board covered\n\n-family income under $130k, full tuition covered\n\n-family income under $260k, half tuition covered \n\nKeep in mind, though, even if your parents make less than $260k together, half tuition at an Ivy or T20 is usually going to be more than full tuition at a state school. If you truly want to save your parents money, your cheapest option (without the complication of transferring) would be to go to a state school where you could probably get at least half tuition covered through GPA- or ACT/SAT-based merit aid. \n\nKeep in mind, though, your parents worked hard for a reason. They can't take money with them into the afterlife, so the only reasons to have such great jobs are retirement and their children. If they work at FAANG, they probably went to pretty good colleges, and likely will be more than happy to pay for you to follow in their footsteps by attending a great university. I very much doubt they would consider paying for your education a burden. Even if they for some reason do, it's one of the responsibilities of parenthood.\n\nAlso consider your privilege; I know cheaper is better, but the wealth and educational attainment of your family gives you an inherent advantage in just about everything (quality of school district, standardized test scores, even your drive to succeed). I don't mean to suggest that you don't deserve financial aid, I just wish to shed light on the fact that by fighting for your own financial aid you could be receiving money that might have otherwise gone to a student who had none of those advantages and whose parents couldn't pay for their college if they wanted to. Always do what is best for you and your family, and if your parents have been hit hard by COVID, have no savings, or are reluctant to pay for your college, you're perfectly justified in seeking financial aid. I just want you to be aware that for some people, financial aid is the difference between going to college and working a wage job for the rest of their life, not just a way to try to keep their parents from paying for tuition they could afford.",

You will still be evaluated individually.",

      "text": "you have very good intentions and a sense of gratitude but honestly if they want to pay for your schooling then just accept it in stride. they worked to earn a comfortable life for the family, that was the whole point of them entering high powered careers. if you're so inclined then you can pay them back down the line (this is what i'm planning on doing)\n\nyour biggest shot isn't need-based financial aid, more like merit aid when it comes to getting money. you can also always go to community college and transfer to a UC after two years if money is of paramount concern.\n\nalso consider things such as taking community college gen eds over the summer to knock out UC gen ed requirements and/or taking heavier schools so you can graduate a semester or quarter (or even year) early, working as a research assistant or a student job in school, etc",

And most importantly i believe that if you can pay the tution then you should not apply for aid, as most prestigious unis are need aware, so they\u2019ll only give aid according to your parents income and thus it may hurt your chances of getting in and also i fell that there are other students who need the aid more than you, and as the resources are limited, so it may hurt their chances of getting in. But that\u2019s totally upto you :))",

Run the net price calculator on the colleges so you can idea, but with FAANG parents, your expected family contribution will prob be $100k/yr!\n\nUC has some merit but you\u2019re best off trying to find merit with local community. Check w/ school counselor when they get announced. With grades and course rigor, you may qualify for merit via regents. UC Davis is the biggest purse with about $8k/yr x 4 yrs. the other ones may not be as high. Some have scholarships you automatically qualify for but not sure who gets them. UCLA has an alum scholarship which is by invitation. You have to write an essay. My son was invited but didn\u2019t even get into UCLA, so that was a total waste of time.",
