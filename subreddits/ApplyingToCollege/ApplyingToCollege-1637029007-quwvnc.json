  "text": "Do you have limited time but multiple essays to write? If so, a good solution is to reuse supplemental essays you\u2019ve already written. Continue to read on below to find out how! We\u2019ve summarized how to reuse 5 supplemental essay prompts.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Tell me which schools you are applying to, then I will suggest the best strategy for choosing the prompts and recycling the essays!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. Why Recycling?\n\nWhy should you recycle supplemental essays? The answer has already been given to you. During college applications, you\u2019ll be applying to multiple colleges. They\u2019ll each require their own prompts for supplemental essays. If you write a separate essay for each prompt, the quality of the essays can be compromised because of the time limit. However, if you look closely, you\u2019ll be able to see the prompts of each college are quite similar to each other.\n\nThat\u2019s right - although the wordings will make the prompts look differently, what they\u2019re asking of students may be virtually the same. Some common college prompts are the ones that ask for how you contributed to a community or pursued an academic interest. Therefore, what you should do is reuse supplemental essays with identical topics to save time and increase the quality of your essays.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Why you shouldn\u2019t copy & paste the whole essay\u00a0\n\nHowever, recycling essays definitely does not mean copy and pasting the whole essay. There are two significant issues with this. First, a few word choices can completely get rid of your chances of being accepted. For example, did you mention a university name in your essay?\u00a0\n\nAnother issue is that although some prompts may look similar, they will require different structures or points. Let\u2019s say two colleges asked why you chose English Literature as the major you\u2019re applying to. Even though the prompts are the same,\u00a0 the curriculums of the two colleges may be different. So you have to do research on each college\u2019s English Literature curriculum, and incorporate them in your essays.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. How to recycle supplemental essays\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u201cWhy this major\u201d essay**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the essay prompt we mentioned above. How should you recycle \u201cwhy this major\u201d essays? First, read through the essay and summarize the events that made you interested in the major. These are the key points you can recycle! However, the points you made about how you want to continue to explore this major should be different. Each college\u2019s curriculums for majors are different. Research these different aspects and incorporate them in your essay.\u00a0\n\nBut don\u2019t feel the need to differentiate your career plan. Keep your career goals, but modify how you want to pursue this goal in college based on the activities and classes different colleges offer.\n\n**Key points to include:**\u00a0 Events that made you interested in the major\n\n**Refinement tips:** Research on colleges\u2019 curriculums and incorporate them in your essay\n\n**Example**: Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u201cWhy us\u201d essay**\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie - \u201cwhy us\u201d essays are a tricky prompt to recycle. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible! First, read the \u201cwhy us\u201d prompt you wrote and summarize the points you made about how the college you\u2019re applying to is different from other colleges. This can be anything from academic curriculums to cultures. Next, compare these characteristics to those of another college you\u2019re applying to. Are there any identical or similar cultures or courses? Do both colleges have a residential colleges system or a core curriculum? These are the points you can recycle! But make sure you modify the specific names of college systems.\n\nHowever, the colleges you\u2019re applying to may not be identical in any way. In this case, you won\u2019t be able to recycle huge chunks of the essay you wrote. But you can incorporate details such as a career path you want to pursue!\u00a0\n\n**Key points to include:**\u00a0 Identical characteristics of colleges\n\n**Refinement tips:** Modify names of college systems (ex: Dartmouth\u2019s D-Plan)\n\n**Example**: Why are you interested in attending Columbia University? We encourage you to consider the aspect(s) that you find unique and compelling about Columbia. (Columbia University)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u201cCommunity engagement\u201d essay**\n\n\u201cCommunity engagement\u201d essays are the prompts that ask you to elaborate on how you plan to contribute to diversity. In this case, read the \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d essay you wrote and summarize how you influenced a community you were part of. These are the key points you can recycle!\n\nHowever, you have to differentiate your essay from now on. The colleges you\u2019re applying to probably have different visions and characteristics. Choose a quality of yourself in the story that is related to the college you\u2019re applying to and connect the two. This is the part where you have to write new paragraphs. For example, one college might want students that are invested in giving back to others. But another college you\u2019re applying to may be more interested in students who engage in social issues they\u2019re passionate about. So, modify the qualities you derived from your experience based on the college!\u00a0\n\n**Key points to include:**\u00a0 How you influenced a community\u00a0\n\n**Refinement tips:** Modify the parts where you connected yourself to the college you\u2019re applying to\n\n**Example**:  What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? (University of California)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u201cOriginality\u201d essay**\n\n\u201cOriginality\u201d essays are the prompts that ask you to discuss how you are different from other candidates. Read the essay you wrote and summarize the paragraphs where you talked about what made you the person you are now. You can use these points to reconstruct a consistent story that you want to tell the college you\u2019re applying to. What is a key message you want admissions officers to take away from your essay? Based on this message, modify the points or structures of the essay. However, if the points you made in the original essay are not at all related to a quality of yourself that you want to write about, you won\u2019t be able to reuse it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Key points to include:** What made you the person you are today?\n\n**Refinement tips:** Modify the points you made about a quality of yourself that you want to convey to the college you\u2019re applying to.\u00a0\n\n**Example**: Harvard has long recognized the importance of student body diversity of all kinds. We welcome you to write about distinctive aspects of your background, personal development or the intellectual interests you might bring to your Harvard classmates. (Harvard University)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u201cIntellectual passion\u201d essay**\n\n\u201cIntellectual passion\u201d essays are the prompts that ask you to elaborate on how you utilized your critical thinking skills. Summarize the paragraphs where you broke down the thought processes of when you questioned something mundane. Think about an aspect of yourself that you want to convey to each individual college. Connect that quality to the experience you wrote about in the original essay!\u00a0\n\n**Key points to include:** The thought processes you went through when you questioned something\u00a0\n\n**Refinement tips:** Modify the parts where you talked about a quality of yourself that can be derived from the experience\u00a0\n\n**Example**: Tell us about a life situation, media story, or topic \u2013 beyond or outside of a classroom or formal assignment \u2013 that has captivated you, inspired your curiosity, and led you to delve more deeply into learning about a subject on your own. (California Institute of Technology)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\n* Recycle to save time and increase the quality of your essays!\n* Don\u2019t copy & paste the entire essay\n* Modify the specific names of colleges\u2019 courses or systems you mentioned\n* Differentiate the points you made that are connected to the qualities of the colleges you\u2019re applying to\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you need any help in terms of writing an essay, please leave a comment or PM me!

      "text": "Yeah, I certainly agree with you. I usually like to break them down into these main categories: Why Us (this one is a bit iffy because I try to make it unique for every college and you should too, to be honest), Why Major, EC, meaning to you, community, and passion/interest. Obviously, I hope the creator of this post gets a lot of credit, upvotes, and awards cuz man this must have taken some work to compile. But kuddos to you!",
