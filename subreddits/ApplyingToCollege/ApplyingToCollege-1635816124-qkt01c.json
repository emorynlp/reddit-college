  "text": "Im applying to boston college RD, but tonight is the deadline for a certain scholarship they give out to 18 accepted students. I wasn\u2019t planning on applying now bc I don\u2019t think I would get the scholarship (not a top student or anything) and I also want more time to work on their supplemental. \nBut I was wondering if applying by the deadline for this scholarship would increase my chances of acceptance or anything? BC only offers RD and ED, so my application would by RD, but would applying to this scholarship show im interested or something?",
