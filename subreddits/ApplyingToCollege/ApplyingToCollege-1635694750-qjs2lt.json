  "text": "I have done some online research and I have heard the same things over and over again\u2026..\n1 Carnegie Mellon is full of antisocial academic grinders; ie not that much fun/ party life\n2 The depression rate is extremely high, stress rate is extremely high and the average # of hours of sleep is very low\nCan somebody please confirm or deny this\nI\u2019m really into math and statistics and I would want to dip into comp sci yet not major in it. Also I\u2019m a guy(supposedly means less acceptance rate)\nThanks",

      "text": "There is partial truth in what all you've said, but not the complete truth... Yes, most majors at CMU are extremely rigorous, and you'll spend a lot of time studying, but that doesn't make you anti-social by any means... Students are busy a lot, but that doesn't mean that they're stressed or depressed... But yes, you will be sacrificing your sleep a fair bit, but you'll become an expert at time management... If all that seems interesting, then go for the ED, other take the RD route instead.",

      "text": "I attended a CMU information session and the person presenting was straight up like \"Don't do ED. It's not worth it.\" He said something along the lines of the acceptance rate is pretty much the same RD vs RD. Also, know that you won't be receiving your financial package when/before you get your decision. I don't know your financial situation, but if you do get accepted, you'll be binded to a very expensive school. This was from what one presenter said, so of course, take this with a grain of salt.",
