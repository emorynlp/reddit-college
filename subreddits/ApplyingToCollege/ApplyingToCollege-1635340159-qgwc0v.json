  "title:": "How do we know whether we have good/ bad essays?",
  "text": "Most of us have multiple readers read our essays, and I assume that we turn in our essays only when we know that they're as good as we can get them. On the other hand, I've also seen many posts from qualified people saying that the majority of submitted undergraduate essays are quite bad, but applicants don't seem to realize it. In that case, how are we to know whether our essay is good/ bad, and what can we do about it?",

      "text": "It\u2019s so subjective. One reader will love your essay and another won\u2019t. \n\nWhat they call holistic really means wholly subjective. Yes, if it\u2019s full of typos and grammatical errors, well, that\u2019s bad. But otherwise one person will like an essay and another won\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve shown my essay to probably 10-15 people. I take input but don\u2019t let them really edit it. Some people give good input that helped my essay flow. They all seem to like it. It\u2019s not flowery at all. Kinda cut and dry. Maybe it\u2019s not personal enough but it tells my story. I can\u2019t fake it with flowery language to look like one of the essays posted online. I imagine I\u2019m not the only one in this boat.\n\nSo my advice is that if you feel like it tells your story and it reads well to you and people you know, then it\u2019s perfectly fine. \n\nIt\u2019s not an essay writing contest or a creative writing championship, it\u2019s a personal statement.",
