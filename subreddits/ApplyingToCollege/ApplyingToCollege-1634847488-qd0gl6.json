  "text": "i know schools are test optional because of covid and they SAY they're going to judge fairly even if we don't submit test scores, but are they REALLY going to judge us fairly or are they just saying that? my gpa is somewhat strong but i just feel so subpar to everyone else. i'm especially scared because i saw so many c/o 21 students get rejected from schools that were supposed to be their targets and now i'm just so intimidated going into this process\n\nplease tell me i'm not the only one that is fucking terrified",

      "text": "If they say it won\u2019t impact you, it won\u2019t impact you.  \n\n\nOf course, the dirty little secret about \u201ctest optional\u201d is that the schools \u2014 especially top schools \u2014 don\u2018t really need our test scores. They know the strengths/weaknesses of our high school and whether our GPA, class rank, and EC\u2019s are at the level they want. \n\nI mean, you just know that these schools used decades of admissions data to model what their previous decisions would have been in a \u201ctest optional\u201d situation before they committed to the policy. Esentially they KNEW they didn\u2019t need our scores before they gave us the \u201coption\u201d to not submit them.\n\nUltimately, I believe, that anyone thinking \u201cwith test-optional I\u2019ve got a shot that I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise\u201c is fooling themselves.",
