  "text": "I've been filling out the CommonApp and MIT applications, and listing the courses for my current year. However, I am currently attending a place that operates under the semester system, and the classes will all be different from semester to semester, although I haven't yet chosen my courses for the second one. On the CommonApp, there is an option to select this, but on the MIT application, there isn't an option as far as I found. Should I just list both the courses I am taking right now, as well as those I plan to take (the list is more or less confirmed) under the 12th grade? Or should I somehow clarify that I am not taking some of the courses I have listed?",
