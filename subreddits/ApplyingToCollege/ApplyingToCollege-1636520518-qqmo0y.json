  "text": "Heyo everyone! I'm currently attending a community college, still trying to figure out what I want to do. I think I'd like to go to a medical school, but I'm not sure what major(s) would be better or worse for applying to one. So I was hoping to get some suggestions of majors to well, major in that would be beneficial, since I do plan to head to medical school.",

Chem/biochem is solid. CS (Crop Science) would make you stand out and might have the pre-med reqs you need. It also has decent employability.",

      "text": "If you want to go to medical school then it kinda doesn't matter.  The main thing is that you take the courses that medical schools require and do well in them, and also do well in whatever other courses you take.  And do well on the MCAT.\n\nSome students prefer biology, chemistry and biochemistry because they have the highest level of overlap between the degree requirements and the med school requirements.\n\nOne thing to check on:  if you're planning to use your CC credits to skip general education requirements, some of those are \\*also\\* required by med schools.  Check some med schools' pages to make sure your transfer credit from CC satisfies their requirements.  It may, but it may not; worth researching.",

      "text": "If you plan on going to med school, it doesn't particularly matter what you major in as long as you meet the premed course requirements. \n\nYou could go for biology or chemistry, since those majors' requirements have a big overlap with the premed requirements, but the problem is that if for whatever reason med school doesn't work out, those degrees aren't very employable. \n\nYou could try biomedical engineering, since that also has a big overlap with premed requirements and is much more employable, but a high college GPA is important for med school applications, and BME has a reputation for being really tough.\n\nYou could also major in something you're interested in that's completely unrelated to medicine and use your other course slots to satisfy the premed requirements. A friend of mine is considering majoring in political science on a premed track, and there's another person I know who majored in Spanish on a premed track, went to med school, and is now a doctor.",
