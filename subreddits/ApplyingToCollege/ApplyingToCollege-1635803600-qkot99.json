Don't worry, the answer would be YES, they have definitely admitted kids with not-national ECs.  You're being realistic, which is good.  Definitely DON'T rescind your app.  And GOOD LUCK!!",

This was before the pandemic and online schooling became common. I would have been happy to go to a regular HS and work after school every day but a) my work time was fixed and b) regular schools are too time inefficient (too much time is lost getting there & back etc).",
