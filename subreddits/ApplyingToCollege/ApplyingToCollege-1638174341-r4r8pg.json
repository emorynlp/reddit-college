  "text": "1 week ago got an interview with Duke alumni. Weirdly, interviewer didn't ask too much about me, I mean in standard way. He just started : tell me about yourself,  then it smoothly switched to why duke then to talks about quantum computing, Arduino,  EEG, and AI in his research at Duke. I also asked some questions. I don't know, it was interesting enough,  but I worry that mb I screwed up",

      "text": "From what you described that sounds like a pretty standard interview, I think you did fine.\n\nEspecially when it comes to alumni interviewers, I\u2019ve experienced a lot of variation when it comes to their style of questioning. I had one interview where the guy\u2019s only question about myself was what my favourite movie is, before segueing into asking like 5 different variations of \u201cWhy School X\u201d for the remainder of the interview.",
