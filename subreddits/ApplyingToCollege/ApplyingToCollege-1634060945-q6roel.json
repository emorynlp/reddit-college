That has always been the case.\n\nBe sure to check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll. However, other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.",
