  "text": "Hey so I finally got an email for my interview for Princeton. I am curious if anyone here who attends, graduated, or has already had their interview for Princeton can give me a rundown of what to expect. I know experiences are different by person because different it\u2019s an informal conversation, but I would like to know what to to do/not do before and during the conversation. Thank you.",
