  "text": "I'm going into finance. I have a job lined up after my birthday that makes a liveable wage, but just about barely unless i push my hours. (crazy expensive here)\n\nMy employer offers tuition reimbursement and I'm realizing I could work 40 hrs a week and complete my classes and graduate debt free. I'm working 50hrs a week and doing my hs classes just fine. But if it's online I'm wondering if employers will have any bias against me? And should I go online with a nearby college or go completely remote?",

      "text": "I think employers are widely biased against online degrees, especially if it is an online only kind of school.\n\nIf you are looking at online degrees, I think the best options are public universities that don't distinguish between an in-person degree and their online offering. You want a school that stands behind that offering and doesn't feel a need to point out that it's a separate thing on the diploma. \n\nArizona State, Penn State, Oregon State, U Florida are a few examples to look at, but there are a lot out there.",

              "text": "I think that's a pretty solid program if you are local - they have that hybrid option where you can do in-person for the upper level courses if you prefer which is nice.\n\nIt's obviously going to be closer to a commuter school experience than the traditional live on campus kind, but if that works for you it's fine.",
