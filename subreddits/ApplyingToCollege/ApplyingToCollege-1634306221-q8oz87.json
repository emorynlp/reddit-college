  "title:": "Computer head with an interest in real estate",
  "text": "So I\u2019m 16 years old and starting to look at colleges early so I\u2019m not stressing later. I have always loved computers and I want to have a really good amount of college time in computer science. I have always also had an interest in real estate. My question is, if most real estate titles don\u2019t require a college degree, could I theoretically get a 2-4 year degree in computer science, just to have the knowledge, and use that \u201clevel of education: bachelors\u201d to have a better look, to get into a good real estate title? I\u2019m sorry if this sounds stupid, I just don\u2019t know much about college, and was wondering if this is an option. \nAny response would be helpful! Thanks.",

      "text": "Much of computer science you can learn online for free. Although I enjoy college, if I didnt see myself getting a job in what im studying I probably wouldnt be here. Computer Science is a great backup career in terms of pay, and real estate is a good paying career as well, but I would suggest just not going to college if you are dead set on real estate. Its probably a waste of time and money and if most real estate agents dont have degrees, your degree will be meaningless (especially in CS and not like business or something). Theres really no wrong answer though, its your life and I suggest doing what makes you happy first!",

      "text": "It depends on what you want to do with your career.  In the SF Bay Area, residential real estate agents vary from zero degree to MBA and JD degrees.  When you're looking at 2-3 million dollar average looking houses, it becomes whatever it takes to entice the customers to work with you.  Commercial transactions are even more complex, so I'm assuming they have teams of real estate lawyers who look over everything.",
