  "text": "I applied to U of O on November 1st as an early applicant and I know all my stuff has been processed by the school and is officially in because I received an email and my portal has confirmed that everything is in. However, my friend at school applied on November 5th under regular decision and was accepted within the week. I have not received an admission decision yet, should I be concerned? My friend and I share the same admissions counselor at U of O being from the same state so I\u2019m confused how they have already heard back and I have not. I\u2019m sure everything is fine I\u2019m just very nervous lol and would love some kind words of encouragement.",
