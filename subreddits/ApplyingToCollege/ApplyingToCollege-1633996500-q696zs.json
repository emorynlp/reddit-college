Not very significant, but annoying. Instead of a 4.73, which I would've gotten for 4 years of study halls instead of choir, I have a 4.61.",

However, and this is really a biggie, grading is on the 100 point scale with a 97 in a regular class receiving a 3.7 and in an honors or AP receiving a 4.7. You could get a 95 in every class throughout your time in High School and have an unweighted gpa of 3.5 for your efforts. \n\nTo be clear, a straight A student can apply to college with a 3.5 gpa on their application. Colleges say they take stuff like this into account when evaluating transcripts, but I\u2019d bet money that a lot of them never take the time to do the conversion given how flooded they get with applications.",
