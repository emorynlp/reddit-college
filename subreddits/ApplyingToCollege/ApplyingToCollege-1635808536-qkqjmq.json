  "text": "The ielts testing agency sent a confirmation to me that the score report has been officially reported to the university around 3 weeks before today but in my applicant portal, the score is not shown. When I emailed the university, they said the score would not appear in the portal unless it is received as official. (I'm certain that the name of University + department is listed correctly in my request for the official score report) What would I do? Since it already past the deadline, will I not be considered for admission because of this? \ud83d\ude2d",
