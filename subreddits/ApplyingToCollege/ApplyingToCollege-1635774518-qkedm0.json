      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 after the app has been submitted, there is often a way to report in the portal. Self-reporting is faster. If you are just ordering score reports today, they may take anywhere from a few days to two weeks to be received.",
