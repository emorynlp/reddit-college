  "text": "is it just me or has literally every kid in your area started some sort of black lives matter project, instagram, fundraiser etc ?\n\nI know some have good intentions but it all feels VERYY performative and as someone who has been working for black rights for all of high school, been called the n word and discriminated against on multiple occasions as well as other microaggressions, it makes me sick that kids are taking advantage of the current movement to beef up their ec's and look like they care when they most likely don't give a damn and say the n word all the time.\n\nAgain I know some are genuine and truly care but its really hard for me to believe that some of these rich white kids who have 0 black friends really cares about black lives.

For example, I\u2019ve seen so many people actively dismiss black people\u2019s opinions and feelings while still \u201cspreading awareness\u201d on their socials. \nOr in recent \u201cyoutube apologies\u201d in which BLM, Covid and other big topics are used to deflect from the actions they were apologizing for (a more specific example being this dude named Jeffree Star). \n\nI know this seems very cynical but I feel like it\u2019s not difficult to identify genuine people from those just riding the wave, and you\u2019d be surprised to see how many are doing the latter.",

I joined as well because the club was open to all and I wanted to support my friend the best I could. Literally the entire school talked bad about her for the entire year, trashing posters and mocking it. \nThe club barely limps by for 2 years because the school gave 0 support and everyone mocking it so much, people were scared to come in gear of either being outed or mocked severely. \n\nHigh school graduation valedictorian speech, \"We are proud to say that we are the year to have the first LGBTQ club.\" I knew this guy and remember when he was mocking it like everyone else. \n\nP.S. We finally got some proper support thanks to some bomb new teachers that were all about it. Hopefully that club runs well without its founder and can continue",

Luckily I have some incredible teachers who are willing to dedicate their time and energy into making sure it succeeds, but to have individuals dismiss me and my requests constantly, while simultaneously bragging about diversity and acceptance is INFURIATING.\n\nThis year we tried to change the name our club, because one of the rules when it was founded was \"it can't have 'gay' in the title,\" because they didn't want to scare off perspective donors (private prep school). We wanted to change it to \"gender sexuality alliance\" and they wouldn't let us because they didn't want us to \"be associated with the national GSA,\" as they had a doctrine which included \"creating a safe space on campus,\" which they asked if we were actually even doing. \n\nOur club is still featured on their website under the diversity section though :)",

I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s mostly white and/or non-Black students starting these things (which is already a bit suspect considering this is a movement that\u2019s supposed to be led by Black people). It\u2019s insane to me that people can\u2019t even take a movement that\u2019s meant to uplift and support Black people seriously\u2014the instant they hear about it, they hijack it and use it to their advantage. I hope colleges are able to see through this performative activism bullshit.",

He knows that he is extremely privileged, and everyone in our town knows that our authorities are racist, yet he doesn\u2019t use his platform at all to speak out about these issues. He posted one black screen for the whole blackout Tuesday thing and his fans would not stop praising him...\n\nIt\u2019s honestly super annoying for me because I\u2019ve always been vocal about my opinions and I\u2019ve gotten crap for it before lol, while now all these popular kids are getting praised for doing the bare minimum.",
