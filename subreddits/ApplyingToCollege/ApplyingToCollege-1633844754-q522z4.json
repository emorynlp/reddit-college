  "text": "I achieved a rank of 73 in a National mathematics competition in India (I\u2019m an international student). Is that worth mentioning in the honors section?\nI\u2019m in a dilemma because on one hand, it\u2019s not a particularly high rank but on the other hand, it\u2019s a *national* competition and I got a rank under 100 where thousands of students from all over the country participated. \nShould replace it with a regional achievement instead? \n(also sorry if the question is silly lol)",
