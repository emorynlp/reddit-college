  "text": "I'm applying as a film studies major for a lot of different schools and am thinking about submitting the optional film portfolios. But I've been hearing that I shouldn't be submitting them if they aren't insanely good. \n\nHow much do these types of artistic portfolios matter in admission especially when I am applying to film studies? Will it be weird to not submit any portfolio? Also should I only be submitting them if I think it's some masterpiece of a work?",
