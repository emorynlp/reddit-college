  "text": "7 days left until ED/EA and one of my teachers still hasn't submitted the LOR! I am so stressed out rn. I literally asked her in JULY if she would be willing to recommend me and she agreed, and I sent the official request last month, earlier than almost everyone at my school.\n\nI emailed her again today sending a friendly reminder about it and she straight up IGNORED my email, like I know she's not obligated to write me or anyone a LOR but I gave her more than enough time to write one and the fact that she straight up ignored my email was rude af. I'm gonna meet her in person tomorrow so she can't ignore me but I'm so upset rn. Someone please make me feel better.",

'Double texting' is not a taboo for older adults. \n\nWhen DD didn't get an answer to her email to an AO, I made her actually call them on the phone.  She had to leave a VM but the issue was cleared up immediately once the AO heard the message.",
