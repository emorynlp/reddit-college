  "text": "Can you add colleges after you submit the CSS Profile and IDoc? Does it cost extra to do so? If so, how much? \nAlso, if I have a CSS Profile fee waiver from a specific college, will I still have to pay the $9 CSS Profile fee? \nIs there a cost to submit the IDoc? \n\nPS: I'm an international student\n\nThank you so much :)",
