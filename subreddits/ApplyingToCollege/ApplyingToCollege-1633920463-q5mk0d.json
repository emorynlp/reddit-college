  "text": "In the \u201cretirement plans\u201d section, I wrote down \u201cother type of retirement plan\u201d. It then asks for the current value of tax-deferred and after-tax retirement, pension, annuity, and saving plans such as IRA, [...]. My question goes as follows: is it asking for an annual or monthly (predicted, since hyperinflation exists) retirement income value? I assumed it was yearly at first but then looked \u201cannuity\u201d up and found that that isn\u2019t necessarily annual... so what exactly am I supposed to write down?\nAny help would be appreciated!",
