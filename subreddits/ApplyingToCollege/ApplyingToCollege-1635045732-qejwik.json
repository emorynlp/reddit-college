  "text": "Hi! I graduated from high school last June, and have taken a gap year. The Common App asks the question below.\n\nI initially marked the second to last option, but I have heard some people who were in the same exact situation marked the last option. Does anyone know which one is the proper option?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease indicate if any of these options will have affected your progression through or since secondary/high school. Check all that apply.\\*\n\nDid or will graduate early\n\nDid or will graduate late\n\nDid or will take time off\n\nDid or will take gap year\n\nNo change in progression",
