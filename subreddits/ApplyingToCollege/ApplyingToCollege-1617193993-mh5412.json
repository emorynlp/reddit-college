Rejected. \n\nYou never saw The Rejected after Decision Day. \n\n...\n\nAs the guards hand out The Decisions, the national anthem starts to blare out through the streets. \n\n*\u201dDear old Dartmouth, give a rouse*\n\n*For the College on the hill...\u201d*\n\nA single tear slides down a nameless citizen\u2019s face as they murmur a quiet prayer:  \n\n*\u201dDartmouthSimp, my savior.\u201d*\n\n\n[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mgf7nt/day_7279_of_waiting_for_a_dartmouth_acceptance/gssui80/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",
