  "text": "I'm an international applicant and I'm considering ED-ing to Amherst. I love it so far but the only potential drawback I can find is that its social scenes might not be too lively because of the class sizes as well as its location. I really love everything else about it and not sure if I'm overthinking this bit. I know this is something that applies to all LACs but I just wanted to know a bit more about it for Amherst specifically. Thanks so much!",
