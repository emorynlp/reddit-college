  "text": "So, I reported both my ACT (34) and SAT (1490) in the common app section. Some of the schools Im applying to require that you send official score reports. Is it ok if I only send an official score report for one of my self reported scores, like just the ACT and not the SAT? The scores are both practically equal anyways.",
