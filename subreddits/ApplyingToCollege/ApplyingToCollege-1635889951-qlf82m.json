  "text": "So, I reported both my ACT (34) and SAT (1490) in the common app section. Some of the schools Im applying to require that you send official score reports. Is it ok if I only send an official score report for one of my self reported scores, like just the ACT and not the SAT? The scores are both practically equal anyways.",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free - all of these require that you send *an official report if you later enroll* (you will only enroll at one college)*.* After you are accepted and decide to enroll, you would send an official report to prove the scores that you had self-reported in the app to that college.\n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency *prior* to admission. They will only consider the scores you have sent official reports for.",
