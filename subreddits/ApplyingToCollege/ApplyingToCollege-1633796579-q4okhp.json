  "text": "I took AP Psychology at BYU Independent Study (BYUIS) over the summer, but unfortunately my school won't add it to my official transcript. However, BYUIS still gives me the option to mail transcripts.\n\nHow would I report this on the Common App and on Courses and Grades? Do I have to mail the BYUIS transcripts to every college I'm applying to?",

However, that is on my official high school transcript. Would I also list that under \"other secondary/high schools\" and add another transcript in courses and grades?",
