      "text": "I would have to believe he's mistaken. Now I'm not certain on how test scores will affect your chances, (there have been volumes written on the subject, of which the results are nebulous to say the least), but you absolutely CAN get in without test scores. There's a reason we use the term \"holistic review\" ad nauseum; if the rest of your app is great (which it sounds like it is), you've got a good shot.\n\nAnd McGill is wonderful school, so I wish you the best of luck!",
