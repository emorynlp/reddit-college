  "text": "Hi! For context, I\u2019m applying to BU\u2019s 7-year BS/MD, UPitt\u2019s Medicine GAP, Case Western PPSP, Rice-Baylor Medical Scholars Program, Augusta University\u2019s BS/MD, Brown PLME, and a few more. Any info on this is helpful, I\u2019m going to call each college during school because of the time difference but was hoping to get some answers beforehand, since I couldn\u2019t find it on their website.",
