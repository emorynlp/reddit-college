  "title:": "I don't have my grade 11 transcripts since my school went Pass/Fail. What should I do about transcripts? (Common App)",
  "text": "Hi Everyone! so I have a question about the Common App, so basically my school went Pass/Fail this last year because of covid and the pandemic so now the last transcript students have is the Final Sophomore Grades and we don't have any transcripts for grade 11, not even the school itself. obviously, the common app asks for at least the final junior year grades. and also it's worth mentioning that we don't have a mid-year report but I think the school can offer predicted grades. What do you think should I do. I thought about asking my school to make a document explaining that I passed all my exams but I'm not sure how a document like that looks like? do I list all the courses I have taken and then indicate the grade of every course indicating if I passed or failed? I think that would be the best thing I can do .. what do you think about that guys? and thanks in advance",

          "text": "thank you that's very helpful! also, another question: I chose on my common app that I don't have access to my grades since it would be better if my counselor submitted directly from his common app account. do you think that should be fine or is it better to do it on my behalf? I noticed that the counselor would have to submit my school profile and grades too, so why bother listing them again on my common app? what do u think of that?",

              "text": "I listed them myself/self reported stuff when the application asked for them even though i had to submit transcripts and stuff because I think they look at the self reported grades first and the official transcripts are just to verify\n\nSo i would both have your counselor do it and do it again yourself",
