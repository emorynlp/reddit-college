  "text": "I'm an international student applying from Europe and only applying to HYPSM. It's likely that I won't receive enough aid to realistically attend (say 40k a year fees with aid). So, the question is if I get accepted, does it make sense to take out loans to attend, or to stay in Europe and attend University here ( 3k-15k a year depending on where). On face, this seems like a really silly question, but I want to break into Finance related careers and I recognise the (relative) importance of going to a target school to work in these industries. I also want to work in the US eventually and it seems intuitive that graduating with a US degree makes working in the US easier.",

The main reason. however, is that salaries are far higher after graduation in the US and tax rates are far more favourable. My plan is to work in the US for some years and then move home.",
