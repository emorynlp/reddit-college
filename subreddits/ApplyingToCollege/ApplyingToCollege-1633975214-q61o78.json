  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI know this has been discussed before, but I am a little confused. I have taken 9 APs so far, and I don't wish to submit 2 of them. So, on CommonApp I put that I took 7 APs. But, I know that there is the \"withholding form\" where I have to pay $10 to withhold exams. I am just confused how to do this/if I really need to. If I self report on CommonApp can't I just say I took 7 APs and be done with it? Are colleges really going to reach out and find the other 2 exams? If I were to fill out the form + send money, do I report the 2 exams I failed? If so, does that mean collegeboard works with commonapp to cancel them (seems unlikely). My guidance counselor says I have to do it I am just really confused on how it works/ what happens if I don\"t do it. Thanks!",

      "text": "College Board and Common App do not work with each other on reporting test scores. Not reporting in the app has absolutely nothing to do with canceling scores.\n\nReporting scores in Common App is self-reporting. Most colleges do not need an official score report to consider AP scores for admission purposes. You do not need to cancel AP scores.\n\nWhen you take your senior year APs, you will send an official report to the college where you have enrolled, for the purposes of placement and credit. It will include all past scores. Colleges will not care that there may be additional scores that were not self-reported in the app.",
