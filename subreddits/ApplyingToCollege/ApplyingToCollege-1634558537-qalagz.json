  "text": "Hi, I'm having trouble deciding with what to submit for my graded paper. All of last year, my essays were in class writings (hence I only had 45 min) so they aren't amazing. However, I did have one writing that I had time to edit but it is a research paper that was 12 pages (which is over their 1-2 page requirement). I emailed admissions and an admissions officer directly asking if I should submit the longer one or shorter one (and hopefully not be penalized as much) and they just copied and pasted the general info on the website into their response and didn't acknowledge my question. If anyone can recommend which to submit, thank you so much! (Bc I have everything else ready to submit including supps, so once I upload this paper I'm submitting)",

What I meant to say is would it detriment me more to submit an essay where I spent less than 10 min a paragraph or go over what they recommend as I spent a good portion of time outlining, revising, editing and getting strong pieces of evidence for the larger paper",

If your writing on the first page or 2 is representative of your skills and the grade, feel free to submit, knowing that they won't go beyond the second page. If your timed essay is better than the beginning of your 12 page paper, submit that instead",
