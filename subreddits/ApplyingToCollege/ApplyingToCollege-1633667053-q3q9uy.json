  "title:": "Penn or Northwestern ED",
  "text": "I like both schools pretty equally, I decided on Penn a few weeks ago and am visiting it this weekend but I'm starting to think I should maybe ED northwestern, because in reality the biggest reason I ended up putting penn over northwestern was my parents telling me to ED to a more prestigious school (despite northwestern being a T10.......). I really like northwestern but I won't be able to visit until after the ED deadline so I feel like that will make my why us essay a lot weaker as I was also planing to meet a professor - maybe even weaker than an RD application with a why us essay after visiting?\n\nAs I said, I like both schools *fairly* equal and I'd be over the moon to go to either one, which one do you think I might have a better chance at? I'm applying for engineering btw",

They do have a great Engineering program, and their building is the largest office/academic building in the US after the Pentagon. Also, Chicago >> Philly!",

Thank you, I think you're right I initially already had a preference for northwestern but I just wasn't 100% sure, also yeah northwestern gives a pretty big boost to ED applicants\n\nMy parents say northwestern doesn't have as big of a name as penn which I guess is half true (from an international perspective at least - they're both immigrants so they also think that), do you think this will be a problem?",
