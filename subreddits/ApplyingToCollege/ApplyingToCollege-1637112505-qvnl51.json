I know it hurts and is hard to believe the system is not fair but it is what it is. EA/ED is very exclusive at least at T9 and good grades/good essays/good ec are not enough unless you can check one of the boxes mentioned above. Feel free to check other years posts/acceptance profiles to see what the profile of an EA/ED student looks like",
