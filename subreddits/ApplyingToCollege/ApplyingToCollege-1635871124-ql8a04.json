  "title:": "Error on Activity List",
  "text": "I made a minor error on my activity list and it's honestly not a big deal. The only issue is that it contradicts something I said in my Rice supplemental. I put in my activity list that I run a food bank which feeds over 400 families, but my essay states that it feeds over 600 families. The actual number is 600, not 400. I dont want them to think I over exaggerated in the essay. I put the name of the food bank in my list and a quick google search will bring up the website. The website states on the home page that it feeds over 600 families. Should I email Rice about this discrepancy? They're my ED school and I'm worried making an error will harm me.",
