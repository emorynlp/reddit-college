  "text": "Reason I ask is because I have a 3.7, but a 3.85 10th/11th grade (with 3 honors, 3 APS and 4 IBS) and a 3.4 freshman year (C+ in honors Algebra 2.) Ik people say colleges look for this trend but I want to go to UMich (in state) or a t25 school for engineering and my GPA initially isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s good without freshman year while my classes got substantially harder in rigor.\n\nAlso, for an engineering major (specifically biomed) I am taking calc 1 (IB) in 12th grade rn and got a C+ in algebra 2 (other math classes were As for me). Will this screw me out of any chance at a good engineering school? I didn\u2019t take AP Physics as well.",

      "text": "so, t30 engineering is pretty unforgiving stats wise (if u look at average sat/gpa for those programs) since there\u2019s so many kids w near perfect stats and solid ecs applying. They expect you to have done calc and some form of the 3 ap physics (Ik Princeton\u2019s website even say this explicitly and I imagine others r the same) since engineering at those schools is rigorous and it\u2019s based on applied calc and physics. I don\u2019t mean this discouragingly since of course you definitely could get in based on ecs/essays/narrative, but it might be pretty difficult unless you have a really high sat/act or some other standout",
