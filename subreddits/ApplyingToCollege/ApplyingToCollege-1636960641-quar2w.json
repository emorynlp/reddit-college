  "text": "So I applied to EA/ED(Cornell) schools a while ago and now I'm gonna start with the RD applications I plan to submit in Jan a day before deadlines. I'm also applying to UCs but I'm gonna submit that in a few days. Most of my safety/target and a few reaches already received my applications in November. My remaining list (i.e. the RD ones) are mainly massive reaches with a target. Here's the list: UPenn, Princeton, MIT, Dartmouth, Rice, Stanford, USC, UNC-CH, CMU(ED2), NYU.\n\nI'm an Asian international(residing in the gulf) going for CS, not applying for aid, and Test-optional for most(I'll submit my 1490 with 790M 700E to non-reaches). I'm not listing my ECs HERE, I obviously did on the commonapp lol. I got 3 LORs. 1 from my CS teacher (amazing), 1 from Math (Also nice), and one from a uni professor (good) - yes I got to read them after EA/ED submissions.\n\nI wanted to know what exactly does someone in my place do to enhance their chances at the schools I listed above? From r/collegeresults, I see so many similar students get rejected/accepted to the same uni.",

I\u2019m not sure which of those listed is the target, but try adding some safety schools. Those top places only let in so many international students and many are allocated to kids of big donors/influential people.\n\nPick some more in the top 50 range to add in. Maybe even one top 100.",
