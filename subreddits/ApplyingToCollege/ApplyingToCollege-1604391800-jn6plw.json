  "text": "With the election tomorrow and the height of college app season throughout the entire month, it's a really scary time right now. Our lives will be changed forever based on the decisions made this month, some of which we can control and others we can't. It's also insane to me that we are expected to choose what we want to do with our lives while most of us can't even vote for a person that will be in charge of the country for the next 4 years.\n\nThat being said, I hope everything works out. Both in the election and everyone's college goals.",

      "text": "I really appreciate you acknowledging all of these things so openly. Let's unpack some of these things, in the hopes of controlling what we can and being prepared to forge ahead regardless of tonight's results.\n\n1. I can't speak holistically about the election, of course, but I will say there is a large portion of the US population who are casting votes to benefit future generations (you), and I also hope their voices are heard tonight. On a more personal note, I think we should change the voting age to 16. If you can drive a vehicle at that age, you should be cognizant enough to cast a vote that will impact your future.\n2. Everyone, listen up! You DO NOT need to know what you want to do with your life right now. You don't need to know what you want to study, where you want to go, or what kind of career you might want. This might sound crazy, but consider this: many of the jobs your generation will have 5 years from now likely DO NOT EVEN EXIST YET. Let that sink in, because how could you possibly know what to study or what you want to do when the career opportunities aren't even a blip on our radars at the moment?\n3. Here are some stats to drive these ideas home:\n   1. almost 80% of students change their major at least once during college.\n   2. Granted these numbers are from 2013 and I'm too busy with essay reading to find more recent data, but at the time, only 27% of folks were actually utilizing their degree in their careers!! TWENTY-SEVEN PERCENT. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) My point? It really doesn't matter what you study, as long as you're engaged, take advantage of educational and professional opportunities, network, and actually ENJOY the college journey. Even medical schools are taking more students who major outside the STEM fields, because they are looking for well-rounded students. \n4. For whatever it's worth, my personal journey has led me all over the place, and yours likely will, too. I was pre-med when I started college, learned I no longer enjoyed science, wound up studying Psychology and Anthropology instead. Graduated college a year early because my school wasn't a good fit (which is why I now do what I do!), applied to graduate school during my third year of college, and wound up in a Forensic Psychology program. In that program, I earned clinical hours to become a Licensed Professional Counselor, worked for a law firm managing mock trial research, ran a Juvenile Fire Setters program at Children's Hospital, served as both a victim's advocate for domestic violence and a therapist for domestic violence offenders, and conducted research on trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy...which all led me to be an Operations Research Analyst for the Army for a few years. I then went on to conduct further research at a well-known public university in the mid-west while launching my college counseling practice. Arguably, I do utilize some components of both of my degrees in my work, but not in the typical fashion. The takeaway: Get comfortable with the unknown if you can, be open-minded about activities and educational opportunities, take advantage of everything on campus wherever you wind up, and just be sure you're completing a degree in which the courses are interesting/exciting and keep you engaged. What matters most in college is that you learn something and grow as an autonomous, independent, authentic human being. \n5. And for those of you who are already 18, please vote.",
