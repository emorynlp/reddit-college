      "text": "I think that if anything, it\u2019s going to have no effect. Or maybe the tiniest positive bias. Definitely not a negative bias.\n\nUC schools are pretty progressive. If you were applying to a school like BYU or Liberty, then idk, maybe being LGBTQ+ wouldn\u2019t help. But UC schools care a lot about acceptance, diversity, and inclusion. There\u2019s no negative effect that I could see for ticking off the LGBTQ+ box.\n\nAnd it\u2019s really not going to have much of an impact at all, if any, whether you do or don\u2019t tick off the box. I think that it might just be for statistics purposes or for diversity-specific email lists/LGBTQ+ group invitations or things like that.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure, then just don\u2019t tick off the box.\n\nBest of luck. :)",
