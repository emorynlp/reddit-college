  "text": "I submitted an early action application a few days ago, however yesterday I realized that I made a mistake inputting an extracurricular. I play the saxophone and wrote that I did it for 4 hours all 4 years. In reality I did it for 3 hours, skipping junior year as well.\n\nSo I realized this mistake, and felt really bad. I emailed the admissions person YESTERDAY about it but I don't she saw the email yet.\n\nI got accepted today, which I didn't expect until like December. Anyways, if the admissions person sees my email, will she rescind me? Or not care?\n\nI'm probably overthinking this. But I'm a person who gets stressed easily and I'm worried about this. I also want to apply to the full ride scholarship and don't want the extracurriculars to be wrong.",
