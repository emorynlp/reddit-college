  "text": "Hi guys, I just submitted three of my common apps into schools that allow initial self reporting of ACT scores, but require you to send them once you are enrolled. I accidentally hit the \u201cno\u201d option for have I ever taken the \u201cACT writing Plus test\u201d. When I send in my one score I am reporting, they will see that I have taken a writing test.\n\nWhat should I do about this?",
