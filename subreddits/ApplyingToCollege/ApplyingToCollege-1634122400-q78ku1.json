  "text": " \n\nHello, I'm an international student who is trying to apply as an early decision right now. My school just told me that i need pay them 600USD just for a reccomendation letter. The counselor doesnt even help with my main essay and supplement essays.\n\nI'm at a loss at what i should do. 600 USD is too much for me to afford right now but i'm too inexperienced to write my own counselor reccomendation and i have an exam in a week that lasts for the whole month so i literally dont have the time to invest in this. Its not a joke when i say that i'm crying as i'm writing this post. I cannot burden my parents with the amount because i know they're struggling.",

Should i just bet everything there instead? I dont need to pay the 600USD to my school for that.  \nBut my problem is should i be betting everything there though?  if i dont pay my school 600 USD then tbh i cant even apply to any university cuz they're blocking my application process.And what if i just apply to BYU and not get in. I would have lost a year worth of opportunity",

              "text": "Why not apply to BYU plus some other places that don\u2019t require a counselor LoR plus some schools in your home country? Though, it sounds like if you can\u2019t afford $600 then you will probably need full need met for tuition, etc.  The set of schools willing to give that much financial aid to internationals is fairly small.",
