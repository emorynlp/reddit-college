  "text": "For one of my UC essays I am writing about mining for diamonds in Minecraft. I am connecting it to a metaphor about looking for the good in everyone/pursuing academic excellence etc. My question is would this be a turn off for admission reviewers? I wanna show my 'quirky' side but idk it might be too much.",

      "text": "No one can judge an essay without actually reading it, but from the topic I think you might run into the problem of being overly quirky. Try writing it and see how it comes out, but be aware that the overly quirky metaphor essay is very common:\n\n>**The \"metaphor\" essay**  \n>  \n>If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e20pcf/the\\_worst\\_essays\\_you\\_can\\_write/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e20pcf/the_worst_essays_you_can_write/)",
