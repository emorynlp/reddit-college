  "text": "I was talking to a friend who scheduled his interviews with rice & case western 3 days ago. I checked when I could schedule the interviews now and they are all filled until late november/early early december. Do you know if these colleges will post interview dates past these november/december dates?",

On the Rice website, it says that you need to have your interview done by December 3. So if you didn\u2019t sign up for one, I\u2019m guessing you wont be able to do one",
