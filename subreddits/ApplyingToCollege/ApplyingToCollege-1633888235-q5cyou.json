  "text": "For context, I am a senior in a large, competitive, public HS. My graduating class is approximately 700 students. My counselor recently told me that I rank in the top 20%, and I was initially super proud! But then I did some lurking on this sub and now idk how to feel about my ranking, since I know that ***tons*** of kids on this sub are in the top 1-10% of their graduating classes. \n\nSo basically, I'd love to know what the general opinion is regarding student rank on this sub? If I'm aiming for top colleges, does my ranking (in the context of my school, ofc) seem impressive enough?\n\nAlso yes I flaired this as emotional support lol I'm a bit insecure about my rank & kind of want some guidance!",

      "text": "top 20% is something to be proud of. go for the schools you want regardless (as long as you also have safeties obviously) because ivy's are full of applications from top students. they're competitive schools regardless of how impressive an application is. also don't forget that there's the 80% that you've ranked higher than. doesn't mean you're better but it's def not something to be ashamed of",

      "text": "It's not possible to assign an exact number to how impressive that is.  It's less impressive than top 10% at your high school.  It's more impressive than top 30% at your high school.  It's less impressive than top 20% at a more competitive high school.  It's more impressive than top 20% at a less impressive high school.\n\nThere is also no such thing as \"impressive enough\".  You can be valedictorian of the most competitive school in the country and still not get in if the rest of your application is subpar.\n\nDepending on how competitive your school is, I strongly suspect top 20% is not \\*disqualifying\\* at top colleges, if that's what you're asking.",

      "text": "Class rank is so subjective depending on what county you're in, what state you're in, even what neighborhood you're in, etc. I don't think it compares to GPA and class selection. But also, you should never worry about something that you can't directly change. Just try your best in the other parts of the application, the parts that you directly control and are not a result of others' work.",
