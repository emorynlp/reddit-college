  "text": "I know that this is the age old question lol, but I am genuinely pulling my hair out. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m a \u201cthinker\u201d and really like the uchicago theoretical atmosphere, but am not sure about the academic rigor since I don\u2019t want to spend 24 hours at the library. I\u2019ve heard that northwestern has a more chill, collaborative environment compared to the more competitive uchicago. At uchicago I would be trying for the molecular engineering program. At Northwestern I would be going for some materials science degree. I still want to be able to think, but in a friendlier environment. Which do you think would be better for me? Thanks in advance and sorry for rambling.",

If you think going to northwestern will give you a stress free 4 year (no 24 hours at the library) then prepare for potential regrets.\n\nIf you think northwestern's culture/environment is more friendly, then yeah, possibly NW is the right choice. If you prefer NW because you don't want to work hard, then probably not the right choice.",

I do like to mention though that college is pretty different from high school. It is generally more flexible and you have more control. For instance, in high school, you probably have daily assignments but college, assignments, at worse, are weekly. So you really have to plan your own schedule out. Even though the college I went to is pretty stressful, I still seen people spend a lot time outside of courses (start a company, research, etc). You can really design your schedule/coursework where you have a bit freedom. This, of course, is not to dismiss your concern because there is a difference between colleges.",

Honestly, I would not even bother with Chicago and would, instead, look at any of the other top 15-20 engineering schools.\n\nEdit: I know this sounds harsh, but nobody asks \"I'm interested in literature so should I choose Harvard or MIT?\" Even if Chicago were fully committed to engineering (which they are not), it would take them years just to get to where Harvard is -- and that's still not great.",

Look at where they get people from too: if they didn't share people with Argonne, they wouldn't have even some of their so-so people.\n\nFurthermore, engineering disciplines benefit from each other. What if you hit a problem with connections to MechE or EE or the Chem part of \"ChemE\" (now usually ChemMolE) or Operations Research/IE (common, because optimization crops up a lot)? What do the researchers there do? They talk to people at Argonne or Northwestern or UIUC. So why not just go where the experts are?\n\nI've read the hype too, but I also know the weaknesses in anything that is close to engineering. Hell, some alumni are angry that engineering (and the undergrad finance minor) means Chicago is becoming too careerist. That's not what I'd call a supportive ecosystem.",
