  "text": "Hello, as most of you know UMich has the supplemental question about your community\n\nA topic idea that I have come up with has to do with the STEM Academy at my school (not sure if other schools have this, if so please lmk). There are two pathways- biomedical and engineering - I chose engineering. Each year I had a year-long engineering course (PLTW) as one of my electives. Since this is sort of a four-year commitment, the students in your class start to repeat (even had the same teacher for 2 of these classes). Because of this, we all got familiar with each other and built quite a strong relationship. We even have traditions like a question of the day, and flannel Friday.\n\nIn the 10th grade class around the first week of school we shared a story about our name origin, fast forward to this year, we repeated this activity and it lasted way longer. This does show how more social we have become.\n\nJust wondering if this is a good topic-- doubt it is if most schools have a similar pathway as this.\n\nAll feedback is appreciated.",
