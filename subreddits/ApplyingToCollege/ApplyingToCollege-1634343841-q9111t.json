  "text": "I got a 1550 without studying (I took it as a baseline) in September last year.  \nI wanted to take it at least one more time to see if I could improve my math score (my split was 790/760 ERW/math). Everyone (including my parents and college counselor) told me I shouldn\u2019t bother because a 1550 was nothing to sneeze at, regression towards the mean is way more likely than an improvement, etc.  \nWell, I got my October score \u2014 1570! 790/780! Now I\u2019m feeling much better :)  \n  \nPlease note that I understand a 1550 is already a good score \u2014 it was my math in particular I was worried about, since I\u2019m an intended CS major.  \n  \nAnyways, the moral is that you should trust your instincts. If you think you can do better, try to!!",
