  "text": "Guys am I screwed?\n\nOur school has a strict policy for dating and my counselor caught me dating with a guy ( absolutely no physical interaction just talked alot) and I told her later I broke up with him( lied or I will be suspended). But then few months later today she saw me just walking to school together with my so-called ex and said she would suspend me and write it on my recommendation letter. I know it sounds weird but her dad is like the school president so I cant do anything about it",

After all, in college you have the independence to do almost anything and everything. Dating is the least of universities\u2019 worries when it comes to student behavior",

Actually I can\u2019t imagine where they\u2019d have that sorta policy but if I were you I\u2019d just qualify the reason for being suspended, which would probably negate the suspension. As for your counselor recommendation, hopefully the AOs take anything negative with a grain of salt given the reason why she suspended you. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry your school has this shitty policy; students at mine get caught doing all sorts of sus stuff but very rarely do they get suspended. Even if it doesn\u2019t have a material impact on your application, it just seems like a really weird in general. All the best tho!",
