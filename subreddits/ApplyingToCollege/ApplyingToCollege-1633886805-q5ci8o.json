  "text": "Hey guys, so I live in China and I want to do an English A Level so I can do university in England. I want to do an online course from China to get 3 a level qualifications. I'd like to do philosophy, sociology and something else I haven't chosen yet but does anyone have any advice for how I can go about doing that? What will I need to do?",

I googled what's useful for philosophy degrees and got this from the Cambridge website; i think it's pretty similar at most places\n\n\"Required by all Colleges: no specific subjects.\n\nUseful preparation: Mathematics, an arts/science mix, an essay-based subject\"",
