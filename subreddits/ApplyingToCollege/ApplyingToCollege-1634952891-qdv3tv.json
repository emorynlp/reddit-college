  "text": "Hi,\n\nI ran into a dilemma that I don't know what to do.\n\nI wrote an essay for the common app prompt:\n\nSome students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.\n\nin my essay, I talked about my interest and talent in computer science which is my intended major.\n\nbut now, uiuc's supplement essay question is:\n\nIn the past 3 to 4 years, what experience(s) have you had (inside or outside of the classroom) related to your selected first-choice major or academic interest?\n\nsince I already elaborated my experience in great detail on CS in the common app, what should I do with this kind of question?\n\nthanks",

      "text": "From my limited knowledge, the common app essay is compulsory for UIUC, so the AOs will most likely read it. Consequently, they will realize if u copy-pasted or wrote about the same topic. To solve this I wrote my common app essay on \"What makes u lose track of time\" slightly touching my ECs in the CS field and for the uiuc essay, I explained in detail what experience i actually had.",
