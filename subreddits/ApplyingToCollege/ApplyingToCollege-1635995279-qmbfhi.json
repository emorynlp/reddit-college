  "title:": "Submitting a List of Books for Essay?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! For one of the colleges I'm applying to, there are a bunch of essay topic options, but one is to submit a list of books you've read over the last 12 months. I really committed to reading this year and have read 100+ books from very diverse authors and genres, so I was considering submitting that list. But is it a wasted opportunity to write a more personal story/essay? \n\nWhat are your opinions?",
