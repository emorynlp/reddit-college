  "title:": "Submitting Poor AP Exam Scores",
  "text": "Hey all, just wanted to ask a quick question as I am currently going through a post submission crisis. \n\nSo I submitted to my dream school last weekend and included my AP scores which all were 2's. I did great in all the classes themselves but didn't put proper effort in the exams. After my submission I realized not submitting the scores all together was probably the much better move. As I further tried to cope, I read somewhere that admissions will only use your scores for credit reasons and nothing else. Is this true? I am posting this expecting to feel more like an idiot than I already am lol. \n\nMuch appreciated. o/",
