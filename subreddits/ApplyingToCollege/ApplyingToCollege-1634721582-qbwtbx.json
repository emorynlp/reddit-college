  "text": "Lately I was stressing so much about college applications that I forgot to do basic things (didn't eat nor sleep for couple of days). And while writing another supplemental essay, I remembered u/-throwthisawayokay and understood how stupid I am for throwing away my senior year and isolating myself from everyone. Definitely gonna catch up with my pals today, and wish u'll do so too.",
