  "text": "My mom is making a big deal about submitting my ed application two days early. She\u2019s worrying Bc many other kids have already submitted their apps, saying if I submit it within one day of November 1st, then it will decrease my chances. She says the AOs will look at my application later and see me as someone that isn\u2019t on top of things. As long as you submit your application before the deadline, does it really affect your chances?",
