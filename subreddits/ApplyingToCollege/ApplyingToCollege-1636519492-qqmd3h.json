  "text": "Hi all! So I need to self report my transcript, but I\u2019m very confused. I\u2019ve tried calling the university (University of Houston) and the office didn\u2019t really provide the answer I was looking for. I asked my school counselor-same thing. Basically, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed list the courses I\u2019m currently taking and label them as in progress for the entire year or only this current semester. Also, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to list the courses in semesters since that is what my high school\u2019s transcript goes by. I would assume so for the latter but I just want to make sure.\n\nTLDR When self reporting transcript, how do I list current courses and their grades? Do I list my grades and courses in semesters since that is what my high school goes by?\n\nEdit: My current courses do not show on my transcript so I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m to include them on the report for this semester only (or both) or not at all.",
