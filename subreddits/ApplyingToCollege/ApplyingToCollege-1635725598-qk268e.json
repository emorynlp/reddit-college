  "text": "I was planning on applying EA to MIT but one of my recommenders has been out of the station and says that they probably won't get to submit their rec in time. Does it really matter if I apply EA on Nov 1st vs applying RD like 10 days later? Is it possible to get my app moved to RA after submitting EA if I'm close to the deadline? Please someone here give me advice I'm desperate, sleep deprived, and stressed lol",
