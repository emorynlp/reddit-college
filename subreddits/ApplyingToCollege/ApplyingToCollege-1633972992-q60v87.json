  "title:": "UIUC MyIllini application Essay Wordcount Max Error FIXED",
  "text": "Howdy, gamers.\n\nThis is a fix meant for people that copied and pasted their essays into the MyIllini application for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) but it said the word limit was exceeded, despite word/google docs AND the website both saying it was under the word limit.\n\nTo fix this, download notepad++, if you don't already have it. Copy and paste the essay into there, go to the \"View\" tab at the top, click \"Summary...\", and it should tell you the ACTUAL word count of your essay. Please note that the regular notepad already installed on your computer (if you are a windows user) does not have this function, which is why you need the other application.\n\nIf that doesn't work, though, you can try to type in the first essay by hand into the MyIllini website, though don't be surprised if this doesn't work since I tried this first and it didn't work.\n\nIf none of these work, email  [admissions@illinois.edu](mailto:admissions@illinois.edu) A$AP (no Rocky) so that they can help you out.\n\nIf anything is confusing please comment down below or dm me.",
