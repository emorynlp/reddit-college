  "text": "Which would be a better university for Computer Science?\n\nI\u2019ll be a international transfer student from another 4 year university in the US. So, I just wanna make sure I\u2019m employable and the degree is not seen as 2nd rate by employers. \n\nThat being said, I know most of CS anywhere is about learning skills yourself and applying your knowledge by making projects. \n\nDo you get a lot of companies that send recruiters? (Non-Defense)\n\nPersonally, I rather avoid Lubbock because it seems kinda dead. I hear that Denton is fun. I also get mixed reviews about SA. Anyway, I don\u2019t exactly want to risk employability over trivial stuff (if that makes sense).\n\nI would be grateful if current CS majors and CS alumni to share their experiences with me.",
