  "text": "Hi! I'm a sophomore in High School looking to do a law or political science summer program/internship/research. For research specifically, I want to work under a researcher for social science, but I'm not really sure of where to start looking/what researchers to contact, so if anyone could give me any suggestions that would be great! Thank you! (either in person or virtual stuff)\n\nAlso school year activities would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I'd say its going to be very difficult getting anything research related. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't. Though perhaps a little different in STEM, I reached out to 80+ profs/industry people, and couldn't find any work, and only got research by being in the right place at the right time, which I wouldn't count on.\n\nA really good way to go is to volunteer for your local congressman, or, if possible, one of your senators. These positions are very sought after, so I'd suggest that you start asking people as early as possible. Show continued interest over months! If you don't get an internship with that senator this year, maybe they'll remember you and you'll get a job this fall or next summer!",
