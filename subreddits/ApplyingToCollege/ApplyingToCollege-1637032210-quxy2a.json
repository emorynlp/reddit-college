      "text": "There are a lot of very good biochem schools in and around the US\n\nObviously the top ones will be the prestigious schools such as Harvard, Stanford and MIT. But if you are looking for more cheaper options/easier acceptance rate here are a couple other good options:\n\n* University of Washington\n* Penn State\n* Rutgers New Brunswick\n* University of Michigan Ann Harbor\n* Boston University\n* University of Pittsburgh\n* University of Delaware\n* University of California  Santa Cruz\n\nIn regards for Human Biology, the same thing goes for the Ivy leagues being the best ranked for Human Biology programs. Here are some more affordable and practical options:\n\n* College of Saint Mary\n* College of the Atlantic\n* Purdue University\n* UC Irvine\n* UCLA\n* UCSD\n\nI wish you the best on your endeavors and if you ever need assistance or help with your studies, student first tutoring is the best place for you!",
