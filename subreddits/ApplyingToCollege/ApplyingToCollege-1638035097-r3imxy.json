Tied with Cornell and GaTech, just behind Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and CMU tied at #1,and just ahead of CalTech, Princeton, and UCLA rounding-out the top 10.\n\nWith an acceptance rate that was below 15% before test-optional came along (rumoured to be below 10% last year) it\u2019s probably not a safety school for ANYONE for CS. (Unless they can also throw a football through a tire 65yds downfield or shoot >35% from behind the 3pt line.)",
