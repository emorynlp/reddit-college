  "title:": "Effect of outside scholarship on admission",
  "text": "I have secured outside funding that will cover 100% of my college costs (tuition + room and board) at a select group of elite colleges. \n\nThis effectively makes me apply without requesting need to otherwise need-aware institutions (I\u2019m an international student so most schools aren\u2019t need-blind for me). \n\nI was wondering how much of a boost listing this scholarship in my applications will have in my decisions to top schools (ivies and the like).",
