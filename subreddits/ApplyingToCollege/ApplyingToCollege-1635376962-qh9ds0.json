  "text": "I have taken AP bio and AP chem in sophomore year but I\u2019m taking Anatomy this year and thinking of taking AP physics next year (senior year). I don\u2019t know if I should take it since I don\u2019t really want to major in something engineer or math based, but I want to major in something STEM related. Just not emphasizing on the math \ud83d\ude2c Should I take it? Or should I sub something else in for science credit next year (if so, any recommendations)?",
