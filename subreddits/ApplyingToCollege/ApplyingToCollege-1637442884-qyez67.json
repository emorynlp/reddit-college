I am one of the founders of my school investing and finance club, I attended a finance/economics summer camp, I trade stock myself with pretty large returns, and I\u2019m also planning on getting an internship at a firm over the summer. Do you think mentioning these things would make me a good candidate for unis like Nyu stern, Wharton, etc? Thanks a lot",

If your stats are on par w the schools and you have a few other strong ECs (even if they\u2019re unrelated to finance) I\u2019d say you have a decent chance",
