  "title:": "Is it a myth that AOs will stop reading your essays if they\u2019re uninterested?",
  "text": "It\u2019s something I\u2019ve heard frequently actually but idk if it\u2019s true. \u201cBe inspiring and original or they\u2019ll get bored and stop reading\u201d\n\nFor the sake of my own sanity please tell me this is a myth. Because if AOs ACTUALLY stop reading an essay they find uninspiring, that\u2019s just a massive embarrassment for the American college system...\n\nNot to mention that it would be WILDLY disrespectful and unethical for a reader to just toss an application when the student probably devoted HOURS to writing the essay in addition to allll the other work they\u2019ve done (AP\u2019s, grades, ECs, application fee, etc)",

      "text": "The essays are just one component of the overall application, and are treated in context with the other components... But at many schools like the topmost ones, this is your opportunity to stand out of the crowd and highlight your application - so having great essays can definitely help you in making your case...\n\nUnfortunately, the opposite is also true - having dull essays which don't really tell the reader anything additional about you would be a missed opportunity... Your AO has to take your application to the admissions committee and fight for you over there - unless your \"story\" appeals to them on a personal level, they just won't be as effective in convincing the others about your candidacy...\n\nTo answer your question, while they may not stop reading your essays (since it is their job), they might not be reading them with the passion that could help your application.",
