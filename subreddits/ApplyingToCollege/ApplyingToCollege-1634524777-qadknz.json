  "title:": "Applying ED to need-blind, meeting 100% need based school",
  "text": "To put it simply my EFC number is pretty low (004000). If I applied early decision to a school that was both need-blind and meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, would I be able to attend that school for 4k if I got in? How would loans play a role, I believe my direct loan estimate is around $5000. Would they make me pay in loans?  What does the loan estimate number even mean?",

      "text": "EFC is what the feds think your family can pay from savings and income.  It's also showing you that you qualify for a subsidized direct loan that you can take from the government.  It's not the same as the aid estimate from a college or university.\n\nUse the school's net price calculator, as they may evaluate your need differently than the federal government did.  The number that gives you should be a realistic estimate -- at some schools meeting need would include that federal loan, at others they meet your need with no loans required, and other schools just don't meet all your need - if your aid estimate includes \"parent plus loans\" that part isn't real aid. The NPC should spell out exactly what kind of aid the school thinks you will get.\n\nIf you have a strong first choice you could apply early decision if that NPC number is affordable - not providing the aid they indicate on the NPC is a valid reason to withdraw from the binding agreement.",
