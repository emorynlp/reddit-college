  "title:": "SSN/SIN on IDOC for international students",
  "text": "I just submitted by CSS profile and received IDOC login details. The first page asks to list the SSN/SIN of me and my parents. Since I am not a US citizen, do I leave this blank or do I list my country's equivalent to the SSN?  \n\n\nI went through the IDOC FAQs and the video tutorial, but this question is not addressed there, so I was hoping for some guidance here. Thank you!!",
