  "text": "I have taken the SAT three times so far, and my most recent score (as of today) is a 1490 (780 RW/710 math). However, I really want to get into a school like Harvard, Brown, Hopkins, etc., which need at least a 1500-1520. I'm not sure if I should keep trying to improve my math score (I have always struggled with the math section) or just switch to ACT. I am a junior but it makes me sad that some of my friends got 1540s and super high scores like that on barely their second try, while I can't even reach that threshold after studying so hard and for such a long time (since sophomore year). I've exhausted all of the resources that I have access to. I used Khan, QAS, UWorld, YouTube channels, all of the College Board practice tests, etc. I even made a log with all of the mistakes I made and how I can improve. I just feel so tired and frustrated. I don't understand why I just can't do better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry for the rant :( please help i don't know what to do",
