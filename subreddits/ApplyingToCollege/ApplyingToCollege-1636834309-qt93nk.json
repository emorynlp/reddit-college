Amazing merit scholarships; you'd likely receive a $15k yearly scholarship, which would make the cost of attendance around $30k a year.)*\n\n\\-U of Iowa *(great location in a nice college town. Large public university. Solid business school. Generous merit scholarships as well.)*\n\n\\-Arizona State *(Solid business programs, so many majors. Pretty campus, rapidly expanding area. Awesome honors college; it provides a smaller college (6,000 students) feel within a large (50,000) university. Generous merit scholarships.)*\n\n**High Target (50-80% chance depending on the school):**\n\n\\-UW Madison *(You're probably familiar with the MN-WI tuition exchange program. You get in-state tuition at UW Madison. You've definitely heard of it too; great large university, great business school, awesome location.)*\n\n\\-U of Minnesota Twin-Cities *(Solid business school, in-state for you, so it'd be inexpensive, great recruiting and large alumni groups much like the other first 4 schools on this list.)*\n\n\\-Indiana University *(You need to petition to be a direct admit. Great business school, gorgeous campus, nice college town location, and it's a large public university.)*\n\n\\-Syracuse University *(this is where I got too lazy to write descriptions. lmfao)*\n\n\\-Michigan State\n\n\\-FORDHAM! <--- if you get anything out of this list, it's that you should apply to Fordham. Great business school, especially for finance.\n\n**Low Target (20-50% chance depending on the school):**\n\nOhio State, GWU, Santa Clara, Villanova (last 2 are on the smaller side of \"medium/large\" at around 5k students.)\n\n**Reach (1-20% chance depending on the school)**\n\nBoston College, Northeastern, BU, NYU, USC (Southern California). Given your stats, I would not submit your test scores if you choose to apply to any of these.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. Obviously, this was a lot of schools. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look them up online, look at their majors, look at them on Google Maps to explore the campus and surrounding area. I hope this helps! :)",
