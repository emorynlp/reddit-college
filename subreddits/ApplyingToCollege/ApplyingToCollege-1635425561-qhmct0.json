  "text": "So this is a follow-up to a previous post. Basically, I'm eligible to get a full ride due to my family income being under 60k at a few colleges (if I get in). But my family can pay about 5k, and I want to put that value in the CSS coz I'm applying to other need aware colleges too. So basically my question is: Can I get a full ride (if I get in) at these colleges even if I didn't ask for one due to their 60k pledges? Do you guys know any cases where this happened to someone?",
