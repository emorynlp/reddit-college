  "text": "Hi! There are 1-2 schools on my list that only allow for ONE core teacher recommendation, but I have two teachers writing recs. I'm having trouble weighing the options:\n\nTeacher 1:\n\n\\- Writes EXCELLENT letters (incredibly individualized + representative of who I am)\n\n\\- Told me I am one of the few students that they are excited to write about\n\n\\- Caveat: is a 10th grade, non-AP teacher\n\nTeacher 2:\n\n\\- They like me but I\"m incredibly iffy about how they write and what they will write\n\n\\- However... they are a teacher I've had both in 11-12 and teaches and they teach AP classes that are very relevant to my major\n\nI don't know how much the grade level and course level matter to colleges. Does that outweigh content? :(\n\nTLDR: Can't decide between sophomore, non-AP teacher who will write a really good letter vs. a junior/senior, major-related AP teacher who may not write well.",
