  "text": "No one where I live goes to an Ivy League school or any T20 really. I\u2019ve never met a T20 student or graduate in my life. The only depictions I\u2019ve seen of them have been in movies and college lifestyle videos.\n\nHow does a kid who gets into Harvard even behave? Seriously, are they like young super humans in teenage bodies? For some reason, I can\u2019t picture them as regular teenagers with feelings and crushes and insecurities. I just picture them as inhumanely successful automations for some reason.",

              "text": "nah, they are normal just like any other kids. The difference is they probably have a strong emphasis on studying and academic performance. So usual teenagers go out partying, they probably stay to study. They are still normal though, like they enjoy movies, some play video games, etc. \n\nIn terms of insecurity, imposter syndrome is huge at these top schools.",

You don't need to be the prom queen, etc. But generally even for top schools, people are sociable, even at the most engineering focused school like MIT. They are not full of antisocial kids.\n\nLike, doesn't matter how smart you are, you can't make it far in life without knowing how to interact with other people. There are few job, if any, that doesn't require you to communicate with others.\n\nBut ivy probably has focus on popularity slightly more other than top schools (at least HYP) due to their emphasis on leadership experience.",

They\u2019re normal people, but they\u2019re realer and more brilliant than anything. They can handle the rigor because they have lives beyond school! They have crushes and insecurities and they\u2019re genuine and wonderful people to be around as well. I\u2019ve spent more time ice skating with them and laughing during SciOly competitions with them than poring over textbooks (except they still simultaneously baffle me with their skills).

As a huge (better word might be \u201cfanatic\u201d) college football fan, I always start by asking where they went to school - hoping to break the ice, talk about sports or what it was like to go to school where they went. I\u2019ve had folks from small LACs to UC Berkley to Liberty\u2026everywhere.   \nOne I had from Yale - vibrant, well spoken, conversational, confident. Did very well in the program. Very impressive.   \nThis past week I had a Harvard grad - couldn\u2019t look me in the eyes when talking, nervous, actually had kind of a hard time completing the tasks we set out to do. Not the same as Yale above.   \nSmall sample size, I know, but it just goes to show, just because Ivy (spec HPY), doesn\u2019t mean shitting excellence. In fact in what I do, the college RARELY has any bearing on performance...much less personality.",
