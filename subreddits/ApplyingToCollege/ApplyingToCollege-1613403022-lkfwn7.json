It's on a volunteer basis. A lot of people do it to keep a pulse on their alma mater, but I think a lot of people also do it to simply talk to current high school students. I'm one of the latter, and I always make it a point to tell the interviewee that I consider it a privilege for me that they're giving up 30-45 minutes of their time to talk to me (because it really is -- speaking with someone in school right now during COVID is fascinating), and they're often speechless, as if it's the first time someone is telling them that their time is no less valuable than an \"adult's\". \n\nThat's all part of maturing and as you take on more responsibility, learning that your value is not intrinsically more or less than your teacher's just because they happened to be born a few decades before you.",

      "text": "Tips to be not annoying when asking for a letter of recommendation, from a teacher who is often asked to write letters of recommendation:\n\n1. Ask at least 2 weeks in advance of when you need the letter, ideally 4.\n\n2. When you ask, include your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or activity sheet with the request.\n\n3. Give a little bit of context about what you need the letter for. If there is a form to fill out instead of a letter tell us in advance so we don\u2019t write the whole letter then figure out it\u2019s not what the school/scholarship wants.\n\n4. Send a reminder email 1 week before you need the letter and again 3 days before you need the letter if it hasn\u2019t yet been completed.\n\n5. Don\u2019t ask a teacher if you were a complete knucklehead in their class. It\u2019s okay if you weren\u2019t particularly close to the teacher, but if you were actively annoying or disruptive that\u2019s a no-go.\n\n6. Ask the teacher via email or in person and get a \u201cyes\u201d response before sending the request out via Common App or whatever other platform you are using. Once you get a yes response, add your recommender to the app ASAP.",

      "text": "So, I'm a parent and not a student but I watched my child deal with the exact same feelings for a summer program LOR a couple of years ago:\n\n1.  It's totally normal to feel this way, these LOR are often the first time a student has ever had to make a request like this to anyone.\n\n2.  Doing them for a summer camp is actually good because it gets you experience with asking before you are asking in spring of your junior year for college LOR.  Always easier doing something the second time around.\n\n3.  I know it feels like you are imposing on the teacher, but this is absolutely part of their job and they do this every year.\n\n4.  Pre-pandemic, I would say ask in person.  In the pandemic, if your teachers have some kind of \"office hours\" or other way to connect \"live\" virtually, I'd do that.  It's just respectful.  But if they don't, it is 100% OK to ask by email.\n\n5.  Like many awkward/uncomfortable conversations, I think it's best to just get to the point and ask quickly. \"Hi Ms. McGillicuddy, thank you for speaking with me today.  I reached out to you because I am applying to a few summer programs this summer for budding etymologists and wanted to ask if you would write a letter of recommendation for me.\"   \n\n6.  After they say yes, and you've thanked them for saying yes, ask if it would be helpful for you to provide any information about yourself.  Most will probably say yes, and many may even have a form they use that they ask you to fill out (that's when you'll start to realize they get these requests A LOT...)\n\n7.  It's hard to go wrong thanking them each time you communicate with them. You would be surprised how entitled some students can be in their communications (well, maybe you wouldn't be, you go to school with them...).  A little gratitude goes a long way.\n\n8.  For college LOR, I think it makes sense to ask in late spring of junior year. Like April/May. Just in case someone you want to ask gets deluged with requests and limits how many they take, get in early.  \n\n9. If you've asked them \"live\", after they say yes and you thank them confirm by email, thanking them again (sensing a theme about thanking them).\n\n10.  One thing that is difficult no lie is how responsive they are after that.  This reddit has posts about teachers who are not responsive and posters that are worried they've been forgotten.  At the same time, this really is a part of their job and they are used to it and most of them are totally on top of it even if they are not responding.  So you have to strike a balance.  It's OK to check in occasionally.  Like for college LOR ask in the spring, and then check in again in September and as the date gets closer.  But asking every couple of days is counterproductive unless you are right up against the deadline and they are being nonresponsive.\n\n11.  Last thing, once you do get into a summer program, or a college you are excited about, let them know that it happened and thank them one last time!  Teachers really do get excited when their students have that success.  Will you ever know just how much the LOR did or did not contribute to that good result?  No, you won't!  But it costs you nothing to assume it did and thank them accordingly.  Consider it not just giving thanks to the teacher, but giving them some enthusiasm for the job (because LORs are a slog, particularly for popular teachers) and a way to pay it forward for the class behind you.",

Then you're kinda put at a disadvantage for how you were born because it might take longer to get to know you. That doesn't mean you won't succeed at college, though. The whole idea of having someone \"vouch\" for you seems kinda odd to me. If the person has good grades or participation in activities like sports, volunteering etc. and more importantly good results like a portfolio or essay or artwork or whatever it is that shows what they can do, why does another person's opinion really matter?! \"Yeah ABC College, Timmy would totally be a good candidate for your English Lit program. I know because I taught him chemistry two years ago.\" LOL",
