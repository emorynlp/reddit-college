  "text": "So for reference, I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but am planning on taking A LOT of college classes, not AP but like at my state college. I'm planning on taking/ have taken 8 math classes, 5 CS classes, and 4 physics classes after AP calc bc, CSA, and physics c, respectively. I might take more, might not take some, but for top colleges, like MIT Stanford etc, how many of these will i be able to get credit for, or if i can't get credit would i be able to test out? thank you",

A couple of others might let you test out of MVC. But otherwise, unlikely.",
