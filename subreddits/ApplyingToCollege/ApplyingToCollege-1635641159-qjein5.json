  "text": "So my parents are unmarried and live separately. My mom is my custodial parent and has \"head of household\" on her tax forms, my dad has \"single.\" But on the CSS it says \n\n\"If the student's parents each filed a tax return select 'Married, filing separate returns,' even if they were not married at the time they filled the separate returns.\"\n\nSo does that mean I choose that option? Why would they even give the options of choosing \"Single\" and \"Head of Household\" for that question if I'm supposed to choose \"Married, filing separate\"?",
