  "title:": "What should be in my Letter of Recommendation?",
  "text": "Hi so my counselor from a program is writing me a letter of recommendation for the common app and she asked me what i would like her to highlight about me, ideas on how to brainstorm what I want her to focus on? \n\nMy personal statement already addresses my drive/motivation and what I want to do in the future. For my teacher letter of recs, I know 1 of them is talking about how I interact with other students in the classroom and 2nd one is talking about how I'm a resilient person. \n\nI'm thinking of telling my counselor to talk more about my personality, the way I interact with other kids in the program that are some of my closest friends, my sense of humor, stuff like that. \n\nlet me know if you have any suggestions",
