An educated individual does a lot in terms of productivity and the advancement of everyone as a society.  If anything, it's selfish to not seek higher education. Those that don't actually put a negative outcome in terms of most indexes such as happiness, wealth, etc. This has been documented over and over.",

Soon everyone is no better off than they started although all have had to expend the extra effort.\n\nWhat if, to take an example from Caplan, everyone had one fewer degree?\n\nIn this world, employers in need of a top-third worker would only require a high school diploma. The quality of labor would be certified about as accurately as now\u2014at cost savings of four years of school per person.\"\n\n\n\nI'm on mobile so can't really write all i want to say but as someone that that is at a Master's level in a top 10 school can absolutely say with certainty that a high school diploma holder and a Master's graduate do not hold the same level of skillset, productivity output or equal GDP. contribution. I think a lot of people that don't get to a higher level of studies don't truly understand how hard it is. How you learn a craft to it's maximin.

In university, we learn with the purpose to later get a high-paying job. We have lost the purpose of the present. In university we should learn for the sake of self-improvement. \nIt\u2019s better not to preoccupy our minds with things that belong to the future and try to earn the maximum of the present.\nDeepak Chopra, in one of his interviews with Oprah says:\n\u201cThe most important person you can meet, is the person you are talking to right now;\nthe most important place you can be is the place you are at right now;\nnow is the moment that never ends.\u201d\nI want you all to remember that life is what we live while we\u2019re making plans. Enjoy it!!!\n\nPs: I know I am a little bit off the topic, but I needed to say it.",
