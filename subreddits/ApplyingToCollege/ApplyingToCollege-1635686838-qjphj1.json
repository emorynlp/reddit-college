  "text": "I am on a VEX robotics team. However, as I entered with no prior knowledge/experience, there is almost no way I can make it to the \u201cvarsity\u201d team. However, because of my fluency in the local dialect and experience in working on the spot, I kind of do the manager\u2019s job. I am just wondering if I should focus on my training as a member more, or should I shift my focus towards management. I enjoy the training a lot, but I also enjoy solving problems for others (which is pretty much managers do, to negotiate between teams, members, and other outsiders). Therefore I personally have no preference just do not know what to do. \n\n:-)",
