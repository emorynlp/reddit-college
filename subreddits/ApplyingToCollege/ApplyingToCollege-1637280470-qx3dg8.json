  "text": "For one of my supplements, I am writing about how being in the government headstart program for disadvantaged families when i was in elementary school taught me to appreciate things and now i give back to the community (some global initiatives that i made and donated toys and money to disadvantage kids). Is this a bad idea as my family income now is higher and i am no longer poor? (250k+)",
