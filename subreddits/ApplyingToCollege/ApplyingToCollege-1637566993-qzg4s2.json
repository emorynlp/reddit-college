  "text": "Man, I've been reading your posts and commenting on them for a while now. Most of you don't have a clue why colleges have these essays.  \n\n\nIt's not just some sort of hurdle that is just there to bar you from college.\n\nEssays are there for you to actually think about who you are and why you're going to college. \n\nIf you think that is a waste of time then think about the 4 years and thousands and thousands you'll spend on school and the tens of thousands you won't be making even with a horrible job.  \n\n\nThere are plenty of options to get paid decently well without a degree if all you want is money.   \n\n\nSeriously, \"Ask yourself who are you and what do you want?\"   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WhoIu9b1Gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WhoIu9b1Gw)  \n\n\n(I'm just an Asian dad with years of admission consulting experience and a daughter in college channeling some serious Iroh energy right now.)",

      "text": "Personally want to go to college so I can learn more about things I never got to learn in high school! I attended a science high school, and don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the education I was able to receive, but throughout my high school years I realized that I wanted to dip into subjects outside of STEM too. The only exposure I had to subjects like linguistics or arts were YouTube videos and my own hobbies \ud83d\ude14\n\nYou might say--\"well, why don't you just learn things by yourself/online?\" And I do! In my gap year I've researched and learned about so many new things, but over the course of last year (remote learning during 12th grade) and this year, I found that remote/online learning isn't for me. For me, school is just as much about learning and gaining knowledge as it is learning *together* with your peers. I was reading a textbook on STS (Science, Technology, and Society, my dream major!) and I remember being so frustrated I couldn't talk to anyone else about it. In school, I loved asking my friends and my teachers about random curiosities, and in contrast to that, the past few months have just been so sad and lonely. (Of course, if you like online/individual learning, good on you! It's just not for me \\^\\^')\n\nOf course, this all goes back to my ultimate goal of coming back to my country and serving the nation using the knowledge I've gained :D (I don't think anyone's ever heard of STS here, much less offer it in local universities, which is one of the reasons I'm applying abroad in the first place lol)\n\n(I basically just wrote an essay, albeit a very messy one, and now I'm going to save this for future reference just in case a college asks me the exact same prompt XD)",

          "text": "You sound like you're ready for college and that's the point! It's actually very straightforward.   \n\n\nJust make sure you dig deep and show you have a path in college laid out towards your goals/mission.   \n\n\nWhen students aren't ready they think it's some sort of trick question and they need some sort of gimmick or interesting topic or hook.   \n\n\nEveryone can have a solid essay if they're ready for college.  I think more students need a gap year to have time to reflect on who they are, what they want, and make a plan for the future.",

      "text": "Unrelated, but I love your username!\n\n___\n\nHonestly, I feel like I'm one of those people who are dreaming about college, but would have never gotten here if not for schooling (and hated schooling until very recently). The backstory is that I have an interest (robotics) that is almost completely disconnected from the school curricula I was exposed to, at least until 8th grade. So my life at that point was \"somehow get through school, and rush back home to build something or join a webinar or whatever\".\n\nEnter 9th grade, and enter me searching \"what is calculus?\" at 3 a.m. on YouTube (we wouldn't formally learn it until two years later in 11th grade). Well, for once, I had a tool from academics that seemed like it was built for the exact problem I was trying to resolve in one of my ECs. It let me measure the live speed of a robot some 90% faster. It's been all uphill since, and now I know that college has a lot more in common with my (traditionally non-academic) interest, and I can't wait to learn more.\n\nI've also faced trouble finding people who'll be strongly dedicated to teaming up on projects, and I am hoping college can resolve that (since I expect relatively more like-minded people there). And don't get me started on some of the university labs I've been touring through my tiny Google Chrome window. All of that fits in well with my now 14-old goal of running a company, that uses tech to solve societal problems, especially education and climate change if I can do it (ik that's kinda vague, but I want to wait till college before setting that in stone).",
