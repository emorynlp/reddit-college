      "text": "You don't need to wait to submit transcript and scores just because you haven't submitted the app yet.\n\nFor scores, check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for these colleges, it's getting late for scores to arrive on time, order NOW.\n\nFor transcripts, how long that will take depends on your high school. Some high schools ask/require that you tell them to submit the transcript to the college well in advance of the deadline. Follow your high school's procedure on that.\n\nFor almost all colleges, you can submit the application itself up until the deadline. (I recommend against waiting that long, as Common App and/or payment glitches can occur. Aim for a few days before.) One major exception is Penn State, which apparently has a deadline requirement for grades to input into the portal and there is a delay of a few days between submitting the app and receiving the login credentials.",
