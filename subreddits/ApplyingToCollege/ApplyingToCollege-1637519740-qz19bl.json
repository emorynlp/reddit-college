  "title:": "Reusing UC Personal Insights Questions As Transfer",
  "text": "So I am planning to apply to other UC schools as a transfer. I am mostly writing these personal insight questions with new ideas but I do reuse part of the content from my old essays that I wrote when I applied as a freshman. I really want to keep these as I find them still apply to who I am today. Would they mark me as plagiarism if I do this?",
