  "title:": "I applied for IELTS but am in deep trouble",
  "text": " \n\nso I applied for IELTS on 8th and selected 21st October so I could have received scores for November 1 deadline,\n\nbut my school decided to start the preboard(prelims) exams from that date and 21st is the physics paper which I can not miss, if I did my school would not provide me with predicted marks or any internal marks for the board. I couldn't really afford the IELTS but still managed to save and pay for it somehow, I emailed them called them like 30 times, and requested to change the date or just the time, but they said the test can neither be canceled nor be transferred. I could only miss this test and re-apply which is impossible for me financially. Talked to the school, they said they won't be giving any help as I had missed midterm due to covid and would neither provide midterm nor predicted score if I miss out on the prelims exam,\n\nAnother alternative is Duolingo, but I can't pay for that either as my family's annual income is around 1800 USD, it would mean the world to me If someone can help me get the test or tell me a way to get a waiver for Duolingo test. I searched the net for about an hour but couldn't find any help. Please help me I can provide the proof for income, my school datesheet, and my IELTS mess up screenshots, I can refurbish you after the 10th of November  \nPlease help me!",
