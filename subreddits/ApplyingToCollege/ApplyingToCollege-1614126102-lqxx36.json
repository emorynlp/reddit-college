I know someone who got into Harvard and Stanford who was rejected by MIT. It\u2019s a crapshoot. No matter what your parents say, don\u2019t let it get you down.

Only you know the amount of effort you put into being VALEDICTORIAN, are you kidding me? Like that's crazy amazing. I'm really sorry your mom said that, I hope she didn't mean it, but you gotta know you should be beyond delighted. Here's to us (me and everyone else on this thread and YOU OP) to going places!",

      "text": "DUDE honestly FUCK YOUR MOM!\nI\u2019m 23, so school is a little bit behind me and I\u2019m starting to get some perspective. \nHere\u2019s a bit of a story. \nI went to a rigorous and high pressure high school. It was an international school where most were in the honors classes over regular classes and then in APs over honors classes. There were like 3 periods of AP English and only 1 of Brit Lit if that tells you anything. (I was in the easier class that year because I knew I\u2019d only be able to handle one AP class that year and I chose Music Theory. I had been in Honors English the year before). \nThis was an international school, but I technically graduated with an American Diploma not an International Baccalaureate. So for anyone graduate who didn\u2019t want to go to an American college (like the kids that are from South Korea, go to high school in Germany, but want to return to their home country for university) had to take FIVE AP CLASSES over the course of their four high school years. That\u2019s the caliber of student at this school. Disciplined, studious, and dazzlingly intelligent. I went to American schools K-10 and my four years of college and holy crap I have never seen such hard working kids in my life. Everyone there was so fucking smart it\u2019s insane. \nI say all of this and it\u2019s just to tell you that what you have accomplished is insane. No matter how many APs you took (and you said it yourself, you took SO many) I can\u2019t imagine the work that goes into taking more than one. (I got a 2 in AP Music Theory and I\u2019m still salty because I got a cold and couldn\u2019t hear intervals and our teacher never prepared us to identify instruments by their sound! Whatever) \nYou worked so hard. And you KNOW you deserve this recognition. It doesn\u2019t matter if every other kid got Ds or if you beat the other kids by .003%. YOU DID IT! I am so blown away by your dedication and hard work. I have seen first hand the kind of focus and discipline that true academics have. You my friend are a scholar and you should be extremely proud of yourself. \nI\u2019m so sorry that your mom is mistreating you. Not only does it hurt by itself but it\u2019s so frustrating that she doesn\u2019t understand you at all. It\u2019s so hard to live with someone that won\u2019t communicate or appreciate you. But use this as a chance to remind you who you are and how awesome you are. If she won\u2019t tell you you\u2019re awesome, you have to! My mom doesn\u2019t tell me she loves me! So I have to tell myself that I love me. You will eventually leave your mom, but you will always be with you! You\u2019re the only lifelong friend you have. Take care of yourself. Appreciate yourself. Smile when you do something good. Be proud. Boast to yourself about how great you are. \nYou are so smart and incredible. I am so impressed by and and proud of you. You\u2019re mom is wrong for not loving you. You can do this. \nAnd congratulations! That\u2019s wonderful news",

My mom shits on me everyday for being dumb and lazy but I didn\u2019t have a social life because I was always working. It\u2019s no small feat being valedictorian and you should be proud of yourself regardless of what your mom says. You have to ignore the negatives and focus on yourself. You\u2019ll definitely get into an amazing school, MIT or not. If I was valedictorian I\u2019d be over the moon about it. If you wanna talk or rant or anything, you can talk to me OP :) wishing you great success in your life and to your future endeavors!",

It will become clear that what they're saying doesn't make any sense, and for good reason. You are intelligent. You are powerful. You are worth a damn.

I'm sure there ate plenty other top-tier elite colleges who would accept you. Just because you didn't make it into MIT does NOT mean you're a failure or a loser or a disappointment. \n\nI know you probably aren't quite looking for this response but, ignore your parents. They aren't the ones who took all those AP classes. They aren't the ones who put in the time and effort to achieve being the top of your class. \n\nYou don't need that kind of negativity in your life. Don't seek validation from them or wait for anyone to tell you that you did a good job. Your achievements are a reflection of your hard work, that alone is enough. The only standards you should care about are the ones you set for yourself because at the end of the day, only YOUR opinion about you matters.\n\nDon't let your parents ruin this accomplishment for you, because it's a pretty awesome accomplishment that deserves to be celebrated and enjoyed by you.

There are 24,000 high schools in the United States.\n\nYou literally did as good as you could have done, it's just that the people at MIT have to roll a twenty-sided die for each applicant. That's just the truth of the application numbers they get. They reject nineteen qualified candidates for every one they accept.\n\nYour parents are being stupid because they have wrapped their egos up in you, vicariously. It's a \"them\" problem, not a \"you\" problem.\n\nIf going to MIT is YOUR goal and not theirs, then you should know that what actually matters is grad school, not undergrad. MIT undergrad is a total burnout meat grinder. If you want a job that only requires a Bachelor's anyway, getting it from MIT just means you'll have a difficult time at college and then go work with people who had a great time at Colorado State. If you have serious Educational Ambitions, then you should attend a college that you like, focus on research and internships, and get your advanced degree at MIT (or somewhere else, because by then you'll see that what really matters is the specific professor and lab you're in, not the university.)",

You did awesome. Most people will never achieve that in their lifetime and you did it so that's something you will always have that can never be taken away from you. I don't care what college you go to - whatever you DO there will matter a lot more than just the name of the college itself. Get involved in clubs and activities or student government. Research something. Get a part time job. Volunteer. Do something to make your mark and contribute to your community and the rest will fall into place\n\nI'll also say this though - it's okay to get a B. Heck, it's okay to get a C or D or once in a while to fail too. I failed one class in college and still graduated with honors. Many kids with douchey parents like this who put too much pressure on them or judge their self-worth by their grades feel a need to achieve at super high levels to win their parents' love. My dad was like this. Once I got to college and realized, you know what - C's get degrees. I'm gonna do well but I'm not gonna kill myself. I'm going to enjoy myself too. I'm gonna hang out with my friends down by the river on a nice day and take a long lunch and enjoy a sandwich and read a book I want to read just for fun. We need a balance in life.

You\u2019ve made a difference to your peers. But even if it was just about the education, you\u2019ve proven yourself to be an intellectual top dog! That\u2019s amazing! \n\n\nHold your head up high. You earned this achievement. You deserve to have pride in yourself.",

When I told her I'm ok with second place and that 1st isn't a big deal to me, she flipped out and told me that I'm just \"too afraid\" to \"go for gold.\" Starting to feel like my effort to stay top of my class has gone out the window because she isn't ok with my 4.64522 and wants a 4.64523 instead.\n\nLet's congratulate each other for our effort because how we feel about our accomplishments is more important than anything else.\n\nTl;Dr: I'm in a similar situation and feel nothing I do will please my mom--unless it's breaking my back to raise my GPA by a minuscule amount to be first instead of second. Since we're both feeling shitty about the whole thing, let's congratulate each other! We work hard and nobody knows that better than us.
