  "title:": "Am I focusing too much on things related to my major?",
  "text": "Hey everyone\n\nIn my common app essay, I essentially discuss my curiosity for complex machines and how it has driven practically everything I do. I wouldn't say it is completely about my major (Mechanical Engineering) since I add a (hopefully) interesting twist to it. \n\nNow for a college with something such as a why major college essay, I obviously discuss a lot about the engineering aspects of the college such as the research and some of the engineering clubs there, \n\nNow, would it be too much to discuss one of the prompts, about a community you come from, and relate it to a community of \"makers\" ( people interested in engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3-D printing)? Would that cause me to focus too much on engineering in AO's eyes, despite \"making\" is a big part of my identity?",

      "text": "If you  can describe how being a \"maker\" impacted/shaped who you are today, then go write it. The colleges are trying to know who you are apart for your stats which alot of students will share a commonality with. If you believe engineering is your identity then write about it.",
