(Not a T20 school or even close, just a regular state school.) But I personally would like to see the financial packages before paying the deposit.\nAbout how long after deciding do they start disclosing the aid packages? The portal doesn't say.",

      "text": "Depends on the school, but it\u2019s typically February through April.\n\nIf a Google search, or a read of the financial aid site, does not return a result, you can e-mail admissions.\n\nFor example, searching \u201cpenn state  financial aid notification\u201d yielded\n\n>New students (undergraduate, graduate, or transfer) who have been admitted can expect an email on how to access your award summary if Penn State has received your FAFSA by Mid February.\n\n(Yes, an English teacher would mark this wrong. The current student section more clearly says \u201cyou\u2019ll hear by July, if we have received your FAFSA\u201d.  So I read it as you\u2019ll hear in February, if your FAFSA is in by the earlier deadline, not that your FAFSA is due by February\u2019).",
