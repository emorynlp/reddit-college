      "text": "Why not superscore, i.e. submit your highest section scores?\n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 Common App asks only for your highest section scores (and date), with no room for the lower ones.\n\n Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - using score choice, choose the two whole test dates with your highest section scores.",
