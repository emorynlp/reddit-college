  "text": "so i was going through discord and found a gc from like 2017 lmao (still a junior so i got time to clean all this stuff up if its bad) and found a decidedly middle school GC full of all sorts of stuff thats not exactly the most PC stuff out there, AKA stuff ScholarGrade said is probably rescind matieral if you send it after you get accepted. the thing is the chat is pretty much dead and everyone there partook in the activities, and also this was like 4+ years ago, and all of us are still close enough freinds that i don't think there's any chance of a rat but with college admissions you never know right  \n\n\nI have scripts ready to clean all this but its like 200k messages and I don't know whether it'll affect me enough to the point where I should clean all my messages.",
