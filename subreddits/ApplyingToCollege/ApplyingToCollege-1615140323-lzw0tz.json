  "text": "It was Rosa Parks (or whoever idc) who once said, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d To me, this isn\u2019t just a wall but a symbolic metaphor for the struggles I\u2019ve had to face throughout my life as a rich suburban white kid.\n\nLet me take you back to a childhood memory that is either greatly exaggerated or completely made up. I was in preschool when I first discovered my love of computer programming and web design. I vividly remember staring at the glowing screen and thinking to myself \u201chow can all lives matter until Black lives matter?\u201d\n\nThis is a great segway into humble bragging about my extracurriculars. I distinctly recall my first day at our school\u2019s Black Lives Matter club. Myself along with the other 12 all-White co-founders believed in the importance of equality. I could go into more depth here but I don\u2019t want to offend anyone so I\u2019ll just reduce the entire movement into a couple of vague aphorisms like \u201cequality is the soul of liberty\u201d or \u201cour only real prison is fear.\u201d Feel free to interpret these things however you like as long as it helps me get into your T-20.\n\nAllow me tell you a terrible canned joke now. Are you laughing? Good, because I\u2019m trying really hard to come across as likeable even though you would probably hate me in real life. No seriously, I\u2019m actually the worst. I\u2019m the type of student who asks you how you did on a test just to see the obvious annoyance on your face when I complain to you about my 98 percent.\n\nSo with all that said, please let me into your college. My self-image depends on validation from strangers when I tell them in passing that I went to Harvard or even better be coy about it knowing they will eventually find out later.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to go have a mental breakdown now. Bye!",

So we have people sit for an insanely proctored standardized test, but let them write their essay at their leisure over several months and do no checking to even remotely see that it\u2019s them that wrote it?

          "text": "That's how everything in admissions is. There is no part of the application that people without resources aren't disadvantaged in. A proctored exam will just make it worse. The people with resources will have more experience with typing, take lessons on how to type and faster, do practice on how to write various essays topics etc.\n\nThe point of the essay is to think and dig up your entire fucking life, survey it and define who you are. You can't do that in 2 hours unless you've had extensive training and that's something you can't have without, you guessed it, extensive resources.\n\nWe also have the thing people complain about with standardized test. Having 2-4 hours dictating your life. A bunch of stuff could happen the day or night before and even during said test that will screw you over.\n\nGrades and GPA are also very manipulatable. We know grade inflation is a thing. It is more likely to happen in wealthy schools, it is more likely to favour female students as opposed to male students and it is very open and predisposed to human biases even more so than essays. The biases include racism, sexism, ideology discrimination, dislike for disagreeableness (which is actually a good factor for success), transphobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, religious discrimination etc. You can pay people to do your assignments (course hero) way easier than you can pay someone to write a personal essay for you.\n\nCheating is also way easier in classrooms than say in a standardized test. It is also easier and less risky than plagiarism.\n\nShould we then abolish the use of GPA in admissions?\n\nI don't mind essays becoming optional, but you should never remove an avenue that makes the application more holistic. This will give rich people one less area they have to cheat in to completely cheat the system (which most rich people really don't do. They're rich; they've had access to the best schools and teachers and resources. What are the chances they'll need to cheat to have a more impressive portfolio than us) and give lower-income, more nuanced students less opportunity to tell their story.",
