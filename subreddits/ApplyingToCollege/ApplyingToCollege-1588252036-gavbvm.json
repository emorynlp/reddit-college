  "text": "this may be an unpopular opinion: but you CANNOT double enroll or pay the deposits at 2+ colleges to secure your spot. I have seen 16383993 posts the last few days of you guys saying you want to double enroll. No, you cannot do that. When you fill out the common app, YOU AGREE TO ONLY ENROLL AT ONE SCHOOL. Not to mention, securing multiple spots is a waste of money, and quite frankly\u2014disrespectful to the school. If you are smart enough to get into a top 20, than you should be smart enough to comprehend this. If you cannot understand this, (which many of you can\u2019t) I think you either lack common sense, or you need to make up your darn mind. You had plenty of time to make up your mind, but you have not. Everyone else is in the same exact boat as you, you aren\u2019t special. If I see another one of these posts I might tear all my hair out. If you are enrolling at more than one school I hope you get rescinded :) peace out",

Meanwhile you are waiting on one more step  with a job you love but have one more step in the process.   People have to make ethical decisions to accept the lesser one now and then not show up and  start it if the top job comes in with an offer.",

But there\u2019s also the problem of some diploma results releasing way after the deadline to commit (such as IB and A-Levels). Many people might be leaning towards a university that gives conditional offers (i.e. unis in almost every country not named the US), but don\u2019t want to be in a position where they miss their offers and have no alternative options. This is especially true with the uncertainty of the the grading system in IB and A-Levels due to coronavirus and the fact that many of these unis hand out difficult offers that are pretty easy to miss (Oxbridge and London). It\u2019s nice that in the US, most have the luxury of not worrying much about grades at this point and can just decide which university to go to out of their choices. But for students in diploma programs leaning towards the UK and worrying about their final scores, declining all their US offers is basically taking a shot in the dark in these times. It\u2019s easy to say that these people should just reject their UK offers instead, but these people are often looking at top tier offers from Oxbridge. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely fair that universities force students to commit before they have a full picture of their future, grades and all.",

I think most people are more worried about which college will open in the fall and whether or not it's worth taking loans out for online classes than \"disrespect\" to a school. I do believe it's better to just ask for an extension of the deadline, and most schools are very willing to do that nowadays. I myself have had to push back my enrollment date in all my schools because of changes in my situation due to COVID. I'm sure making a decision about which college to enroll in was always hard, but especially right now the future is extremely uncertain, and more people may be taking the chance of enrolling at two schools. Which I do agree, is not the best choice, but many people are just looking for ways to work around the changes happening right now.",

Like if someone enrolled at UCLA and University of Florida, if corona gets worse in California and a ton of people get it, it can very well go to Florida as well. Trying to escape corona is not a good approach, you can\u2019t run and hide from it. Double enrolling is not the way to escape corona. Not to mention it would be silly to base your decision that will last four years off of if corona is going to worse in the area or not. It\u2019s temporary. Also, that Fauchi guy said he fully expects schools to reopen in the fall so while he is not a fortune teller, he could be right potentially",

So there you have it, more people are getting off the waitlists than ever before. \n\nAlso I understand that corona can also affect areas much farther away, but enrolling in unis far away from each other reduces the risk drastically, and the risk of the university not starting on time is less than halved I bet. No one is \u2018escaping life corona, its a precaution. No one is making a four year decision based on corona, it\u2019s a question of college starting on time so people don\u2019t have to waste any part of their lives. \n\nIt is also very likely that the first semester is either online, or colleges move it to December. Check with your counsellor or any aos. I\u2019d rather go where the college starts on time rather than conducts study online. \u2018Right potentially\u2019 is not good enough for me.",
