  "text": "Does anyone have any experience (anecdotal or otherwise) with ChemE programs at the (applicable) UCs? I know Berekely is the 'best' for ChemE but from what I heard...it's not my first choice. I'm really not looking for a ChemE program that will make me suicidal. The other schools I'm considering are UCSD, UCSB, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, and UC Riverside. The ChemE program at UCSD also seems to be related to NanoE, which I'm not a huge fan of. I'd prefer a ChemE program with some sort of environmental emphasis but it's not a necessity. If you know of a ChemE program at a UC with a non-toxic environment, please let me know.\n\nAlso sorry if this probably isn't the most appropriate subreddit to post this to, but it seems to be very active compared to some other related subreddits.\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thank you!",
