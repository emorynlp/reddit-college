  "text": "Hi everyone! I was filling out the UC App and it's asking me to rank UCSD colleges. I wasn't aware of this, and the website the application linked to also had no information. Does anyone know where I can learn more about the colleges and rank them? Is there anything I should keep in mind with regards to safety, travel to my classes, etc? \n\nThanks!",
