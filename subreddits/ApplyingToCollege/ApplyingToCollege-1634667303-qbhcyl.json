  "text": "So I'm planning on submitting a violin arts portfolio / supplement to Columbia university ED. The requirements are 2 pieces with less than 20 min total time (I would definitely not want to use all 20 minutes though, maybe like 12 max). I'm struggling to choose between these pieces to make my portfolio. I enjoy all three pieces dearly but I can only record 2. All the colleges keep emphasizing to only submit a portfolio if you have \"extraordinary\" talent or whatever, so idrk. My teacher recommends I stick to Tchaikovsky and Chaconne, I'm wondering if I should perhaps swap one of them with a ysaye movement. I would not be able to get accompaniment for the Tchaikovsky at the moment, so take that into consideration.\n\nTchaikovsky violin concerto\n\nBach chaconne\n\nYsaye sonata 2 (2nd or 4th mvmt)\n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Idk know violin rep too well (ofc heard of chaconne, Tchaikovsky concerto + Ysaye's name thrown around but not any of his works except that famous one with the double stops) but if you can play all three EQUALLY well, I think I would go with your teacher. Tchaikovsky and Chaconne would probably show much more of your musical + technically ability, even though you don't have accompaniment for Tchaikovsky (which isn't ideal ngl)",
