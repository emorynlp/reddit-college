      "text": "So if I understand correctly, you want to transfer to a US university from your current one? In that case, I recommend joining subs like r/TransferStudents and r/IntltoUSA to ask questions. If you want to know about requirements/how to apply, the procedure will be detailed on each college's website. I guess the first thing to do is see a counsellor and build a balanced list of colleges that fits your priorities and profile.",
