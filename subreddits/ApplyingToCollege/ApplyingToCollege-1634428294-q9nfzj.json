  "text": "I'm gonna be blunt, I'm failing both of the AP classes I'm taking this year, and they're both closely related to what I plan on majoring in college. I'm thinking of discussing my poor performance in these 2 classes and how I learned about my limitations. Question is, will this sound reasonable? Is this ok for an AO to read? Does it just come across as making an excuse for (currently) failing the classes?",

      "text": "Are you thinking of a different major given this or sticking with the original choice? If the former then it might be a reasonable essay. If the latter then unclear how they would think not doing well in a \u201cclosely related to your major\u201d AP class would help your chances. But depends on the essay. My gut says, it will hurt you more than help.",

          "text": "I'm honestly kind of split. If I'm struggling this early, with a sort of prereq class, it will be much, much more difficult to pursue this in college. But on the other hand, I haven't really considered other, more easier majors to pursue. My high school course selections seem to work okay for my original choice and a possible different choice. My parents are suggesting I go into a less math-intensive major, like management, and my original choice was engineering. I don't know what to do.",

              "text": "Several schools don\u2019t admit by major or for some you can apply to their arts and sciences school (vs engineering). This is not to \u201ctransfer into engineering\u201d later but mostly to do something a bit more balanced vs. an engineering focused major. Having said that areas like CS, Economics, Operations Research, Stats/Data Science are all relatively math heavy depending on the school so think hard about it.",

                  "text": "My target school has some options, I can apply undecided, engineering undecided (meaning I want to do engineering but don't know which specialty), and specific engineering majors, like mechanical. The AO I met with a while back said that it's better to apply as engineering than completely undecided since it's harder to transfer into engineering than get out of it, but it's still an option. I'll think about it though. Thanks",
