  "text": "Is there a major difference in how people view ivies of different calibers such as Harvard vs Columbia or Dartmouth vs Princeton in regards to investment banking is it just a matter of working harder in lower ivy leagues to secure top jobs. Same question for entrepreneurial engagement and also tech with regards to tiers of institutions",

      "text": "I've taught both kids of a top-3 investment bank CEO, and I asked him exactly this out of curiosity.\n\nHis answer was \"absolutely not\". His interviews for any meaningful position consisted of either playing chess or taking a Math Lv. 2 SAT-II while taking the verbal interview, but he also said that there were steps of the hiring process that occurred before he saw any resumes.\n\nAll of these banks operate VERY differently in terms of hiring practices, though.",

He said that gardening indicates a methodical, careful approach alongside careful planning, and those were the traits that numbers and pedigree can't articulate on their own.\n\nOh, and by \"absolutely not,\" I mean that he genuinely didn't care where his bankers went to college. He had people without college degrees, people with Ivy diplomas, and everything in between.",
