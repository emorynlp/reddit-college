              "text": "Sure! It's been a bit since I was in high school, but for what it's worth, here's how it was done.\n\nAt the beginning of each week, I received a one-page schedule for each day, which was prepared by my mom who is also a university professor. In senior year, my day was scheduled from 8:00 AM until 4:00 PM with a half hour break for lunch and a couple of fifteen-minute breaks here and there throughout the day. For the first ~2 hours of each day, I did history, philosophy, and economics. For the next ~1.5 hours, I did AP physics. Then I did an hour of languages and an hour of music. Next, 1.5 hours of AP calculus. Before senior year, I also spent an hour or so each day studying for standardized tests. Then I had some odd-and-end assignments that took up the remaining time, or I had some sort of extracurricular language/music/sports lesson.\n\nFrom all the AP science, you may be thinking I became a stem major, but my day job nowadays is writing. So, when I was done with all that school, I usually sat down at my computer and wrote into the evening. I also read an unholy amount of books, usually between 50-100 per year. I was published 7x by the end of high school.\n\nWhile this description maybe sounds like I was way overworked, keep in mind that by 4 PM, all my school was done, including \"homework,\" and that I could usually finish early if I was diligent. Also, if I woke up one day and was like \"you know what, I'm not feeling it today,\" I could simply do my work on Saturday or something and take the day off. Writing and reading were free-will endeavors that my parents, though they are absolutely my biggest fans, actually sometimes asked me to slow down because I'd disappear for hours and reappear with raccoon eyes. I also got to travel a lot, both abroad and at home, and we would either bring school with us and do it in the car/plane or simply call it off and finish it later. \n\nMy experience is not representative of most homeschoolers, but I'm really glad I was dealt this hand. Being homeschooled allowed me to receive an absolutely stellar education (represented by top 1% or better scores on my standardized tests) and pursue what I really loved in life - writing. It also prepared me well for college because I got used to the mentality of \"here's the amount of work you have to get done, you can do it at any time as long as it's done and done right.\"\n\n10/10 would do again.",

My mom chose all my science and maths textbooks, since she was a professor, and filled in any gaps with her own knowledge. I also took free online courses from universities, and my parents paid for AP certified courses specifically for homeschoolers.\n\nIt's tough to give specifics because there was SO much.",
