  "text": "I'm 21 and this is my freshman year, I started college in September and I honestly love it. I'm so sorry if this was already answered, but I scrolled for a bit and didn't see anything though I am newish to reddit, so it's possibly I missed it lol\n\nAny websites for recommended scholarship applications? Or any recommended tactics for financial aid, like begging celebrities on twitter to sponsor your education HAHAHA ! Doing the FAFSA, they unfortunately include your parents income unless they're both dead, you're emancipated, or orphaned. I've been on my own since 16, never officially emancipated. My dad's dead, my mother doesn't financially provide, but I'm not eligible for my state's (PA) grant which would really help out. \n\nUnfortunately I'm not talented, don't volunteer bc I'm always working or at school, didn't really get into sports, and I graduated with average grades in highschool, like a 3.5 gpa or something close. When I applied for colleges my senior year in highschool, I had scholarships from RMU and Point Park, something like 12k per year, but I was in a bad situation at home and decided I should get my life somewhat together before I even think about college. I'm not sure what I'd like to do so I'm in community college with hopes of transferring out when I decide a major. Now, here I am. \n\nOfc I tried googling it before I landed here, but I can't tell what's real or could be a scam either trying to take my information or unknowingly sign myself up for more loans lol\n\nTL/DR: I'm a 21 y.o female, freshman, community college, looking for possible scholarship opportunities.",

      "text": "Here is a good article on avoiding scams: [How To Avoid Scholarship and Financial Aid Scams | FTC Consumer Information](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-avoid-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams).\n\nI recommend that you check out local community organizations and perhaps ask your school what familiar third-party sources they see. Some private companies have scholarships for specific programs and specific post-graduation plans. If you are performing well academically, you may qualify for a merit-based award if your school has a merit-based program. They may consider your performance after admittance. Good luck and keep a positive attitude: everyone's path looks a little different, and you'll be a stronger person after overcoming these barriers.\n\n^(\\*Opinions, advice, and content posted by \"nath\\_rid\" are that of the author and are not provided on behalf or endorsed by any third-party entity.)",
