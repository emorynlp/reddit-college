  "text": "My clown of a friend put \"certified cousin fucker\" in her application as an award/EC (one of those) awhile back as a joke but she just realized that she didn't actually delete it. She got rejected from all of her common app schools and accepted to only the UC's, where she did not put that shit in her app. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. But don't fuck around and act like a clown.",

Long story short, the only college I applied to early is the one I\u2019m going to now (UIUC), so basically the other 8 apps I did after I already got accepted there were a waste of time lmao. Funny enough, I also kinda pulled some bullshit with UIUC because, you know, their business school is actually *good* and *worth a damn*, meanwhile I cobbled my essay together in all of about 10 minutes. Needless to say they didn\u2019t give me it, although they still somehow gave me my second choice major even though I only spent about 2 minutes on that essay lmao",

Case in point, my old band director went to the site where the plane with Ritchie Valens crashed (mind you, this is in the middle of nowhere, Iowa), and he wanted to leave some little trinket at the memorial, but he didn\u2019t have anything so he left his school ID.
