Like should I even apply to the ivies or am I wasting money?",

              "text": "No. That is exactly the point. Especially when most public schools in the US have stopped ranking altogether, it simply cannot play a large role in the process. That's why OP should stop worrying and still apply.\n\nMy comment to OP, though, was implying that even if they did care a lot, the size and competitiveness of the school would justify the lower class rank relative to kids who got top 10% in smaller, less competitive schools.",
