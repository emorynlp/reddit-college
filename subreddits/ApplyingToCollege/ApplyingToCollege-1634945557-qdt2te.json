  "text": "So today I was talking to my counselor and stuff and we were talking about targets and my college list (the usual). Anyways, she said GW would be harder to get into but all of the sites I've googled for the acceptance rate have always been 40-42. Whereas American's acceptance rate is 36%. Maybe I'm completely oblivious to how percentages work, but how is GWU harder to get into if it has a higher acceptance rate than American?",
