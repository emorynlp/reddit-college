  "text": "Like some schools have very well-reviewed and ranked art departments, but it is not the most reputable compared to Parsons ect. If I were to apply to UC Berkeley for visual arts, is it easier to get into? Or do AO's think you're just doing it so you can transfer later?\n\nLol, sorry if I sound confusing.",

      "text": "I\u2019d say it depends on what you want to do. If you want to pursue a niche focus like fiber arts or furniture design, specialized art schools would be better, just because they tend to have the facilities to accommodate your practice. If you\u2019re not sure about what you want to do, though, or if you care about good academics, definitely go for the traditional universities. I\u2019m at SAIC right now, and while the facilities are great, the caliber of education is pretty low.",
