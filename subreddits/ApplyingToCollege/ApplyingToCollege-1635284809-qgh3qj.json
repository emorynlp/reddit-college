  "text": "International student here. Only a couple of the colleges I'm applying to require courses and grades, but I'm not quite sure what to put here (from grade 9 up). I haven't had formal graded exams each year, and those I have had are not marked for external use. \n\nMy transcript is going to be submitted by my counselor anyway. Do I actually need to fill anything in here, or should I say I don't have access to my transcript?\n\nThanks!",

The only results I got from those were the end of grade 10 (and are noted on the transcript). Then no grades in grade 11 and provisional in grade 12 (as on transcript). Is that still required to be filled in?",
