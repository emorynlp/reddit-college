  "text": "Ive heard the strategy of switching from a less competition major to a one you like will aid you in admission to colleges. If I were to do this what would it look like? I want to study finance.\nWould I apply as an anthropology major then switch to finance?\nFrom what I understand, engi and cs are the hardest to do this strategy on but I would love to go to a top tier uni for business.",
