  "title:": "Forgot to Send Self Reported AP Scores",
  "text": "Just did a big whoopsie and forgot to submit my self-reported AP Scores under Testing on the CommonApp.. I already submitted my applications without them for two schools Early Action (one Oct 15, other Nov 1st). I emailed both colleges about this issue, and I hope they don't think I have half a brain for making this stupid mistake. For one, I submitted them using a file on the college's portal where additional information: self-reported most recent grades as that were the only section that fit the criteria. I updated through another email that I had done this. For the other college (Nov 1st), I just emailed them because I haven't received a portal log-in email from them yet as I just submitted their app today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I worse off with this issue (In terms of applicant evaluation)? Will these colleges think I am inferior because I made this mistake in submitting the application?",
