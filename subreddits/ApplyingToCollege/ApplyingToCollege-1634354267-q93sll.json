  "text": "Hello! I am a soon to be graduate student, and I would LOVE to continue my education and apply for grad school. However, this requires at least 3 letters of recommendation from professors. A combination of issues arises: 1) I am extremely timid and have many anxiety and social issues, so I doubt not a single professor will remember my name nor my face 2) the past two years have been over zoom, and this furthered the issue of not connecting with teachers or being memorable.\nSo with this, I would be asking 3 professors that would definitely not remember me by name or face, and they would have to write a letter on a student they don\u2019t even remember or have any comments for. Is this normal? Is it annoying as a professor to receive this request from a student who you had no connections with??\n\n* I am a transfer junior and both years have been on zoom, and my UC required the letters to be from this specific school, meaning the teachers I did make connections with were at my community college and I can not ask them, sadly. So I feel like I have ZERO options on who to ask a letter of recommendation to.",
