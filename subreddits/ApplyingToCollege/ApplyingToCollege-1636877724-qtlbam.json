  "title:": "12th Predicted marks vs. real marks: How much difference is tolerable?",
  "text": "I'm in an Indian CBSE curriculum. My school submits 12th predicted scores to universities. As I scored 97% in 10th and 11th, and around the same in the 12th Unit test, my school gave me 97.6% predicted percentage (4- 99's and 1- 92). Due to covid, we have 2 board examinations this year. The first term boards start next week, and I couldn't study for it at all due to early applications of colleges.\n\nSo I think I will score really low on these exams and might not be able to even achieve a 90 or 85+%.\n\nHow much difference between the real and predicted marks can get my college acceptance rescinded?",
