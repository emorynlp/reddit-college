  "text": "Hey, A2C!\n\nI'm trying to create a CSS Profile account for my non-custodial parent, since he does not speak English. However, when creating a College Board account, it is asked for one's high school graduation date as a required field. My non-custodial parent did not graduate from high school, so what should I add?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Then add the school that requires the non-custodial parent. \n\nOnce you add that school, you will get a spot to enter their email address. I\u2019m not 100% sure (and college board staying consistent which how sucky they are) exactly when they will kick the email off to the parent. I think it wasn\u2019t until we actually submitted the form with the custodial parents information. Basically until they get that link, they can\u2019t do much at all.",
