  "text": "I was wondering if there were many colleges with high-ish(60-80%???) acceptance rates that have trans-accepting administrations. I don't mean the student body or the teachers(though this is very important) being accepting, what I mean is I'm looking for colleges that will allow me to go by a preferred name even if it's not my legal name, and colleges that will allow me to go by my preferred pronouns. It's also important that they give an option where they won't tell your parents. Basically I'm looking for a college that will allow me to live as close to being a cis man as possible, but also not notify my parents(there is a possibility my dad will not pay for my tuition if he finds out). Dorm room situations are also important, but to be honest I don't really mind what gender I'm put with as long as the other person is comfortable and won't bother me.",

They also offer some merit scholarships which can reduce the cost to OOS students (roughly 15% more than our in-state flagship would cost).\n\nOne word or warning, though:. If you set a preferred name at a school, they will use that name in mail/email to your parents.  This includes colleges to which you apply.  My youngest is also transgender (just lucky that way, I guess) and they put their preferred name and gender on the Common App and as soon as they applied, I got emails from multiple schools saying, \"We're so happy that Preferred Name applied to our school!\". My eldest didn't start using a preferred name until she started college, but even her school will use her preferred name when contacting us (for instance, the phone call to raise funds for the school endowment fund used my daughter's preferred name).",

Everyone on campus (students, faculty, staff) enters their chosen or preferred name in their 'user dashboard' and that is the name that appears on every document, roster, email, canvas, etc. I don't know how it works with payroll, but I assume it's the same or they will do whatever you want. Also, everyone uses pronouns on their email signature, zoom info, and business cards. There are gender inclusive restrooms throughout campus.\n\nAlso, no school can notify your parents of anything without your consent. You can put a FERPA flag on your account. Please chat with admissions after you're accepted or just call the registrar, and they can instruct you how to do this.\n\nEdited to add, you can DM me if you'd like to know the school or if you have more questions.",
