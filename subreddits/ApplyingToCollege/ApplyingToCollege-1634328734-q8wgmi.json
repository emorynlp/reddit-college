  "text": "I was wondering if there were many colleges with high-ish(60-80%???) acceptance rates that have trans-accepting administrations. I don't mean the student body or the teachers(though this is very important) being accepting, what I mean is I'm looking for colleges that will allow me to go by a preferred name even if it's not my legal name, and colleges that will allow me to go by my preferred pronouns. It's also important that they give an option where they won't tell your parents. Basically I'm looking for a college that will allow me to live as close to being a cis man as possible, but also not notify my parents(there is a possibility my dad will not pay for my tuition if he finds out). Dorm room situations are also important, but to be honest I don't really mind what gender I'm put with as long as the other person is comfortable and won't bother me.",
