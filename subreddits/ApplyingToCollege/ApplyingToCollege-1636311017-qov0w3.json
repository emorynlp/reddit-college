  "text": "Wanting to weigh my options since I'm going out of state for college and don't want to waste my money. I'm good at team work,  managing, teaching, and hands on work. However math is my worst HS subject, but I'm aware weak HS math grades aren't a deterrent. \n\n\nI've never been terribly interested in STEM but I'm willing to learn for the best outcome for me. Any advice is appreciated!",
