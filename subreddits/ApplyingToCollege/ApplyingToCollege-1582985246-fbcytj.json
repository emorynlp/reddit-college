The prettiest places in Tajikistan in my opinion, however, are the places in the countryside and mountains. Iskanderkul is an AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL lake that Alexander the Great visited. Also the Pamir mountains are worth a visit. \n\nIt will be hard to get around unless you know Tajiki or Russian but if you know Farsi or Dari that would work as well. People are quite hospitable but don\u2019t speak a ton of English (in my experience), so as long as you are fine with being outside of your comfort zone I would highly recommend.",
