I've been on the other end of friendships like this, and while I appreciated the intention, people telling me they were \"sure\" I would be accepted actually made me feel more alone in the process, because it meant they didn't really understand the unpredictable nature of highly selective admissions.\n\nNot trying to call you a bad friend or however you interpreted this, just wanted to try to show how this kind of support can have the opposite of the intended effect. Personally, I don't think it's worth the risk.",
