  "title:": "A Declaration of Independence against the Collegeboard",
  "text": " When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for students to protest the injustices imposed on them by an oppressive organization, they must declare the causes which motivate them to the protest.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students have the right to sanity, not getting ripped off, and decent educational standards. That, whenever any organisation in control of students becomes destructive to these ends, then it becomes reasonable to protest their injustices. To prove this, let us state the facts of this organization.\n\n1. The cost for the SAT is $47.50. **$47.50** to take a multiple choice test\n2. Hardly any multiple choice tests are released to students to study from. My calc teacher makes new tests and quizzes EVERY YEAR\n3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the college board so they make money\n4. The president of the college board, a non profit organization, made 1.3 MILLION in 2009. Over twice sal khan's salary at khan academy and more than the Red Cross president salary.\n5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products\n6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number\n7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free\n8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money\n9. For having multiple reporting errors in their [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqbkfe/fuck_the_college_board/)\n10. Having to pay $98 dollars to go through an AP exam (3 hours of death)\n11. In addition to these $98, students have to pay for study materials due to lack of resources posted online\n12. For playing mind games with students (you can send your score to 4 colleges for free before you get your score report or pay to send to colleges after you get your scores????? What??)\n13. For selling student data [College Board Search \u2014 Pricing and Payment Policies](https://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/licensing/pricing-payment-policies) without making them sufficiently aware [The College Board's Student Privacy Pledge Status \u2013 Pledge to Parents & Students](https://studentprivacypledge.org/the-college-boards-student-privacy-pledge-status/)\n14. Recycling SAT exams allowing for cheating\n15. Rush shipping is an extra $15. So they can ship it early but they don\u2019t just to milk money\n\nIn every stage we have petitioned to our oppressors, yet they have not answered our complaints. \n\nBut it\u2019s over now, I\u2019m a senior now going to college next year where I won\u2019t get ripped off with useless bloated costs. Oh wait\u2026",

And the classes are only a semester so you don\u2019t waste a year in AP English, you can just do it in a semester, get an easy A and take something else the following semester. \n\nScience classes are harder to build a high school schedule around because of labs so AP science classes should still be taken. But most high schools will let you take 4 classes on campus and then CC classes. Our local CSU even offered a program that allowed juniors and seniors to take 2 classes a semester so it was possible to take 3 classes at a CC, 2 at the CSU and then 4 at the high school. 5 college classes were a lot easier than AP classes and it was all for the cost of one AP test.",

If the HS students in the US paid $6k for the CB, they would have the same pain!\n\nI am not wishing US students pay 6k. NO. I just wanted to show how much $300 means for people in my country",

Secondly when I registered for my first SAT, a centre very close to be house was available, so I took that centre. Keep in mind I applied 3 months in advance for the test. Then one day before the test, CB emailed me saying that my centre has been changed and my new centre was at a distance of fu**ing 100km+. It was a total harassment. Third there was mismanagement at the centre. Students were discussing answers by going into the toilet and proctors were doing nothing even though they knew (and yes I did filled up the feedback form). And all of this is happening in a country which has a large (I mean very large) number of students who give SAT and apply to US colleges.",

AP tests aren't going to yield direct tuition savings for every student.  What if you attend a school that charges threshold tuition, instead of by the credit hour?  On such a campus, AP will only save you money if it shortens your study by a semester.\n\nThere are plenty of other potential benefits, such as getting into more interesting advanced classes sooner, or gaining flexibility to take some great electives, or being able to take a lighter load for a term or two so you can get more out of tough courses you are taking.  that's all valid, so I am not knocking AP at all.  I just get frustrated that AP benefits can be a little \"oversold\" to students and their parents.",

The amount of money I saved through AP tests was literally enormous. I think the reason most people still finish in 8 is because 1) it's normal and 2) they don't fully understand how much money they are actually spending per semester.",

Thinking of using this for something at my school, so if anyone else wants me to add their usernames to it, I'll add it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeclaration of Independence\n\nWhen in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for students to protest the injustices imposed on them by an oppressive organization, they must declare the causes which motivate them to protest.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students have the right to sanity, not getting ripped off, and decent educational standards. That, whenever any organization in control of students becomes destructive to these ends, then it becomes reasonable to protest their injustices. To prove this, let us state the facts of this organization.\n\n1. The cost for the SAT is $47.50. **$47.50** to take a multiple-choice test.\n2. Hardly any official multiple-choice tests are released to students to study from.\n3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the      College Board.\n4. The president of the College Board, a nonprofit organization, made 1.3 MILLION      in 2009. More than the Red Cross\u2019s president, a true non-profit.\n5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products.\n6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to send scores represented by a number.\n7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to obtain financial aid.\n8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from struggling student's money.\n9. For having multiple reporting errors in their examination processes, even when subsidized greatly.\n10. If a student does not pass the test, their year of work means nothing.\n11. In addition to the $98 surcharge, students must pay for expensive study materials.\n12. For forcing students to send their scores to colleges even before they know what they got, decreasing our autonomy.\n13. For selling student data without making us know about the process.\n14. Recycling old SAT tests on a regular basis; allowing for cheating.\n15. Rush shipping is an extra $15, which makes no sense compared to Prime prices and UPS postal service costs.\n\nIn every stage, we have petitioned to our oppressors, yet they have not answered our complaints. Many lawsuits have been shut down by College Board, and yet they affirm that they work for the good of the student. We have warned them about student dissatisfaction. We have reminded them of the circumstances of high school education. We have appealed to their mortality via email, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common goals. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of education, enemies in motive, in peace allies.\n\nWe, therefore, the representatives of r/APStudents, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these students, solemnly publish and declare, that these united students are, and of right ought to be free and independent minds; that they are absolved from all allegiance to Jeremy Singer, and that all educational connection between them and the College Board, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent students, they have full power to think for themselves, sleep well, not have to stress over exams, and to do all other acts and things which independent and free men may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our grades, our futures, and our sacred honor.\n\nPresident \u2013 r/Sarim_Aleem\n\nSecretary \u2013 r/Starronix",

The $12 to send scores and $16 for the financial aid reports are actually some of the most reasonably priced things you'll find a university offers in your college career.  Absolutely they're making a profit, in reality they're doing what any company would do which is charge you 2 or 3 times the wage a worker gets paid for the time it takes to complete a transaction.  And it's not just you asking for these things, depending on the university you want to attend, it's safe to assume thousands of people are requesting the same thing before each academic year and more throughout that year.  That time adds up.\n\nEdit: spelling error",

      "text": "Okay, we have to shore up your manifesto to make sure you've got a strong case.  Here are a few points where the College Board might poke holes in your argument--sharing so you may publish a stronger case if so moved.\n\n>The cost for the SAT is $47.50. $47.50 to take a multiple choice test\n\nSimplicity in scoring a test does not mean the test was easy to develop.  The College Board got where it is was by investing resources into test development, piloting, etc.  They have to make sure that their tests have validity and reliability.  So every test has some R & D invested in it.\n\nAlso, it's not just test development--there are also costs related to administering the test, like hiring proctors.\n\nKeep in mind also, for all the things that the College Board charges for.... it has activities and products that it doesn't get much revenue for (for example, waiving fees for needy students).  It needs to collect revenue to cover those things, so the prices on some products may be in excess than what they cost.  You make money on some things so you can lose money on others and still stay in business.\n\nYou might still  argue that the test is too expensive, but I don't think it's fair to argue that it's too expensive just because grading the multiple-choice responses is fairly straightforward.\n\n>For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products\n\nIt's not quite a monopoly.   You can take the ACT, for example.  Students who take IBs don't usually need AP tests.  Not every school requires a Profile (FAFSA is free)  You could say \"near monopoly\" and it would be harder to argue with this.\n\n>For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number\n\nThey are doing more than sending a number.  They are sending a number, plus all of your associated demographic information, in a secure way (to protect your privacy and comply with laws) formatted digitally in a way that works with the systems maintained by colleges.  It's not like they can write your scores down on a postcard and send it for $.27 (or whatever a postcard stamp costs).  Again, there may be valid reason to question the cost of this, but the basis should be how easy it would be for you and me to communicate a number.\n\n>To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free\n\nThey will waive it for families with extreme need.  Not every school requires the Profile, either.  \n\nI do get the irony here--payin to apply for aid seems perverse! However, the College Profile is seen as valuable because it identifies assets that the FAFSA does not.  Using FAFSA alone, some families with substantial means can qualify for aid.  The Profile isn't meant to punish people with need.  It's meant to make sure there are aid dollars available for them and that limited resources don't go to families with means.  If everyone got rid of the Profile, there would be less money for students who truly need help to afford college.  With any luck, you only need to send the Profile to a small number of colleges (only those who require it and who you are serious about attending) so the cost of this is not so onerous.  Hopefully.\n\n>Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money\n\nI don't keep their books, but it's unclear this pay stems directly from student money.  They also sell products to colleges, for one example, like Descriptor Plus and the Student Search Service.  Who is to say that revenues from those product doesn't help pay executive leadership?  And not every student pays for their own tests.  Sometimes school systems do. Many students have their parents pay.",
