  "text": "not sure where to ask this (sorry if this is wrong sub) but im a junior in hs set to complete my aice diploma with only one credit needed left, and i have 0 service hours right now. i need 100 to get the 100% paid scholarship for any florida college but i am curious whether i need all of those hours by the end of senior year or do i need to get them all during junior year. i definitely need like 40 hrs by the end of senior from what i know but idk if the time i finish my aice diploma has any relation to my hours.",
