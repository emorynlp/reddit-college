  "title:": "Am I in the wrong for not letting my mom read my essays?",
  "text": "I don\u2019t want my mom to read my essays and she even agreed that she won\u2019t, although I knew that she wouldn\u2019t uphold her promise because she never does. She shows no respect for my personal intellectual ideas and insists that she has the right to read them because she birthed me. \n\nI am honestly just annoyed that she always went back on her words, but now she\u2019s trying to gaslight me into saying that I don\u2019t want her to read them because I\u2019m discriminating her lack of education. \n\nWhat. the. fuck. I just don\u2019t think parents have the right to violate my personal space and give me unsolicited opinions, especially since they never helped me with anything before either.",

      "text": "Is your essay super personal where there are secrets you don\u2019t want her to know?  If not and if she\u2019s paying for your college, your application, I think it would be a decent gesture for you to let her preview it. Just ignore her comments because you ultimately have the final say when you submit. It\u2019s probably more aggravating with her holding this over your head otherwise.",

      "text": "If she's going to be paying for your schooling then, to me, that argues for the opportunity to give advice.  Not to dictate what you put \\*in\\* the essays, but to give feedback.  Why are you so adamantly opposed to letting her read them?",

      "text": "I completely understand, my parents have never been involved in my academics and I adamantly refused to let them see my essays because they are very personal and I don\u2019t feel comfortable showing them. My mom was also persistent in trying to get me to let her read them but ultimately I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with showing her and she backed off. And I know other people said to consider whether she\u2019s paying, but personally, I don\u2019t see how that has anything to do with reading your personal essays as long as you\u2019re letting her be involved with other parts of the process",
