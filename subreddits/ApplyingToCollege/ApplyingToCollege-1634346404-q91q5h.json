  "text": "I want to go premed, and I know that I don\u2019t have to major in biology; it\u2019s just what I think of first when asked about my intended major. I\u2019ve been hearing bad things about only having a biology degree if I don\u2019t get into med school, and it\u2019s worrying me. Has anyone else thought about this before, any reassurance? Is it really that bad (the truth, please)?\n\nWhat about majoring in public health if that would be better? or double majoring with biology and public health?\n\n(thanks for all the replies so far!)",

In other words, it\u2019s more risk and no reward from a premed/Bio major perspective. \n\nI had planned on doing bioengineering (applied as such) and then in summer after graduating HS I finally got around to researching what everyone said about the specific classes I\u2019d be taking  \u2014 hard, grade killer, expects you to know Bio + CS, covers too much (everything from genetic engineering to computer modeling to hip design), better to do it in grad school where you can specialize etc. \n\nI expect I\u2019ll end up majoring in Bio.
