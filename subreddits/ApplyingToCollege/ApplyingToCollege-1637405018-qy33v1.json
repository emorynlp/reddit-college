  "title:": "Out of curiosity, is anyone on here into lo-fi music?",
  "text": "I wrote my common app on the lo-fi community lol! Was just curious if anyone of you guys are into it. Lo-fi has honestly helped me power through my supplements too and I doubt I would be making much progress without it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who have no clue what I'm talking about, \"lo-fi\" basically stands for lo-fidelity music. Think chill beats, nature sounds, and auditory imperfections (scratchy records, tape hiss, etc). The music's great for focusing, especially if you're like me and listening to songs w/ lyrics can get you distracted! I highly recommend any lo-fi playlist (Google / search on Youtube) if you need to zone in for an essay, need something to calm you down, or just want waves of warm nostalgia flowing over you. On top of that, the lo-fi community is one of the friendliest groups I've ever met. Random strangers will become your well-wishers. For a brief moment, you'll question why anyone would ever call the Internet a horrible, disgusting place. The community is truly a gem in the rough - come for the music and stay for the people behind it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this post and good luck with all your applications!",
