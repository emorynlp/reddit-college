      "text": "Hey!\n\nAs a general rule, try to stay away from explicitly telling something. You can still \"show\" without it actually having to be a story if that makes sense. Perhaps I am misinterpreting what you are saying but you don't necessarily need to have a story and likewise, you don't need to \"tell\" the entire time. On the other hand, \"showing\" provides authenticity and a level of genuineness to your writing, and makes your bored AO lift his eyebrows for a sec (in a good way) to read through your essay. Good luck!",

      "text": "It's okay if it's not a story as long as it represents your traits. You shouldn't write \"this experience shows my grit and determination in the face of adversity\". What you did in the essay is supposed to SHOW that. Unless I'm misunderstanding what your essay is like. \n\nWhat is your \"idea\"? Is it a way of telling your traits? A metaphor? An anecdote, even if it's not written like a story?",

I see people do that, but after an anecdote (the famous [costco essay](https://www.princetoncollegeconsulting.net/blog/the-costco-essay-deconstructed)), so I'm not sure what it would be like to do just explanation, that too with a metaphor that doesn't really have anything to do with you directly.\n\nIt's better to ask your english teachers and counselor for advice.",
