  "text": "I was just minding my own business at my house when I got an email from my counselor saying she submitted my transcripts and stuff and I was all set to go. I went to check Common App just to make sure everything was done and was like re-reading my essays because I was bored and everything. For Indiana we had to submit a PDF for the supplementary essay instead of just typing it down in a textbox like most of the Common App schools. So like I download it and click on the PDF and it's a fucking Martha Stewart cookbook PDF, I don't know how the fuck I messed up this bad but I can't ago back and change it. IU was essay optional anyways so hopefully they don't hold it against me, but it would suck getting rejected from one of my safety schools because I submitted a cookbook instead of my supplement essay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: So quick update: I am going to contact my AO but there is one little issue, I can't find the actual essay I wrote (oopsie). Turns out naming everything \"Untitled Document(x)\" isn't the best way to stay organized, so for now Martha Stewart cookbook it is.",

Think about it: you can see that I'm on a gap year from my user flair, and for most circumstances, you should interpret that as being 1 year immediately after highschool. Assuming a normal 12-year school post 3 years of kindergarten starting at 2-3 years old, you'd place me at currently being 17 to 21 years old (imo even that is an unnecessarily broad range), which is pretty young. So it's not really adding any information",
