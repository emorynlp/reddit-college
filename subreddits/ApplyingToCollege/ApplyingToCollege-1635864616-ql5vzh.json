  "text": "I chose to go to a community college and I found that there is a Saint Louis Community College that is less than 12 minutes from where I live and it is 3221 McKelvey Road if u want to know.\n\nI was creating my account and it says which one, I didn't realize that there were more than 1 Saint Louis Community College but I looked up what exactly was the one I was going to but then it said that the community colleges are specific to one thing. Is that true?\n\nSo I can't just apply to the McKelvey STL Community College and apply to 5600 Oakland Ave(which said it was for I.T) and also it is about 20 minutes so does that mean I'd be driving 40 minutes 2-3 times every week???",

Saying you live 12 minutes from a specific address would make it pretty easy for someone to target you.\n\nTypically with community colleges they are one school with different campuses offering different courses at each campus.",
