UMD portal shows them as having been received on Monday\u2026 the day BEFORE CB says they sent them.\n\nNote: this was in September when there weren\u2019t a zillion other kids ordering SAT score sends. No idea whether \u201cvolume\u201d is a problem for CB or UMD.\n\nSchools match your scores with your application by name and birthdate; if your scores get to UMD before your application, they\u2019ll just sit on their server waiting.\n\nShould be OK.",

If you feel like they wont be in, email your AO. Cause I emailed my UGA AO that my scores won't be in by the deadline and she said as long as my scores will be in during the review period, my application will be reviewed. And worst case scenario, I'll be deferred to the regular decision pool. But again, this is UGA and not UMD so idk how similar or different it'll be.",
