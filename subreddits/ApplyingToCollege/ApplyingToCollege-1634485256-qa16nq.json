  "text": "Just as the name says! For some context, in my sophomore year, I helped a family friend in their campaign to become the district attorney of our county. This county is extremely conservative, and while I did not agree with the political perspective of this candidate, it was a very eye-opening experience that made me realize my interest in government, and law. In my essay and personal insight questions, should I mention this candidate's name, or is unnecessary? Am I just overthinking this?",
