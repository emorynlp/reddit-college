  "title:": "got feedback on my common app essay in english today and i\u2019m so done w/ everything lol fuck",
  "text": "oh my god. So I finished up my 2nd attempt at the common app essay earlier this week. I spent such a long time writing what I thought was a really fucking good essay and I was genuinely v proud of it and relieved to be done. But then in English class today we peer reviewed essays anonymously and the person that did mine didn\u2019t even fucking try. They gave me a shitty score and said that it was cliche, nothing special, and gave no reason for an AO to admit me (verbatim). And they left zero edits or specific constructive feedback. I\u2019m seriously so pissed rn. I was convinced they were wrong and just bullshitting the work so I stayed after to ask my teacher about it and he AFFIRMED THAT MY ESSAY WAS HOT TRASH. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nAnd yeah whatever I know the feedback is supposed to help me and I shouldn\u2019t be pressed over them being honest (idec if i\u2019m coming off as whiny or sensitive fuck it)  but jesus seeing this essay that I thought was *the one* get shit all over  makes me feel like it\u2019s me and my personality and interests that are lackluster and cliche and not worthy of colleges. And I don\u2019t have the fucking energy or willpower to scrap it and do it all over again before Monday but that\u2019s what imma have to do now. I don\u2019t know anymore. \n\nThis is mostly just a rant but if y\u2019all have any a2c wisdom to give rn I would rly appreciate it lol \ud83e\udd27. If anyone\u2019s in a similar situation,, we in this together i believe in u <3",

      "text": "hey, i know ur feeling rlly beat down but don\u2019t worry!! i would suggest get it reviewed from 2-3 more people bec not everyone has the same taste and that\u2019s okay! \n\ni\u2019ve been in a similar situation! i thought my common app essay was awsm but a reviewer said \u201cit won\u2019t hurt u but it won\u2019t help u either\u201d and that rlly stung :/. however i got it reviewed from like 2-3 more people and most of them had something positive to say, about the concept at least!\n\nif your english teacher has some constructive criticism or any grammar/structural changes, implement them, and pass it on to some trusted college ppl/AOs here on reddit. these ppl will give you the most accurate review bec they have no reason to be mean/nice to you! \n\nand even if you\u2019re consistently getting negative feedback, know that it\u2019s not YOU. it is tough to retrospect and write about your personality/life in 650 words when most of us don\u2019t even know who we are! \n\ntrust the process, keep editing till YOU are satisfied w ur essay.",

It's really hard to write well without discovering where you write poorly, and while you might feel terrible about it now, this means you're passionate about the quality of your work and improvement is forthcoming.\n\nBest way to improve is to keep writing and to keep revising. Good luck buddy, I believe in ya.",
