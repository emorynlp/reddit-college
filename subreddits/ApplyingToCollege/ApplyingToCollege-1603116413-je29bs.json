  "text": "Imma keep this short: I had the same problem last year, where I'd stare at a blank google doc for hours and get upset because I'd write two sentences, realize that my writing was bad, and delete it, putting me back to square one. \n\nThe thing about just forcing yourself to write, no matter how bad it is, is that you can revise bad writing. You can't revise a blank doc, no matter how hard you try. From personal experience, once I had word-vomited an essay, even if it was bad, it was much easier to edit to improve clarity, ideas, and flow rather than try to write something than the first time around. \n\nSo if you're still stuck--just start writing and worry about quality later.",
