  "title:": "Should I ask 2 STEM teachers for letter of recommendation?",
  "text": "I'm currently a junior, and I'm working on figuring out who I should ask for my letter of recommendation when applying early to a couple schools next year. I'll likely ask my biology teacher this year for the first letter of recommendation, since I know her very well from class office. Even though I've also done well in her class and I would like to major in biochemistry, I know her best from class office and I'm hoping she can speak about my other skills related to class office.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure about the second one. One option is my sophomore year chemistry teacher, who knew me very well and can probably speak highly about my curiousity and passion for science, since I shared with him some of the research I've done. I'll also be taking his advanced class senior year. However, he is my sophomore year teacher, which means that I would need to ask him in September of senior year when I take his class, and I also won't have been in contact with him for a year. I'm also not sure if I should have two STEM teachers, even though they'll be describing different personal qualities.\n\nThe other option is my history teacher this year. Other than doing generally well in his class and having occasional conversations, I don't think there's anything groundbreaking he could say about me other than typical qualities like polite and hardworking. However, this would be one humanities and one STEM teacher.\n\nSome other options that I'm considering include my medical class teacher from sophomore year, who I got along great with and she's probably the teacher I have the best relationship with. She already wrote me a glowing letter or recommendation before, but the issue is that she moved and I haven't been in touch with her since. The other option is my research advisor from a local university, who could also speak highly about my passion for science that I'm trying to highlight, but he's very busy so I'm not sure if he would have the time to write a good letter of recommendation. So in total, who should I pick for my letter of recommendation?\n\nTLDR:\n\n* Junior Year Biology Teacher + Sophomore Year Chemistry Teacher - good relationship with chemistry teacher, can speak about qualities I'm trying to highlight, but not sure if I should have two STEM teachers. The two teachers will be able to talk about different personal qualities.\n* Junior Year Biology Teacher + Junior Year History Teacher - decent relationship with history teacher in that I'm well-liked and work hard, but not an outstanding letter of recommendation\n* Sophomore Year Medical Class Teacher - she's the teacher I have the best relationship with, but she moved away and we haven't been in contact\n* Research Advisor - can speak well about my personal qualities, but he's a busy person",
