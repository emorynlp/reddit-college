  "title:": "Is outting myself in college essays worth it?",
  "text": "Basically what the title says. Im a nonbinary person but im only out to a couple of friends (I had a very unfriendly upbringing) and have no clue if putting that information in my essays would be worth doing or not. Some friends of mine are doing it and say it will give them a slight boost but I can't find info that confirms that.  I would prefer not to but im also not the most well off person in the world and any advantage I can get is helpful. \n\nany advice is appreciated thx!",

      "text": "if you feel like you can write a good essay on the topic that responds to the prompt well and you are comfortable with it I'd say go for it but I don't think the very action of outing yourself will offer an edge over other applicants but experiences/trauma from it and how it has affected you might but even then those have become cliche to some extent",
