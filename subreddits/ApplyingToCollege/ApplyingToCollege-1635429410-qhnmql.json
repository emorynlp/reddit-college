  "text": "Columbia's Research Supplement section states : Have you completed research with a faculty member or mentor in an academic discipline such as science, engineering or other academic interests (e.g., humanities, social sciences or languages)?\n\nWho exactly is being referred to here as a faculty member or mentor? Is it someone from Columbia itself? Or faculty from my school? Nowhere it is explicitly mentioned. Can anyone please clarify this?",
