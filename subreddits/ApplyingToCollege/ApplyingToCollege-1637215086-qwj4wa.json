      "text": "Just spitballing here but I would break it down this way: \n\nEducation/teaching quality: no difference.\n\nOpportunities: significantly better at T5 for a few disciplines (finance, etc.) and marginally better for most other disciplines compared to T50.  The rest are essentially equal for driven students.\n\nOutcomes: significantly better at T5 compared to the rest of T50, no major difference between the rest for driven students (though *median* outcomes are probably still marginally different even between T10\u2019s, 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s, etc.).",

      "text": "It can vary very little or very much, depending on the field.\n\nIn the humanities, you have tons of PhD students graduating every year and there are not many other jobs for those students. So, even at a rank 200-400 school, you may have an English or history prof who did there PhD at a top 10 or top 20 school for their area and is a known scholar. Thus for humanities and the arts, there is not so much difference.\n\nIn the sciences, there are more career options for PhD students and labs can get expensive, so you are much less likely to find professors at a rank 100 school who did their PhD at a top 10-20 school. That means the research, connections, and intuition (and thus your education quality and upper-level topics classes) of the professors vary more.\n\nIn business and engineering, the career options for PhD students are very strong so costs are high (high salaries in engineering + lab costs; higher salaries in business). That means the really good PhD graduates from top 10-20 schools who are innovative, intuitive, and good communicators go to industry or top 50 schools (and often they will still consult). Rank 50-100 schools might get the decent PhD graduates from top 40 schools and some from top 10-20 schools. By the time you get to rank 200-400 schools, they cannot pay competitive salaries so they are getting PhD graduates from top 100 or top 200 schools who know their subject less well and may be poor communicators. These differences drastically affect the quality of your education, the upper-level topics classes offered (or not), and the connections your professor may have to help you find a job.",
