      "text": "Value of certain assets:\n-market value of home/other real estate\n-cash\n-retirement accounts\n-other investment accounts\n-other things of value\n\n\u201cOther\u201d would include things like a massive art collection, collectible things like vintage cars, memorabilia, etc.  most people do not need to worry about this. Don\u2019t include the value of your normal household goods, cars for transportation, etc. \n\nSo now you have the value of those things. Equity is among the value of those things and then subtracting the remaining debt principal. So if you owned an apartment building you could sell for $1 million, but you had an $800,000 remaining debt balance, you only have $200,000 of equity in that asset. But if you had $1million of stock, there is no corresponding debt..unless you somehow borrowed to invest in that stock. So $1million of stock has an equity value of $1million of stock. \n\nOther thing to keep in mind:  some of the assets I\u2019ve mentioned above are excluded depending upon how the question is asked. A 401k retirement account is generally excluded. The value of your primary residence and it\u2019s corresponding debt principal balance is excluded. \n\nWhat they\u2019re trying to do is to determine what assets your family has that they don\u2019t necessarily need minus any debt you have accumulated to squire those assets.",

                      "text": "If your family owns their house, then they probably have some levels of assets outside of the house. Even if it is a month of living expenses sitting in a checking account. \n\nAlso:  pay attention to what assets are specifically excluded. Depending upon what you\u2019re filling out, they may want you to include retirement accounts, the value of your house minus outstanding debt on the house, etc. \n\nIf you have zero, then yes. The net worth should be zero. If you have $400 in a bank account but you have 10,000 of debt, then you have zero wealth. Or you could just put $400. If you\u2019re in the very lowest range of wealth, it\u2019s not really going to impact your award anyway. \n\nKey point though:  pay attention to which assets they are telling you to exclude in the notes. If they aren\u2019t telling you to exclude anything, then home value-debt + retirement/pension accounts in",
