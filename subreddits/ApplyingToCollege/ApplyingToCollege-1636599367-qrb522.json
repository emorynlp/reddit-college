  "title:": "Anything and Everything about Penn Alumni Interviews! [Class of 2026 Edition]",
  "text": "# Before we begin\n\n* I have been doing alumni interviews for a few years now. If you are an alumni interviewer, please feel free to make your own comments and suggestions, especially if your insight differs from mine.\n* Please do not make a post related to admissions/application/essays/etc. to r/upenn. These posts will be deleted (I'm a mod over there)\n* Before posting a question about interviews as a comment on this post, please make sure you first a) Read this entire post, b) Read through the Penn resources regarding interviews, and c) look over previous threads on interviews (linked in this post). It's very likely that your question has already been asked and answered.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nMost applicants to Penn traditionally get an interview. My general advice is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer (Penn specifically advises you not to). Your interviewer can tell when you do this, and it's super weird. You will not get any bonus points by sucking up to the interviewer--the process is about YOU not me.\n\n# How has COVID Changed the Interview Process?\n\nLike last year, all interviews this year will be conducted virtually. Penn encourages interviewers (the alumni) to set up video conferencing interviews, but phone interviews are still permissible. Penn has provided webinars/trainings for interviewers to cope with this new format, but they are optional. Penn recommends that alumni use Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams (lol), UberConference (what the fuck is this?), Google Meet/Hangouts/Duo. They permit FaceTime, WhatsApp, WeChat, or Telephone. Platforms that are not allowed include Facebook Video Messenger, Instagram Phone Call, and Snapchat Video Calling.\n\nThe interview assignment structure is **unchanged**. Interviews are still coordinated by region. Last year, due to tons of applications and the new virtual format, many applicants ended up getting interviewers from outside your region. So that might happen...but it doesn't mean anything. \n\n# FAQ\n\n**How many people get interviews?**\n\n>According to Penn, typically more than 90% of applicants are offered an interview. However, given the pandemic and the fact that everyone's life is a shitshow right now, I would not be surprised if fewer applicants are given interviews, solely because of volunteer availability. Let me make this clear: Interviews are given out SOLELY BASED ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY. If you do not get an interview, it does NOT mean you are less likely to get in, it does NOT mean that you application was pre-screened as bad. Similarly, getting an interview does NOT mean you are likely to get in or your application was favored. It's literally luck of the draw whether you get one or not.\n\n**When do interviews start?**\n\n>Some applicants may have already been contacted by an alum. Most ED applicants who get interviews will have their interview before **November 24, 2021.** Most RD applicants who get interviews will have their interview before **February 16, 2022**. Some applicants may have their interviews after these dates---those are just the report deadlines given to alumni. Once again: If you don't get an interview by these dates or at all--don't fret. There's literally nothing you can do but see if you get one, and if you don't, be confident with the fact that it doesn't mean anything.\n\n**Who conducts Penn Alumni Interviews?**\n\n>Interviews are conducted by Penn Alumni who specifically volunteer to do so. Region coordinators usually try to match applicants to alumni who attended the same school/program that the applicant is applying to, but this isn't always possible (and matching/not matching means nothing). I'm a College graduate and have interviewed with College, Wharton, and Engineering applicants. \n\n**Is the information in this post different if I applied to a special program? (Huntsman, etc.)**\n\n>Nope. Your interview questions may be more tailored towards the program curricula, but the process is the same. \n\n**How important are interviews?**\n\n>Depends on who you ask. Penn itself claims that interviews are very important:  \n>  \n>[*Yes. Time and again, Admissions Officers tell us how helpful the  interview report is as they evaluate applicants. In addition, applicants  say the interview strengthened their perception of the university, and  increased their desire to attend Penn.*](https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=6200#panel3)  \n>  \n>Most alumni/current students though disagree and believe that interviews will likely not be a deciding factor on whether or not an applicant  gets in. I'm in this camp too--I think Penn uses interviews more as a way to convince accepted applicants to enroll, but again, I don't know  anything. This isn't a reason to not care about your interview, but hopefully this should decrease any stress about it.\n\n**What do interviews know about me?**\n\n>We are given your name, the high school you attend, the city where you live, contact information, and the school you applied to. We do not get anything else, including test scores etc., and neither do the people who assign alumni to applicants. You do not need to send a resume to your interviewer (in fact, Penn tells you not to). Hopefully your interviewer won't give two shits about your test scores.\n\n**How does the interview process work?**\n\n>If  you get an interview, sometime between now and the end of February for RD applicants (November for ED, see above), an alum will send you an email asking you for an interview. They likely will give you a couple of time slots and suggest a platform (call admissions ASAP if your interviewer is a creep and wants to meet over Facebook/Insta/SnapChat, or if they want to do an in-person interview). Then you and the alum will negotiate a time and place. The interview typically lasts between 20-45 minutes. Some are shorter, some are longer. \n\n**Am I at a disadvantage if I don't get an interview?**\n\n>No. Penn tries to get everyone an interview, but sometimes this is not possible due to alumni availability. Not getting an interview has EVERYTHING to do with alumni availability and NOTHING to do with the quality of your application (please share this with all your paranoid friends). The volunteers that tell alumni to interview people don't see your test scores either (see question above).  So if you don't get an interview, don't freak out. Penn does not count it against you and there are plenty of people who were accepted even though they did not get an interview. However, this does not apply if you are granted an interview and you decline without a good reason  (i.e., not \"I don't want to\"). If you don't respond to your interviewer about why you don't want an interview, it's not a good look.\n\n**OMG Someone in a school got an interview a month ago and I'm still waiting, does this mean I'm going to get rejected?**\n\n>No. Read question above--your application was either assigned to an alumni that is working through a list, assigned to a different alumni than your colleague, or not assigned to anyone yet. It's entirely random.\n\n**Okay I asked the same question above and its been a week and still nothing, should I be worried?**\n\n>No. For fuck's sake. Someone else getting an interview and you not getting one has no bearing on the quality of either of your applications. Those who decide who gets assigned an interview first and those that don't do not see your application details whatsoever. NOT getting an interview does not mean you can't get in. GETTING an interview does not mean you have a  better chance of getting in.\n\n**Still haven't heard anything. Should I be concerned?**\n\n>No. <3\n\n**What should I wear?**\n\n>Penn suggests that you \"dress as you would for a school photograph or a presentation in class.  Be comfortable and let your personal style show through so you can focus on the interview, not what you\u2019re wearing.\" Personally, so long as you aren't wearing pajamas, I won't give a shit what you are wearing. You might get some old fart that is offended by more casual-wear though, you never know.\n\n**What questions will my interviewer ask?**\n\n>See the section below, where I copy and pasted the suggested questions Penn gives alumni volunteers. Note that some alumni ignore these questions altogether and ask other questions that may be more tied to the program you applied to. Hopefully you don't get a moron that  asks for your test scores and irrelevant shit, but it happens. I typically start with some basic questions and let the conversation flow from there. In our report, alumni are asked to answer these questions:  \n>  \n>*What are the student\u2019s academic pursuits and interests? Why?*  \n>  \n>*What are the student\u2019s activities or passions outside of class? Why?*  \n>  \n>*Why has the student decided to apply to Penn?*  \n>  \n>*Is there anything of note, contextual details in particular, that the Admissions office should know about this student?* (I usually leave this blank)  \n>  \n>*What is your bottom-line impression of the student and their potential fit for Penn?*  \n>  \n>(There's also a specific rating scale, something like \"Not a good fit\" all the way up to \"The Best I've Ever Interviewed\"). You should keep that in mind during your interview.\n\n**Are there previous Reddit threads about Penn interviews I can peruse to see discussion?**\n\n>Yes.  \n>  \n>Last years threads: [https://redd.it/jn2hcp](https://redd.it/jn2hcp) and [https://redd.it/jn2lgf](https://redd.it/jn2lgf) and [https://redd.it/kshk26](https://redd.it/kshk26)  \n>  \n>2019 Thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/djbtbx/anything\\_and\\_everything\\_about\\_penn\\_alumni/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/djbtbx/anything_and_everything_about_penn_alumni/)  \n>  \n>[https://redd.it/ae0tsw](https://redd.it/ae0tsw)  \n>  \n>[https://redd.it/9m1h7w](https://redd.it/9m1h7w)  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/7pcxsw/upcoming\\_penn\\_alumni\\_interview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/7pcxsw/upcoming_penn_alumni_interview/)  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/7ugc8v/upenn\\_interview\\_on\\_friday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/7ugc8v/upenn_interview_on_friday/)  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/9l9frr/im\\_a\\_penn\\_alum\\_who\\_volunteers\\_to\\_conduct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/9l9frr/im_a_penn_alum_who_volunteers_to_conduct/)\n\n**What resources does Penn give to applicants re: interviews?**\n\n>[Penn Official Interview FAQ](https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=6200#panel3)  \n>  \n>[Some other Penn Interview page](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/what-penn-looks-for/interviews)  \n>  \n>[Advice on College Interviews from Penn Admissions \\[Video\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LZwH8uvaoM)  \n>  \n>[Principles of Good Practice (for Alumni Interviewers)](https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=9847)\n\n# Questions you might get\n\nQuick note:  You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes naturally (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says, trying to make sure I hit on all topics where I need information to write my report).\n\nIn short, you should be prepared to talk about who you are, what defines you, how you are a good fit for Penn, and how Penn is a good fit for you.\n\n**General**\n\n* Tell me about yourself.\n* How are you doing?\n* How has your current school experience affected the way you learn and think?\n* How have your goals for the future changed in the past year?\n\n**Personal Identity**\n\n* What do you think is important for me to know about you as a person?\n* In what ways has your family (and family life) been affected by the events this year?\n* Do you think your family, teachers, and friends know the same \u201cyou\u201d? In what ways is your identity different with these groups?\n* Have you faced any particular challenges this year, and how have you overcome them?\n* What\u2019s something really positive that has happened to you this past year?\n\n**Academics**\n\n* How has your current academic experience changed from previous years?  How have those changes affected the way you study, stay organized, and  interact with your teachers and fellow students?\n* How have you changed as a student, a learner, and a thinker in the past year?\n* What do you do to stay informed about the world around you?\n* Have you recently developed any new skills, ideas, or areas of interest?\n* Have you faced unexpected challenges or surprises during the academic changes this past year?\n* How are you maintaining balance between academic and extracurricular activities right now?\n\n**Extracurricular Activities**\n\n* How did you stay active and engaged this past summer?\n* How are you spending your free time?\n* Has the increase in virtual interactions led to any changes in your interests and favorite activities?\n* Have you discovered new things you like to do, or rediscovered old things in a new way?\n* What do you do to stay aware of the world around you (your school, community, larger region)?\n* How have you been managing your time outside of academics? What have you done to stay aware of (and connected with) your community?\n\n**Penn/Future Goals**\n\n* How have your goals for your future (college, career, personal life) changed in the past year?\n* Did you have the opportunity to visit Penn, take an online tour, or view the website? What stood out to you about the university? What else  would you like to know?\n* What led you to apply to Penn? Have your reasons changed at all since you applied?\n\n# Last Thoughts\n\nIf you are still here, I hope this was helpful. Please feel free to post any questions that aren't answered above or in any of the provided resources, and I'll try to answer them. Hopefully other alumni interviewers will do so as well.\n\nI'll close by saying: There is SO much to stress about these days. I promise you that a Penn Alumni interview should NOT be one of them. It's just not that deep. Take a deep breathe, and if you have one, be yourself, and if you don't get one, don't fret!",
