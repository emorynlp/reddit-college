      "text": "Did u guys work on it together? Since you\u2019re international from the same area, you will 100000000% get the same AO reading both of yours. And GT might be a school that does school readings back to back, so you\u2019re likely gonna get flagged. Either an auto rejection for both (if they AO is lazy) or your counselor gets a nice little phone call and you\u2019ll have to explain. The latter option is pretty dangerous, as it can have a multitude of school based disciplinary action involved. In my school, people have been suspended for plagiarizing apps, and some have been forced to email all universities letting them know they plagiarized/worked with someone else to do their apps aka unauthentic work. \n\nYou know how that\u2019ll go..",

Unless you\u2019re overreacting about what you mean by similar I highly doubt it can be that close if u guys didn\u2019t work on it together. \n\nLike do u guys have the EXACT same reasons to go to GT\ud83d\udc80",

GT already knows they have football and threads. They would probably prefer to hear more about how you'll fit into their campus.",
