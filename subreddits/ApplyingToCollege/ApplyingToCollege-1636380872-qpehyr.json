      "text": "You study for four years and get a degree in something.  Usually a B.A. or B.S.  That part isn't as important as what the degree is \\*in\\*.  Depending on the program, you choose a major and a minor.  The major is what goes on your diploma.  Other disciplines, e.g. engineering, typically don't have minors.\n\nI encourage you to to think about what careers might interest you, then work backwards and look at what majors are best suited to those careers.  Also, whether those careers require any degrees beyond the undergraduate level.",
