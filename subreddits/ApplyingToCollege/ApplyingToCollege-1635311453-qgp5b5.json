  "text": "There\u2019s two activities I have:\n1. I play in a prestigious youth orchestra and I\u2019m the only one in my section\n2. I work in a volunteer group and I\u2019m not the head of a department, but I\u2019m the only member of it. \nI want to bring in the fact that I\u2019m the only one for the orchestra because it kinda shows how competitive it was but I don\u2019t want to sound pretentious about it. And for 2. I don\u2019t really know what to call my position title because while I don\u2019t have an official title so I can\u2019t really call myself a manager or department head, I\u2019m the person responsible for literally everything except organization. I get all the work done. How do I word these?",
