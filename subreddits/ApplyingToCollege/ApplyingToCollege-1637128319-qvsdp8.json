      "text": "UBC and Canada are overall quite stingy when it comes to scholarships offered to international students. You\u2019re better off finding some colleges in the US, honestly. And getting into a college in Canada is just the start. Getting a study permit (student visa card) can be even harder (some 30-40 % of international students\u2019 applications get denied).\n\nEDIT: Although I believe UBC has got International Major Scholarship or whatever they call it, offered to exceptional international students WHO APPLY FOR IT SEPARATELY. So you can give it a shot.",
