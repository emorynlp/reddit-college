  "text": "So I'm going to use a common app fee waiver but what happens if you think a school accepts a common app fee waiver but they don't and you submit your common app? I don't know what happens after you submit the common app because I didn't do it yet but like, will it tell you the school doesn't use the common app waiver? will the school email you? will you have a chance to use a different fee waiver like nacac, or a college board one orrrr will they just tell you to pay up?",
