  "title:": "Do you need Olympiads to get into HYPSM? Some statistics",
  "text": "Take this with a grain of salt since I am just a junior who spent 20 mins of my free time doing this.\n\nI've seen a ton of people ask this question on r/A2C, so I decided to do some research and calculations.\n\nAccording to [this article](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/enrichment/), MIT has listed 6 International m Science Olympiads that USA participates in (there are a few more but idk whether USA participates in those).\n\nTotal number of olympiads participants per year = 32 (8 for IOL, 4 for the remaining)\n\nOut of these 32, there are quite a few duplicates: Geniuses who qualify for multiple olympiads and those who qualify multiple years for the same team (taking a seat from another participant). I would say a conservative estimate for the number of distinct participants is 20.\n\n1,241 US citizens were admitted to MIT last year ([source](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/)). So approximately 6,000 students were admitted to HYPSM. Which means that more than 99% of students who got into HYPSM did not participate in an olympiad.\n\nThe story for international students however is very different. There were 123 international students admitted to MIT last year, so apporximately 600 students were admitted into HYPSM.\n\nMIT claims that its students come from 118 countries ([source](https://web.mit.edu/facts/enrollment.html#:~:text=*%20MIT%20students%20come%20from%20all,territories%2C%20and%20118%20foreign%20countries)). That seems like bit of a stretch for 123 students (since 5 came from just India). I'm going to assume that the 123 students came from 75 countries (assumption).\n\nSmaller countries statistically participate in fewer olympiads, so I'm going to put the average at 3 olympiads (this again is pure assumption, but the actual number shouldn't be too different). That means an average of 8 olympiad participants per country.\n\nThat translates to 75 \\* 8 = 600 total olympiad students. Which means that all HYPSM international admits could be olympiads students, but that's not very likely. In India, most IMO, IPhO IChO and IAO participants end up in prestigious Indian colleges (IIT), while a lot of IOL and IOI participants tend to apply to US universities. I assume this is more or less true in other parts of the world and only 100 out of 600 olympiad participants apply to HYPSM.\n\nWhich means is HYPSM admitted all of these 100 students, there would still be another 83% of HPYSM admits who didn't participate in an olympiad.\n\nAll being said olympiads aren't the only prestigious awards. ISEF (fun fact: 75-80% of Indian participants at ISEF win an award), national awards, and bunch of other stuff still exist. \n\nWhich makes it harder for people like me who have tried for IOL, IOI and ISEF but just somehow manage to fail at the last step. :(\n\nThat being said, while international students have it a lot harder than domestic students, there is always room for people have normal achievements but great grades, essays and LORs. Hopefully this clears up this topic for once and for all (I very much doubt so). \n\nAnyways, have a great day and hope you guys get into your dream school :).",

I personally have an APLO medal and have qualified for IOL and IOI national camps. \n\nWhile these awards are obiously impressive, they're not as impressive as and IOL or IOI medal.\n\nBut I do agree with you, I wanted to give a uniform view for domestic and international students, so I stuck to just international olympiads.",
