They\u2019re not lazy but they prioritize other hobbies over school and then get angry when I talk about getting like a 93 on a test when I wanted to do better. Plus they bring up how the valedictorian is *so* much smarter than me (I guess to hurt my feelings? Idk why they do this) so at least u got valedictorian and don\u2019t have to deal with that.",

You\u2019re whining about not getting scholarships and wallowing when really it looks like you can\u2019t give any reason for actually having one. If you can\u2019t justify a scholarship with your academic rigor and achievement or other stuff like race or economic status, why should they just give you money?",
