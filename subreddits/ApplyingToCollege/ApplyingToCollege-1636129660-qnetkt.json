  "text": "My state school is Rutgers and i'm really overqualified. I have a 1550 sat, 4.56 weighted GPA, 3 seasons of sports, and enough extracurriculars. I got accurate enough info (I think) about my parents finances to run through the EFC calculator for a few universities and I got odd results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Williams - my EFC was 28k, and Rutgers in state tuition is 30k. Some places say Rutgers in state is 16k however. I would need this financial aid to be able to afford to go to a school that is not Rutgers. What is the actual price of a Rutgers in state education, and what are my options?",

              "text": "It is likely they will be pretty close for the options that meet full need, unless Rutgers has some merit scholarship to lower your cost.  \n\nThe NPC for Williams shows what they think you can afford, and they are the kind of school that you would expect to meet all the extra costs.  There are other schools who might have a similar estimate but not meet your need.  The net price calculator for each option is your best estimate, until you get an actual financial aid offer.",

      "text": "Your price is dependent on NPC which your aware of. Northeast public\u2019s would be more expensive vs southern schools generally. And almost never drop their price in terms of the percentage that privates do. Those numbers look reasonable imo, with state school giving you little due to your parents income(>100k I\u2019m assuming)",
