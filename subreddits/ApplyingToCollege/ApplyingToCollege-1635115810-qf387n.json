  "text": "In high school i was part of an early college program and graduated with a associates degree. After i graduated i also decided to take a gap year.  I plan to go back to college next year (going for bachelors or masters) but there\u2019s a question I\u2019m struggling with on my applications.  For questions like \u201cwhat is your current school level\u201d I\u2019m not sure what to put. The options are\n\n-high school freshman\n                       sophomore\n                       junior\n                       senior\n- college 1st year\n                2nd year\n                3rd year\n                4th year\n- graduate student \n-adult/non-traditional student",
