  "text": "Ik if ur racist or sexist or failing school but for what other reasons can you be rescinded?\n\nTbh I think colleges need to uphold free speech and people need to understand that a college only represents a persons education and nothing else so a bad person from a college shouldn\u2019t reflect badly on the college.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve heard stories about people getting rescinded from  schools for a variety of reasons. Some made racist or sexist jokes on their twitter pages. Also, posting pics of drug/alcohol use or sexual activities is also a great way to get rescinded.\n\nI think that students who post videos of themselves breaking the law or making inflammatory comments should not lose out on their chance to go to college. We all make mistakes. But of course, if you\u2019re using drugs or drinking underage or being bigoted, there need to be consequences. \n\nThe best way to avoid this is: *Don\u2019t be a bigot. Don\u2019t break the law.*",

You can scroll through this sub and see people not wanting to X college because of controversy. I also don't think this is unfair because it is reasonable to not want problematic class mates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I think colleges need to uphold free speech\"\n\nFreedom of speech in the first amendment protects you freedom **from the government**, not private entity (you can make an argument for public schools, sure, but they, in general, care less in this aspects anyways). If you are upset that college can get rid of you because you are in general a shitty person, wait until you leave college and work for a company. They are way less forgiving. College, in general, has a lot of freedom compared to pretty much anything else later in life.",
