  "text": "hello everyone ! so i really really messed up on my october sat, and i failed to get my goal score range of a 1400-1450+ :// my highest score is a 1390, and although it\u2019s higher than the average score of the schools i\u2019m applying to, i\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not enough to qualify for any scholarships. is it worth it to give up applying EA and apply RD instead to get more chances to improve my score?",
