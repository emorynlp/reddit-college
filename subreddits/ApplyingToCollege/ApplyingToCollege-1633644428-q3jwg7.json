  "text": "When I was constantly on here during app season, I would always joke that I should donate a building to get in.\n\nThe first few days after I arrived on campus, I snuck into the freshmen talent show with a few other kids who missed the deadline to get tickets. We spent like an hour trying to get past the security or find a secret entrance before we got in. We talked and got ice cream after, and I\u2019ve gotten food with them a few times since.\n\nI just found out from another friend that one of the guys is the son of a famous billionaire who literally donated a building on campus and is the world\u2019s largest collector of paintings from a famous artist. Having gotten to know him a bit, I suspected he was somewhat wealthy, but I had no idea\ud83d\ude33\n\nThen there\u2019s a girl I know from my dorm building who is like a math prodigy (RSI, international math awards, etc.) I don\u2019t know her that well yet, but I found out her dad literally donated the science and engineering building\ud83e\udd2f\n\nMost kids aren\u2019t famous or the children of super famous and wealthy people, but then there\u2019s these unexpected surprises. You eat with a kid in the dining hall and he might have some crazy life story you have know idea about until you\u2019ve chatted several times. And then there\u2019s just regular people like me, of course, lol. It\u2019s a wild world out here guys\ud83d\ude03",

He said \"How do you think he STAYS rich?\"  Which he meant to be funny, but there was some real truth in that.  \n\nAffluent people come into contact with many people who may be friends of one sort or another; it's neither practical nor good for group dynamics to shower ones wealth and privilege on your less-affluent friends.  \n\nOf course there can be some nice perks to hanging out with people of means who have access to special places and experiences - they may invite you along.  Enjoy that!  But no one should anticipate getting \"stuff.\"",

It can be very alienating. They often have no idea just how expensive some of their preferred activities are or how much financial pressure they\u2019re putting on other people who are already struggling to pay the bills. They\u2019re used to everyone else around them also being rich.\n\nMy partner is from a very wealthy family, and the cost just gets passed on. There are so many events with more intricate social rules and complicated dress codes. How are you supposed to dress when you\u2019re visiting someone\u2019s castle?! And how are you supposed to find a cheap dress that looks understatedly expensive? Birthday presents do tend to be very expensive things though!",

Ignoring the issue of feeling like you're being used or anything, there's also the potential for power imbalance. Just not worth getting into. My friend is very rich, they just bought a home that is worth more than my entire family has lol, but he'll always make sure to cover his accounts (goes both ways.) I used to be more \"generous\" with my money and I realised that it instead made me feel insecure at times (for above reasons). Much better for everyone to be on the same page and for nobody to feel like they're owed something or that they owe something.",

There are few billionaires, less who collect art, and even less who have kids who are freshmen at T10\u2019s\u2014I could crack that in an hour and extort the kid for breaking into a college building for a talent show. I\u2019m already pretty sure I might know who you\u2019re talking about. Same issue with the science/engineering building/RSI.\n\nThe wealthy deserve privacy too. Leave them alone; just because you feel starstruck doesn\u2019t mean you need to share it with them world. Sporadically deleting identifying bits of information as people point them out isn\u2019t going to cut it; there\u2019s still enough.",
