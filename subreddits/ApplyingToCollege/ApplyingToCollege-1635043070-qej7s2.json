      "text": "different schools have different policies, i did an interview for barnard way back in june because they're sign-up ones, while I have to wait for Columbia to get my application and eventually email me offering one, and that's if they even can do that. you're gonna want to do some research for every school and see what they say. \n\nI'm pretty sure colleges that offer them through email don't allow sign-up interviews and vice versa. if some do, i'd imagine signing up yourself would demonstrate some level of interest",
