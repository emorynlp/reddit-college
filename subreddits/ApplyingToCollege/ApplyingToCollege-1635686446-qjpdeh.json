      "text": "If the college accepts scores self-reported in the application, then self-report in the application.\n\nWhen their computer system takes in the score from the application, the computer system knows the score is from the app. If their computer system takes in an official score report, it knows that the score is from an official report. The computer system records this simply because self-reported scores will later need to be verified by official report for those students who enroll at the college.\n\n\"Show up on its own\" - not sure what you mean by this. A college would only get scores you submit, either in the app, portal, or an official report you ordered to be sent.\n\nAfter you submit your application, you will receive an admission portal where you can check that the college received your scores.",
