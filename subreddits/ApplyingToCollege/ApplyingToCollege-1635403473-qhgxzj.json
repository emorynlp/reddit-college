You gotta realize they have a lot of people to handle and it's really too much for one person, or even a few people to do. \n\nThey're a lot like public defenders. If you have to rely on a government-provided lawyer, you're probably not going to get the best court result.",

My counselor deals with everyone, and I can almost guarantee, after reading many of my friends\u2019 essays, that my essay is subjectively half-decent in a high school context\u2014especially when 2 seconds before my counselor probably read something from a 2.0 gpa student. However, the Yale student doesn\u2019t have exposure to shitty essays, and is judging me in a pre-conceived Yale context, which automatically makes my essay the most disgusting vile piece of shit he\u2019d ever laid his eyes upon.  But I want it to be good to everyone, so I\u2019m going to go the with harsh criticism of the Yale student\u2019s over the mindless lauding from my counselor, because I know the counselor is biased in a way that doesn\u2019t help my essay.",
