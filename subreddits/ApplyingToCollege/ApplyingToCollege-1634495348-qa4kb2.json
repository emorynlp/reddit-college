  "text": "My parents make a solid amount of money. Enough to finance me going to a public school in-state with pretty much no problem. However, they refuse to give me a cent unless I go to a uni that's within 50 miles of home, or one of the 2 farther elite ones in-state they want me to go to (UCLA/UCB). However, this means that if I want to go to any school that doesn't fit these parameters (my favorites and also 2/3rds of my list), they won't pay for any of it. This isn't as much of a problem until I considered that schools and the government give me financial aid based on what my parents make in the expectation that my parents will pay for a solid amount. But they won't give me money unless I go to a handful of the places they want me to go... \nI'm in this bind where I either have to bend to the will of my parents and be generally unhappy for 4 years or say fuggit and have to basically loan out almost all of my expenses. That's still a stupid high amount, even if all of my schools are public and in-state. What am I supposed to do here?",

      "text": "What you can personally borrow, by yourself, is limited to federal student loans (around 5500 for freshman year, 27k for four years). So borrowing gigantic amounts, in addition to being incredibly unwise, is not possible.\n\nYou can look at schools that offer large automatic merit to out of state students and see if you can swing those based on a combination of merit scholarship, federal student loan, and summer/school-year job. Examples of these schools include U Arizona, ASU, Bama, etc. Also check the WUE schools, like UNM, Wyoming.\n\nIt sounds like your budget might, at the very least, be limited to the cost of in-state UCs, even if you convince your parents to pay for colleges that are farther away.",

Definitely. Then it was please only go on the West coast. Fine. Then it was only stay in California. Fine? Now it\u2019s please go to UCLA or Caltech.\n\nI\u2019m obviously not getting into Caltech so my college list is 1 SCHOOL.\n\nLmao sorry for the rant this is frustrating.",
