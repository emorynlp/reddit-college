  "text": "context: i was selected for national merit finalist (my state's cutoff was 215 and i got exactly a 215). as y'all know you have to send in an act/sat score to confirm what you got on the psat. I took the act in feb 2019 and got a 33. however, nmsc only takes scores from aug 2019. so i took it again and just found out i got a 30 (i got a 25 on science, 35 on reading, 31 on english, and 30 on math). do i still have a shot at being selected as a finalist?",

From what I read online (at compass prep scholar and others), the qualifying score cutoff is usually at the commended cutoff or near it, so you should be good with a 212.",
