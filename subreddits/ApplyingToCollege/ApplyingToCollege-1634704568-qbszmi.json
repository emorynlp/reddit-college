  "text": "Good evening Reddit, \n\nI was hit with somewhat of a confusing blow- i got denied from Sac State as a transfer due to \"not meeting minimum requirements (A-G criteria) for transfer\", which is odd since I applied to 2 other CSUs and was accepted with no problem. \n\nI also made sure on my application that I had met all the requirements. Does this happen often, cause I thought all CSUs for the most part use the same admissions requirements.",
