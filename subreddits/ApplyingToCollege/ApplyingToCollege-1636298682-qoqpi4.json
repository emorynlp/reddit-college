  "text": "I slacked off HARD during my freshman year and got sick for around 1.5 month, so I had a GPA of around 2.7-3.1. Sophomore year I improved it mostly Bs with a few As then junior year one B and the rest As.\nNow, I take the IB program and has a predicted of 41/45 and also has a SAT of 1500+. The freshman and sophomore grades do not match my ability at all. \nDo colleges see this improvement as a sign of me working hard or as a sign of me not caring about school during freshman and sophomore year?",

If your councilor can write about your sickness, that helps. You need to write essay that show how you matured over the years - they know at this point that you are intelligent but does work only when you want. That is something you want to clear up in your essays.",
