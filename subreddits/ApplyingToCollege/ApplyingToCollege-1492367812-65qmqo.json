  "text": "When I was in about 3rd grade, this business man came to my class and promised to pay for our college tuition. We all worked incredibly hard for the next 9 years, only for him to come to our class a couple months before graduation to tell us he can't pay for our tuition. As compensation, he gives us laptop batteries and tells us they're lithium. I'm not sure what to do. I'm so angry and confused. I hate you, Michael Scott.",
