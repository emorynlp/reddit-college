  "text": "So I was initially planning on applying to a decent amount of colleges with early action. 2 weeks before... just 2 safeties because time was running out, I didn't want to give a bad app and mediocre commonapp essay for a reach school ... now I just decided to do them all RD because I kinda procrastinated with teacher recs. Is the higher acceptance rate thing with EA really true? Or do a lot of competitive kids do all RD as well? I really hope me not choosing to do EA with schools like Georgia T or UMich ends up hurting me.",

      "text": "At Georgia Tech the early action applicant pool is stronger because it's required for their scholarships.  Because of that their EA acceptance rate should be higher even if they give no other advantage for applying early - that's true at a lot of other schools too.\n\nThere are definitely schools where EA is an advantage, in the same way that rolling admissions can be -- some schools will fill their programs from the early applicants if they get enough qualified applicants.  Purdue computer science is a good example.",
