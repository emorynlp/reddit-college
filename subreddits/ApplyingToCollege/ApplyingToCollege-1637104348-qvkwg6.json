  "text": "part 1: ok so i already applied to three safety/target schools EA and one reach for ED. i go to a very competitive high school so my gpa was low freshman year w a strong upward trend in junior. i\u2019m not betting on getting into my ED, so i\u2019m relying on mid year reports to show colleges my 4.0 in senior year w 4 APs and 2 IBs rn. \n\npart 2: i have a D in health \ud83e\udd73. it\u2019s an online full year course run by my gym teacher where we have a discussion post every week worth 10 points (completion) and one 50 pt project. i missed the first week before i realized this wasn\u2019t an actual in person class, and the discussion post was locked two days later\u2014probably should\u2019ve dealt w that at the time but whatever. anyway that week was worth 20 pts for some reason but i thought i would be able to raise my grade. i handed in every other week and got 60 points from that. \n\npart 3: ok now it\u2019s a bit exciting\u2014the project was due a few days before EA deadline. i mayyy have posted it to the discussion board a week late. anyway i got a 100 according to the rubric, but he gave me a 60 for lateness. i respect the late point policy\u2014but this is our only project and it\u2019s worth the same weight as five weeks worth of discussion posts? now my average is a 63. also super pissed bc my friend handed it in the same day as me but got a 100 w no late points.\n\npart 4: i sent my teacher an honest email apologizing for my irresponsibility and how i kept pushing the project off bc it was an overwhelming week which ik is not a reasonable excuse. but i told him my tri 1 transcript is rly important and i don\u2019t want a D on it\u2014it\u2019s academic probation. so i asked for ways to do extra work or redo the assignments from week one. \n\npart 5: this lovely man talked to me in class today and said \u201ci understand how important this is but idk what u want me to do.\u201d he basically said his policy wouldn\u2019t change anything for late work. we have one more week left so my final grade would be a 68 (D+). he said maybe he could give me another 10 pt assignment to make it a 71 but bro i don\u2019t want a C- either it\u2019s HEALTH.\n\nanyway i have to meet him again next class. idk how much this C- would affect my mid year reports (health isn\u2019t included in gpa) but it still feels like a turn off to colleges. i don\u2019t want to mention my friend in case he drops her grade too and she realizes i told him but it feels so unfair. if u read all this ur a trooper but how do i handle this?",

      "text": "\nMany schools will recalculate your GPA & won\u2019t count health/PE at all, so it\u2019s not the end of the world. Even your school apparently doesn\u2019t count it for GPA!\n\nI\u2019d still try to bring it up to a C (or C- if that\u2019s the max) because a D is attention grabbing. You could put in the additional comments section that it was an online vs in person mixup. It sounds like the rest of your grades are great, and they will be much more impressed with As in APs/IBs than worried about your health grade, which in most schools is kind of a joke.",
