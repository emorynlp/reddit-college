  "text": "Hello All,\n\nJust went through my previously submitted application and I found an error with my FIRST activity. It was about working but the text says  \"Helped launch business during the pandemic. Assist in training new staff, interact\" and then stops. It's not a character space problem, I guess when I put it into the text box it got messed up. It's early and I want to fix it. How would I go about doing that? Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I did submit a complete resume with the full description. Don't know if that helps at all.",
