  "text": "I am very proud of the way my common  app essay turned out. I spent forever on it! \n\nI kinda neglected my supplements. Yesterday, I got my wisdom teeth removed and in my incredible genius, I was like lemme finish writing this. Essay went from mediocre to worse, but I was like \u201cyeah! this supplemental rocks! this is better than what god could write!\u201d AND SUBMITTED MY TRASHY ESSAY. \n\nLiterally, I was typing all my credit card stuff and was so damn proud of myself.  I remember just laughing and thinking that I\u2019m so ahead of the game (not really bc it was due today anyways). I even took a Snapchat video of me boasting abt my essay with blood poring from my mouth. It was like a goddamn scene from Scream. \n\nIdek what to do. I feel like a moron. I read the essay today and almost gave myself a heart attack. It\u2019s not bad\u2026. But it\u2019s definitely not good. The beginning of my essay is fine, but it all goes down hill after I started editing it. \n\nI\u2019ve been eating ice cream to console my mouth and broken heart.  \n\nTime to find a new college to apply for! \n\nLesson: don\u2019t ducking touch your college stuff when you are out of your mind.",
