  "text": "So I was ready to submit my early decision common app. I review my pdf and go to flywire to pay but it says the transaction failed. I go back to the common app and it says I have already submitted the application. I can't go back to flywire to repay the money, because the application has already been submitted.\n\nMy receipt says I have paid the money and my application status is submitted (I saw the confetti and everything). But money didn't leave my credit card and I know this because  I checked the log. WTF should I do? I have already contacted common app customer service. \n\nI'm so worried about missing the ED deadline. Fuck. Someone help me please",
