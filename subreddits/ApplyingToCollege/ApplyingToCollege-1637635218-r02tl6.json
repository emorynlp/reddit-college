  "title:": "How do I self-study for Math Competitions?",
  "text": "I have a Math Competition is 3 months AAAA and but I'm not getting much help from my school ??? \n\nMy math teacher emailed me saying I'm representing our school for this competition + gave PDFs of practice problems. When I asked her about preparation, she told me to self study for 2 months but we'll meet 1 month before the competition. But when I checked the practice problems, holy cow it was so difficult.\n\nWtf am I supposed to do? I feel so unqualified.\n\nRn my plan is to just answer practice problems she provided + find past papers online + finish AOPS vol. 1. Is that enough? \n\n(I'm in 10th grade now btw, and this competition is for 10th graders only.",
