  "text": "so my question is that should i be taking the APs or not. The nearest AP center to me is 250 miles away(India). The exam is also expensive with no financial help. Although I have good grades i am considering skipping it after seeing how much value it really holds. And i also read that colleges don't really want APs if your school doesn't offer it although i might be wrong. Please help",
