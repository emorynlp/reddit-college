  "text": "I\u2019ve applied to Georgia tech and I have to do some questions for financial aid on their website and one asks if I plan to enroll in classes during the fall and the spring. I know I will choose fall but should I choose spring as well? Is it normal to do that? How long is a college course typically? Is doing fall classes and then spring classes unusual? Any answers to these questions are much appreciated.",
