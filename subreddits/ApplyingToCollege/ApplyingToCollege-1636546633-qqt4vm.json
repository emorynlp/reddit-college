Take virtual tours. \n\nMake a big list of pros and cons that considers \n\nCost\n\nCost of living \n\nPrograms \n\nInternship opportunities (check out career center and program and ask about this)\n\nLiving opportunities \n\nVibe \n\nAnd anything else that interests you. Add to the list for a week or two and then you\u2019ll be able to see what feels most right to you.",
