      "text": "Troll through majors offered at universities you're applying to. See what sparks your interest. You can take Gen eds & intro classes to different majors. You can shadow careers you're interested in. Lots of googling, lots of self reflection, & asking people in the industry helps.\n\nIt is insane to make an 18 yo choose their pathway for life. Just do your best, know you can feel stuff out in college & change course.\n\nBusiness at my college is all the same stuff except for 20ish credits that differentiate MIS from marketing from accounting etc, so I assume most businesses majors are similar elsewhere.",

      "text": "General business is way too broad of a major. Finding a specialty within it is definitely better but the comp sci would really make you marketable if you can stomach it. Are you still interested in tech? Maybe finding a way to combine business and technology, like not exactly computer science. Check out something like visual communications if you\u2019re more interested in the design/psychology and marketing in combination computer science! Couple great programs I could recommend!",
