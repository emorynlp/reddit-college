  "title:": "How to make peace with rejection? Or get closure?",
  "text": "I wanted to take interesting and thought provoking courses in college. I wanted to learn about tolerance, peace, conflicts, politics etc. from teachers and peers, and grow personally. But because I have such mediocre profile I couldn't make it to a top school. Now I'm gonna have to take mediocre classes at an average university. I feel like I won't be able to grow, won't be the best version of myself. I know I can go for post grad but that wont be the same as ugrad right? How do I make myself understand that its okay to be average? Is there any other way I can learn from cool professors? Its all I think about. I cant get any closure. I feel like a failure.",

      "text": "There will be cool professors at every college. There will be crappy professors at every college too, including those \u201ctop schools\u201d that you\u2019re over-glorifying, seriously. Do you realize the sheer amount of work, dedication, and patience one usually has to go through to even have a chance at being a professor at what you might consider an \u201caverage university\u201d? There will certainly be things to learn from them that will be interesting, thought-provoking, and most likely well beyond what you\u2019ve learned so far. And while your surrounding environment certainly impacts you and your growth to a significant extent, ultimately a large part of that is in your own hands. Many people will go to Harvard and remain stuck up assholes. Many will go to \u201caverage schools\u201d and shape themselves into their best self. To increase the chances of the latter happening, go in with an open mindset rather than the way you\u2019re thinking now. You can do and become all those things you dreamed of even if you\u2019re not at a \u201ctop school,\u201d if you\u2019re willing to keep an open mind and actively seek out those opportunities. \n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, 1) going to a four year college itself puts you well above average\u2014statistically speaking\u2014in most countries, even in the US, and 2) being average is not bad\u2014it\u2019s literally being the *norm,* and thinking that you must always far exceed the norm will only put unfair and unnecessary pressure on yourself when other people often couldn\u2019t notice or care less",
