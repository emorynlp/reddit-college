  "title:": "\u201cI lead America\u2019s top-ranked university. Here\u2019s why these rankings are a problem.\u201d",
  "text": "This editorial is a good reminder to the ambitious a2c kids that ranks aren\u2019t everything. Sometimes it\u2019s assumed that those who say that are those who can\u2019t get into the top tier, but this opinion is by the president of Princeton University.\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/21/i-lead-americas-top-ranked-university-heres-why-these-rankings-are-problem/\n\n\nChristopher L. Eisgruber\nMy university has now topped the U.S. News & World Report rankings for 11 years running. Given Princeton\u2019s success, you might think I would be a fan of the list.\nNot so. I am convinced that the rankings game is a bit of mishegoss \u2014 a slightly daft obsession that does harm when colleges, parents, or students take it too seriously.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I am proud of Princeton\u2019s teaching, research and commitment to service. I like seeing our quality recognized.\nRankings, however, are a misleading way to assess colleges and universities. There are lots of great places to get an education. America\u2019s colleges and universities work collaboratively to educate the wide variety of people seeking degrees. Different schools may suit different students.\nFor example, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, and the University of California are spectacularly good universities, but they have distinct strengths, structures and missions. The idea of picking one as \u201cbest,\u201d as though educational programs competed like athletic teams, is bizarre.\nYet if ranking colleges is a dubious enterprise, it is also a wildly successful one. The U.S. News rankings attract tremendous attention and a huge customer base. Their popularity has inspired many imitators.\nNone of that would matter if rankings counted only for alumni bragging rights. Applicants and their families, however, rely on the rankings and feel pressure to get into highly regarded institutions. As a result, many schools make intense efforts to move up in the rankings.This competition produces damaging incentives. For example, some colleges avoid doing difficult but valuable things \u2014 such as admitting talented lower-income students who can thrive at college if given appropriate support \u2014 in favor of easier strategies more likely to add points in the U.S. News formula.\nStill, students and families need comparative information to choose colleges. If rankings mislead, what is the alternative?\nFor generations, buyers have turned to Consumer Reports for advice about almost everything except college education. When Consumer Reports evaluates a product, it assesses multiple factors so that prospective buyers can make their own choice wisely.\nSavvy college applicants likewise need information about some basic variables. Graduation rates are crucial. A college that does not graduate its students is like a car with a bad maintenance record. It costs money without getting you anywhere.What applicants need is not the average graduation rate, but the rate for students with backgrounds like their own: for example, some places successfully graduate their wealthy students but do less well for lower-income students.\nApplicants should also want to see some measure of post-graduation outcomes. The most frequently used yardstick is average salary soon after graduation, which has some value but obvious flaws \u2014 students may choose a first job for the fulfillment or the training it provides, rather than to maximize salary. I prefer alumni satisfaction 10 years post-graduation, though that information is harder to gather.Here is a partial list of other factors that matter: net cost (that is, cost of tuition and fees minus financial aid \u2014 again, for students like the applicant); a high-quality faculty actively engaged in undergraduate instruction, including through the individualized supervision of independent work; and a learning culture composed of diverse students who study hard and educate one another.\nJudged by these criteria, many schools \u2014 public and private, large and small \u2014 could be \u201cConsumer Reports Best Buys.\u201d Applicants should be thrilled to get into any of them; they should pick the one they find most appealing; and they should not waste time worrying about which is \u201cthe best.\u201d\nIt would be great to have a Consumer Reports for colleges. Something like it already exists, thanks to the Education Department under the Obama administration. The department\u2019s \u201cCollege Scorecard\u201d allows anyone to compare colleges on several dimensions, without the distraction of rankings.\nDespite its many virtues, the College Scorecard has limitations. Its data-centric interface can make it more attractive to policy wonks than to students. Some of the categories are incomplete or misleading: The earnings data, for example, are drawn from a narrow subset of students and do not accurately reflect the long-term salaries for many fields of study.James Kvaal, the newly confirmed undersecretary of education, was a leading architect of the original scorecard. I hope that he and the department will upgrade the project and heighten its visibility to students, families and school counselors.I also hope that some national publication will have the courage to produce an annual, user-friendly Consumer Reports-style analysis of higher education institutions, even if it is not as beguiling as a football-style set of rankings.\nIn the meantime, those of us who understand the flaws in the rankings must call them out \u2014 even when, indeed especially when, we finish at the top.",

They say they value this stuff then still fail to accept more low income students and such to protect their prestige. A better comparison is bill gates saying we should raise taxes on the wealthy then going back to his accountants and telling them to make his tax payment as low as possible",

While that isn't incorrect, it also has a massive amount to do with the people you meet, the funding the school receives, the programs the school offers, and the human resources that are available. You will meet people from different walks of life, some with much more enriched backgrounds than yours, and you may befriend them. You may meet people without whom you would otherwise never be able to succeed in inventorship, entrepreneurship, or creative development that's otherwise inaccessible without a solid social network. That's why it's desirable to go to a school like Princeton - not because there's a huge benefit to being a school people rank highly or see often in media, but because it is more likely you'll meet people who can help you climb the socioeconomic ladder.",

It\u2019s just like when some of us comment that test scores have limited validity, it\u2019s automatically assumed that the whiners were/are all poor test takers, which isn\u2019t always the case. \n\nAs he mentions, of course he\u2019s happy his university gets recognition, but he realizes that there is more to a college education than a rank.\n\nNote, he\u2019s not saying ranks are completely meaningless; the top schools tend to do well on most measures he and others probably agree are important. However, many other schools not in the T20 or T50 also do well, so the laser focus on top ranks misses out on quality schools. On a2c, I think it\u2019s an issue when some feel like they are a failure if they don\u2019t get into a t20, or even worse, feel guilty/shamed about wanting to go to a lower ranked school even when financially it makes sense or the program/school environment are a good fit.",

There's also the matter of signal strength, and some names send a stronger signal.  This is captured, albeit somewhat poorly, by the rankings.  I'd have appreciated it if he had at least *acknowledged* this, even if he were ultimately going to argue that signal strength should de-emphasized when making one's choice.",

Emma Green called him out a couple times pretty nicely:\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/princeton-president-racism-inequality/620340/](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/princeton-president-racism-inequality/620340/)\n\nHere's a quick quote:\n\n\"Emma Green: I promise my first question isn\u2019t facetious. Why should Princeton exist?  \nChristopher Eisgruber: Universities are places that invest in human talent, often in audacious ways. The idea of a place like Princeton is that you can identify young people who have extraordinary talent and will benefit from an intensive academic experience. Over the space of years and decades, they will blossom in ways we can\u2019t even predict, and they will be able to address problems that matter.\"",

      "text": "I already made a breakdown of how dumb these rankings are on my channel. When you actually pick apart the metrics they use to measure universities, they're missing some of the most important ones or underweighing them significantly. \n\nThey underestimate things like student-faculty ratio and percent of full-time, tenured professors, things that are more likely to ensure quality for you as a learner. They overestimate things that are mostly out of the university's control, like 6-year graduate rate (why are we praising a university for you getting done 2 years late?!) \n\nFew even consider things like post-graduate earnings or debt, and those that do just pay it lip service (like US News that just added it at like 2.5% of the weight and patted themselves on the back) \n\nThey use \"selectivity in admissions\" as a major metric of quality, when that really has little bearing on your experience as a student. \n\nThey're all a crock of shit. All that should matter is your ranking of yourself. What do you want and how hard are you willing to work to get it?",
