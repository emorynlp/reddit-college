  "text": "i\u2019m a high school senior and i\u2019ve been on the typical overachiever A2C tryhard grind for a while now, trying to maintain my grades and do things i\u2019m passionate about. and even though i fully enjoy pursuing academics and want to go to a good school, i feel like i\u2019m missing out. like, if i dont get into one of my top schools, i feel like i\u2019ve wasted time that i could\u2019ve spent on getting a high school experience\n\nnot to say i\u2019m very interested in partying a lot or anything, but i feel like theres a lot of little things ive missed out on bc ive been working. especially bc being a teenager and at the height of youth ur expected to really enjoy these years. and if my efforts aren\u2019t realized, i\u2019ll feel like i\u2019ve failed, y\u2019know?\n\ni dont know if any other people are feeling that anxiety right now, but i definitely am. i just dont think i was a teenager right (i mean i still am a teenager, but u k what i mean). i know way too much about gpa and ECs to be a normal teenager. that sounds so stupid and ppl r probably just going to call me cringe and weird but yeah haha",

          "text": "Seconding this. I feel like a lot of things we watch and read in pop culture makes out high school/college to be the best years of your life and once that\u2019s over\u2026nothing just happens in your life anymore. But I don\u2019t think that should be true at all. Your 30s, 40s, 50s, etc can all have their enjoyable and fulfilling moments, even if it\u2019s not the same way you would\u2019ve \u201chad fun\u201d in high school. \n\nGraduating high school doesn\u2019t mean enjoying life has to be over. At the same time, to have those fulfilling moments at any age, you need to let yourself rest at times. And that just comes down to finding the personal balance for yourself. Second semester of senior year is a good time to play around with that imo; see what balance of work and play suits you, where you\u2019re getting academic results you\u2019re satisfied with, while also not missing out on the things you really *do* want to experience. \n\n(I\u2019m just a college first year so obviously I\u2019m not qualified to give long term life advice, but this is how I\u2019m feeling about it right now and I hope it helps!)",

      "text": "I can relate to you. I spent a lot of time in high school working hard on ECs, research projects and other things I found passionate, and I now feel like I missed out on traditional high school things.\n\nEven if you don't get into a top school, that doesn't imply your effort was for naught. That's like saying \"I didn't win a bodybuilding competition so I'm just as unfit as my overweight neighbor\".\n\nGood thing is, you have another year left my friend. Make the most of it. I recently went to hoco with a group of friends I hadn't really talked to since middle school and it made me realize that it's important to live in the present. The fun years of our lives are not ending; they are in fact beginning.",

      "text": "I completely agree w/ you but instead of the anxiety you're feeling, I think I'm a little off-track with the burnout. I don't have the energy to focus in classes despite my mid-terms being less than a month away because I'm finished with all college applications and I truly have no interest in anything besides getting to know my results (which 100% depend on these exams). \n\nIn fact, just recently I was thinking about how I've spent such a long time planning all of it out that I've missed out on simpler things. I never thought of high school as a place where I'd get to do \"cool\" dance off's against the popular chick and snag her jock boyfriend away BUT I do wish now that I'd have drawn in my art class instead of chatting away with people who I no longer speak to because I neither got to draw nor do I remember the conversations. Now that I think of it, half my time was spent talking to my \"friends\" (didn't stick around due to Covid, only some did) and it's such a waste of time that I wasted so much time investing in those people. If I wasn't in class, I was almost always preparing for college admissions and it's like I smoked pot and 4 years went by LMAOOOOO   \n\n\nBut yeah, it feels like there's not one moment that has truly stuck with me and it upsets me because that just goes to show how I wasn't doing things I'd have remembered.",

      "text": "I think of the same thing all the time because I feel like since middle school I\u2019ve been subconsciously thinking of college (dw I\u2019m not crazy and didn\u2019t start doing anything in middle school except try to improve my personality so it matches well with people)\n\nBut I feel that a lot\u2014like what would happen if I was like every other kid and thought that a B was enough? I\u2019d have so much extra time outside of school and I wouldn\u2019t be stress-checking my grades every six hours in case my teacher added something to the gradebook \n\nIn ways, I\u2019m jealous of kids who don\u2019t see achieving crazy things in high school as important; for me it\u2019s really important to having a good start to my future but ig for most people they see it a lot more as a stepping stone on the path? Idk completely but I do sometimes wish I could see what they think of school, college, and their future",
