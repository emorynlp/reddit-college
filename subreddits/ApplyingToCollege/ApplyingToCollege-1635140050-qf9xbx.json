As a result, i didn\u2019t put this on my resume or a few of my applications. Did I mess up? \n\n2. I put National Spanish Honor Society under EC for a few of my apps. That\u2019s irrelevant right?",

      "text": "Hey, I'm an international applicant so we don't even have NHS. It's completely fine to not put that in. Because NHS is so common and A LOT of students put it in their apps, it wouldn't really have made you stand out anyway, so don't worry about it! I think National Spanish Honor Society is pretty relevant, and that you should put it unless you have something bigger. Why do you think it's irrelevant?",
