      "text": "You don't need a degree in aerospace engineering to work in aerospace at all.  There are probably more mechanical engineers than aerospace engineers in the field, and EE and CS majors are very common too - it just depends on what you want to specialize in.  It's very common for big aerospace companies (Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrup, etc.) to pay for your grad school as well if you go into a specialty where it really matters -- systems engineers and GNC engineers are more likely to have aerospace degrees.\n\nCornell is really well regarded and has an aerospace minor. CMU has a bunch of grads at Boeing and SpaceX.  If you are eligible for financial aid I'd definitely consider either of them - they are great engineering schools.  If you would be a full pay student, I'd rather save some money and go to somewhere like Purdue which is also excellent.",
