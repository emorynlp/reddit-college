  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m applying early action and realized the school I\u2019m applying to requires a letter of rec from CORE teachers. (Ahhh). I had another one but they\u2019re technically not a core teacher. So, I have two options: 1) I ask my APUSH teacher who really liked me and gave me an award for her class (social studies, something that I\u2019m majoring in), or 2) I ask my physics teacher who I didn\u2019t do *extremely* well in his class but did grow overtime and he explicitly offered to write me one (but I\u2019m not exactly majoring in physics). I\u2019ve heard it said that students should get a teacher from different types of subjects, and I already have a social studies teacher LOR, but I think my APUSH teacher would do a good job cuz I got 100% in her class, tho my physics teacher could stress my growth?? Just not sure of how his writing skills are. Don\u2019t really know either of them very very well. Any advice?",
