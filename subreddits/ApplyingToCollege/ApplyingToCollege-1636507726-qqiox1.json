I know Amherst tufts wesleyan vassar would be fine ish reaches otherwise though.",

You can take classes at the 5 colleges and have a wider range of offerings at a small college. \n\nColgate is a good reach, as is Vassar. \n\nESF is really interesting because you get all the SU amenities. \n\nHow about Ithaca College, U Rochester, Boston College, Seton Hall, Connecticut College, Dickinson?",

You\u2019re in classes and clubs and activities with kids in different years and majors. It feels like tight groups form at the start of freshman year and some kids feel left out, but then time passes and everyone realizes that the whole student body is available to get to know and everything relaxes. \n\nI\u2019d email Vassar admissions and ask if they have an ambassador program and if they can connect you to another black male student so you can ask what day to day life is like for a student like yourself.",
