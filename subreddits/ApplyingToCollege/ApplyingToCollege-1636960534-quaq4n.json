  "text": "Graduating this year with my Bachelors in informatics and I\u2019m applying to NYU Tandon School of Engineering for there MS of cyber security program. I was wondering if there is anyone here who might be in the program looking for some advice on the statement of purpose essay. Also I haven\u2019t taken that many cs courses besides basic Java, Js, css, and html and was wondering would it be more beneficial for a ms in cs or cyber security in terms of software security?",
