      "text": "Auto admit does not mean you get your 1st or 2nd choice major....it just means you get in.  Some auto admits choose not to attend bc they don't get into their major (say business or c.s.) bc they don't make the cut for the competitive majors.  And if they are top 6% (like for UT) of their class, they could potentially get into Ivies or other schools with the major they want.",
