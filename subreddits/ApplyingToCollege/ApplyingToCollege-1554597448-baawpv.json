  "title:": "Mom said she\u2019s disappointed with my results",
  "text": "My (Asian) mom has always wanted me to go to an Ivy. A few days before ivy day, I told her she shouldn\u2019t be expecting ANY ivy acceptances and she got mad and told me that I should at least get into cornell and said I wasn\u2019t good enough for HYP. I got into Penn, Cornell, and Brown, so I thought I had satisfied her. I asked her today if she was happy and she told me she was disappointed that I didn\u2019t get into Princeton or Harvard. I can\u2019t take this shit anymore. She\u2019s a good parent but she needs to lay off with this HYP stuff. She doesn\u2019t understand what exactly it takes to get into those schools and that my high school does not have a good rep with one of the HYP after a student was expelled for academic reasons. Sometimes I really hate how Asian people worship this prestige stuff and it makes me question whether or not I should even go to penn. \n\nEdit: wow I did not expect to get this much support, thanks to everyone. But also some of u people don\u2019t need to brutally bash my mom she\u2019s not that terrible, her mindset is just a little flawed ",

The Asian parent culture is toxic and I'm super glad my parents didn't' get caught up in that. That's why they're obsessed with Ivies and not other colleges that are considered equal or even better in a field (UCs, UMich, etc.). Because either they're super ignorant or they're only concerned with societal status in their little tea circle.\n\n\nTLDR: A lot of parents don't actually want the best for their kids and only use them to flex.",

She's not disappointed because she thinks you are going to be unhappy (you won't be) because of misfortune. \n\nShe's disappointed because she wants to use you to make her look better. \n\nShe wants to use you as a tool that allows her to look down her nose at EVERYONE around her. Now, because you didn't go to HARVARD, she feels that there might be people who are looking down their nose at HER because their kids DID. To her, this is apocalyptic. (There's no consideration that she actually had nothing (or next to nothing) to do with your success. In this context, you are her possession and not an individual.)\n\nBut don't get angry at her. Pity her. Her world is so devoid of meaning and purpose that 'face' is all that matters to her. She is miserable because she has never had the power to achieve anything. Part of her might even resent that you have achieved more than her, and she will probably continue to harbour that until she dies. \n\nSo try to turn your frustration into understanding, and if not for her sake, for yours. Help her to introspect. Don't give up on her. Not because \"she's family and family sticks together\". Fight for your relationship because it will make *you* stronger, more compassionate, more patient and empathetic. In her own way, she's teaching you the value of compassion and empathy by depriving you of them, and she's giving a great working example of how not to be a decent human being. ",

They're a lot more supportive and encouraging and more open-minded with their child's path. \n\n\nAnyways, stay strong and ignore your mom anyways. Like another commenter said, she's being unreasonable when she's still unhappy after she doesn't expect you to go to HYP and you don't. You got into an Ivy, and that's more than what many smart and capable students can say. **Be proud of yourself.**",

They are still disappointed with not-so-awesome outcomes, but overall they're much more resilient to setbacks that their kids face. I know many friends whose parents took them out to dinner even after getting into schools that Tiger Parents hated (like the University of Florida, Purdue, UC Davis, Northeastern, etc).   \n\n\nI also appreciate that newer Asian parents also less anal about their kid choosing not to go into an engineering field or attending medical school, which is imo a good mindset to have because there's a lot of great career paths out there that don't involve being a software engineer or physician. Hell, I know many younger Asian parents who are fine with their kids joining the Army or Air Force post-graduation -- imagine that from our generation, LOL. I hope in the future if we are parents we will be more receptive to our kids' successes and failures and be supportive of them no matter what.  \n\nListen to u/skyloft0629, u/nyc1280!

It's getting a career where you're a respected citizen, who people look up to - a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant etc etc.\n\nThey want you to have the life, their parents/grand parents were robbed of?\n\nJust remember the emotions going on here.

It was really out of line of her and completely unemphatic of her.  Getting into even one Ivy, no matter which one, is an insanely challenging feat, for the amount of people who go to one out of everyone in this world is an incredible minuscule number.  Congratulations on being accepted into UPenn, Cornell, and Brown.  As someone whose favorite school is Brown, I'm kinda biased and would suggest Brown, but obviously, it's your choice, and you should be so proud of your achievements, regardless of what your mom thinks.  I'm sure you know all of this, but I know that in situations like that, people sometimes want to hear it from someone else, so I want to say one last time congratulations!  Wherever you go, you certainly have a lot waiting for you.  Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day.",

It makes it easier to cope with a parent's negativity by taking into account her life (your mom's), understanding the insecurities that have led her to adopt a warped world view and casting that toxicity aside. I too will find myself sometimes getting wrapped up in high expectations. I just had a convo with my daughter last night about this while talking about ACT prep. She said it was all starting to stress her out and I told her ultimately, all this BS is not that important in the grand scheme. Congrats on getting into amazing schools.",

Consider first how you are going to perform in those schools and make a constructive decision about which is best for your future.

I know this sounds jaded but -- being an Asian -- I can understand how hard my parents had to work to get me where I am today. So just appreciate your parents and try to explain to them that what really matters is your future success not the 4 year college you're going to",

Congrats! Seriously, all 3 of them offer both name brand AND education, and even then your mom shouldn't be disappointed. If she thinks it's so easy then she should consider applying as a freshman and see just how stressful it is.\n\nRemember that Asian moms usually do this for personal gain, not for you. That \"oh, he got into cornell but THEY got into HYP and he didn't\" mentality is super toxic and needs to stop, although I don't know when that will be.\n\nTake your education and make the most out of it. HYP clout only lasts for a year before people realize it's a different playing field and no one will care as much about where you go so much as what you DID. Wish you best of luck :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I'm sure she's disappointed but she's disappointed for you because she thinks you've had to settle.  Truth is, when some of her more enlightened friends see where you are going, she will be impressed and floored.  And she will meet other Korean or Chinese (I'm assuming you're one of those) at orientation week and she'll realize how great your achievement is. It's not right, I know, but that's the way they think.  \n\nI understand how hurt you must be.  But there are a couple things that I hope you take into your future.  You will be at an incredible university now - use this opportunity to find yourself.  So many asian kids live to make their parents happy and their response will always disappoint you.  Do what you want to do - that means if you don't want to be a doctor or an investment banker - that's ok.  You are an incredibly bright person- you will do some really great things in this world and trust me, your mom will be very very proud of you. Hell, I'm proud of you and you're not even my kid.
