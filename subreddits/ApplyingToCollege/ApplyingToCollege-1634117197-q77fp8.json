  "text": "I don't really want a long additional information section as the AOs might feel annoyed, but as I'm writing down extra info I couldn't include in the rest of the application, it's getting pretty long (431 words). Can somebody please review this and help me to de-clutter it? \n\nFor context, my application focuses on dance(as an EC) and biology, especially cellular biology (intended major). \n\nI can inbox you the additional info section :)",

          "text": "I already wrote in bullet points. The headings and lines are good ideas too, thank you!\n\nAlso, can I include any piece of information from middle school? I continued that activity throughout HS till now, but there's one scholarship I earned in middle school(you can't receive it twice). Would it be okay to include this or should I keep it strictly high school-related?\n\nThere's this other activity I also continued from middle school, throughout HS, and has significantly shaped me. I slightly hinted towards it in my supplementals but wanted to address it fully in the additional section, including experiences from middle school (not for the sake of the achievement, but for the sake of adding depth to an element already part of my common app application). Can I do that, or again, is it limited to HS only?",
