  "text": "i realized after i submitted that we were supposed to add algebra 1 to the self reported courses even tho i took it in middle school.. so i sent an email to all the admissions teams saying if they can add it in but they replied that they can\u2019t make any changes and they\u2019ll check my official transcript to see if i have all the requirements later. the problem is that my high school transcript doesn\u2019t include algebra 1 because i took in it middle school so they\u2019re not gonna see it?? is it gonna be a problem if they don\u2019t see that i took algebra 1??",
