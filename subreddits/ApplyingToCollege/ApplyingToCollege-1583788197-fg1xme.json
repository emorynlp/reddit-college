  "title:": "PSA: you CAN get into T20s without being seen as elite in middle school!!!",
  "text": "So unlike probably a lot of people on this sub, I was NOT one of those kids that took Algebra 1 in Eighth grade rather than in high school. All of my friends were on that path and pretty much everyone who was average at math or better at my school seemed to be on this path (yours could be different!)\n\nI am a senior, and I am only in Pre-Calculus. Months ago I was really paranoid and asked both this sub and r/chanceme if I would be able to get into T20s without having been in calculus or even having the prerequisite for calculus; I got a resounding \u201cno\u201d from pretty much everyone. Whatever, I still applied and worked my ass off on my applications.\n\nSo months pass and just a few weeks ago, I get my acceptance to Vanderbilt. What???\n\nI got comments from these subs telling me that even as a social studies major I wouldn\u2019t be able to get in because I wasn\u2019t on that path. I applied *STEM* and got in!! \n\nThe school system likes to shit on us, and tell us how good we\u2019ll be at math in the future and decide what path we\u2019ll be on in High School as early as the 5th grade with no chance of mobility onto the upper path. I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the \u201cdumb kids\u201d path for the entire rest of my K-12 years. \n\nIt CAN be done. I wanted desperately my junior year to make up for my lack of rigor in math by doing well on the ACT section, and I still ended up with a 28 max on the math section because my school only catered to kids on the \u201csmart\u201d path for ACT prep. However, I was still damn proud of myself for getting a 28 math while i was only in the middle of Algebra 2. I managed to get a 35 or a 36 on every other section and get a 34 SS, and even though I only scored a 28 on math 3 times in a row, the ad board at Vandy apparently still saw something in me that they thought would lead to me being an incredible STEM student. \n\nI will reiterate for the last time that IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. I\u2019m sorry if you were deemed \u201cdumb\u201d in 5th grade and weren\u2019t able to move into the \u201csmart\u201d path like I was, but if you show that you have kickass ECs, a passion for what you want to study, and a thirst to do well despite your circumstances, you will be OK!!",

          "text": "> Middle school doesn't matter AT ALL.\n\nMiddle school grades don't matter. The purpose of middle school is supposed to be to transition kids from elementary school to high school. In elementary school grades are used as a communication tool between teachers and parents. It helps parents see where their child is struggling and what they need help with. In high school grades go on your transcripts to communicate what kind of student you are to the colleges you apply to. Middle school is about transitioning that communication from the teacher/parent to the teacher/student. It is also a low stakes way for you to learn how to manage the demands of extracurriculars and school work. At the end of 8th grade one of my kids was studying with friends for a final during breaks of an important track meet. He did well on the final but that mattered way less than the fact that he was able to figure out how to manage his commitments. Middle school has a purpose but that purpose isn't to get you to take calculus a year earlier than your peers.",

I was also on the regular track at that but after a great year last year I made it to honors precalculus which as I learned a year after the rest of my class did is like the hardest class at my school lol. \n\nThank you for this post, as a follow up I wanted to ask how even as a senior now and especially accepted managing to shake the notion everyone tells us that things are going to be impossible, much more work, etc. I guess the pride in making it to Vandy is the cure for that lol but still mad props you\u2019re officially my hero",

Choose classes that will challenge you, and don't pick all of the regular classes just because you \"were never really smart.\"  Middle school is often an awful determining factor of success in high school for many reasons (more parent involvement in schoolwork, maybe less motivation because honestly middle school isn't nearly as engaging as high school, less of a goal to achieve- there's no college at the end of the tunnel).  High school is when you really start to grow as a student and a thinker.  Plus, you don't know your school yet.  There's a good chance that advanced classes aren't as hard as you expected.",

Like it really did feel like everyone was taking Algebra 1in 8th Grade.\n\nWhich overall I think was a trend for me in middle school, I just was not good at the things I enjoyed (STEM)\n\nSo to fix that I took a little bit of a different approach than you did. Knowing that if I did not do something I'd be put in Algebra 1 freshmen year (despite wanting to be a programmer who really needed to learn more math), I'd decided I would grind the heck out of online courses. But online courses are def not for everyone as they can be expensive and take up a lot of time (in my case the majority of my summers).\n\nAfter finishing an Algebra 1 online that I kinda got addicted to improvement and learning (in some respect (not the main goal) I also wanted to prove that the whole \"advanced\" pathway given to most kids was not representative of someones actual potential). So I took two more, one in Algebra 2, and one in Chemistry. At the end I was now a year ahead of the \"advanced kids\" in math taking Calculus as a junior while I originally was never going to get to it at all.\n\nI really have no regrets, taking that initiative has changed me as a person, and It showed me how I could work toward my weaknesses.\n\nSo while you did not take my approach with the middle school dilemma for math I really respect your grind. You did everything you could within the confines of your opportunities (as not all schools allow online courses, nor does everyone have time with ECs), and showed that even if someone like me didn't do those courses (and maybe used those summers for programming or something else) I still could have been successful college wise like you are.\n\nCongrats on Vanderbilt, still waiting for my T20 decisions to come so we'll see, but it honestly makes me really happy to see how someone else approached being put in that path back in middle school.",

I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the \u201cdumb kids\u201d path for the entire rest of my K-12 years. \n\nThis really hit home for me...\n\nI have ADHD, so as a kid I was constantly disruptive and could never pay attention in class. Because my mom didn't want to medicate me (for legitimate reasons, and I support her choice looking back) they were like \"fuck this kid\" and put me in painfully slow classes where I learned nothing.\n\nI lost interest in school all together because I felt like whatever I achieved would be overshadowed by those who were in the honors or AP classes above me. I finished my senior year of high school with a GPA of about 2.0, and wouldnt have graduated except I went into school early on the day senior grades were due and did a months worth of work for a class I needed to pass to graduate.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm in college and have a cumulative GPA of ~3.9, and unless something happens should finish this semester with a 4.0.\n\nGrade school tore me down and told me I wouldnt amount to anything. My teachers expected nothing from me so I produced nothing. I'm still mad at my school district, not so much for what they did to me, because I found my path and believe I can get back on track, but for all the kids who had just a much potential as I did but never found their calling. They have to struggle for the rest of their lives because someone tried to predict their potential back in 5th grade. It makes me so mad to think about all the people I knew in my \"slow\" classes who were intelligent, driven, but never given a chance to prove their abilities.\n\nSchools make mistakes, dont let someone elses mistake determine your self worth or your future, you're the only one in control of your destiny.",
