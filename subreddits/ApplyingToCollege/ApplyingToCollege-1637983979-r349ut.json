  "title:": "Confused at how someone can qualify for the pell grant and apply for need based scholarships but can afford new cars, teslas, etc?",
  "text": "So I have a friend that qualified for the Pell grant and got a scholarship meant for minorities and is need based (note that she is not a minority either), but found out her dad bought her a new car for graduation and a couple months later bought himself a Tesla. She didn't qualify for work-study during college either, so I'm wondering how the Pell grant qualification even works out and why she would even be one of the recipients for a need-based scholarship meant for minorities (when all the other recipients were actually first-gen minorities). I know this sounds super judgmental, and it probably does come from a place of judgment and just annoyance just because I know that I and many other students had to actually work to buy used cars, pay off tuition, and actually needed the scholarships to even attend school in the first place ://",

      "text": "That dad may be financing thing well beyond his ability to pay off the loans. I wouldn\u2019t assume he actually has all that money. She may be in a minority group that you can\u2019t tell just by looking at her. Native American? Hispanic? First gen to go to college? Don\u2019t assume minority always means dark skinned and obvious. Worry about your own financials, jealousy hurts you.",
