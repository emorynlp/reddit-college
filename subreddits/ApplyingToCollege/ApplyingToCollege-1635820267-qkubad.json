  "title:": "I've read through a couple posts saying don't write \"sob story\" essays; how far does this go? Is it just something I should avoid entirely or is there a use?",
  "text": "I've seen a lot of like don't write about that stuff in your essays, but I feel like it is an important piece of my life. I've had a few medical issues that over the past year have impacted my academics, and even just my life as a whole. I've struggled with frequent headaches since I was about 8 (honestly doesn't have too much of an effect - as bad as it is - as I've learned to cope with it), and I've experienced some degree of trauma from an ex. This has lead to daily stomachaches/panic attacks for the past year and for a time it really killed my energy to do anything. I managed to get fine grades, but I didn't really do anything with my time and was constantly in my own head and just generally unhappy, mostly playing games or hanging out with friends to escape.\n\nI don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, and I've come to terms with it. I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to get pity or anything, because I don't need it. Because of that, should I not bother with any of it in my essays, or is there a way I can encorporate it meaningfully?\n\nThanks in advance for any replies :)",
