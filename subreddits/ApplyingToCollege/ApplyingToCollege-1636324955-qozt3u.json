MIT interviews all kids while Harvard\u2019s policy is unclear, though the great Tom Stagliano interprets it this way:\n\n> From what I know, Harvard and some of the other Ivy League colleges, conduct their interviews After the application has been submitted. Therefore, it is most likely that only candidates that Harvard is seriously considering will be granted an interview, of course, others could ask for one (know an alumnus or alumnae who will conduct the interview). Therefore, for colleges who conduct the interview after the application is submitted, the interview is part of the Weeding process.",

Which is not to say that the alumni office may be given some names of applicants that admissions wants to ensure are interviewed. However, when Harvard says that interviews are randomly assigned based on availability, that is generally the case. Interview requests for many applicants have gone out, and it's long before the admissions committee has met, and before some of the applications were even read.",
