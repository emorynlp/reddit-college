  "title:": "How do colleges know whether you're low income?",
  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a current senior applying to college. While filling out the common app, I noticed there is nowhere to report your household income. My household income is pretty low for my area (it's \\~60k and the median for my county is \\~120k), but not low enough to qualify me for reduced lunch. I'm wondering how I can convey to colleges that I'm low income if I'm not a QuestBridge finalist and I'm not first gen or anything like that?\n\nThanks!",

              "text": "**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.**\n\nMore details here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS> \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).
