  "text": "So I moved schools 4 times throughout highschool. Only 2 of the schools I moved to had AP. I moved schools because of my dad's work, not because of behavioural or academic issues. It's kinda hard to commit to ECs like clubs when you have moved so much, so for my ECs I only really personal stuff like hobbies or personal projects. Along with this, im not submitted SAT/ACT, because where I live, the testing keeps getting cancelled. So how does this all affect admissions?",

      "text": "explain this in additional info section, its a legit circumstance that prevented you from prusuing ecs.  any relevant ecs/broad theme of ecs that you did at every/most of the schools? you can still list it to show interest but explain that you dont have leadership etc because of moving.  \nand on sats, once again explain in additional info that you werent able to take it because pandemic. since everyones test optional, if your gpa is at the right place then its alright.  a good sat may help, but wont break your application at the moment.",
