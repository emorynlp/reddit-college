  "text": "So yesterday I mapped out all the deadlines that I'm going to experience up until early January. And before my eyes, every single week was filled with major events whether they be final tests before Thanksgiving, December 1 scholarships, mid-term exams, or the infamous RD deadlines. While I've already applied to seven schools, my ED is a reach and I'm still far from finished. The mere fact that I still have more schools, more honors colleges, and more scholarships to apply for is really overwhelming, especially since they're all so selective. It's like why even apply to additional T30 schools or prestigious scholarships when the odds are so low? And how am I supposed to have time to maintain relationships with my friends, somehow hold my grades through finals, and complete all of this additional college work? \n\nMy worst fear honestly is that I'll be denied from my ED and forced to spend my entire Christmas break away from friends and family, completing applications that will likely amount to nothing. It's like I know in my brain that even if I stopped now I will get into some schools and go to college, but I feel claustrophobic with the potential reality that all my favorite schools, whether reach or safety, could likely reject me, reducing all my effort and sacrifices I'm going to have to make by completing these applications.",

      "text": "Don't worry; I feel the same way. I'm an IB student, and literally every week is filled with unit finals, IAs, projects, extracurriculars, applications, and my EE deadline. Every time I think I'm going to burn out though, I take a break and meditate or nap. While it seems counterproductive to take a break when you have so much you need to do, maintaining your energy and mental health is crucial to getting through everything. Remember, it's not only the amount of time you work that matters; the efficiency of your work is also important. So, take a break and do something that will help you recover your energy (recuperating is not wasting time. Just don't overdo it, or the stress will only build up and it will become a waste of time).",

      "text": "Simple solution: apply to less schools and apply only the schools that you feel are a good fit. If you're having trouble writing a \"Why school\" essay, drop it. That way, you have a higher chance of getting into the schools you do apply to and you'll feel happier once you're already in college.",
