  "text": "Spoke to my counselor and I could only apply for way less EA's then I had originally planned for. Not to mention that I could only ED 2 my dream school. This was all because I wasn't about to get rec letters in on time. But I wanna ask: how big of a difference does ED 1 and 2 make? I mean, I'd imagine that ED 1 is more likely to admit you but I just wanna know some kind of comparison.",

      "text": "It depends. But for instance,a top30 school recently had a virtual session with the Dean. He stated ED1 generally is biggest boost bc especially during Covid,the colleges had a difficult time knowing how many students were going to come last year. Thus they and many,increased the percentage of ED1 admits. He specifically stated by the time ED2 rolls around they have a better idea and it\u2019s less a boost although demonstrated interest helps when applying as an ED2 vs RD.",
