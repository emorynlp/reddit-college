      "text": "For a few reasons:\n\n1. Applying internationally tends to come with some other hurdles, like the degree being accredited, being recognized by US employers, etc.\n2. More paperwork & visa issues. The college application process is already so complicated that most people don't even bother with Canadian universities because applying for a visa/studying abroad comes with more paperwork and lots of people just don't have the time or motivation to do any of that.\n3. The public university system in the USA is quite good. People shoot for the stars with US universities (HYPSM, etc) with non-flagship public universities from their home state as backup schools, which generally cost around $10,000-$25,000 a year *(For commuter students, more towards that $10,000 range)* to attend as an in-state resident, including tuition, fees, food, and housing. *(Examples - Western Michigan, JMU, West Chester, Texas Tech, UMKC, UMBC, San Jose State, etc. They're great schools and are quite affordable as an in-state resident, and they're less selective than their flagship counterparts.)*\n4. Most people in the USA haven't heard of McGill, UofT, or UBC. They just don't quite have the name recognition in the USA as a lot of other schools.\n5. For most people in the USA, going to school in Canada would be a long ways from home. If you live in the South/Southwest/Texas/Midwest, that could be a 25+ hour drive or a pricy plane ticket.",

          "text": "Thank you for your comment!! I really appreciate it. As an international student, most of these things are already a hassle for me even if I go to school in the US. I have to pay international student tuition, the plane rides are about the same length (1 or 2 hours difference, give or take), I still need a visa, etc. Nonetheless, I totally get how much of a problem this could be if you have never considered leaving the US. I guess the advantages of going to a Canadian school really only affect international students.",

Those need-blind schools are already competitve enough that the need-blind policy won't help much in helping your chances getting in any of them. And tbh, i've seen those merit aid at Canadian tops, they are basically little to none, you still have to pay a large sum in 99% of the cases.",
