  "text": "**Parents who are on A2C,**\n\n**Why are you here?  Please choose (more than one may apply):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) I'm worried that my child is not informed about the college application/choice process, and I'm essentially doing the research for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) My child's school has inadequate support for college-bound students, and I'm trying to fill in the gap for my child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) I know my child is on A2C, and I want to see what information/misinformation they are getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) I am a Tiger Mom/Lion Dad, and I need to be involved in every aspect of my child's college application process.  This is their/my future we're talking about!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) I'm curious about what information is out there -- I'm trying my best to keep up with my kid who is totally on top of this process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) I think college is over-hyped.  I'd be happier if my kid just went into the work force, and I'm not thrilled with paying out the nose for my kid to go to parties (basically) for 4 years.  I'm looking for conversations that will fuel my confirmation bias here, and maybe convince my kid to learn a trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7) I'm nervous as hell (maybe more than my own kid), and I'm feeding my anxiety with any information I can glean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8) Other (explain in comments)",

As a result, there's very little prep for these kids. And since neither myself or my spouse went to college, we don't have experience either. Which makes me anxious as hell, so I come here to see what's going on.",
