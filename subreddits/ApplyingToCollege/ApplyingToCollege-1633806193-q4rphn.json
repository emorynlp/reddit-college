  "title:": "Are my LOR teachers good?",
  "text": "Okay this is the last time I\u2019m asking something like this because my LOR situation has changed a multiple times. My top school (Wharton) wants LORs from 2 core curriculum teachers. I\u2019m getting letters from my Econ and Lang&Lit teachers for the core classes, with my business teacher as the optional letter. I\u2019m really set on these three because I feel like they can write amazing letters for me, but I\u2019m worried that they might dislike that I didn\u2019t get one from a STEM teacher. The school\u2019s website does not specify or imply that they want a STEM letter at all, so I think it should be fine, but is it some unwritten rule?",
