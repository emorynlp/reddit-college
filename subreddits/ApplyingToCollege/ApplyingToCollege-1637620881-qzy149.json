  "text": "Hi! Made this account specifically for this as I don't want existential dread in my main account!\n\nSo, background that I hope illustrates my situation: I'm a 24-year-old law school student in A University Not In The US\u2122. Was just about done with school (turned in and presented my senior thesis, passed the bar exam and all that) when last year my school completely shut down due to COVID. That year and most of 2021 made me realize Law isn't really what I want to do for the rest of my life. In my college entrance exams my first option was actually Computer Engineering and I was admitted to it but the second they called me for Law I immediately switched to it because \"more prestigious\".\n\nSo here's where I'm actually lost:\n\nI thought I was familiar enough with the US system for college applications as I initially applied to US schools in my senior year of HS ages ago and was admitted to my dream school (NYU, family circumstances led me to unfortunately discard the possibility of eventually attending) but it seems the landscape for transfer applications are *very* different than the one for new students back then.\n\n* I intend to pursue a CS degree and apparently I can't apply as a first year bc I've already attended university even though the two courses couldn't be more unrelated. \n\n* I'd hoped I could apply as a freshman as this is a whole new field for me but apparently that's not possible in a bunch of schools so I would at least want to enter as a sophomore. \n\n* Most of the schools I applied for way back then had some sort of financial aid program available for international applicants but now it seems a bunch of them don't support that anymore, NYU apparently isn't even need-blind as it was back then so I had to drop that one from my list entirely.\n\n* I'd whittled down my list to a few extremely long-shot possibilities I knew had FA for international students (Ivies, MIT) but they require letters of recommendation from math & science professors I literally have no access to bc in my country you're pretty much railroaded into your own major and can't pick any courses that are unrelated to your area (in this case humanities). So they're obviously not there anymore.\n\n* Some universities were pretty clear that they would only consider a transfer from a related program which is absolutely not my case.\n\n* Canadian schools are slightly more compatible in terms of admission document requirements as most of them don't bother with letters of recommendation and don't really care what you were doing before but the ones I found have precisely 0 FA. They do let you work but the salaries don't cover the CoA, just make it slightly less nightmarish. I wouldn't mind taking loans and paying banks for the rest of my life but not even that avenue is open for international applicants.\n\n\nUnlike in my senior year of high school I'm kinda scrambling to find good options quick bc I had completely discarded the possibility of changing majors *and* studying in the US/Canada until two weeks ago when my dad who lives in Washington decided he wanted me to visit him there and stay with him for a month to decide if Law is what I wanted to do (I'd already decided it wasn't but he doesn't need to know that). So now that I've been considering it, I couldn't be more overwhelmed by the amount of boxes I need to tick in order to vie for the already traditionally lower admission rates of transfer students.\n\nSo TL;DR: any schools with CS programs *and* compatible admission requirements *and* that extend financial aid opportunities to international students? I'm genuinely open to any genre of advice except \"give it up\" at this point.",
