  "title:": "How do I send Letter of Recs to UT Dallas?",
  "text": "According to the UT Dallas website, I'm supposed to upload my Letter of Rec on the Supplemental Document Submission form on my portal (I applied via ApplyTexas and not Common App). But when I click on it, it prompts me to attach a pdf of the letters myself (ie from my laptop and unlike what UT and Common App do with putting in your recommender's email address). So would that mean I would ask my teachers to send me the letter they wrote for me? But wouldn't that imply I will be able to read the letter, making it unauthentic/whatever?",
