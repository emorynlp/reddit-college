Lmao I\u2019ve looked around but even though I\u2019ve passed AP Compsci the skills taught are just not useful in the real world..I wouldn\u2019t want to drag a team down in a website-building hackathon because I\u2019m just really good at loops lol",

              "text": "Lol - yea. APCSA and APCSP aren't great classes for outside skills. But hackathons are basically just competitions where people build an app or website to solve a problem in a certain amount of time (24 hrs or something). Then judges decide which apps are best!  \n\n\nIf you learn HTML and CSS you can create a static website. Learning Javascript, you can create a dynamic website (an app)! Tools like jQuery are also helpful:)\n\nGood luck!",
