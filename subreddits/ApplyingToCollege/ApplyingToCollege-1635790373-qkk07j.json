  "title:": "CBSE mark sheet not accepted by WES",
  "text": "hi I sent my 10th-grade transcripts to WES for evaluation almost 10 days ago, today I got a mail from them saying that my mark sheet won't be accepted because it needs to get attested by CBSE itself and not the school (i got it attested by my school), I have no idea how to go about this because my deadline is today (lmao). I can send them a softcopy of my original mark sheet, I'm not sure about this. Can i beg them to accept the document because idk how the fuck I'm supposed to get it attested by the national board (it will take me ages). Solutions please :(",
