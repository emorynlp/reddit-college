  "text": "I have been stressing over the fact that I won't get into any of my reaches because of what an absolute crapshoot top colleges are and I have been trying to find target schools I like but with my stats almost every school is a safety or a reach because it's a top college. Other than that target schools would all be out of state and not offer much financial aid. Instead, I think I'm warming up to going to my in-state safety school. It's good for my major, I could easily graduate in three years and I know a girl who graduated from my school that goes there and she's super smart. I'm just kinda disappointed that I put myself through so much stress in high school just to end up at my safety.",

Are you in line for any non-need-based aid?  If so, then the work wasn't wasted.\n\nAlso the possibility that, without your hard work, this school would be a target instead of a safety and you might not have gotten in.",

This seems to be a very common issue amongst A2C posters, putting up lists of 14 reaches (nine of which they call \u201cmatches\u201d) and one safety.",

A safety school means exactly that: a last option, a safety net\u2026 it has no implications on the quality of the actual school itself, just what someone expected. Although I will agree with people on this subReddit having inflated opinions of their own chances at schools",

There\u2019re so many cool opportunities available to me! I could play competitive ping pong, or take up kayaking, or join the amateur theatre company, or train for a triathlon, or do a capella!\u201d I look at their study abroad options, and think about going to China. I look at their course listings, and get myself hyped over fun-looking courses in French cinema and creative writing. I do virtual tours of their campus, and I get super happy thinking about the Olympic swimming pool and the whole-ass water slide, and the state-of-the-Art gyms complete with racquetball courts, for my favorite niche sport. I look at the dining hall menu they publish and think \u201cdang, I could be eating fried chicken, or pizza, or stir fry for dinner tonight!\u201d Best of all, I get to do it all for free, because of how hard I worked in high school to get this scholarship! My safety\u2019s not exactly prestigious, but still! Free college!\n\nIf I get into a more prestigious school, all the better, but I try to put my focus on how much fun I\u2019ll have at college, and how happy I\u2019ll be no matter what. I\u2019ve worked so hard up until now, but everything\u2019s a win from here. It\u2019s like I\u2019m eating a really delicious bowl of pasta, but if I\u2019m lucky, I might get filet mignon instead. So what? It\u2019s still a great dinner, and I\u2019ll be satisfied no matter what. I\u2019m on a roller coaster that only goes up.",

A few years back, our neighbor's daughter was Salutatorian of her class, All State for Softball, and a double legacy for our state flagship.  Well, the state flagship rejected her and when our school counselor called the Admissions and asked \"WTF?\", they said that there was absolutely no way for them to know she actually wanted to attend their school.  She hadn't stopped in during the AO visit to the high school and hadn't taken a formal tour (was there all the time for sports events and didn't feel the need to your).  She ended up getting a good offer from another college, but was devastated for weeks.",

My freshman and sophomore, while not inherently bad (3.7 uw/4.5 w), fucked my gpa. I think just gonna have to go to UMD, which is awesome but also im in a feeder school for that college and I stressed way more than I had to. I played less Soccer only to get a 1510 on the SAT (also great, but just underwhelming in consideration to the time studying took away from playing more soccer). Im kinda just burnt out and life doesn\u2019t seem that great in this moment. On the other hand, Im thankful that these are my problems, compared to not having food to eat. \n\nBut yeah, idk if im still willing to apply to anymore schools. Even if there is a chance, it\u2019d probably be in vain.",
