  "text": "For my \"why us\" essay, how would admission officers perceive it if I choose to write as if I'm already at the school??\n\nI planned on opening with me a description of me engaging in a specific school experience and then reflecting back on my time at the school (to show all the other aspects of student life I'd engage in). Would this format work to give the admissions committee a picture of me on their campus or would this sound arrogant/confident?",

      "text": "Well the question is \"why us\" as in why go for us of all colleges. Using past tense sounds more like you dont understand when to use past, present, or future tense (not trying to be offensive) than it does paint you as confident. Since its a question about why apply to us (active process) it should be present tense. If you mention things like your future experiences or courses you use future. Finally, if you're using past experiences such as a college visit as to why you're applying then you use past tense.\n\n(Edit... I COMPLETELY missed the description... sorry! I still find it as an unnecessary addition, however, if you see it as a fitting intro go for it)",
