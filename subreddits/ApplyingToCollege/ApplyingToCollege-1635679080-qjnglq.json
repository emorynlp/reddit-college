  "title:": "Submitted Dartmouth Supplements One Day After Common App",
  "text": "I finally managed to submit my Common App to Dartmouth for ED yesterday, on the 30th. Today morning, as I was working on perfecting my supplements, I noticed that the Common App said that Dartmouth had already downloaded my application. Though I was eventually able to submit my supplements now, and it does say so on the Common App, could this potentially affect my chances at the university (as I submitted the supplement work a day later than the Common App document)? Sorry for the potentially stupid question, I'm just not quite sure.",
