  "text": "My school reports both Unweighted and Weighted GPA and rank on transcripts, but I reported my unweighted GPA and rank because my counselor said it would look better. I\u2019ve since seen that the Common App directs you to use your weighted GPA and rank if you have both, but I\u2019ve already submitted my ED application. Do I need to email the school to let them know, or will it be ok because they\u2019ll see my transcript with my weighted GPA and rank anyway?",
