  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI am in a situation where I have accumulated a lot of AP and Dual Enrollment credits. However, many top schools have a cap on the number of credits you are allowed to transfer in as a freshman. I am looking for a top school (T30) which accepts large amounts of AP credit (such as 45-60 semester hours).\n\nDo any of you know of a school which fits these criteria?\n\nThank you for all your help. I appreciate it very much.",

      "text": "Most top private universities will allow APs to replace required courses but not credits. Public universities may have more generous AP credit policies. Every college posts information about AP credit on their website - easy to google for any particular school.\n\nDual enrollment is another matter. That tends to be case by case. In general, your own in-state public universities are much more likely to give credit than private universities.",
