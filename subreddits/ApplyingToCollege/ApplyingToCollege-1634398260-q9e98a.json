  "text": "Hi guys, so the other day I receive an email from a college in which I attended several events. They said that they were giving me \u201cSelect Status\u201d meaning that they are waiving me the application fee, the essay, and considering me for top scholarships. Does that mean that they are really interested in me? Or do you think it\u2019s only marketing to apply so they can reject me? lol",
