I agree that anyone looking to maximize their chances should do an interview if offered. \n\nI may be reading these data a bit differently. To me, it seems to be not *necessarily* clear from the data that accepting an offered interview is (ceteris paribus) advantageous to declining one. It stands to reason that many who chose to decline MIT's offer of an interview had been self-selecting (ie: \"why bother, I don't have a real shot anyway\" or \"you can make me apply mom but you can't make me go to the interview\" etc).\n\nThey also doesn't necessarily speak to whether having received an interview is indicative of anything (vs not having received one). It would be interesting to see the admit number for those who didn't receive an interview.",
