  "title:": "34 (35 SS) ACT/99.3 GPA Scared about applying into engineering programs... feel my APs are not up to snuff. Can I still get accepted into a school if I get rejected from their engineering program?",
  "text": "I have tried to keep my course-load fairly balanced throughout HS because I am predominantly undecided and was always interested in the humanities. I have recently (past year) become enamored with engineering. I, however, have only taken/will be taking AP Lang, Lit, US Hist, Gov, APES, and Chem. Partly because of COVID, partly because of anxiety, I neglected to take Calc junior year, and instead took Pre-calc H. I 100% should have because my average was a 99, and I still regret my decision. With my high GPA and ACT score, I am planning on applying to some prestigious colleges, and was wondering if I should even bother. Should I apply to them as an undecided major instead and give up on engineering? What happens if I apply into a school as a prospective engineering major, but don't get accepted into their engineering program? Do I get flat out rejected? Am I allowed to choose a major in their general school? I am just scared of applying as an engineering major, but then getting rejected because of my courses, and then not be able to pursue even a non-engineer major at my favorite schools.\n\nBTW I still have the option to add in a one semester independent study (AP Gov is already one), but I basically can only take AP Psych. Is it even worth it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, 4 on chem, and 5 on lang and apush. \n\nThanks... I'm honestly scared guys. I don't want my hard work to go to waste because of me being and idiot and not choosing to take Calc junior year. Should I try and explain why I didn't take calc in the COVID essay? The last semester of sophmore year was online and I learned nothing, so I was scared of not being prepped for calc junior year.",

Some allow you to list a second choice major, some don\u2019t.",

I have emailed the schools I am EAing to, and one of them still has not responded, and the other just gave me a generic response linking me to information sessions that have passed. I have tried to comb their FAQs, but I have not found anything pertaining to me issue. Also, at least on the common app, none of my EA schools allow me to pick a second major.",

      "text": "You have nearly perfect scores and grades.  Whether you should bother to apply to highly selective schools mostly comes down to the \\*other\\* aspects of your application and/or your personal traits (1st gen, under-represented minority, etc.)\n\nIf you want to be an engineer then I strongly advise against listing a different major in an attempt to \"game\" the admissions process.  Be content with whatever school will admit you as a prospective engineering major.\n\nAlso sign up for Calc AB for your senior year.  Plenty of students are on a math schedule that has them taking Calculus as a senior.  That's still accelerated by one year vs. the default.",
