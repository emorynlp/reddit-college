  "text": "So, few weeks back, I started writing my essay on the prompt \"The lesson we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success.....\"\n\nHowever, when I completed the essay, I found that in the essay, I mainly focus on the 'what happened' part (4-5 paragraphs)  and only wrote 4-5 sentences on 'what I learned' part. Plus, I didn't achieve anything significant from the 'learnings'.\n\nSince there are only 2 days left to submit the applications, I was wondering if I should go with the \"Any topic of your choice\" prompt.\n\nWhat do you guys think ?\n\nP.S. I am an international applying to low-tier universities with acceptance rates ranging from 50% to 70%",
