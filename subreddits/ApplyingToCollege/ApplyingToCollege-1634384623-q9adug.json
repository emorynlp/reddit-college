  "text": "I moved to a new country since the start of high school. In this new country, I\u2019m going to a high ranking public school, in which I learn in their national language (as my 3rd language). I started learning their alphabet a few months before high school, and now I\u2019m fluent in this language. However, my gpa is not very competitive (4.1/5 or about 3.2 in the US scale) due to my lack of language in first year. \nI wrote about this in my essay too, but will this make up my gpa?",
