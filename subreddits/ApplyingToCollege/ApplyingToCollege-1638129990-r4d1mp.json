  "text": "\nSo for some background info: \nO Levels done in May/June and Oct/Nov 2018\nGrades were as follows: English- A*, Bangla- A*, Physics- A, Economics- A, Maths D- B, Additional Maths- D\n\nI then sat for my AS in the May/June session in 2019\nMy grades were as follows: Mathematics- D, Physics-D, Economics-E \n\nThe reason I did bad was i let a break up affect me to a really bad degree and I\u2019ll forever regret that.\n\nI then registered for my AS Level exams again for the May/June session in 2020 which got deferred to the Oct/Nov session due to the world situation.\nMy grades are as follows: English Language- A (86), Economics- C (69), Mathematics- B (71)\n\nI just completed my A2 Levels this Oct/Nov 2021.\nI have also registered for SATs which will be on Dec 4th.\nTo clarify something, I registered for my O Levels from a school. Afterwards, both of my AS registrations were done as a private candidate (could not afford a school), and my A2 registration was from a different school as i was able to afford it. \n\nI also have two Bangladesh National Film Awards in the category of Best Child Artist which I received in 2011 and 2013 for acting. I have a certificate of appreciation from when I went to the divisional round of Spelling Bee in 2015. I also have a few other certificates from when I volunteered and some from my school\u2019s annual sports days and other events. \n\nMy family struggles financially so I don\u2019t think there is any way for me to study abroad without a scholarship. \n\nI have already created an account on Common App, and added a counsellor from my school who has filed out a form for an application fees waiver. However I have not yet completed my application on Common App so she is unable to submit the fees waiver.\n\nCan you all suggest me what I should do next? I\u2019m very lost. Neither of my parents have studied beyond high school so they don\u2019t know how to guide me. There are some agencies in my country but they charge a lot of money if i were to consult with them or apply through them. \n\nAlso, will the fact that I did bad in 2019 affect my applications? Do i need to report those grades on my Common App or can I skip it? If i decide to skip it, how will I explain the year gap? Honestly, I\u2019m too embarrassed that I flunked because of a breakup. \n\nWill my ECAs help in any way in my applications? How can I report it on my Common App account? The ECA section asks for hours worked and generally speaking I don\u2019t quite remember how many hours I acted in those films. \n\nAny advice on where to apply, which university to select and how to do it would help a ton! \n\nGeneral advices are much appreciated as well!",

EducationUSA events are where I started learning this whole process.\n\nJust so you know, your awards from more than 5 years ago don't really count. You should be finding better + more recent awards.",
