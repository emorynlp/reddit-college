  "title:": "Updating AMC 12 Score - Advice?",
  "text": "So I just took the AMC 12 a few days ago. They dropped the solutions, so I calculated my score to be around 114, which would probably be in the top 3-4% of AMC 12 participants and will qualify me for the next round (AIME). I applied ED to Wharton, and I'll probably get my scores just a few days before they release decisions. Would there be any value to updating them with my score? It's my first math accomplishment/experience outside of school, and I understand that Wharton values \"strong preparation in mathematics\", so I feel like it might be valuable. \n\nOr will it be too late to send an update that will materially impact my admission, and should I avoid sending last-minute updates? \n\nAny advice appreciated, thanks!",

If you are proud of your score when it comes, definitely shoot them an email telling them about it. Some schools have dedicated forms for application updates, but if Penn doesn't, an email is fine.",
