  "text": " On UCLA's website it says that the 25th percentile out-of-state admit has a 4.46 weighted GPA. On Berkeley's Engineering school website, it says the typical admit has a 4.51 weighted.\n\nLet that sink in, this is a school system that doesn't weigh ANY honors courses for out-of-state applicants and yet the majority of the students got admitted with ridiculous GPAs. I don't understand, do these people take four AP classes every year of high school?? Can anyone who got admitted to UCLA or Berkeley from out of state shed some light on this :(",

Granted, student could take additional AP courses (in academic areas) as electives.",
