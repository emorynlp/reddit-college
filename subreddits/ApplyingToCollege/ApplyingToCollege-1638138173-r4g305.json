  "text": "I am interested in about Rocketry Science and Aerospace engineering and Aeronautical engineering but at the same time i love Astronomy and Astrophysics? I love to do research on Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nI am applying to US universities fall 2022. I know Aerospace engineering and Astronomy has different schools in US, one in engineering school other in liberal arts school. \n\nIs there any way i can study both in college taking one as major and other as minor or anyway? What will you advice me? Is there any college which offers both degree in same school? Please help me out.",

I don\u2019t know of any school where an engineering major plus an arts/sciences minor wouldn\u2018t be possible.",

(Caltech, CMU, Case Western, just through the C\u2019s)\n\nAlso consider a school with a Physics major and astrophysics track.",
