  "text": "I\u2019m so lost. If I wanna go to med school in the future, which colleges in Canada should I apply to as a student from the US? I have McGill on my list as I like Montreal. I heard not to apply to Toronto because bad grades deflation means it\u2019s hard for people to get into med school. But, any other recommendations? My average is like a 96% and I have a 1540 sat so colleges with those admissions requirements would be best!",

If it is, going to U of T as it is the most known Canadian school may help you more. \n\nIf you have to go searching for the easiest possible uni and program to get to med school, the question then becomes how truly capable you are of surviving med school and residencies and if you\u2019re taking the spot of someone more qualified.\n\nIn terms of admissions to Canadian undergrad programs, with a 96% average you\u2019ll get into basically every grades based program, only ones with supplementary applications like Mac and queens health science would be uncertain",

For example, in the US premed students are told not to go to MIT as it is unnecessarily difficult to get a high gpa compared to peer universities. Since I\u2019m not familiar with Canada, I wanted to know if there were any schools like that there. As for prestige, I don\u2019t think med schools really care. Would you say McGill is well known?",
