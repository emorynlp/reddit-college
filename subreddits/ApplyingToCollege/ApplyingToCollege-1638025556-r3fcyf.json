  "title:": "Can I reuse Personal Insight Answers",
  "text": "I applied to a couple UCs my senior year of high school in 2020. Although I got in, I ultimately decided not to go and attended a CC instead. I\u2019m now applying as a transfer student and I was wondering if it was okay to reuse a personal statement if it still holds up. I would change a few things of course but the basis of the essay is still something I\u2019d like to share. Would it get flagged or anything? Thanks in advance",
