  "text": "Hi,   \n\n\nI was wondering if we can include online courses in the honors section. I finished an online course on Coursera offered by Standford and I finished the course with honors. Can I include this? If yes, what level of an award would this be? (National, international, etc.)  \n\n\nThanks in advance!",
