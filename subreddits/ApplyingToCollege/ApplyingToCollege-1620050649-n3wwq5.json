  "text": "so I was waitlisted at a few schools, and have been hounding over my phone for any calls from the United States for the past 2 days.\n\ntoday, I got a call from a +1 code phone number (I live outside the United States btw) so naturally, I was EXCITED!\n\nI called my dad, who was at work, and I got my extended family on a conference call before I picked the call up. Suffice to say, we had practiced this multiple times before. \n\nAs soon as I picked up the call, I was greeted with a voice saying \"is this (insert my name)?\"\n\nI responded with an enthusiastic \"Yes!!\"\n\n\"Would you be interested in earning money while sitting at home?\"\n\nI literally wanted to yeet myself across the room bc my ENTIRE family was laughing at me for being so excited for a scam call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yea, I hate it here.",
