And which is better for my major?\nMajor-computer science \nAlso I have got priority scholarship consideration from Clarkson and selected as Dean priority student from Drake. I know it may mean nothing just mentioning.\n\nThank you for your advice!",

      "text": "The University of San Francisco might be better for Computer Science just because of its proximity to the Bay Area/Silicon Valley tech hub, in regards to internships and job opportunities.\n\nAn example of this is San Jose State: amazing CS job prospects due in large part to its location in Silicon Valley.\n\nI will say this: run the net price calculators for each of the three schools. On Google, look up \"\\[name of school\\] net price calculator\" and a link from the school will pop up to input info and you'll get a cost estimate. Note that:\n\na. Some net price calculators don't take merit scholarships/ACT/SAT/GPA into account, and might be inaccurate.\n\nb. Some schools offer separate merit scholarships with a separate application, or an honors college with a separate application.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. :)",
