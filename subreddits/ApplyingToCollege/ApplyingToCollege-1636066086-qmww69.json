Hopefully you addressed this in your PS or in the additional info or somewhere. \n\nBecause it's all over the place. I've seen *massive* grade inflation as a teacher since cheating became rampant. A lot of teachers have no idea how to use technology and many more have just shrugged and gave up on controlling for cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps your school was much tougher, but there are others that haven't been. You have to clarify the context.",
