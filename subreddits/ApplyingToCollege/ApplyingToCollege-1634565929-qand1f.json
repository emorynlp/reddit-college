  "text": "My SAT superscore is currently 1490 (690 EBRW, 800M). I wanted to apply to REA to Yale but I feel that this score does not reflect my ability. I will be retaking in December, hopefully getting a 1520+. My question is should I apply REA to Yale or wait? If I apply should I apply test-optional or should I send my scores? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't know if this is relevant, but my English teacher is providing a LOR. I also take the IB diploma and have gotten a 7 predicted (full mark) in English language and literature.",

      "text": "Keep in mind that acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate. So, to start with, you're looking at chances in the single digits. In the big picture, the question is whether giving up other early application opportunities is worth your single-digit-percent chances applying to Yale REA.\n\n1490 is a good score in an absolute sense. Yale's middle 50 percentile range for class of 2024 was 1470-1560. If you apply REA, I would submit.",
