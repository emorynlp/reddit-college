  "title:": "Is it okay to put YYGS (Yale Young Global Scholars) in the Honors section in Common App?",
  "text": "I do not have a lot of honors, so I wanted to put YYGS there because it also represented a really important achievement for me, because in my background and community getting accepted into those things is not common. Is it okay?   \n\n\nAlso, I do not know what to write in in Honors, \"Yale Young Global Scholars alumna\"? \"Yale Young Global Scholars accepted student\"? Should I put the acceptance rate? Example: 2000/7000 approx? (I also had 97% of financial aid but I did not get the scholarship, idk if i should add it)\n\nThanks :(",
