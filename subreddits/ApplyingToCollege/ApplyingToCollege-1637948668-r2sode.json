  "title:": "Am I the only one who can easily afford external college essay counselors but deliberately choose not to?",
  "text": "To preface this: I come from a pretty well off community. Students at my school are pretty rich and they all can afford to shell out the huge sums of money to get people to review their essays and even write them (in some cases), me included.\n\nBut i never felt the need to get an external counselor cause I think my school's one is sufficiently good, and that most college essay counselors write shittier essays than i do \ud83d\ude36\nI would not consider myself a great great writer, but the work of some of these counselors are horrible and don't deserve how much they're paid. So i became the only person in my friends circles to not have an external counselors, which is quite unusual. Anyone else who can afford these people easily but just don't feel the need to?",
