  "text": "\nI submitted my CSS profile and received an email from college bird saying that I have to upload tax returns on IDOC. Living in Italy, all my tax documents are in Italian. Since they are 20+ pages long, can I upload only the pages where wages and taxes are indicated or do I have to upload and translate all of them? \nMoreover, even on the couple of page in which wages and taxes are indicated, there are other numbers that have nothing to do with them. Can I translate only the section regarding taxes and wages or do I have to translate all of them? \n\nThank you in advance!",
