If you want community college is really affordable and you can later transfer over to a top university for the remaining 2 year. It\u2019ll save you a decent amount of money because I only paid 2k in total for my community college tuition now I\u2019m applying to some top schools for political science like UCLA and Berkeley.\ud83d\udc4d",
