              "text": "One stat I've always wanted to see is the SAT range of students \\*graduating\\* from schools.  Given how folks use rankings (i.e. to make assumptions graduates based on the school they attended), it seems like you'd care more about the set of individuals \\*exiting\\* a school than the set \\*entering\\*.\n\nThis should tend to inflate every school's range somewhat since (I would guess) students with lower scores are less likely to earn a degree, but I suspect it would particularly benefit schools with lower graduation rates.  These admit a large % of marginal students with the expectation that many won't make it through to graduation.  The set that \\*do\\* make it through, however, may be roughly comparable to the set of graduates of schools that are more selective.",
