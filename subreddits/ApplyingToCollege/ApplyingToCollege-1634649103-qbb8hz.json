              "text": "One stat I've always wanted to see is the SAT range of students \\*graduating\\* from schools.  Given how folks use rankings (i.e. to make assumptions graduates based on the school they attended), it seems like you'd care more about the set of individuals \\*exiting\\* a school than the set \\*entering\\*.\n\nThis should tend to inflate every school's range somewhat since (I would guess) students with lower scores are less likely to earn a degree, but I suspect it would particularly benefit schools with lower graduation rates.  These admit a large % of marginal students with the expectation that many won't make it through to graduation.  The set that \\*do\\* make it through, however, may be roughly comparable to the set of graduates of schools that are more selective.",

Those are the students any applicant will likely spend their time with as peers in their years at school anyway. \n\nOn a related note, I\u2019d like to see FT attrition rate over the first two years by race/economic status. That would be a useful measure of academic support. I know they already do it w Pell v non-Pell for graduation, but most of that battle is fought in the first two years.",
