  "text": "So basically I have the PSAT tomorrow and didn't study for it. I'm a junior and I already know about nat merit but I live in Florida and the cutoff this year is high I think, I also have prepaid and am going for bright futures. So my main question is that is the PSAT important? Will it effect my college admissions and if I get a low score will it negatively effect me? (UF is my goal) \n\nTldr: didnt study for psat, very worried, is psat important, will I lose anything from scoring badly",
