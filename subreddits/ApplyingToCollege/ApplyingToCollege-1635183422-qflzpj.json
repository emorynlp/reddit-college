  "title:": "Guys my school has a weird AP course system (?)",
  "text": "Basically my shitty school allows up to only 2 AP courses each year and if we want to take different courses we have to pay for it. Also the 2 courses we take are online classes. \n\nThe courses are then applied to our GPA if and only if we finish the courses until the end of the semester.\nBut the real problem is that those online courses are not done by our school teachers but some weird website.\n\nOur school gives us an ID and a password to log in and we should take the courses in our free time. \n\nSo It\u2019s like our school has an AP class but at the same time it doesn\u2019t \nAnd I really don\u2019t know how to explain this to universities I am applying to. the system so complicated and ridiculous",

      "text": "Ask your counselor to see a copy of your school profile. This is a document that the school will send to colleges along with your official transcript. The school profile should probably explain the nuances of the AP situation at your school.\n\nBut you could also explain this in the \u201cadditional information\u201d box (on Common App, for instance).",
