  "text": "Basically my shitty school allows up to only 2 AP courses each year and if we want to take different courses we have to pay for it. Also the 2 courses we take are online classes. \n\nThe courses are then applied to our GPA if and only if we finish the courses until the end of the semester.\nBut the real problem is that those online courses are not done by our school teachers but some weird website.\n\nOur school gives us an ID and a password to log in and we should take the courses in our free time. \n\nSo It\u2019s like our school has an AP class but at the same time it doesn\u2019t \nAnd I really don\u2019t know how to explain this to universities I am applying to. the system so complicated and ridiculous",
