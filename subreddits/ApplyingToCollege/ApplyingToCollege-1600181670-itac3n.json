They will also likely file a CPS report, so don't be surprised if they do this, too.\n\n2) You can omit what is going on at home (please don't) and just tell your counselor about what the teachers are doing. Your counselor may either take your word for it and go up to bat for you, or ask you wtf is going on at home that you need them to go to bat for you. Personally, I would want to know the story, if I'm putting my neck out there and standing up for you.

I had to ask my future professor for a join code or something, so I did so, but she denied that such a thing existed, accused me of lying to a college professor, then reported me to administration. I reported her behavior to the school but never received any updates",

I had horrible problems at home, my mom was a druggie and alcoholic, it made living life as normal almost impossible. I was in this stupid fucking AP class I wasn\u2019t allowed to transfer out of (I begged, I pleaded, no one cared). I had an especially hard night with mom and didn\u2019t do the required 40 pages of reading and 8 pages of notes. This fuckin teacher thought the best way to punish me would be belittling me in front of the entire class and telling me that if I didn\u2019t do my homework I would end up \u201cworking at Burger King forever and being a no good loser\u201d. I left the class crying and just never came back. \n\nThat pain hurts. I don\u2019t know you, and I don\u2019t know your situation, but if there\u2019s anything I can recommend- don\u2019t give up please. I wish every day I hadn\u2019t dropped out, it made life so much harder for a solid 5 years and I\u2019ve had to majorly self-advocate for EVERYTHING in college. You will be light years ahead if you manage to stick it out. \n\nAnd on top of that I just want to offer you virtual hugs if you want them. It fucking sucks to live like that and the people who should be understanding and compassionate just take the opportunity to kick you down further. It\u2019s a shitty experience and I wish you didn\u2019t have to go through it.\n\nPlease message me if there\u2019s any way I can help you, I\u2019m personally moved and I\u2019ll do what I can to help if you reach out.

I won't pretend I can relate but like I said i've known a bit of the verbal abuse, irrational/hypocritical/utterly illogical and idiotic guilt tripping, etc. \n\nYou probably know on an intellectual level that her abuse has no bearing on your character, but emotionally when you're hammered continuously it can start to wear on someone. I'm no counselor, but please take my reassurance as an Internet stranger that you will get through this. Maybe I'm idealistic, and I certainly don't feel this way when I'm down -- but perhaps there is something noble about surviving the torment, and learning to grow from it.
