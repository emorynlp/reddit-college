  "text": "Most of my friends have interviewed with college Seniors or fairly young alumni, but how do I go about formality with interviewers that are a bit older? While I'm emailing with my interviewer right now, they're signing off with their first name, would it be appropriate for me to refer to them over email as such, or stick to Mr./Ms. ??",

If they sign first and last name, respond Mr./Ms./Dr. etc. \n\nWhen meeting for the first time, either in-person or remotely, the same rules apply. If you address them formally, they will likely say \"call me John.\"\n\nIf the interviewer is a student, call them by their first name.",
