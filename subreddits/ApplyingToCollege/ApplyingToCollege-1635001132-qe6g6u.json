      "text": "It doesn't matter what prompt you do. The prompts exist as a starting point for you to write about yourself. My advice is write 650 words that convey the authentic version of you who isn't apparent through your application. By the time you're done, you'll most likely realize you've answered one or more of the prompts. If not, then you can select Prompt 6.",

I spent weeks struggling with my commonapp because I tried to answer a specific prompt\u2026 once I started to just write random words, I came up with an idea and first draft within a day. My essay was completed and polished a week later; turns out it fit the exact same prompt I was attempting (and failing) to write\n\nJust start writing, the rest will just fall into place",
