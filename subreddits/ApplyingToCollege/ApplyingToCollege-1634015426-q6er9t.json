  "text": "I would like to preface this post by saying that this is a bit of a silly and trivial question however, that will not stop me from asking it hahaha. I\u2019m a current senior, and I do the morning announcements everyday at school (I say the pledge of allegiance, read announcements pertaining to athletics, clubs, school happenings etc). It takes up only about 10 minutes each morning, however I am one of two students who gets to read the announcements. Is it worthwhile to put this somewhere on my applications? Or is it not important enough to weave in? It feels too minuscule to put down as an activity but I do devote some of my time and energy towards it. Overall, I am conflicted and open to any advice pertaining to the subject.\nTLDR: I read the announcements everyday at school, it is not something super significant but I am wondering if there is a good way to communicate it on my college applications.",
