  "text": "My parent is telling me to not report that we have real estate in the CSS form if it is not required so I can have more financial aid. I\u2019m very apprehensive because it\u2019s only requiring the number of real estate properties after I check off the box that we do have real estate. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "text": "First, go ask your college counselor if real estate is required in the CSS form (Sorry, I don't know either). But, if it's not, then don't submit it. Because if it's not required, then other people aren't doing it either. Yet, I also believe that it is required so this wouldn't even be a question at that point.",
