  "text": "i\u2019m an int\u2019l student; i did the IGCSEs in grade 9-10 and a-levels in grade 11-12. a-levels are divided into as-levels (g11) and a2 (g12).\n\ni got:\n\u2022 9a* 1b at igcse level\n\u2022 3a 1b at as-level (max grade is a)\n\u2022 1a* 3a predicted at a2\n\nis that a significant downward trend? my grades primarily dipped bc i developed severe ocd \u2014 i was diagnosed and everything, but i will not be mentioning this anywhere since most people advise against mentioning mental health issues. i moved to a new (more rigorous) school after g10, so that\u2019s prob what i would use as the reason. but i also don\u2019t want it to seem like i can\u2019t handle rigour aaaa.\n\ni applied to harvard rea (w a 1460, which is their 25th percentile), so idk if i should upload an explanation for the downward trend. any advice? \n\nthank you so much!",
