  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m an international student,  3 years studying in Texas. I\u2019m struggling to find a school where I don\u2019t have to pay a lot of money. University of Texas at Arling and U of North Texas are two schools that have scholarship around ~10k. I\u2019m still trying to find any school in Texas that have scholarship barely paid for the tuition. \n\nI\u2019m afraid my parents can\u2019t afford colleges if I don\u2019t get any scholarship at UTA, UNT or any other school.  Any advice would help me so much, thank you!",
