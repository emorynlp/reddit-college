  "text": "Hey guys, quick question relating to hiding the subject line and body text preview for  admissions decisions on gmail. I\u2019m applying to a lot of programs that send acceptances/rejections via email instead of through the website or portal, and it\u2019s the second time that I\u2019ve ruined the moment by checking my email (which I have to do 24/7 for other things) and seeing the decision right away. I really want to be with my family when I open admissions decisions, so the fact that as soon as I open my email I can see \u201cCongratulations\u201d or other info in the subject line kind of kills the moment\u2026 wondering if any of you know how to hide the subject so that I can only see who the sender is on Gmail? I kinda rambled anyway lmk if that makes sense and thanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR Being able to see the subject line of unopened emails ruins admission decisions. How do I hide the subject and message preview so that I can only see the name of the sender on Gmail? Thanks!",

      "text": "If you use Gmail you can put a add a label to your email address after a plus sign, then filter those out of your inbox.  You would use an address like [\"myemail+college@gmail.com](mailto:\"myemail+college@gmail.com)\".  But you would have had to use that email address when you applied.\n\nShort of that, you could create a keyword filter that looks for the names of the schools you applied to.",
