  "text": "I've seen countless people on this subreddit and on r/chanceme with awesome stats and really distinctive ECs (publications etc.) applying at most to second-tier schools (UNC, NYU, and sometimes lower). Comments are usually harsh too. Why? Is it really that competitive or are people just undermining themselves?\n\nEdit: Let me clarify, there are incredible schools that are not considered T20, but there are applicants who (I believe) are very much qualified for T20s who don't apply. I wanted to know why- that's it.\n\n&#x200B;",

Aggressive. Outgoing. Locked-on. Informed. Personable. Rock-Stars.  \n\nWe have threads here in A2C where people are asking for career guidance on what degree or job to take with soul-crushing introversion so bad they can't talk to a Professor.  \n\nRespectfully, and meaning no hate or ill-will, but you can be smart as hell, and savagely destroy your standardized tests, and write a majestic and glorious essay, but if you can't sell yourself to a recruiter in sixty seconds, you're not going to be offered that glorious job opportunity that you are dreaming about.  \n\n\nPeople latch on to the fantasy or narrative that \"If I can just get into <PrestegiousU>, I'll be set for life.\" and it's just an incomplete view of the recruiting process.  \n\nNobody wants to think of themselves as average.  \nNobody wants to be told they are average or not-exceptional.  \n\nBut there is no guarantee that you will receive an especially high-paying job-offer just because you attend a higher-tier university.  \n\nThe opportunities are probably there. But that doesn't guarantee you will be handed one of them.  \n\nEmployers have to pay the university to attend a career fair, or otherwise recruit from a graduating class.  \n\nBetter universities charge more money for access to their pool of graduates.  \n\nIf a high-end employer paid top-dollar for the ability to recruit, they aren't looking for average applicants - they came looking for exceptional applicants.  \n\nSo...  \n\nIf you reach and stretch and claw your way into a top-tier university, you might find the academic workload so challenging you have difficulty maintaining the 3.5+ overall GPA the recruiters want to see.  \n\nMeanwhile, you could have been at your State's Flagship University, in the Honors College, on a 90% Scholarship, with an academic workload that is better aligned to your capabilities where you are maintaining that 3.5+ overall GPA...",
