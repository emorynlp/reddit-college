  "text": "So I am currently taking a gap year and preparing to apply to colleges this November. However, most colleges require 1-2 recommendation letters from teachers, and at this point in time, 2/3 of the teachers I have requested a rec letter from are no longer in my school and they don't seem to be responding. \n\nAll I have is my counselor's recommendation and 3 ghosted emails. Any suggestions? Please help, need advice.",
