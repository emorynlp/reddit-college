If you don't want to go to art school then don't apply to art school.  If you don't want to major in art then don't list \"Art\" as your major when applying to non-Art schools.\n\nPhotography is a fine EC, but it's basically like a hobby unless you can demonstrate a pattern of sustained involvement or \"achievement\".  For instance, if you were the photographer for your school's newspaper for several years.  Or, as you mention, if your photography was of such high quality that you placed in photo contests.",

      "text": "Listen, you\u2019re ruining yourself. The way an activity has all the fun sucked out of it is by you making it about something stressful instead of just doing it. Just do it. Enjoy it. Then whatever you have come Summer 2023, you can put on your application. Photography itself won\u2019t be a spike EC if it\u2019s not related to your major. Like if you grew your account to 10k followers, you could maybe argue the connection with marketing. But you don\u2019t need to try to make it something that relates to engineering when it just doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s great to have stuff outside of your major. If you develop a spike plus have a hobby that shows you\u2019re actually passionate about other things besides a degree, you\u2019ll look amazing. And when it comes to impressing people, that comes from genuine accomplishment. So if you do photography and it takes you places, obviously a STEM program AO will still be impressed because achievement in anything shows that you\u2019re capable of doing things. Just like if you went to the Olympics for skiing. Does that have anything to do with engineering? No. But of course that\u2019ll be a major plus to someone\u2019s application anyways.\n\nBut again, don\u2019t ruin the activity for yourself by putting pressure on it. It\u2019s important to just do things for the fun of it. Please have fun!",

              "text": "Basically a spike is just a common theme throughout your entire application. So for instance, if you wanted to major in public policy, a spiked EC would be something that has to do with public policy\u2013 like leading an organization that does a ton to cause change in the world. Another example would be a computer science major having developed an app that got 50k downloads. \n\nYou can enter into university undeclared, but I would try to find your area of interest. There\u2019s no pressure to find one thing, but just do a bunch of different stuff if you don\u2019t have a clear path. Join clubs definitely, but just watch a TON of YouTube videos on careers, schools, and degrees. Some schools it\u2019s fine to go into without a clear interest. Like UChicago, Brown, Harvard, Princeton, and a lot of top private schools because they let you move majors pretty easily. But for public schools, it\u2019s imperative you have a major that you\u2019re applying to. At good public schools like UT or the UCs, it\u2019s practically impossible to go in undeclared and then get into a competitive major before your senior year. It\u2019s just as impossible to switch from one major to another if they\u2019re in separate colleges.",
