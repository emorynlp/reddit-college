  "title:": "Entering double period classes in Coalition",
  "text": "I had double period AP chem in my junior year, and have double period AP phys now. My HS transcript shows these classes as 1 credit/semester (as against .5/sem for other classes). Common app asks you to enter the number of credits for each class, but Coalition doesn't.\n\nHow do you enter such classes in Coalition so that you don't appear to be one class short? If Coalition (or any school using this information from Coalition) calculates GPA without the correct credit information, it would be slightly off.",
