  "title:": "Anybody else desensitized to receiving bad grades?",
  "text": "Idk if it's just me but bro. For my last physics test, the class average was a 40 fucking percent. And our physics quizzes are graded out of 3 points open ended w/ no partial credit, so make one factoring mistake and you automatically get a 66%. And our first WHAP quiz was like a 50%.\n\nI feel like at this point I'm so desensitized to receiving shitty ass grades because I've gotten so many already and because everyone around me is getting the same type of grades too. It kinda doesn't phase me anymore and I feel like thats not good lol. But yea idk if it's just my school or junior year. Lmk how it is for you b/c now I'm kinda curious.\n\nThis recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qrnk2o/nothing_like_being_in_highschool_and_the_class/) inspired me to ask this question.",

That class is a load of caca, and every kid in it bitches about it at least once per day. Kids are consistently getting 30%s and the averages are in the 60%s. Our teacher wasted an 40 minutes last class lecturing us on how it's normal to be getting bad grades in the class. She then said that the busy work she grades is meant to balance those out. We have reading quizzes where you read 50 pages of textbook on your own then answer some vague questions with answers that all sound correct. \n\nTo answer your question ( sorry about the rant), yeah. I'm happy with anything above 85% in WHAP, but not for other classes. At this point, I'm just happy to get the bare minimum.",
