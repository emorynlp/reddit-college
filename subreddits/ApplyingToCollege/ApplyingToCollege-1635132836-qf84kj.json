  "title:": "Question about sports for my activities section",
  "text": "Hi! I play a varsity sport at my school and I'm putting it pretty high up on my activities list, but I'm not looking to be recruited and that never has been my goal. However, I'm currently the #1 player on the team, and the #2 player *is* being recruited for the sport and has offers from pretty good schools. Would it make sense to include that in my description of the activity? It seems a bit trivial but it might contextualize my #1 spot and make it clear that it's actually somewhat of an achievement. Thank you in advance :D",

      "text": "I would not talk about any other student, but if you are the top athlete in your school sport, describe THAT (like \u201cteam captain, finished first in district tournament and third in state, named to League First Team and county All-Star team\u201d). Those details will tell them you are recruitable without you having to directly say it.",
