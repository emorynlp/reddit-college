  "title:": "Is it weird to do a lot of research when looking for the right college?",
  "text": "May sound like a dumb question, but am I weird for looking for researching colleges? My friends now have a running joke that i'm the \"if you mention college \\*my name\\* will know all about it haha\". And i'm like, doesn't everyone research where they wanna go? Like this is the next 4+ years of our lives, shouldn't you do as much research as you can??\n\nAn example of this is one of my friends going to York University in the UK. He basically just choose the uni on a whim just because it had his major. But he hates it there, doesn't connect well with the other students, doesn't like the classes, doesn't even like York in general. Like if you did some research on it wouldn't you have known you would hate it there? \n\nAnyway, that ends my TED talk, thank you",
