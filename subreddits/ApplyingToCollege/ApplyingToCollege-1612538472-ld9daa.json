  "text": "i'm not the best at talking to people, but it would be so fun to get to know strangers just a lil bit by reading about them- i wish somebody would compile a book of essays written by the average American teen (not the extra stiff stuff in the Harvard/Stanford books) so we could kind of see a reflection of our generation on paper. yano, the head and the heart of zoomers all in times new roman 11 pt single space.\n\ni wouldn't want it to be a guide for how to get into top colleges or bag a seat at an Ivy- i wanna read essays from every corner of the nation with every color of ambition. the honest, the quirky, the cute, the heart warming, i mean heck, we just wrote our own coming-of-age stories. why aren't we shouting from the rooftops?\n\nidk what dy'all think? after college decisions come out, can we make it happen? no flex essays, just stories about kids growing up?\n\n\\*Edit: ok so say somehow someone made this happen, what would you wanna title it? any ideas?\n\n\\*Edit 2: ok y'all i'm really bored in class so i'm just daydreaming rn. but if thisss actuallllyyy happened we could use the profit from publishing the book to set up an a2c scholarship or smth\n\n\\*Edit 3: lolz i might still be daydreaming but if ya wanna help make this legit PM me por favor <3",

My story was about an interview/audition/tryout thing and how I'd prepared and stressed about it, but my ending was me waking out of there accepting my result--I didn't know my result at the time, but I'd gotten to the point of just thinking \"so be it\". I'm proud of that ending. The rest of my essay was a bit clich\u00e9 tho :(",

My original idea would be to host on GitHub, but that doesn't allow for php or server side code, so I don't think we'd be able to have people make their own accounts. Or perhaps we could make it a submission style thing, where we set up an email that people can submit essays to, we have someone look them over and see if they are appropriate, and put them in the appropriate category within the website. I'm certain that this community is full of Web Developers that are willing to help (myself included!). PM me if you would like to discuss this further, I really think we can do this!",
