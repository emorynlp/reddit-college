  "text": "Was in the process of applying to Notre Dame for the Fall semester as an incoming freshman, however noticed that in the Declaration of Finances Notre Dame requires you to display *4 years of finances*.\n\nIs this the way it works? Don't think any other colleges have a similar requirement (mostly just for a year).",
