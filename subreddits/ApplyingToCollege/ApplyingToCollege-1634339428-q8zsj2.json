  "text": "I went to a CC for 4 semesters and because of VISA issues when covid hit (international student), I am currently spending a semester on another CC. I plan to transfer to my final University where I hope to graduate from. I am aware I would have to submit 2 transcripts from my last CC and the current CC. \n\nI'm curious what transcript they emphasize more. This is especially important because I scored a cumulative GPA of 2.6 from my last CC and (almost certainly) a 3.8 in my new CC.\n\nI am planning to talk to my academic advisor on this but I would just like to get a jist of it since the academic advising is closed on weekends. Thank you stay safe!",
