  "text": "I don't have a very good feeling about my interview. I don't know if I was being tested or if the interviewer was just strange. First, he \"arrived\" via zoom 45 minutes late, Of course I didn't say anything about it because what could I possibly say? So I acted like he showed up on time. Then he asked me about one of my teachers that he happens to know and I answered that I really like her and she's been a great teacher, etc. He then says he doesn't think much of her and he's \"not a fan\". Was he testing me to see if I would then conform to his opinion? He then tells me that he has 3 kids and they are double legacies and not one got into the school he was interviewing me for so \"don't get your hopes up\"! He was cold and unfriendly and if he has a chip on his shoulder about his own kids not being accepted should the fate of other kids be in his hands? This sucks to be honest.",

On the one hand, I feel like you should share this info with your Admissions Officer, but on the other hand, I understand not wanting to hurt your chances of acceptance by being misinterpreted or not believed. I wonder if there is a way to make an anonymous report somehow.",
