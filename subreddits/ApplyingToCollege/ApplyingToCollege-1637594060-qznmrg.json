      "text": "Imo, it is alright. I named one professor for my Why Us essay and even the current students that I asked for review said that it\u2019s recommended to do so. I\u2019d rather name one than multiple professors, and dive into the reflection on the aspects of that particular research that inspired you, and what you hope to gain if you were a student (e.g. you\u2019d want to have a direct interaction with said professor).",
