Can i assign her as a teacher again but with a different email so that she can send another rec letter without specified college? If not, are there any other ways around this besides asking another teacher for a new rec?",
  "text": "I already applied for early action for the specified college, but i have to apply for other schools later. If I assign her as a teacher again, but with a different email so that she can submit a rec letter without the specified college wouldn\u2019t it be okay since it\u2019s going to send to the school and it wont matter if it looks weird to have two recommenders of the same name in the common app?",
