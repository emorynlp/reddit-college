  "text": "I didn\u2019t know when I submitted my caltech application early action that they need a recommendation letter from English/social science teacher. Both of mine are from science. Is it too late for my teacher to submit one at this point? If not, can I change my decision to regular since some colleges allow me to do that?",

      "text": "1) Many colleges will allow more time for the LOR.\n2) Almost all will allow you to switch to RD.\n\nI would try to see if you can get the recommendation in and, if not, the school will likely contact you or switch you to RD and you can monitor in your portal. I\u2019m speaking generally and cannot answer specifically for Caltech. Good luck!",
