  "text": "Basically does ED 1 have more acceptance rate than ED 2? \n\nLike, why would I apply ED 1 to a school that offers ED 2 as well instead of applying ED 1 to a school that only offers ED 1 ?\n\nFor an example, should I apply ea to Columbia and Ed 2 to northeastern in case I don\u2019t get in ea Columbia ? Or just do ED1 northeastern to up my chances at being in a top university?\n\nI\u2019m confused and would like opinions, thanks loves !",

Not all schools release this information.\n\n>For an example, should I apply ea to Columbia and Ed 2 to northeastern in case I don\u2019t get in ea Columbia ?\n\nColumbia has ED1, not EA. So, assuming Columbia is your top choice and you are certain it's affordable, then yes, you can ED1 to Columbia and ED2 to Northeastern if you are not admitted to Columbia.\n\nNotice that other applicants to top schools might use a similar timing strategy.",
