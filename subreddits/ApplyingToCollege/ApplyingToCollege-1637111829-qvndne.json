  "text": "Title. Just learned from some people applying Ed that they can still submit early applications. Makes my REA feel really pointless - why can schools like Stanford just offer ea if REA doesn\u2019t even give much of a boost? They\u2019ll still get a smaller applicant pool",

It still serves as a form of demonstrated interest, but these 4 schools are confident enough to not need a binding requirement.",

That being said, I think these applicants do get a slight boost even if the schools don't announce this fact.",
