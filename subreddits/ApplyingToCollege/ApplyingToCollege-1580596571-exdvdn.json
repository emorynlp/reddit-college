  "title:": "My Dartmouth interviewer made a *SIZE* joke during my interview",
  "text": "I wish this was a shitpost...\n\nThe interviewer I got was probably in his late 50s to early 60s, very proud of his school, and struck me as the 'former frat boy' type.\n\nHe starts the interview by asking, \"What's your biggest accomplishment?\"\n\nMe: \"Hm, I would definitely say my biggest acc-\"\n\nHim: \"Not that size matters, ha! I bet you wouldn't worry about that\" **(gesturing down)**\n\n*(For context, I'm about 6'4\")*\n\nAt first I thought he was talking about my height and laughed with him, thinking this was one of those *\"oh wow you're so tall, do you play basketball?\"* moments... until I realized what he actually meant. It was actually really funny now that I think of it. I wasn't uncomfortable or anything, it just caught me off guard.\n\nOverall though the interview went really ~~good~~ well! He was a fun personality- it just took some getting used to!\n\nEdit: Again, not a shitpost. Yes it actually happened.\n\nEdit 2: Grammar",

I think you\u2019re thinking of it this way because of the genders involved; if it was a 50 year old man saying this to a 17/18 year old girl, I really doubt anyone would encourage her to \u201cbe flattered\u201d or that it\u2019d make a good story \u2014 you\u2019d be encouraging her to reach out to the uni because someone in a position of power (not to mention just way too old) turned their college interview weird by making an awkward sexual advance. \n\nBut again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a pick up line, though it is massively inappropriate.
