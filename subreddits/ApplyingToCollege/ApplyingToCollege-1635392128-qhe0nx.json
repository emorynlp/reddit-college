  "text": "So basically I want to say that I acted as the on-the-field captain for my soccer team my sophomore and junior year, but was not given the \"official\" name of captain because the coach really did not like me. (He would goof off all practice and not help our team, we did poorly and whenever I would call him out he would get mad, he later quit due to bad results with the team and because he fucked a players mom and threatened to take away the kids playing time if she didn't continue...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere, if at all, should I put this information. Because truly I was the best \"Captain\" on the team, as the official captains wouldn't lead for crap and were super negative all the time. Everyone agreed I should've been captain lol",

You're not explicitly calling yourself captain, but you're implying that A. you were basically a captain, and B. you held the position & responsibilities of a captain.",
