  "text": "I am an international applicant with US citizenship. However, as I attended events with my Chinese name as the official language of the country I currently live in are Chinese. Therefore, all of my certificates are Chinese, even the ones from international events, because I was chosen as the representative of the country, it also has my Chinese name in pinyin on it. However, my American passport only have my English name because my parents did not give me a Chinese name until we move back to Taiwan when I was one years old. How do I prove to colleges that these name on the certificates are me?",
