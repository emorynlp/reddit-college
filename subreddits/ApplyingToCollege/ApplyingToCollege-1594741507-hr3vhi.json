Schools don't sell their lists to other schools, instead, schools buy names/emails from companies like the College Board, Niche, or any other college search site/company including dedicated enrollment name sellers like Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL). If any place is asking you to submit your name and email address, you bet they're tracking everything you do on that account and notifying the school if you indicate any interest (so long as the school is willing to pay the .42c or so per name)",

And, no offense to op, but that's super extra and way more work than it needs to be.\n\nIf you get an email from a college you don't want to go to ever, just unsubscribe then, and you never have to deal with them again. In op's case, it seems like they never unsubscribed from anything until after committing, so they went through to find every single unique college that had emailed them. Imo this is the unnecessary part. After you commit just unsubscribe from the dozen or whatever colleges that are in your recent emails. Then, if any other colleges email in the future, you can just unsubscribe from them. Unsubscribing from even half a dozen of the most spammy colleges in your inbox will basically mean you rarely get college emails, and when you do get the odd one out it's easy to spot and fix.",
