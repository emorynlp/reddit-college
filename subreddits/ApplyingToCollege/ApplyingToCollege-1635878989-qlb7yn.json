  "text": "Title. I forgot to self report them, I guess because I was going test optional and mentally lumped the SAT/ACT with my AP scores but I have a 5 on multiple exams and I'd like to showcase that. Would I look bad if I sent Yale an email detailing my AP scores, or should I just stay silent so they don't think I'm irresponsible or scattterbrained?",
