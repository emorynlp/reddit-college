  "text": "I have decided to EA at UChicago & Knox College.\n\nHowever, NYU (all 3 campuses) allows me to withdraw out of ED if it's not financially viable for me. In that case, can I ED to both Emory & NYU? (Note, Emory's ED too follows the same rule).\n\nI am really confused as most people say that I can only ED to one school, however seeing that both unis are non-restrictive if I am asking for financial aid, I am drawn towards the idea of EDing at both schools. I am not looking for anything that I can't get out of.\n\n(International btw)",
