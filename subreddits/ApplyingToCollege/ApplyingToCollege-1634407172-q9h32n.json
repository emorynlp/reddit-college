  "text": "So I was reading my cousin's personal statement last week and a majority of her essay was talking about this one incident about her childhood. Like it went into the DETAILS of what happened with a lot of imagery and prose that took a huge chunk of word count. REALLY WELL WRITTEN tho but I feel like it was superficial. How is an incident from when you were eight help you? Like I understand if it was your hook or smtng but she spent over 400 words describing the moment that happened in detail and the \"consequences\". I did like her overall theme since it was about creativity but it felt well written yet superficial. I know a lot of ppl do this where they take a random moment that is important to them, and load the readers with sensory description that sounds pretty but doesn't get to the point. My question is, would ao's rather see a general overview and insight into your personality or should we get into a small detail about our life, expand it, and relate to us?",

You can have some, but 400 words is the majority of the essay, and that severely restricts the amount she can talk about the stuff that she needs to.",
