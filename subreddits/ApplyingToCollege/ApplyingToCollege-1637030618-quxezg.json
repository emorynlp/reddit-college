  "text": "So, I\u2019m currently applying for a scholarship under this program my teacher recommended. But, they require that my teacher reviews my application and in one of the essays, I mention when I got SA\u2019d as a kid. The thing is it was a VERY long time ago and I indicate that my family is aware. Would she still have to report it to the school?",
