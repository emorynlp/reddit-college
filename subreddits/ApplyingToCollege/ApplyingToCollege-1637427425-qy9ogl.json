      "text": "There\u2019s so much overlap that it shouldn\u2018t be terrible.  In fact, because of the amount of overlap, the double-major combination is actually not even allowed at some schools. (I\u2019m looking at you, Yale.)\n\nMany schools have a specific \u201cMathematical Economics\u201d or similarly named major that combines the two. Yale, Wisconsin, Illinois, Penn, UCLA come to mind.  Also look for terms like \u201ceconometrics\u201d and \u201cquantitative economics.\u201d",

      "text": "I don't think it's especially hard - it's a fairly common combination.  If it ends up being too much work you can usually just drop back to a minor in one of the subjects too.\n\nSleep schedule and social life really just depends on you and how much work the material is for you. Math can certainly be challenging, but it generally doesn't have the volume of work that something like mechanical engineering does.",
