  "text": "So, I'm the parent. My kid applied EA to 5 schools and RD to 3.  The deadline for their preferred EA school is 11/15. We requested the transcripts and LOR weeks ago through Naviance. LOR came in no problem. Transcripts have not. My kid has emailed the GC more than once and he keeps saying that \"he'll get to it.\"\nTheir preferred school has even emailed us saying they will accept an unofficial transcript for now. We need school aid, so applying early was a tactical decision on our part.\n\nMy kid is a middle of the road B+/A- student and I feel like they are getting ignored by guidence for kids applying to more prestigious schools. Which is bullshit, imo. \n\nI don't want to be THAT parent, but I'm wondering if it's time for me to start getting pushy.\n\n\nUpdate: I emailed the GC and was nice about it, but let him know that I was monitoring the situation. (Said something like \"Hey, I know I told my kid that they should let you know about the upcoming deadline, but I'm just making sure they did, since it's coming in a few days...\")\nTranscripts sent in Naviance an hour later.",

That\u2019s where you will see what\u2019s been received by the colleges. \n\nWe have a spreadsheet going with school name, app type, submitted (y/n), materials deadline, portal url, admissions rep name (if applicable). It\u2019s helped keep things organized",

Sadly, if you are not aggressive in obtaining help for your student, they may fall though the cracks.  Long term solution:  complain to your school board.  Short term solution: hire private school counselor for $$$$.",
