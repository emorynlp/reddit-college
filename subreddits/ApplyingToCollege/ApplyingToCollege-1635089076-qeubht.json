  "text": "I\u2019m in my sophomore year. I just transferred to a new school, and I want get at least a couple letters of recommendation from teachers. I feel like doing it sooner since I don\u2019t want my teachers to forget me or something, and I want a compelling letter. Seen as I\u2019m not sure what program I want to do for college, should I still try to ask my teachers for one?",
