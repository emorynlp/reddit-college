  "title:": "International Student goes to HS for Junior Year in USA and needs advice on college.",
  "text": "Hello, I'm an international student that moved into the US this summer. I just started my Junior year of HS and my parents want me to go to college here. I'm seriously overwhelmed by the things you have to do get into college, plus I have some level of anxiety, I'm homesick and I hate my new school. But I have no choice but to stay there unless I fail but I can't, especially that people for where I'm from would do anything to get the chance I have right now. (No need to worry about my mental though, I'll get through it)\n\nI come from a third world country where only academics matter. Extracurriculars are always overlooked and in the US it seems totally different. My parents want me to go to a top college where I could get a full ride because paying the large amount of college tuitions fees would be impossible for them. And maybe I'll be obligated to leave.\n\nI was wondering if y'all have any advice on things I should start doing, goals I should have if I want to get a full ride and colleges I should look at. Just give me any helpful advice really no matter the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStats\n\nThe school I come from doesn't have a gpa system but I got all A's for 9th and 10th grade except for P.E where I got a C.\n\nTook PSAT last week, don't know the result yet.\n\nI took practice SAT on Khan Academy, I got a 1160. (580-580)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtracurriculars\n\nIn my country\n10th grade Class Moderator/leader\n\nAltar Boy(secretary) in local/school church for 4 years, i spend about 5.5hrs there every week of the year.\n\nBasket ball after school for fun.\n\nDid a bit of coding(html/css)\n\nCurrently in US\n\nInvestments Club\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI probably would like to study Computer Science or Business. Idk yet. All advice appreciated.",

      "text": "If your family\u2019s annual income is under $65k, to be competitive for a full-ride, *ideally* you\u2019d want to have:\n1. High GPA (3.9+)\n2. High SAT(1550+) / ACT(35+) (sometimes it\u2019s better for intls to take the ACT because its reading section is easier than on the SAT)\n3. National/International awards (USACO, perhaps)\n4. Good essays \n5. Leadership ECs\n\nThere are exceptions to this, of course. Those, who have medals from international olympiads may have lower scores (I saw one getting into MIT with a 1300-something and another one with a 1480). Also, it\u2019s sometimes very random; I know an average stat international student from Harvard with a very unpopular major that got in who knows how and applied just because. \n\nSome colleges that give need-based aid to international students:\n1. Need-blind (your need isn\u2019t a factor in admissions): Harvard, MIT, Amherst, Yale, Princeton, and Pomona (this one is need-blind if you graduate from high school in the US, I think)\n2. Need-aware (your need is a factor in admissions, but they still give full-rides): Stanford, Columbia, Cornell, UPenn, Brown, UChicago, Duke, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Caltech, Swarthmore, Williams, Wesleyan, Haverford, Hamilton, Colby, Georgetown, Trinity College in CT, Claremont McKenna, Tufts, Dartmouth, Lafayette, Lehigh, Skidmore, Swanee, Colgate, Dickinson, Kenyon, University of Richmond, WUSTL, Washington and Lee\n\nBooks for the SAT:\n- The College Panda for Math\n- The College Panda for Writing\n- Erica Meltzer for Reading\n- The SAT Black Book for strategies (didn\u2019t use this one, but often was recommended)",

      "text": "most (if not all) the schools that meet all demonstrated need are on the very selective end.  definitely work on getting that gpa up, and more importantly, ecs. volunteer, leadership, awards, research etc. i totally understand the type of 'academics only' culture you come from, but its a whole different mindset with american colleges.  feel free to hmu if  you have some questions (i know a bit about colleges, but a lot about ecs i think) or if you just want to chat!",
