  "title:": "Is this enough to know when trying what to figure out what I want to go to college for?",
  "text": "I skipped this first semester because I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do with my life and I just needed a break. I now feel motivated, Healthy, and happy. I haven\u2019t done much research, but I have been doing a lot of thinking about what I want. I know that I want to do work that helps people, I want to be payed decently, use my mind, and Ideally not have to do much physical labor. So college it is. However, I still don\u2019t know exactly what I want to do. \n\nI think I\u2019ve narrowed it down to 3-4 broad potential fields \n\nMedical research\nCivic Engineering\nAerospace Engineering\nComputer Science (This one is the least attractive atm but I could see my mind changing on that)\n\nI\u2019m not sure really which I want to do atm, but It\u2019s a start (I\u2019ve been working a lot so researching has been difficult but luckily I have gotten my hours cut at work so ill have more time to do so) Some will be more difficult than others I know (The type of Research Geneticists would do would be different than the research of someone who researches antibiotics) \n\nBut I have to work soon today. Do you thinks this is a good start?",
