  "text": "Im in my senior year of highschool and It seems I will be graduating a semester late with a 1.5 GPA. Sad, right? Ive made my peace with that and have even decoded to go around travelling witht my saved up money for semester before starting college, meaning I'll already by behind my peers by a whole year. Plan is to go to a community college for 2 years, transfer to a university for the later half of the 4 years and get my bachelors in Biology or statisticd, and then hopefully pass the MCAT and get admitted into a medical college. This seems pretty easy on paper, But I dont even know where to start. I honestly have no clue on what to do besides the general outline of a \"plan.\" Im starting to get overwhelmed now that I figured out just how much of a failure I am. Should I just keep my head down and figure out my College admissions a during my last semester?",

      "text": "It's ok - many colleges love the Late-Bloomer/Turned My Life Around storyline, and you just have to use that to your advantage.  Can you start cc a semester early, or take some online classes first?  It might take a little time for you to get up to speed on the study habits you will need to cultivate, to get straight As in cc.  Also, you may want to start on thinking about your ECs for transfer in to a 4 yr college.  This extra semester will be a great time to start.  Good luck!",
