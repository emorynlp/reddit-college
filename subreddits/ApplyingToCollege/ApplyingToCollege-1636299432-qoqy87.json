  "text": "I applied to Yale REA and while filling out everything and doing all my essays, I really looked at myself as a strong applicant. Issue is, that just makes me daydream and way too optimistic that maybe I could actually get in (when in reality, the chances are SO slim). That\u2019s why I\u2019ve just chosen to be cautiously optimistic! Like a fusion between realism and optimism. Anybody else feeling like this right now? Lmk how y\u2019all are feeling.",

I\u2019m proud of us, and I\u2019m sure all of us will end up somewhere we\u2019ll be happy :)",

I just finished an interview today and, despite knowing the admit rate is extremely low, I'm already kinda daydreaming of what I will do when I see I'm \"accepted\" lol (I even already feel a bit of the happiness right now). I think it doesn't help that my parents keep saying I'm definitely getting in, even though that isn't remotely the case with my school/other people who apply. I just hope my heart can withstand the rejection..............",
