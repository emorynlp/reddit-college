  "text": "I love photography and I\u2019ve taught myself Adobe photoshop over the past few years (not very well haha but still). \n\nI\u2019ve been teaching myself digital photography and photoshop for 4ish years now and I\u2019m taking 3 of my friends\u2019 senior photos in the next week or so. \n\nHow would I describe this in common app? Sorry if this is a dumb question, also not asking anyone to write it for me or anything just for tips. \n\nGood luck with your apps everyone!!",
