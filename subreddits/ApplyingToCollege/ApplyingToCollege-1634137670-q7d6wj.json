  "text": "The first teacher I asked for a LOR for I was actually super excited because we knew each other pretty well. However she gave me her LOR and it was *painfully* generic. I think she just followed a template which yeah okay fair, she\u2019s a teacher with little time on her hands, but I asked over a month ago, so I thought there would be more thought put into it. Should I be disappointed? Will this ruin my chances?",
