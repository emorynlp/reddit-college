  "text": "I live in Japan and y family's income is in Japan, so my CSS profile is set in the Japanese currency (yen). However, my mom has savings in a Bangladeshi bank (where I am originally from). So, the currency mentioned in the bank statement would be in the Bangladeshi currency (taka). Would that be a problem? Do I have to have the bank statement officially changed to Japanese currency? Please tell me if any of you know about it.  Plus, the address given in the Bangladeshi bank is our old address in Bangladesh. Would that be a problem (if the address is mentioned in the statement)?",
