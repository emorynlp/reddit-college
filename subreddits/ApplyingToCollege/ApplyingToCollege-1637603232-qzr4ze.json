  "text": "\nHi everyone here are my stats:\n\nGpa: 3.06 uw 3.48 weighted\n\nSat: 1410\n\nExtra curriculars: varsity tennis 3 years, temple university urban planning course, business classes at drexel, volunteer at local tennis camp, 2 years of choir, 2 years vote registration team, urban technology project (fixed and coded computers for my school district) volunteering at farmers market, second hand clothing reselling\n\nAp\u2019s: microecon and comp sci A. Also did pre calc honors\n\nI got a bad gpa freshman and sophomore year (~2.6-2.7uw) but I really picked it up junior year (3.7uw, 3.9 weighted) and I\u2019m doing really well my senior year. My freshman and sophomore years of high school I was on a medication that had some pretty bad effects on my diet and mood which is a bit of an explanation for my poor gpa. \n\nAs of rn, Pitt is my favorite school (in state tuition, has a bunch of majors I\u2019m interested in, really like the city)\n\nI\u2019m interested in software engineering/comp sci, management information systems, business & marketing, econ, data science&statistics\n\nI can go up to 40k w/o room and board\n\nLike laid-back somewhat stoner vibe with at least some parties, but I still really wanna take college seriously.\n\nTargets: Drexel (expect merit aid), Temple, Penn state (Ik it\u2019s a good school and prob a good match for me but I don\u2019t love the idea of being in the middle of nowhere), Ud, Pitt (sorta reach), Cu Boulder (would prob only go if I got merit aid)\n\nSafeties: UOregon (I\u2019d expect to get merit aid), penn state abington\n\nReaches: Penn (only reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my dad works there), Udub, Fordham (if they give me aid, they prob wouldn\u2019t even if I did make it in), Umd",

      "text": "You could look at Kettering University if you are dead set on CS or business, it ended up being cheaper than in state tuition for me at Pitt. Might be a bit of a reach with your GPA, but if your SAT math score is very high, that will make up for it. The upward trend will also help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther good options are New Mexico Tech, OSU, Western Michigan, ASU, etc",
