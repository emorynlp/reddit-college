  "text": "If a student were applying for a certain major (Like engineering) and there was/were AP exams that they took related to that field (Calc/Physics,etc.) would those scores be looked at more so than other AP scores? Would getting a 5 on those tests increase admisison chances? If so, would the increase be miniscule or would they actually make a difference?\n\nTLDR: Do AP Exams (in a certain field) scores matter when applying for a certain  major (in that same field) besides the obvious college credit hours",
