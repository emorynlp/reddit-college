  "text": "Hi friends!\n\nDoes anyone know if US Colleges that meets 100% of demonstrated financial aid (such as Yale, MIT, Harvard etc.) provide living expenses as well? Or is it simply no tuition and you would have to pay for your own flights, meals, transport etc.?",

Need is calculated based on that total cost of attendance. Look at the travel estimate to see if it seems reasonable for you - I have no idea whether that is increased for international students.\n\nKeep in mind that your financial need is what the college thinks you need, not what you think you need.",

              "text": "Only the school knows that, but most of the schools that meet full need are very transparent about what their cost will be. You can also use their websites and plug your financial info into their Net Price Calculator and those are generally pretty accurate in my experience (unless you have a family business or another complicated financial exception). Their website should also state whether they \u201cmeet full need\u201d with loans (meaning they expect money from you) or without loans (meaning they don\u2019t expect you to take loans, but they do usually expect you to contribute $2,000 - $3,000 from summer work). Some will also include a Federal Work Study \u201caward\u201d which means you will need to also come up with more money, which they \u201chelp\u201d you obtain by offering you on campus employment during the year.",

For FAFSA 0 EFC families this basically means that you need to get a summer job to cover the costs getting to campus in August, your books, supplies and misc personal stuff.  All of the expenses that are paid directly to the university like tuition, fees, room and board are covered by aid.",
