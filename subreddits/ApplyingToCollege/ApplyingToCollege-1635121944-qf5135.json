  "text": "So im an IB senior currently outside the US, born and raised in the US , and will return to the us for college. im gonna apply early to Northwestern, but i cant get good predicted IB grades without any IB material being turned in, which we arent supposed to turn anything in yet. Can i apply twice ED and RD? I dont think my ED application will be flattering cuz i wont have accurately predicted grades. How important are reccomendation letters? since its near my hometown i know some alumni and validictorians, but i read that colleges arent really caring much about letters rn with all the bribery scandals. anyone w some insight? also my councilor is kinda an idiot, hes canadian and doesnt fully know how to do it in the US so i rather not have to rely on him",
