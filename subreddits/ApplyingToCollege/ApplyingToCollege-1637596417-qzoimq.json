  "text": "I'm an international student from India and I have received tons of emails from various colleges that I singed up for. I'm not aware of a single college that sends physical mail to internationals as mentioned on all their websites. But somehow I received a brochure and merch from Princeton. The delivery costs alone were $34 plus a lot of pamphlets and stuff. Like is this rare and has anyone got something similar.",
