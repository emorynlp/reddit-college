  "text": "hi everyone! \ni\u2019m currently a junior in high school, and i literally just now realizing that i wanna do comp-sci but i have absolutely zero comp-sci ecs!!! \n\ni\u2019m taking ap cs a this year and I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m actually pretty good and I like it not to mention that it pays well(\ud83d\ude2d) @ cs. \ni have good ecs(leadership positions, research internship, volunteering, awards, etc.) but none of them r rly related to cs at all, some r stem related tho. \n\nwould it still be possible to get into a top school with cs unrelated ecs? \nkinda freaking out\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Luckily your a Junior, you have a whole school year, and summer to work on your ECs. Some suggestions I\u2019d give:\n\n1) Join Programming, Robotics, or any IT/CS related club and try to get a leadership position.\n\n2) start a blog about any tech related things  you like.\n\n3) Create and publish an app. The publishing part helps your app so much, Colleges love seeing you take initiative and putting yourself and your ideas out there.\n\n4) Ask around for internships or research positions. Email colleges, companies, etc. even ask at your schools office.\n\nNow, To answer your question. Is it possible to get into the top cs colleges with no cs related ECs? Yes. Is it probable? No. Top Schools want to know your actually interested in the field your paying to get a 4 year degree in. \n\nTake some time at home by yourself in your room and ask these questions; Do I actually want to major in CS? Why do you want to? What\u2019s your plan after getting the degree? Do you see yourself doing this 10-20 Years from now?  Evaluate those questions and really think. I only say this because many people go into CS just because the pay is good and they see new grads making 100K+ then once they get into that field their miserable and in debt with a degree they don\u2019t want.\n\nNow after you hard analyze yourself, and make a decision that you actually want this path you take the steps needed. Get involved, and use your time wisely (including summer).\n\nAnother tip, don\u2019t worry about have all 10 of the activities on your app related to cs. Colleges want to see humanization on the application. The Majority should be focused on CS in someway, but Playing an Instrument, or starting A club shows there more to you as a person. \n\nOverall, you still have time make use of it correctly and get active in the cs field and engage in opportunities, but don\u2019t stress yourself about doing too much. Take 1-3 of the ideas I gave above and do excel at that.  \n\nQuality > Quantity when it comes to ECs.",

      "text": "I have all STEM ECs but am more interested in majoring in computer science, I applied for the STEM major best suiting my research and can just switch majors in college if I want to. Don\u2019t worry about changing all your ECs, junior year you do technically have a full year but that is not nearly as much time as the other comment makes it out to be. If I were you I would focus on whatever major best suits your ECs that you\u2019ve spent working on for years now, and then just change it once you get in if you want to pursue comp sci instead. Of course, if you really don\u2019t have any \u201cfocus\u201d at all in terms of your ECs, you should probably start working on a few computer science ones right away, but otherwise don\u2019t tear down what you\u2019ve already built to make a hard pivot. Do keep in mind different schools have different systems regarding that, just do your research.",

Those average salary statistics looked enticing?\n\nAlright, time to actually help you. Go to virtual hackathons, a ton. Look for research opportunities, and get proper internships.",
