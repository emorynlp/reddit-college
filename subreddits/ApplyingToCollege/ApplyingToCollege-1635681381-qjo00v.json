  "text": "So I wasn\u2019t born in America I was born in Kuwait but I didn\u2019t know the city but I was doing the common app and my counselor pressured me to hit submit. Now looking back I\u2019m pretty sure that I put the town immediately next to my city but not the city itself.  Thankfully only three schools had gotten the wrong birth city. Should I email the AO\u2019s about this as I\u2019m already emailing them about another mistake I made on the CSS profile.",
