  "text": "Last year (junior year/remote learning), pulling all nighters were easy. I could get as little as two hours of sleep. Now, on most occasions, I can\u2019t even stay up past 12 a.m. (I wake up at 4 a.m. for school) . Any advice on training my body to stay up? My fatigue is decreasing my work ethic.",
