  "text": "I got many emails telling me happy diwali and other stuff. Two of them were really interesting. One was asking me to join webinars and telling me that there were admissions officers in my area interested in meeting me. The other one send me a \"UNcommon application\" Listing a lot of info about lehigh. Im not sure whether this is just one of those generic emails or something that means I can get accepted.\n\n(Edit:I didn't apply and I know that likely letters are sent to people who applied I just don't know what else to call it :/)",
