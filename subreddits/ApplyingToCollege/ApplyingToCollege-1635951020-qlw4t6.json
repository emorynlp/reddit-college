  "text": "i've noticed that over the years certain ecs/activities got really popular and then as everyone starts doing them they started dying down.\n\nin the past it's been things like starting 10 clubs, getting a bunch of community service hours, service trips, and more recently starting nonprofits. what do most people tend to do nowadays? will these activities gradually lose their popularity as well?",

Typical as in grocery, fast food, retail, etc. Hard work, responsibility, real world experience, context for future learning, and a place to start your resume when you apply to real internships during college.",

I don't think this trend will die down though, because even if everyone does it it still shows personality. Just that WHAt they do will gravitate to being ever more niche and ever more unexpected. I'm already referencing the military in mine, what's next, warzones?\n\nThen one that's upcoming (\\*\\*\\*for rich people) would be actual jobs. I think they help to show you can fit into society LOL and hard work. Soon we'll see trust fund babies doing part time jobs at mac's and talk about their middle class upbringing. I also don't think this trend will die down that much.\n\nOh well, I'll make use of these two.\n\nService trips are probably extremely dead right now.",
