  "text": "Hey guys, so I applied to UConn around 14th November, and since I\u2019ve been getting emails saying my application is incomplete due to not sending my English Proficiency score (I\u2019m an international student). Which is weird, because I have my TOEFL score listed on my common app... anyway their emails redirect me to their application checklist on their portal, but I cant seem to find any button or link that actually *lets* me upload my documents/scores. I\u2019ve emailed the university 2 days ago but I haven\u2019t received any response. Can someone help me out? You can DM me too, I really need to get this sorted out",
