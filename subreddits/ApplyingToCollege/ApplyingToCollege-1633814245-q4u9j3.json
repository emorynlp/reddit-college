  "text": "(M/17). I am a Computer Science student in my first year of A levels (US high school junior year) in Pakistan, and have a British citizenship. I got 8A\\* in my O levels, if that's of any importance. I intend to apply for Oxbridge and the London Colleges CS programs next year. I'll be giving the MAT, STEP and TMUA entry tests. My current subjects in A levels are: Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science, and Physics.  Any advice for getting into these prestigious universities?\n\nAlso, I kind of want to do my masters from Stanford or UC Berkeley for a software engineering career in the Bay Area. What do I need to do to get into their graduate CS programs? Should I study for 3 years bachelor or 4 years masters beforehand from the UK?",
