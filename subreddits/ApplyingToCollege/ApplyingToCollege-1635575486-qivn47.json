  "title:": "The college(s) I plan on applying to do not offer online degrees, but I\u2019m not able to attend campus. The college offers online classes\u2014should I try applying anyway?",
  "text": "I am planning on transferring to a university next fall after I get my associate degree from community college. I currently live too far away from any university to commute, let alone to any of the ones I\u2019m considering. \n\nDue to my disability I am not able to live alone or in a dorm and my circumstances have recently changed so that I\u2019m no longer able to move closer to a campus. No problem, I prefer online classes anyway; however, the schools I\u2019m looking to apply to do not award online bachelor\u2019s degrees. They do offer online courses for credit, though.\n\nMy question is this: is it at all worth it to apply anyway and see if an accommodation can be made later on, once accepted? I say this because I\u2019ve heard universities are flexible with their policies despite presenting themselves as otherwise. The schools on the top of my list have acceptance rates between 12 and 16% but I have outstanding academic performance and plenty of unique extracurricular experience. If I were able to move to a campus I\u2019d be fairly confident in my ability to get in. I\u2019m hesitant to apply because I don\u2019t want to spend time and money on an application only to be told I have to be on campus in order to attend, regardless of their online courses. Is there any chance I could at least start in an undergraduate program at one of these schools, since they offer fully online courses for credit? Or would it be best to explore another option that guarantees an online degree? I have one in mind, I\u2019d simply prefer something with an even better program.",
