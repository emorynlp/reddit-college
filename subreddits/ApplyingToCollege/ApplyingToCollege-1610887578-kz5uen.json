So I talked about divestment, ESG, the finance side of things, worker relations etc.\n\nYou could talk more about the science side of it (geology, chem eng and so forth). The owner of an oil company definitely needs practical knowledge of earth sciences given that his money comes from there. In fact, I'm p sure he would have hired a geology major at some point.\n\nEnvironmental scientists in my experience aren't really seen as \"SJWs\" so I doubt it'll be too bad for you.",

I've worked in the environmental field since 1993 and I can promise you that you do not need to go to Stanford to be successful. The cost of the education at Stanford does not make you more marketable. Find a more affordable school with people and programs that represent what your goals are all about. Volunteer for non-profits, participate in orgs in your field, follow the regulatory community (DEQ of your state, local agencies) to stay current on regulatory trends.\n\nIvy league or elite schools for your field are a waste of money. Listen to your gut. If they are funded by an industry you think is troublesome then you can bet that they are influenced by that industry.",

For the field of earth science, or environmental science, or environmental engineering the source of the degree isn't critical it's more about the program. There are many outstanding schools out there that are not overly expensive. This is even more important given the earning potential for earth science degree is not high enough to justify a cost of several $100k to get a degree. The cost benefit just isn't there. When I look at potential candidates to hire I'm not looking at their school as a deciding factor (unless it's not acreddited). \n\nThe OP can disregard the advice or consider it, my feelings won't be hurt.",
