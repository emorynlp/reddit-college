              "text": "See if you can volunteer in your community. Work regular hours at a food bank, help run Covid vaccination sites for kids (you can be a parking lot attendant or check paperwork) next month, help run social media for a nonprofit, or mentor kids who need help catching up after a year of online school. Pick something you are passionate about and even a low level role will work.\n\nAnd remember that many of the people who go into consulting firms don\u2019t start after college; they work for 3-4 years and gain career experience, then go to an MBA and get recruited out of that program. They are able to give advice on the industries they worked in as well as general business. I worked for a top tier global management consulting firm overseas. It\u2019s been a few years but I doubt the recruiting has changed much. Only 3/50 consulting staff were fresh out of undergrad. The rest had come in after an MBA. \n\nSo while you don\u2019t want to go to an unaccredited online school for undergrad it doesn\u2019t have to be Harvard.",

If you know someone who's involved in scouting, they might have connections to organizations that need volunteers! Finally, there's always large organizations like Key Club, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, or Meals on Wheels. The national organizations usually have local chapters that you can contact to ask about volunteering.",
