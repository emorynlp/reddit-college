  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a Penn ED applicant, and I was recently chosen two selective positions. I uploaded a document explaining my roles to Penn's Applicant Portal. Should I also email their admissions office informing them of my update?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to ensure it's seen, as I believe it could have a good impact on my application.",
