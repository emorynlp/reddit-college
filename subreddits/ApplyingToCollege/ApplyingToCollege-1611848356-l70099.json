If it happens to you, please get help as soon as possible, because if you don't you could have problems for years.",

It\u2019s so competitive these days that you shouldn\u2019t face it all by yourself. Try finding current college students from the schools you want to apply to on LinkedIn, and invite them to chat with you. Reach out to an admissions consultant for more professional guidance if needed. College apps are more than just about good grades and good writing. It\u2019s also about voicing your authentic branding. Also don\u2019t forget to keep in touch with your friends! You guys can support each other. Anything that\u2019ll help you manage your stress!

For example, I know it sounds like hippie/pseudoscientific bs but meditating and focusing on how you feel in the present moment can help. Do more things you genuinely enjoy and accomplish at least a few small goals a day. Even going outside more can help.\n\nMost of all, don't stress out about feeling like that right now. A lot of people have, and a lot have gotten through it, including the aforementioned people around me. It'll go away over time, but focusing on being in the present moment can definitely help it go away quicker and get you to start feeling like youself again.
