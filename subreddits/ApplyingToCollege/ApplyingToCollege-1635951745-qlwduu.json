  "text": "i recently applied to an out of state college under early decision 1 which requires parent consent. my parents have been fine with me going out of state until yesterday, where i got a looooong lecture about it. \ni listened to their concerns such as distance, no family with me, and communication. i tried reasoning with them but they would not hear me out and called me a burden for even thinking about it. \ni had to lie about having my core classes done just so i could go to school one hour away.\nmy dad especially threatened to send me back to my home country if i asked again. how can i slowly convince them or open more options for them.",

It\u2019s a mixed feeling of proud but nervousness. We know that you are turning 18, but it\u2019s just a feeling of having to let go. Don\u2019t overthink it right now. Find a nice time and have another slow talk with both of your parents. If you have an elderly relative that support you, bring him/her in together. It could help them to go through that hurdle.",

      "text": "Maybe you could work towards going to visit the campus together so they can see how safe it is. If there\u2019s a club for people with your cultural background you could reach out to someone on the group and ask questions, and maybe find someone who would video chat with your parents where they can see and help them realize l you\u2019d have people like them around you. (Bet one of those students will understand your situation and help. You could pretend it\u2019s outreach from the school because they really want you)\n\nIt was hard for me as a parent to let my oldest daughter go 4 hours away for college. We did it because, well, it was UCLA. But both my kinda conservative Asian husband (who didn\u2019t want his daughter hanging out with boys like he was in college) and I (went to a religious college than didn\u2019t allow alcohol or sex) felt a little uncomfortable with the idea coed dorms and frat parties. We were able to pick housing options that meant she only shared a bathroom with 2-3 others though and that helped us a lot with reducing concerns. So did just knowing our daughter wasn\u2019t going to do anything too stupid.\n\nAn hour is a kind of far commute but I lived a little farther than that from my grad school, and my younger daughter can spend that much time driving home from her college if there\u2019s traffic. She opted to go to a local school she could live at home for because we saw so many incidents where people got suckered into paying for housing only to find themselves studying all online and/or locked up in quarantines or exposed to covid by roommates. You might offer to set up your schedule so you could commute 2-3 days a week and then if it gets too much you could later look for housing nearby campus - once your parents are used to the idea of you being there. We are considering paying for just a spot in a cheap double/triple room in an apartment near campus next term if my daughter has classes every day, so she\u2019d have a spot to crash but still be able to come home to the peace of her own room whenever she wants. \n\nSomeone else suggested saving up money so you wouldn\u2019t get left behind overseas. Maybe you could get a Christmas rush job? Work Black Friday weekend and a few other days and stash the money in a place only you know about and then in a bank account with a debit card when you turn 18. If they WERE to leave you overseas you might be able to work in the industry around helping prepare applications to US universities. And with documentation you might well be able to use that story to get yourself considered as independent for financial aid purposes. That\u2019s one hell of a shitty thing to threaten to do to your kid.\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t know what their plan is but if it\u2019s a nearby community college maybe you could do that and then take one class at the other school, online or one that\u2019s a 3-hour once a week course as a nondegree/extended education student. That would help them a adjust a bit if your schools would allow it.",
