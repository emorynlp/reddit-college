  "text": "A few people from my competitive public school have been admitted ED to T20s. While the rest of us are excited for their success, we aren\u2019t excited by the fact that they\u2019re refusing to withdraw RD apps, just to see whether or not they\u2019ll get in (even though they cannot attend). \u2018Just for fun, out of curiosity\u2019.\n\n... yea, don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t hurt the chances of people who are applying RD and want an equal shot at their dream school. You\u2019ve accomplished YOUR dream, and for that we say congrats, but now let us accomplish ours.",

Check out UC Irvine\u2019s recent retraction of 500 admissions in 2017. It\u2019s rare, but it happens.\n\nColleges accept students with a good idea of their yield rate, so more students are admitted than necessary. \n\nCheck out this post about why you should NOT withdraw apps right away: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/85m06r/dont_withdraw_your_applications_until_youre_sure/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

It's a really good option that's generally a tier below HYPSM but if someone's dismissing it as a 'just to see' school, then yeah I'd rather they just didn't apply. And this is coming from someone who is viewing umich as def not my top option but still would be perfectly happy if that's where I ended up going (knock on wood).",

That could be an incentive that helps everyone to play by the rules.\n\nThe other issue is that most schools do not include the financial aid package with a student's acceptance letter--why the delay? Get everything prepared and release both at the same time.....that will prevent students from waiting to hear competitive offers from their other applications. \n\nObviously, schools realize that kids are going to try to use other financial aid packages to negotiate if their offer is too low, but really, colleges, you can't have it both ways and keep the $75 fee for doing almost nothing.",
