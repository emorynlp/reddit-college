  "title:": "How much can a letter of recommendation from a Harvard prof help me?",
  "text": "I did research at Harvard with a professor, and we have a strong relationship. I'm going to be applying to Harvard, and majoring in a very very niche subject (same subject that I did research on). How much could a strong letter of recommendation from the professor potentially help my application? Like could it be make or break or just a small boost, if anything at all? Any help greatly appreciated.",

Rec letters vary from generic form letters that show support, enthusiastic letters that show huge support, etc. etc. Without reading it, I really couldn't say. \n\nI've known friends who got rec letters from profs at similarly well respected facilities...and they still got rejected. Impossible to tell with just \"it's a rec letter from harvard\".",
