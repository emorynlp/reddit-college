  "text": "I did research at Harvard with a professor, and we have a strong relationship. I'm going to be applying to Harvard, and majoring in a very very niche subject (same subject that I did research on). How much could a strong letter of recommendation from the professor potentially help my application? Like could it be make or break or just a small boost, if anything at all? Any help greatly appreciated.",
