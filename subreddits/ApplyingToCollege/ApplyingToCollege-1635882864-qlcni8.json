  "text": "I received an email from CWRU saying they received my application. I indicated in the application that I am applying to EA but also to their pre-professional scholar's program (PPSP). They said they will only be considering me for PPSP and, if rejected, will consider me in the regular decision round to attend the college. My grades are good, 4.18/4 weighted, but SAT is 1400, with no extremely special national award ECs. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on what I should do. Should I keep my application to their PPSP or should I say I would rather be considered for their EA round of applications? Thanks!",
