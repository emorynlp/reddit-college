  "text": "All my life I've wanted to go to University of Michigan, and study science. I worked hard, got good grades, a good test score, but now that I've gotten everything ready, I'm kinda facing doubts. Is it really worth it? I have a 3.99 GPA, 32 ACT, and 1410 SAT, so while I should be able to get in with that, I could also use that and go to a smaller college basically for free. I spoke to a representative of one of those colleges, and with those scores I'd be paying 1200 a year in tuition assuming I get nothing in local scholarships. So like, if that degree from U of M really worth nearly 80x that? My planned major is molecular biology, with a back up in engineering if I decide I don't like it.",

      "text": "It really depends on what you want to do. Attending a prestigious college only really helps in a few careers - Wall Street, management consulting, and academia are the main ones. Even then, if you have strong family and personal connections you can land those jobs without that. \n\nPay for an engineering job is set by the job so it doesn\u2019t matter whether you get your degree from UM or Western Michigan or Boise State, you\u2019ll get paid about the same. My daughter and her best friend are kind of angry they bought into the prestige myth - daughter went to UCLA but her coworkers attended schools like University of Scranton and Cal State Fullerton and one ended up switching jobs and making twice as much money as she does. Daughter\u2019s friend borrowed $100k to attend a well regarded small private school and realizes now her career would have been the same if she had lived at home and attended a Cal State school for $6k a year. The loans\u2026 have kind of ruined her life. \n\nBut maybe there\u2019s a way for you to have it all for cheap. Apply to UM and that cheap school. Apply to MSU because you may get a scholarship there. Then look for places that are reasonable in price for you and have a faculty member doing research you are fascinated by. If you check the bios of authors of academic journal articles you\u2019ll find many attended a school like UM and then took a job at some less known school in Florida or rural Michigan where they are continuing research with their UM mentor. You can get involved in the same project and maybe get a great recommendation to UM for grad school. And if you are willing to go into grad school as a doctoral student it\u2019s basically free - or rather they pay you barely enough to live on for helping with teaching and research in addition to covering tuition. I did my grad work that way in Michigan and was definitely out of state.\n\nCheck out faculty at schools you are interested in, and if you spot research studies that speak to you see what universities the researchers come from. That\u2019ll maybe give you some options.\n\nPS there are ways to cut your costs at UM. Use AP tests and community college summer classes to knock out a year of GE and save yourself $30k. Do a year of study abroad in a cheaper college/country for the other year of GE and save another $15-20k. Get a job with tuition reimbursement that also covers living expenses (maybe UPS?) and that helps too. If you set a goal to do this cheaply you can. My second daughter saw what happened to the Millennials in her sister\u2019s group and vowed to get the best possible college bargain. AP credits, community college for a year plus summers, heavy schedule, and living at home (best choice with Covid screwing up the dorm situation) all helped her earn that UC Berkeley degree for under $25k with no financial aid. And since she knows grad school is next it made the most sense to save the money and use it on that instead.\n\nGen Z is smart. You\u2019ve got this. Focus on value for money and be creative.",
