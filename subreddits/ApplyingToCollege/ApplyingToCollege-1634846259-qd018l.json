  "text": "All my life I've wanted to go to University of Michigan, and study science. I worked hard, got good grades, a good test score, but now that I've gotten everything ready, I'm kinda facing doubts. Is it really worth it? I have a 3.99 GPA, 32 ACT, and 1410 SAT, so while I should be able to get in with that, I could also use that and go to a smaller college basically for free. I spoke to a representative of one of those colleges, and with those scores I'd be paying 1200 a year in tuition assuming I get nothing in local scholarships. So like, if that degree from U of M really worth nearly 80x that? My planned major is molecular biology, with a back up in engineering if I decide I don't like it.",
