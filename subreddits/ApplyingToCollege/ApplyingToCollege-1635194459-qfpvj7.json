  "text": "I\u2019m curious as to how you guys think the higher education landscape (specifically in the U.S.) will evolve in the years and decades to come.\n\nThe way I see it, there are a lot of factors at play: demographic changes in the makeup of the American population, global development and expanded access to international schooling, democratisation of advanced education (characterised partly by the recent push towards providing full need-based financial aid that's currently being championed by a lot of top schools), and the tension between these changes and the remains of an older paradigm. \n\nWhat I mean by \u2018an older paradigm\u2019 is maybe best exemplified by the way that we still have this idea that there are a handful of time-tested, household-name, almost brand-like schools that pretty much everyone in the developed world has heard of and accepts as being the gold standard; these being the Harvards and the Stanfords and the Yales. What I think is interesting is that there is almost nothing resembling this level of recognition when it comes to high schools: a much smaller fraction of the population could name a few of the highest-performing high schools in the country. I think there are at least a couple reasons for this, and I\u2019m curious about your perspectives.\n\nOne possibility (which I think is true, and the real question is to what extent the impact is important relative to the other possibilities) is that universities actually do stuff that affects the professional world, and that leaders in their fields invariably teach at universities as opposed to high schools. You\u2019ll hear about the Princeton researchers who discovered a new treatment, but not of the teenage trio from John Cena High School who made bottle rockets, simply because the things that go on in high schools are so far from the cutting edge that they\u2019re barely even in the cutlery drawer.\n\nThe other possibility I see, and the one that is more interesting to me with regards to the topic of this post, is that there are simply too many good students from too many different high schools for us to bother trying to correlate achievement with any particular high school. There\u2019s just no such thing as a high school that consistently churns out Nobel Prize winners or Olympians, and so an attempt at name-branding would not substantiate itself because that kind of consistency just isn\u2019t seen given the scale and fragmentation of secondary education. **I\u2019m curious if universities are going to eventually reach this model, too.** As more and more international students pour in, objective academic achievement is rising (an effect documented *ad nauseam* on this subreddit) and acceptance rates are nosediving. it\u2019s obvious that traditionally second and third tier schools are being populated with increasingly competent and ambitious batches of students. *In 50 years, if Harvard\u2019s acceptance rate is half a percent, how can it continue to hold its current place at the forefront of tertiary education?* I feel that it\u2019ll start to fade into the increasingly pointillist scenery of education, drowned out by an unprecedented volume of new students. \n\nI think this effect is already being seen, but that there\u2019s a time lag at play of around a generation. Name-brands are surprisingly enduring, and the pace of change is too quick to keep up with. I can\u2019t find too much data about how difficult it is to get in now as opposed to in the past, but according to [this data](https://www.ivycoach.com/2007-ivy-league-admissions-statistics/), even since 2007 the Ivy Leagues have seen their acceptance rates slashed in half. I can only imagine what these figures looked like in 1980, when most of our parents were applying.\n\nAnother thing to add is that I increasingly see ambitious people indifferent to whether the school they go to is superlatively prestigious. It's just not as important anymore - we've all heard of the studies that show high school achievement is a better predictor of success than where one goes to college - it's just not how it used to be. (For the record, I think this is a good thing.)\n\nWhat do you guys think? How will your expectations of your children, or of your friends' children, differ relative to those of your parents, given what you know now about the college process?",

      "text": "Number of kids entering college is expected to decline, which will put enormous pressure on schools that are already hanging on by a thread.  Some will fail or merge.  This is already happening.  They will look to admit full-pay internationals who are middling students (i.e. can't get into more highly regarded schools) to pay the bills.  Remains to be seen if there are enough such individuals to allow them to remain afloat.\n\nIn conjunction with the above, there is a general shift away from certain fields of study.  Many schools will shutter these departments.  This is already happening.\n\nTop schools probably won't get on board with the distance learning / MOOC trend as it would dilute their exclusivity and consequently their \"prestige\".\n\nSome large mid-tier schools \\*will\\* try to capitalize on online education as a means of generating additional revenue.  Whether employers ever treat fully-online degrees as equivalent to on-site degrees remains to be seen.\n\nWe may see more schools end legacy admissions given they seem to be taking more cultural \"heat\" for it.  See Amherst's decision recently.  How many schools actually do this remains to be seen; maybe not that many.\n\nSuspect that most schools will remain test-optional indefinitely.  It generates more applications and shrinks acceptance rates, plus they can portray themselves positively in marketing materials.  Doubt many will follow CA's example and go fully test-blind.\n\nI'd love to say the US News rankings will go the way of the dodo, but they're too profitable for that to happen.  It would probably take a boycott by the Ivy+ schools to make it happen, and they have little incentive to do that.",

          "text": "Good points! Yeah the test-optional thing is a whole other can of worms - hopefully we'll continue to see similar movements away from purely quantitative, absent-of-context metrics in terms of relative importance in college admissions, as we begin to better understand what qualities are really important in determining success. But surely we need some kind of benchmark, right? Who knows...",

      "text": "I think the main reason why good high schools don\u2019t get more recognition/name brand value is because they\u2019re mostly local, so only people living nearby will encounter them/send their kids/know alums. Boarding schools aren\u2019t so popular anymore, so only a few well-known ones like Exeter remain. I think you\u2019re partially right about the significant accomplishments thing - high schools don\u2019t churn out much research, most people who become famous do so long after high school (and often attribute more of their success to their college), and then again, there\u2019s the regional factor - unlike colleges, which choose applicants from across the world that they think are likely to do great things, high schools are limited to mostly people within an hour\u2019s driving distance, and even pretty elite ones have acceptance rates 10 times higher than elite colleges (which is kind of what you point out when you say it\u2019s hard to correlate success with any one high school).\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see colleges going this same route - college students are adults and are willing to travel, so other than community colleges and smaller state schools and certain regional private schools, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be locally oriented. And Harvard\u2019s acceptance rate declining each year certainly doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s declining in importance - I think it\u2019s the opposite. Harvard will continue to accept a couple thousand students each year, and as long as those students continue to be excellent and the institution continues to produce great research and important alumni the school will maintain its position. In other words, even if the students at colleges in the tier below Harvard are increasing in quality, it\u2019s not an issue for Harvard as long as Harvard\u2019s students also increase in quality (and I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be able to).\n\nI do think it\u2019s true that as other colleges improve it will no longer make as big a difference if you attended Harvard vs WashU vs UCDavis vs UF (this is already starting to move that way), but there are centuries of positive feedback that make Harvard more and more impressive each year to the next year of applicants, and I don\u2019t see that cycle being broken.",

          "text": "Interesting points, I think what you said about the regional/international difference is absolutely correct.\n\nI'm curious about the cultural importance of having a 'Harvard' as an example of a top school, and whether that'll fade a little as rival schools step forward, as you outlined in your last paragraph. Strange how we hold onto things like that as societies.",
