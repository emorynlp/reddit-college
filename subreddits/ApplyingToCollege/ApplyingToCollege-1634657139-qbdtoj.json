  "text": "So my question is how much do colleges care about dual enrollment college classes? I have taken 6 honors classes and 2 AP classes, however I have taken a total of 8 dual enrollment college classes. Do these 8 dual enrollment classes add to my strength of schedule or not really? \n\nThanks.",
