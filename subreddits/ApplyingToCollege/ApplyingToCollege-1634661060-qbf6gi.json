  "text": "Hi everyone! I am fairly new at applying to colleges, so I\u2019m not really sure what the protocol is. I applied to this school recently ( they view applications on a rolling basis). They emailed me and said that they need one additional item for them to make a decision. It can be a personal essay, a specific question prompt, or a 45 minute interview with the dean of admissions. However, I would understand this if my application wasn\u2019t complete but I already turned in a personal essay and two letters of recommendation. Is this a normal request?? My GPA is not the best so I can only assume it\u2019s because of that. But is this a good sign? bad sign? or just a neutral?. I know that I\u2019m probably overthinking it but I have never heard of colleges making this request.",

      "text": "also I\u2019m 99 % sure that if I do the interview the dean of admissions is going to ask me \u201c why is your GPA so shitty\u201d - in a professional way of course. What is the best way to answer that? I understand it\u2019s important to be transparent but I also understand that they are looking for an \u201c explanation\u201d not just a \u201c I didn\u2019t put effort in at the time\u201d kind of response.",
