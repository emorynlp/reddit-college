Also, it was my top choice around November/October and the only reason I did Harvard REA was because of the need aware policy. But as time progressed, I slowly realized that Harvard was a better fit especially because of the location, weather, and extracurriculars. Music at Stanford isn't exactly its forte and Harvard has the dual degree with the New England Conservatory which I was lucky enough to get into. I really like the rain and cold and seasons as opposed to the constant dry sun of Cali. And I really really wanted to be close to a city. I've seen many people choose Stanford over Harvard for its \"vibe\" but as long as you find the right people you can vibe anywhere, and I did not have a strong will on whether to pursue eng or math/econ. \n\nBeing at the school now obv it isn't the perfect picture that the website paints, but I sure love the vast majority of it. And not a day has gone by where I have asked myself if I would have been in a better position if I had gone to Stanford and I know it would've been the same if I had gone there. \n\nYou really can't go wrong and it's hilarious because all three of my roommates had Stanford as their top choice except me.",

In fact, I don't think there is a big difference between berkeley and stanford other than stanford is small and private. Yet, very few people would go to berkeley over harvard. and very few people see them in the same light",

It is quite lacking in engineering, but other than that, it is a huge figure in STEM. You seem to be playing into some stereotypes. Even for computer science, Harvard has recruiting at the same level (or perhaps even higher) as Stanford, perhaps due to its partnership with MIT. Look at the Linkedin numbers at Jane Street, Citadel Securities, Five Rings, etc., which are the most desirable jobs to cs majors (see /r/csmajors).
