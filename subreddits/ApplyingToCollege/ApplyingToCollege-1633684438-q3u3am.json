  "text": "I have good academics, I predict my SAT score to be pretty high, and I think my essays will be really good. However, my extracurriculars are just average and not anything special. I probably have 3-5 actually meaningful EC's, but I have not really done anything major. For example, I have not done any internships and I have not created a non-profit organization or anything like that. Do I still have a decent chance at a T20, or is it just not worth applying? I don't want to write supplementals and focus my energy if I have an almost nonexistent chance.",

Plus it looks kinda tacky, and doesn\u2019t really show what the student does outside academics\n\nYour ECs are fine, personally I think colleges prefer more normal ECs that show your interests and hobbies, not something you did to look extra in the college application.",

Because I feel like internships do show a high level of interest in something; I don't think people are going to do an internship for an entire summer if they dislike what the internship entails.",

I'm in no way saying that you weren't an amazing applicant, but there are plenty who get into Ivies/HYPSM who don't look as impressive on paper as a lot of those who do (and some of those who don't). Don't count yourself out. Just do your best, and if you get in, then you get in. Otherwise, you've given it your best shot.",

I got into Barnard, Wellesley, and Bryn Mawr and I was in a similar boat in terms of having just a few EC\u2019s I was really dedicated to. I honestly think I just really nailed my essays. AO\u2019s are looking for a mix of things - they might accept one person bc they have stellar grades and got 5\u2019s on a million APs, someone else for outstanding EC\u2019s, and someone else for a great essay. It\u2019s always worth a shot. Just focus on applying to your favorite T20s, since those application fees definitely add up!",
