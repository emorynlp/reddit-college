  "text": "Hear me out. You know how there is already a UMass Amherst, not to be confused with Amherst College. There is also UMass Dartmouth, not to be confused with Dartmouth College. Furthermore, there is UMass Boston, not to be confused with Boston University. (Nobody cares about UMass Lowell). Now, in Massachusetts, there exists Princeton, MA; Harvard, MA; Columbia Point, MA; Washington, MA; Georgetown, MA; and Massachusetts has a northwestern part. \n\nSo here's the idea. What if the UMass system, dedicated to creating confusing university names, created UMass Princeton, UMass Harvard, UMass Columbia, UMass Washington, UMass Georgetown, and Northwestern University of Massachusetts? \n\nWhat other names can you think of?",
