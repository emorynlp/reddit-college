  "text": "I am currently a junior in high school and am a North Carolina resident. I have the credentials to get into the colleges I want to get into but I\u2019m unsure which is worth it. The three main colleges I have on my list are Purdue, Virginia Tech, and NC State. I\u2019m going into engineering but I have to ask. Are the out of state tuition costs going to be worth the experiences you can find at the other colleges compared to the in state tuition at NC State? I\u2019m looking more objectively and looking at other peoples subjective opinions so I have a better idea. Thank you!",

      "text": "I doubt Purdue or Virginia Tech are going to end up being a better value than NC State, which is very good.\n\nIf you are in a situation where you qualify for a lot of need based aid, some private options might be as inexpensive or even a better value than in-state.\n\nThere are also a few public options that can get really inexpensive with the right merit scholarships - Texas A&M with national merit is a good example. That's not necessarily a better option than NC State, but it could be pretty competitive.",
