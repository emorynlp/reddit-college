  "title:": "Why is this the expectation for high school students now",
  "text": "From JHUs website:\n\"The admitted students have already demonstrated exceptional academic and personal excellence. Among those offered admission is a filmmaker who has been published in\u00a0Discovery\u00a0and\u00a0National Geographic, a developer of an electric car and bamboo bike, a racial justice activist leading campaign initiatives and conducting legislative policy, a researcher on underwater robot archaeology, a founder of a malaria youth intervention program in Ghana, an author of the bestselling book on Amazon in the category of Asian History for Young Adults, and an inventor of an artificial intelligence framework for air quality that has a provisional patent\"\n\nHonestly just wtf. These kids are probably more successful than 99% of adults\n\nEdit: To all of you saying that \"this is not the expectation for all high schools students,\" you know what I mean. Just pointing out how ridiculously competitive admissions are these days and the lengths people go to gain an acceptance. And even though there are many \"more average\" students, why doesn't hopkins tell us about those instead of making us feel insignificant and shattering our confidence with these kids. It's almost as if colleges only brag about these kids that they've had nothing to do with, but where are the success stories of ordinary applicants?",

For example\n\nhttps://www.cleveland.com/seniorstandouts/2012/05/david_boone_persevered_to_go_f.html\n\nThat guy was homeless and still managed to achieve at a level 99% of highschool seniors even those born to more wealth than him will never.\n\nSpeaking for myself personally, I have a very stacked resume. But I grew up in a low income African immigrant household , my parents had 0 connections or even extensive knowledge of the college process. It was unheard of at My highschool to do research or similar. I did work during highschool and to secure my positions would literally send out hundreds of cold emails. I didn\u2019t have a car and was taking college classes at my state school, would have to make up at 5 AM every morning to catch the city bus and go there, getting home after 11 Every night when I finished work. The state Im from had a college credit program where they pay for you to take classes. I maximized those opportunities during the summers too taking 18 credit hours and working a full time job. The process i had to take to get a class like Differential equations on my transcript was a lot more difficult than your average private school kid who\u2019s highschool offers classes like that. And yes I recognize I had certain privileges that not everyone has access to , but it is a fact that there are large numbers of low income students succeeding at very high levels even on par with the rich kids. As an academic institution I think they evaluate your application based on the resources you had available to you and take your background into account.",

You\u2019re using a snowball argument to disqualify a systemic problem. By and large, the college system is rigged against low-income and minority students. It\u2019s not because \u201cpeople are lazy\u201d or your fictitious overarching mentality of \u201cI\u2019m poor, so I can\u2019t do anything\u201d, it\u2019s because poverty has an effect that\u2019s extremely difficult to overcome. When a student has to choose between helping to feed their family or researching a niche topic (or even studying for a math test, for that matter) what do you think they\u2019re going to choose? You\u2019re applying a fallacious moral argument to an issue that doesn\u2019t have such a solution. The issue is not that these students are giving up on seeking opportunities, it\u2019s that the barriers to entry to even *seek* these opportunities are too big to even think about. It\u2019s a broad systemic issue that is the reason for a lot of the disproportionate inequality in this country and your self-serving arguments are the reason that these problems keep happening.",

My AP Calc teacher is just amazing and I love her but my AP Psych teacher tries his hardest but he just can't teach the subject well. Besides COVID ruining everything in general, this means I have to basically self-study the class in order to pass which is so different from another school where their AP Psych teacher might have a masters in psychology.\n\nAnd the growing up! I don't think any of this can be healthy for teenagers growing up, those of us who want to go to these colleges have to basically start thinking about it since 7th grade, taking a heavy courseload and working ourselves to death instead of spending time with family and friends the way we should.

And then work 60 hours a week in some job that you may or may not like while rarely seeing your family? Just so that people who enjoyed their time during school can also work hard and see the same level of success? Or so that they can just follow a different path in life that makes them just as happy?\n\nNone of this is actually expected of people our age. Nobody does it except the people who either slave over colleges, have connected parents, or just really enjoy it. I\u2019ve done a good amount in high school and if I get into a T20 I\u2019ll go, but if this is my competition, I\u2019m fine with not getting in. People can be super successful anywhere, and you can define success differently. You also don\u2019t need some fancy, super-high paying job to be happy. You can be just as happy as a teacher as you can be as an investment banker. Might not be as wealthy, but you\u2019ll have more time to spend with the people you love.\n\nidk what this rant was about, I just get so discouraged by what I see some people doing and then worry that I don\u2019t do enough. These people are literally more accomplished in their careers already than most adults will ever be.

Yes I had to be talented to be able to do that but I only got the talent and opportunity because of privilege. I was able to go to a private school during high school that gave me a really good education and allowed me to focus more time on my hobbies like programming and robotics. This was literally only possible because my parents have consistently worked 7 days a week since they immigrated to the US. Very early on in their business they even worked almost 80 hours a week each. How they were able to do that while also being great parents? I don't fucking know and I'm extremely grateful for that, but I know not everyone has that privilege and I do think it really sucks that in this system a lot of your success depends on outside factors. I mean, even the opportunity itself was from the dad of a friend I met at that private high school, which as you can imagine is full of children with wealthy backgrounds.",

As someone who literally has done all their work with a smart phone and a 300 dollar DSLR it drives me mad when others don't acknowledge that being able to just afford the equipment is a HUGE privilege. Like I'm never going to be able to afford most of what these kids have in my next 4 years and that's fine but, seeing people take their equipment for granted just confused me. I won't really say anything about connections because I've been really lucky and busted my ass to get the connections I have today so it's possible to get by although not probable.",

For example \n\nhttps://www.cleveland.com/seniorstandouts/2012/05/david_boone_persevered_to_go_f.html\n\nThat guy was homeless and still managed to achieve at a level 99% of highschool seniors even those born to more wealth than him will never. \n\nSpeaking for myself personally, I have a very stacked resume. But I grew up in a low income African immigrant household , my parents had 0 connections or even extensive knowledge of the college process. It was unheard of at My highschool to do research or similar. I did work during highschool and to secure my positions would literally send out hundreds of cold emails. I didn\u2019t have a car and was taking college classes at my state school, would have to make up at 5 AM every morning to catch the city bus and go there, getting home after 11 Every night when I finished work. The state Im from had a college credit program where they pay for you to take classes. I maximized those opportunities during the summers too taking 18 credit hours and working a full time job. The process i had to take to get a class like Differential equations on my transcript was a lot more difficult than your average private school kid who\u2019s highschool offers classes like that. And yes I recognize I had certain privileges that not everyone has access to , but it is a fact that there are large numbers of low income students succeeding at very high levels even on par with the rich kids. As an academic institution I think they evaluate your application based on the resources you had available to you and take your background into account.",

Expecting this level of accomplishment and career certainty of kids this age is ludicrous.\n\nYou will all find your place, maybe not the place you thought it would be but everyone on this subreddit will go to college  and many to graduate school and beyond.

This is only really the expectation at the most elite colleges.\n\nLet's take a moment to remember that there are plenty of amazing non-T20 colleges that *don't* expect these things of high school students, and that attending JHU or another T20 is far from a requirement to be successful. \n\nThe vast majority of high schoolers don't do the things listed on Hopkins's website, the vast majority of high schoolers don't go to Hopkins or a similarly competitive school, and the vast majority of those students turn out fine in spite of that.",

I go to Berkeley, and the distribution of 'what the fuck, are you even human, do you sleep?' to 'how do you put on clothes in the morning, how phat is your dad's wallet?' people is just barely a deviation or two above the general population: it's just a collection of like, 50some thousand people in an academic setting. No school is actually expecting you to have done something extraordinary in high school: you're literally like, barely a person yet. The schools recruit people for a lot of different reasons: they try hard to snag a few ringers like those above for advertisment, some good athletes to keep sport revenues flowing in, a number of wealthy but not really qualified folks to secure funding, and then the rest of us to just like, actually go to college and pursue academic/career goals. The admissions process is largely about securing the above goals to keep the university financially stable, while vetting the other students to see if they'll adapt well enough to the environment of the institution: as a non-prodigy, non-athlete, non-financial admit, your value to the university is bringing in financial aid monies, passing your classes, participating in campus/local culture, and then using those experiences to make the university look good *post* graduation. Why do you think most institutions love transfers, late-entry, military, AP students/dual enrollment students so much? They're people who have, to some extent, shown that they have a motivation for going to the university, have experience in college level material or equivalent time-management experience, and will therefore stand a higher chance of not failing classes, not dropping out, graduating on time, and going on to live a life that makes the university look good.",

I'm just pointing out that the standards that some people are setting now are insane and that many people don't have access to such opportunities (either from low income, location, lack of connection etc.) Also it's just kinda snobby for schools to brag about applicants like they had something to do with them and promote this type of stuff. Not trying to say that these applicants didn't deserve there acceptance or anything, just that the standards are so hard now",

But there are many, many more people who apply and could do this type of thing if they had the connections that a top school could offer..\n\nI think the argument that top schools have put forth is that, because the most accomplished students have already demonstrated their ability to do crazy things, they're the most likely ones to *continue* to do great things in the future and take advantage of every resource on campus. They're a \"safer\" choice for schools that want to maintain their image.\n\n> Because there should be a chance for those with the potential for greatness to benefit from a top schools and achieve something crazy\n\nI agree with you, but there's no way top schools will ever do this. You're basically saying that the most elite schools should reject the most amazing applicants in favor of the \"late bloomers.\" Well, if they did that, all of the insane applicants would just go to a slightly less competitive school, and those slightly less competitive schools would suddenly gain a reputation for producing super accomplished graduates. And the formerly elite schools would lose their edge.\n\nOnly admitting the top students is partially what makes elite colleges so elite (and therefore valuable). What you're suggesting is great, but it would directly harm top colleges so they'll never do it",

      "text": "See, this bothers me so much because I didn't even really know who I was until I was 21. I was restricted from so many opportunities and grew up thinking I was \"evil\" for literally no good reason; it was just a lie my mom told because she couldn't sculpt me into what she wanted. I stayed under the radar because I thought I was destined to mess up my life and was secretly manipulative (as I would ascribe those motives to myself since others were so apt to). Most teachers didn't take kindly to me due to developmental delays.\n\nI didn't even figure out that all of this was because I was autistic until I was 21 and I was finally, officially diagnosed (I was tested and said to have been developmentally delayed from ages 6-10 and used special ed services, but the standards for autism were different so I was never diagnosed, not even with \"Aspergers\").\n\nSo the whole \"You have to be this successful at the age of 16-18\" is utter nonsense and implies that you're at least closer to self-actualization than I was (and that you're also likely not first generation like I was and you're rich). I mean sure now I do several things to fight against ableism, but how was I supposed to really get started until I knew that my experiences I previously thought to be individual were actually systemic?  (This gets darker when you learn of the diagnostic bias that leads to girls and women being diagnosed later in life by the way). And sure, there are some people who succeed without being that level of self-actualized (after all, they're still teens) and aren't rich and are first generation, yes, I know. But they tend to be the exception rather than the rule. I'm glad for the people who do succeed so much, but many times they shouldn't be the standard that everyone is held to, not even at prestigious universities like JHU. Why do they think people go to college? There is so much room to grow and if people accomplished everything at such a young age, they would feel demoralized because there would be nothing else to do.\n\nEdit: And just to be clear: I'm not denying that the cases named in the OP are seen as the standard that people should be held up to. I'm saying that I wish it weren't but I know it is.",
