  "text": "If anyone could answer these questions I have, I would really appreciate it! \n\n1. Should I bullet, or use commas?\n\n2. Should I make headings to group the ways that I explore my interests?\n\n3. Should I put down Netflix, Snapchat, Instagram? \n\n4. I like music somewhat, and my favorite artist right now is Kanye West. Is it like a horrible idea to put down one of his albums I like?",
