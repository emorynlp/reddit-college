  "text": "It seems like everyone on the sub wants to do either CS, premed, business, engineering, or some other stem, which honestly I get why but cannot relate at all lol. Logically I know there are probably a lot of non-stem students but I feel like I never see them idk? Maybe cause of how much stem is pushed in schools (esp for girls mfs had me thinking I needed to do math to be respected as a smart girl \ud83d\ude44). I want to major in philosophy personally and probably go on to law. Any other humanities majors?",

I\u2019ve held the view for a long time that intelligence is defined by the application of universal frameworks to specific situations. which is why philosophy is my favorite, cause of like the very few actual truths it espouses. I think therefore I am, the existence of an external world. And then that framework of pure logic can be applied/extrapolated to like everything. totally get how that works with math and economics too",
