      "text": ">4.0 UW?\n\nWhat is your grading scale? 4.0 on a typical scale requires all A\u2019s. Even one B in one quarter would drop it to 3.99. Odd you have no official GPA - when does your school calculate it? (Fwiw, you should be able to calculate it yourself.)\n\nSounds very much like my daughter (CS/HCI, 4.0, 1580, 12AP), currently a Senior. Her schools:\n\nReach: MIT, Stanford, CMU (very good HCI program)\n\nReachy-match: Cornell, Michigan, Georgia Tech, UIUC\n\nMatch: Purdue, Maryland, Wisconsin\n\nLong list that didn\u2019t make the cut: Caltech, Washington, Ohio State",
