  "text": "My school year ended in the January of 2021, meaning I almost had no contact with faculty since then. However, to make sure my counselor remember me perfectly, I requested his LOR way earlier, back in December 2020. When I applied this year, he uploaded that old LOR without changing the date under his seal. I didn't know it until today when he revealed that on a phone call. He has already submitted his counselor portal through the common app. Will it be a huge problem like a red flag or something?",
