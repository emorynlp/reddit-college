              "text": "honestly i might get downvoted to hell for this, but i think you should kinda focus on your other RD colleges. Plus with boards this time happening in december only, we don't have much time to study+write essay+study for jee+study for practicals+sleep. (correct me if im wrong) I am also assuming that you are a cs major, so unless you are in state its not very viable applying to udub, because their oos acceptance for cs is like 2%, a joke basically.",

Honestly, I\u2019d suggest not trying to rush the UW app in 3 days now. You\u2019ll just 2 whole essays to write, along with 2 more of you want to be eligible for the Honors College and their merit scholarships. That and filling out the whole Coalition app - don\u2019t waste time and focus on getting out your RD schools ASAP. It\u2019s best not to push them",
