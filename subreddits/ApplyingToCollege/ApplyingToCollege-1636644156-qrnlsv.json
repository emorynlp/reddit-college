Plus with boards this time happening in december only, we don't have much time to study+write essay+study for jee+study for practicals+sleep. (correct me if im wrong) I am also assuming that you are a cs major, so unless you are in state its not very viable applying to udub, because their oos acceptance for cs is like 2%, a joke basically.",
