  "title:": "Which letter of recommendation will be best?",
  "text": "I have a long back story, my high school grades were terrible, 2.69 weighted lol. I have now advanced at a local CC. I have a 4.0 GPA and a ton of extracurriculars. I am trying to decide which letter of rec. That would be best. My old principal is now a dean at the school and since I'm school president we work on a lot of projects. I feel like this will carry a lot of weight and show my advancements in life. (terrible in high school because I was immature, have 2 learning disabilities, and TERRIBLE HOMELIFE). I manage our sponsored blood drives on campus etc.  However, since I work so closely with the president of our school he also would love to write me a letter of recommendation. Which one should I choose between when applying to schools that only accept one letter of recommendation? I feel like they will both carry weight. I am applying to Cornell (ILR), Babson, Northwestern, Colgate, and Fordham.",
