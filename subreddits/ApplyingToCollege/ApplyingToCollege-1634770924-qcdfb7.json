  "text": "I\u2019m writing my Columbia essays and I\u2019m wondering:\n\n1. Is it too controversial to include \u201cLolita\u201d in the list of books I like\n2. I\u2019m writing the diversity/community essay and want to say that I want to teach other students curse words in my native tongue. Should I include this or is it best to leave it out of the essay",
