  "text": "I've rewritten my personal essay three times already, and each time I write about something else. In my conclusions, I always put how X experience has interested me in X area of study but then I looked today and saw that some universities that I'm applying to have short answer/supplementals that ask why you're interested in X area of study. So, should I just not include that in my personal essay and leave that for short answers and supplementals?",
