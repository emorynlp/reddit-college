  "text": "Throughout my life I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m a failure, and now it seems that they are right. College admission was the last grasp for me to prove them wrong and I fucked that up- it\u2019s all just gonna be downhill from now on. It\u2019s even worse that I am at a college in a consortium with all other neighbouring colleges WAY better than mine. Sure, I try to transfer away, but my bipolar brain just wouldn\u2019t work and struggling to get all As, which is not even a guarantee admission cuz they are \u201cholistic\u201d\u2026. how the fuck do I even make time for that?\n\nTwo years of suffering is just too much.",

If you know you want a specific job, you could try to get internships or just hands on experience in the field and that would be much more valuable than you transferring to a \u201cbetter\u201d college",

          "text": "it kinda does define you.\n\nFor any remotely famous company, your alma mater is the first filter of your resume. You aren\u2019t even given a chance to demonstrate your ability. And, this is even becoming more ubiquitous in tech industries, which are supposed to be the ones that don\u2019t care about this, let alone others. More so when you are an international student trying to immigrate: \u201cwhy the fuck should I hire a foreigner if you aren\u2019t top of the tops?\u201d (This goes the same for internships)\n\nAdditionally, the connections you make at prestigious university are irreplaceable.\n\nIt\u2019s just desperation and hopelessness for my future all around.",
