  "text": "I can't rest and I can't do anything my mind is static.\n\nI am never happy with anything that I do manage to write because I am forever in a stated of conflict.\n\n6 days left and I haven't even finished my PS, only a third of the way through the Uchi uncommon essay and haven't started my why school. I scrapped thousands of words, I keep deleting stuff that I write down and I am never happy with it. I started the essays months ago and now I'm barely even halfway there.\n\nI fear that colleges won't be able to understand who I am through simply text. I struggle with expression anyways and there are thousands of people out there who can write and think way better than me I don't think I am good enough.",

One of my kids rewrote his entire common app essay 3 times - for a school that he's essentially already admitted into. \nIt doesn't have to be a work of art, it just needs to be coherent, and express what you want to say. From your OP, I would say that you are more than capable of doing this. Good Luck!!",

      "text": "I suffered from a similar issue. I wrote 5 different drafts for my essay and I am not truly satisfied with any of them.\n\nHowever, I eventually brought up the nerve to simply submit my fifth and final draft, however bad or good it might have been. \n\nRemember, the college essay\u2019s purpose is to tel the college about you. It\u2019s a chance for you to speak for yourself where grades or academics cannot. Self-expression is definitely hard, but chances are that if you wrote your essay genuinely, it represents you well enough.\n\nOf course, there are writing masterminds out there who can weave prose effortlessly like yarn; but you don\u2019t *need* to be someone who writes perfectly to talk about yourself. Your essay\u2019s impact and power doesn\u2019t come from being able to use fanciful words; it comes from you and your story. That\u2019s not to say that writing doesn\u2019t matter at all, it definitely helps to proofread over a bit and get feedback. However, it\u2019s not a reason to redraft essays all over again. \n\nIf you are satisfied with the story that you told and you feel a strong emotional attachment to it (assuming that it\u2019s topic A), then I think your essay likely has the impact that it needs. Best of luck!",
