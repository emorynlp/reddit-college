  "text": "This is kinda stupid but as of right I\u2019ve applied to 11 schools (i had a fee waiver so it didn\u2019t break the bank), and as of today i\u2019ve been accepted into 8 of those schools. I have not currently been rejected, i\u2019m waiting for the last three decisions.\n\nNow this is where it gets kinda stupid, with only three schools left, I\u2019m kinda wishing I would have gone for some more reach schools. Even if they were just harder to get into state schools, I feel like I didn\u2019t really go out of the zone of safety schools. I still could of course apply to these schools, but all things considered I\u2019m simply not prepared to do so and the competitive season for my sport is coming up (which is why I tried doing all my apps so early, I didn\u2019t want to be overwhelmed), so I don\u2019t think I would have time to anyway.\n\nIf the schools I had picked had been harder to get into I think I would have been fine. I\u2019m not ungrateful for the success I\u2019ve had so far I just feel like I didn\u2019t try as hard as I could\u2026",
