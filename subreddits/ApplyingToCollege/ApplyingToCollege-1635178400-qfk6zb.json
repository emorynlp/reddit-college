  "text": "Title. I have absolutely no idea. \n\nFor the past few weeks (months?) I was confident in my choice of Washington University in St Louis (because of their program, minor in fashion design, wonderful campus - they have Ai Weiwei there!!!! - and even nicer food), but now I'm conflicted between Cornell and any other T20 school that has nice dorms, meets full need of internationals (!!!) and offers some form of design as a minor.\n\nBasically, from what I was able to understand from my counselor, my LORs are great. Outstanding even. I have no idea why, I didn't think they were going to be THAT positive, but fortunately, they are. Because of this, and the fact that my GPA is also relatively good, I'm wondering about choosing a more selective school as EDI, and then applying to WashU ED2, if I don't get into the previous one. \n\nBtw the main reason behind my dilemma is WashU's location - while I don't mind the campus being in the middle of nowhere, I'm not particularly fond of Missouri.\n\nI'm interested in majoring in Computer Science, preferably with a BA degree - I'm more into graphic design, web dev, and UX design rather than engineering. Also, I'm an international student applying for aid, so there's that.",

      "text": ">meets full need of internationals\n\nKeep in mind that this is really a bit of a red herring.\n\nWashU, Cornell, and every other US school except Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst factor your need for aid into their decision of whether or not to admit you.\n\nPromising to meet 100% of an admitted international student\u2019s aid need is meaningless\u2026 if the school decides to not admit you because of the amount of aid you need.\n\nPS -  You need to look at WashU on a map.  The campus is absolutely NOT \u201cin the middle of nowhere.\u201d  St. Louis is a great, large, city. There are nearly 3 million people in the St Louis metro area.  (You\u2019ll never need to see the rest of Missouri.)",
