  "text": "Hi, \nAn international here, from the kinda school where most teachers don't write Letters from.\n\nSo, this one teacher finally agreed to write a letter for me and asked for guidelines they could start from.\n\nI obviously sent my teacher The MIT LOR blog and 2-3 samples of LORs u/admissionsmom had posted on A2C.\n\nI'm not sure my teacher understands how serious plagiarism is treated across the world. I'm afraid if she unknowingly or out of laziness plagiarizes \"some of it.\"\n\n I don't mean this in a negative way but it's just that this one teacher has not written a lot of LORs (they know me pretty well and have good command over the English language) but I still believe they're relying on the blog I sent them to give them good advice for a helpful letter.\n\n\nSo, if they were to copy even bits of the samples I sent them, would this impact my app negatively?\n\nI mean I have no clue what or how they might be doing this, but in my interactions with the teacher regarding our projects & school events she OFTEN imitated sentence structures of the writeups we had submitted to her for different events. She often used the same adjectives as well so thinking back to this I'm a bit concerned now honestly...",
