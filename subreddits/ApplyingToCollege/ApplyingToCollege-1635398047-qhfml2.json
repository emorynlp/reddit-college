  "text": "I made a mistake regarding my extra curriculars, I took taekwondo for 2 years until I got a black belt and also said that in my extras, yet in my essay I wrote about how I got into nationals for a history bowl yet I never mentioned it after my essay, I am worried the universities I applied to will think I am lying and it scares me because I already applied. Should I relax and pray that the universities will find out what I was talking about (example of the universities I am scared of is A&M).",
