  "title:": "Teacher Letter of Recommendation",
  "text": "For Brown University, it requires that I submit two letters of recommendation from teachers who taught me in major academic subjects, which they state to include science, social studies, mathematics, a foreign language, or English. \n\nI want the teacher who taught the economics class I took to write the letter of recommendation. Does economics count towards the major academic subjects? Also sorry if this is a stupid question but I just want to be super sure \ud83d\ude04",
