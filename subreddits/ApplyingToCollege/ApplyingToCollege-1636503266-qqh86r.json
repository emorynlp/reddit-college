  "text": "Today was the best day I\u2019ve had in around three months! I feel like I\u2019m always complaining on this sub (lol username checks out) so I wanted to share a bit of happy news, even if it\u2019s just momentary.\n\nI got my first college acceptance package in the mail, knocked out six tests and quizzes, skipped my miserable business club meeting for a fun club, and my rec letter teacher said the letter she wrote for me was one of the best that she\u2019s ever written! \n\nFor so long, I felt like I was drowning in the sea of college apps, extracurriculars, school, work, family\u2026 It feels so nice to have a bit of fresh air",
