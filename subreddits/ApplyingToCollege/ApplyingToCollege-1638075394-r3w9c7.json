  "text": "Recently I learned the concept of rolling admissions, which means colleges look at applications as they come in, right? What I am concerned is that does this mean if I submit my application late, then my app won't be reviewed by the admissions office? I am planning to submit my RD application (January 1st deadline) by mid-December, is this too late to submit one? Please explain about rolling admissions in general if I am mistaken about it.",
