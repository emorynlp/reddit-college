  "text": "[Update: I have received reply from Stanford. I don't need any help now. Thanks to everyone for all of your helps.]\n\n\nI am an international applicant from somewhere. I have submitted my application for the Restrictive early action plan at Stanford University. I thought to get a CSS fee waiver from Stanford. But nowadays they're not providing CSS fee waivers. Right now, due to my family's financial conditions, I am unable to pay my fees whether it's a CSS fee or application fee, or any exam fee. I didn't sit for SAT just for the financial crisis.  \nIs there any good soul who can help me by just providing me the CSS fee for Stanford? I hope one day I'll try to repay it. Deadline for submitting the CSS profile: 11/15/2021. Thanks in advance.",
