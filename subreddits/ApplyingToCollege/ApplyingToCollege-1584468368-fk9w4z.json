My school is likely to go back, but even so it's just so disconcerting knowing it might all be over. I might have spent my last study hall reading manga rather than enjoying one last great weird discussion, or told my AP english  teacher she was great, no matter how much heckling she got. I would have said a proper goodbye to all my club moderators, not just a \"see you next time.\" Wes would have closed out Drama Club, Improv Club, and German Club with a bang, not just a postponement. I could have told My german teacher how much she's meant to me over the years, even though I suck at German. Would have talked with my old chemistry and APUSH/APGOPO teachers to thank them for all the effort they have put in over the years, and the interesting discussions we've had. Would've given my parting advice to all my little underclassman friends, so that they could keep up the wcky crap I pulled and develop themselves further. Would've had closing arguments with all my old debate nemesis, so we could finally have closure. Who knows. maybe I would have told off my band director while exiting the band room. Hopefully I can still do all this. Thanks for reminding me there were things to look forward to in school, and I am so sorry you may not have the chance to do all this.",
