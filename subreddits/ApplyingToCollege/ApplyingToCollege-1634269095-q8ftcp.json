  "text": "I\u2019m having trouble determining if a school would be considered a match for me because all I know about most schools acceptance wise is the avg admitted gpa for freshmen. I have a UW GPA of 3.6, W 3.7, World History Score: 5, US History Score: 5, AP Lang Score: 5, participate in debate, have a part-time job and have recently joined my schools CS club. But when I see a school that has an average admitted gpa of 3.8 does this mean it would be considered a reach? What about a average of 3.7 or 3.9? Any help would be appreciated.",

What are some things you're looking for in a school?\n\nI'd love to give you some schools that would be safety/likely schools for you and that meet your criteria. :)",

Shouldn\u2019t need a whole lot of financial aid? Not too sure though. I\u2019m not super set on what I\u2019m looking for in a school when it comes to class size or location or anything.\n\nsorry for the late reply",
