  "text": "I have submitted a CSS profile waiver for non custodial parent through IDOC to MIT. The deadline for financial aid stuff is November 30 but although they have received my waiver request, no one has replied yet. Is anyone aware of how much time does MIT take to acknowledge documents submitted through the IDOC dashboard? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "There is a \u201cStatus\u201d (far right) column in the \u201cProcessed Documents\u201d section in your account (Status: \u201cYour document is reported as received, substituted (if an online substitute form is completed), or waived (if your institution determines the document is no longer required).\u201d)\n>A document requirement is not satisfied until the document is processed and verified as readable and complete. It may take 3-5 business days to process your documents.\n\nSo, there seems to be three steps that occur. First is your upload. Then IDOC processes it (checks to see everything is readable and \u201ccarves them out\u201d into individual forms etc if the PDF or whatever file contains several pages like a tax return). Then, the third step is it confirms and makes available the data you submitted. The last step is the \u201cStatus\u201d (what the school does).\n\nThe time from when I uploaded stuff to \u201cconfirmed and available\u201d was actually 4 business days. \n\nHope that helps. There is probably a buffer and if you uploaded under the deadline I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be fine given the understanding that the process takes time.",
