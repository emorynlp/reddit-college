Definitely don't use what you see here as the standard for ECs either.\n\nIf you aren't sure where you stand but don't want to share things with everyone, I would start with schools like Iowa or Arizona that have auto admissions policies.  If you meet them, you can work up from there selectivity wise. Use the common data set of schools that interest you to get an idea of average test scores and class rank.",
