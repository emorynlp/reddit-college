Direct head to head comparison is not necessary or informative, and introduces an added level of stress and unhealthy competition. \n\nI once went to a talk by a UC Berkeley admissions director in which he told the audience that they could fill their entire class (7000-8000 students) with just valedictorians or just 4.0 gpas or just top students from elite private high schools. They don\u2019t do that. There is not a single target that will guarantee admission if you hit it. I assume that is equally true at the ivies, much smaller and more elite.",
