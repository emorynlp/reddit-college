  "text": "For the past 6 years, I've only ever wanted to be a doctor. Recently over the past year, I noticed my interest in science dwindling but I thought it was just burnout. This semesterI am taking my government class and I've never felt so excited every time I walk into the room. I started looking at political science majors and policy related jobs and it feels like something I am really interested in. he problem is that my mom is still forcing me to write this bs/md essays and keeps making me rewrite them bc they aren't good enough (bc I don't have the motivation to write them). I still have 2 more essays to write for other schools. How do I convince my mom to let me stop writing the bs/md essays so I can focus on the other ones.",

      "text": "Hey dude, a sophomore (2nd year) in college speaking here! I know EXACTLY how you felt with the whole burnout thing. Since 6th grade, I was SURE that I wanted to be an acoustic architect. But during my first year, I despised all of my classes and my life at the moment in general. I realized that I hated building houses in the Sims, and didn't enjoy all the tedium of my education. \nAfter my first semester and a LOTTTTT of research and debate, I actually switched tracks to a design-specialized Games major, which has a very different crowd/environment/feel, but actually a very similar workflow, creative-math mixture, and is similarly highly competitive. It also takes 2 less years (no Masters degree needed, no expensive tests), is immediately more independently researchable, and is a quickly-growing field. I went from having no motivation and dreading class to absolutely loving every class I attend and every teacher and project I come into contact with (and most of the classmates!). U of U's Games program is actually debated #1-3 in the country, and is #6 in the world I think, so that's pretty cool!\n\nBut it took me a semester to decide if I didn't like it or not. So this depends on how sure you are- are you 100% sure you're not interested anymore in being a doctor? If you KNOW you don't wanna doctor it up, then just grop it. Switch. It might be a nasty realization and feel like wasted potential, but cut your losses here. If you aren't sure quite yet, then apply to both.\n\nAs far as your mom, you have 2 choices, it seems: communicate and hopefully get to change focus, or don't and go along with what she asks, TRYING to make space to work on the other essays just as much, which is exhausting and possibly IMpossible depending on your deadline. You could also be vague, just mention you have 2 other essays to write, and ask her to pause on perfecting those ones while you BEGIN your others. If you aren't 100% decided by the time you have to apply to everything, you can also try to apply to schools that have decent programs in both fields. I don't know your situation with your mom, but that's my best advice for a vaguely controlling but reasonable mom :)\n<3   You'll get through this!",
