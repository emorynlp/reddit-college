  "title:": "Can CS Research be done virtually?",
  "text": "I'm a junior reaching out to professors at my local state schools, and I've gotten some enthusiastic responses back.   \nHowever, I live fairly far from the campus (\\~1 hour drive) and would only be able to come to the lab a few times a week at most. Have people ever done CS research internships virtually? And if so, would it have to be an internship, since it would be difficult to help with ongoing research without being on-campus every day?  \n\n\nThx!",

      "text": "Well not all research (or even CS research) is the same. Ultimately it\u2019s something that would be up to the discretion of the professor or your immediate supervisor would be. There\u2019s probably a pretty good chance that they would want to do it remote anyways, but you\u2019d have to ask. \n\nIn my experience the last year and a half, my positions/research (granted not CS) has been a mix of remote, in person, and hybrid.",

      "text": "It's definitely possible. I'm in CS and have hired remote research assistants. But really depends on the research and what you'd be doing. For example if it's something with VR or robotics you'd probably need to be in a lab. If it's algorithms or machine learning you might be able to do it from home and just connect to university servers over the internet.",
