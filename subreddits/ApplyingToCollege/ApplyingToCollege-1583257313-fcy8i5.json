  "text": "Have you been admitted ED1 or ED2? Do you have no intention to go, even if offered admission? \n\nPLEASE consider withdrawing your applications now, if so. Yes, we do build the admissions model to take these things into account, but we have students who are literally next on the list to get a \u201cyes\u201d from us if you withdraw now.  And these are also very, very deserving candidates.  First generation, low-income, wonderful musicians, talented humanists, etc, etc, etc.\n\nSo please, do your friends and classmates a favor and email the admissions office to withdraw if there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to that college.  Thank you!",

This is no different from a business putting out an RFP and requiring bidders to agree to honor their end of the deal if they are chosen.  However, just like ED, the bidder can still come up with a reason to walk away or just do it anyway.  Since it was at-will and no consideration was yet made, there is no contract and usually no legal recourse in that case.  The business just has to move to the next bidder on their list.  BUT the business can certainly factor this in if they receive another bid from that company.  And they can share their experience with their peers.  So there would be consequences, just not legal ones.\n\nI think the only way an antitrust case would have merit is if a college *only* offered binding early decision and no other admission plans, AND they were sufficiently large or had a consortium of colleges all move to that model.  Even then, there are 4600 degree granting institutions in the US, so antitrust doesn't feel likely to me.",

Higher education in the US does not operate the same across institutions. \n\nIf McDonald\u2019s made a press release saying that they put rat meat in their chicken nuggets, does that mean that rat meat is in the chicken nuggets of Wendy\u2019s, Burger King, and every other fast food establishment? Well they\u2019re all the same right? They\u2019re all fast food. Except that McDonald\u2019s food practices have fuck all to do with any other independent owned franchise. \n\nIt\u2019s the same case here.

              "text": "Your McD's analogy doesn't hold water in college admissions. Though what schools look for in candidates vary widely, mechanics of admission (waitlists/deferral systems) are generally the same everywhere due to institutional standards and systems established via conferences like NACAC.\n\nIf McD's, Wendy's, and BK were congregating every year to discuss how to make their food, it would be totally reasonable to suspect Wendy's and BK are using rat meat as well. But McD's, Wendy's, and BK don't congregate to share recipes and ingredients.\n\n>Whatever system Yale is using for admissions and waitlists could be completely different then the system Ohio State is using. Thought that\u2019d be obvious.\n\nIf the admissions director knew that it was only specific to his own school he wouldn't feel the need to post this. So it's not unreasonable to extrapolate from 'anecdotal evidence' here.",

I\u2019m not saying that the admissions director is wrong and the process can\u2019t work like that, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s misleading to take this one post and assume that all colleges work this way, as they\u2019re entities that are independent from each other and we all know they work differently at least in other aspects of the admissions process. Everything the admissions director is saying is absolutely true, however. But that doesn\u2019t automatically make it true everywhere. \n\nAt any rate, I believe my take is a reasonable take to have. Every other part of the admissions process varies from school to school. We already know waitlists and the chances of acceptance for them vary vastly from school to school. I just figured it was worth pointing out that it\u2019s possible at certain schools that withdrawing your app has no effect on the chances for applicants off of the waitlist. That common \u201cmisconception\u201d that Wolfy alludes to didn\u2019t invent itself out of nowhere. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to get super duper technical about it, and I\u2019m not claiming I\u2019m a master of statistics. I\u2019m not. Anything but. Just wanted a PSA that we shouldn\u2019t be so quick to extrapolate one anecdotal comment to apply to ALL college admissions across the country, public or private. \n\nInstead of being pedantic about it, just use common sense. The odds that this one director\u2019s word applies to all other schools is slim to none. Maybe that\u2019s not perfect statistics; I couldn\u2019t care less. It\u2019s a reasonable point to me and that\u2019s all I was trying to say.",

But there's no way you could know enough detail about universities all around the country.  So you have nothing to base that suggestion on,  therefore one must assume it's wrong.  You can't draw conclusions from incomplete data, it's just not how things work.  Plus,  you don't seem to understand how outlier work, because it's literally how we identify data to exclude.  By (wrongly)  suggesting it's an outlier, you're by logic saying it should be excluded.  \n\nAlso,  this a sub full of teens and adults you are pursuing a higher education, not trying to get into kindergarten.  By saying that you think it's important for them to know not to blindly take people's word is an insult to their intelligence.  Do you think everyone here just makes the broad assumptions you do?  \n\nAnyway, I can see you're clearly not going to accept that maybe people take issue with your comments for justifiable reasons, so I'm not going to argue anymore.

Today I drafted an email to the common app folks suggesting they add a feature whereby once a person commits it is indicated in their account (doesn\u2019t have to say where). A simple green flag of sorts could appear so when admissions counselors begin the review process of a candidate they can see whether that person has already committed elsewhere. Not only would it preclude the unethical wait and see approach taken by people who have no qualms with violating the contracts they signed but would also save thousands of hours of unnecessary work by admissions personnel who could simply pass up a no-longer available applicant saving room for genuine candidates. They could then send a letter along the lines of..Dear So and So...Congratulations! It appears you have accepted a spot at another institution. We wish you the best of luck!\u201d\n\nIn the meantime....for those folks who are simply lying by not withdrawing your applications which you agreed to do...here\u2019s hoping you get caught.",
