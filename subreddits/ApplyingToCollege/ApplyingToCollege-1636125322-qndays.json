  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an international student currently doing the IB and have a predicted of 37/45 with math physics and chemistry HL. I have pretty solid extracurriculars, I founded a youth non profit that helped 15 orphanages in rural Malawi Zimbabwe and Tanzania receive educational materials during the pandemic. I run the organization with over 40 employees and have a social media page that focuses on social activism. I\u2019m also on the board of a blockchain company working with the UN featured in yahoo finance, market watch etc called sharecoin that has donated 2.5million in sharecoin to the UN impact fund. I do have some other extracurriculars though not as important. After reading the amount of rejected people from T20s as well as other schools I feel dishearten from even applying. I just feel lost and that applying to colleges like MIT, stanford, Purdue, university of Austin would just be a waste of money. I could really use some advice as I\u2019m sorta freaking out lol.",

      "text": "Okay, honestly I can't tell if you are joking or not, but assuming that you are being serious, those ECs sound really (really) impressive (but I'm just a HS student, so what do I know, rip). Now, I'm not familiar with the IB system, nor do I know how much harder it is for an international student to get in, but you seem like a really strong candidate. Of course, with places like MIT, the chance of getting accepted is always a crap-shoot, even for people with strong ECs. Now, I can't tell you what the average ECs look like for students that get accepted there, but you are miles ahead of where I am (with my research and club leadership), but I'm applying anyway. I think you'd have a chance, but I'm no AO, and it's a gamble for anyone, so if you have the time and money, then shoot your shot. It's all up to you, good luck!",

I've been feeling like I'm super underqualified in comparison, but I've just decided to give it a shot. And sorry about wondering if you were joking, I'm just very impressed by your ECs and wasn't sure if you were serious! I think you're probably a strong candidate, but unfortunately, no one can predict acceptances, but good luck to you!",
