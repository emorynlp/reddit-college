  "title:": "How I see T10+ Schools",
  "text": "Alright, I did some math. \n\nAveragely, there are about 5,300 schools just in the U.S. Yes, it ranges between all types of schools (like cosmetology to Harvard) but they are still colleges. \n\nThe T10 schools are about in the top 0.002% \nThe T20 schools are about in the top 0.004% \nThe T50 schools are about in the top 0.01% \nThe T100 schools are about in the top 0.019% \n\nI think T100 schools are still top schools. Sure there\u2019s 100 in there, but it\u2019s still the top 0.019% of 5300\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll still think I\u2019m good even if I apply to a T50 school. According the my math it\u2019s still the top 1%\n\nIf my math is wrong, because I\u2019m not good at math, please type the actual answers into the comments. Thank you\n\nEdit: y\u2019all I just wanted to put my opinion out here in hopes that it may help some people nervous about their college choices to know that it\u2019s still okay no matter how top it is. There\u2019s no need to insult me for being stupid and not knowing percentages because I was homeschooled by a mother who almost failed school and most of my high school years were virtual and graphs",

      "text": "That's a great argument, but as you pointed out that the 5300 count includes all types of institutions.\n\nA better number to use would be 3982, which is the total number of degree granting institutions in 2019-2020: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d20/tables/dt20_317.10.asp?current=yes\n\nThat makes a T100 the top 2.5% of all such institutions, which is still really good!",

Neither one of my parents went to college so I don\u2019t know much about the subject. I\u2019m glad I still made a point though. I\u2019ve been hearing seniors talk about their T10s and T20s and while I don\u2019t know where my top schools lay in those categories I\u2019m still very happy with them.",

      "text": "You can be good well below the T50 too.  Even if you only wanted to attend the best programs, schools can be outstanding in specific areas even if you think they aren't amazing overall.\n\nU Iowa is widely considered to have one of the best creative writing programs in the country (and is usually considered the best at the graduate level).  Missouri is always near the top of journalism rankings by professionals in that field.  Schools like SUNY ESF, Colorado State, and Oregon State are great for the hands on conservation side of environmental science.  CU Boulder's physics department has had four Nobel prize winners on its faculty in the last 20 years.\n\nNone of those schools are T50s - many aren't in the T100 in the most popular ranking.",
