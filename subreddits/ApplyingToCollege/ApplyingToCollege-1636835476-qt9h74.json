      "text": "I mean Ivy League really just refers to an athletic league formalized in the 1950s of a group of mostly colonial era Northeastern universities who wanted to compete against schools with similarly high academic standards. If the Ivy League just referred to the strongest academic institutions in the country, then you\u2019d see the likes of Stanford, UChicago, MIT, Duke, Johns Hopkins, etc. enter the Conference. But I don\u2019t think Duke or Stanford would really want to give up their conferences to join the Ivy League.",
