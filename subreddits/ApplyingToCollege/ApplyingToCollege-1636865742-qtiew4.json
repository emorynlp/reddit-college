      "text": "No, this is certainly a remarkable thing. Now, ofc, other people on this server might just boo you down, but don't worry about them. I believe that, for an AO, this demonstrates academic curiosity and your driving personality (the fact that you were self-motivated to do these APs). Plus, this also fits in with your school not offering many APs. But, I do caution you that this only works for APs that you have some interest towards. For example, if you took AP Euro outside of school, but you don't care about Euro or history in general. Then, this won't really be beneficial",

Sure, if a candidate has very little ECs and is purely academic that view is plausible, but it is also too broad a generalization that self studying is considered bad.  Arguably, self studying for the APs probably makes a big difference if taken during the 2020-2021 period when a lot of activities and events were cancelled due to covid... it demonstrates using extra time productively on top of the academic curiosity.",
