  "text": "Hey guys. I have my harvard interview this saturday but the issue is it is during my 9 hour shift at work that I can\u2019t call out on. Would it look bad if I did my harvard interview during my break at work? I have an hour for my break and can find a quiet place to have it, but would it look bad if I was in my work clothes? Does it make me look unprofessional and undedicated to the interview?",
