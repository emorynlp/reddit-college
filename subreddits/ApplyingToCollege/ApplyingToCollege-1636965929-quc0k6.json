  "title:": "All my essays are aggressively average",
  "text": "Does anyone else feel like all their essays are extremely average? I've written 15+ supplemental essays so far, and including my personal statement, I don't LOVE any of them. They are all somewhat dry, boring, and nothing exceptional. As someone aiming high for T20 schools, it's been really discouraging but there's nothing I can do. No more time, energy, or effort will make me get better essays (trust me, I've tried). I've hit a wall in terms of creativity and writing ability. And the thing is, they aren't BAD. They are just aggressively average. It just kind of is discouraging because I have good stats and ECs, and the essays are the place where I feel like I'm hurting my chances to my dream colleges which sucks even more because they're honestly the most important part.",

But, yes it is good to add some spice to your essays, but let me reassure you that I have seen many (and by many I mean most applicants) have \"normal\" essays. The only thing that should matter is if your content correlates back with your core vales. Then you should be chilling my friend",

      "text": "This is how most essays are - uninspiring and bland.  I think it helps a lot to do some introspection and focus on conveying important personal insights.  Focus less on trying too hard to be creative.  To borrow from /u/AdmissionsMom, one of the best ways to stand out is to *stick with* who you are and what matters to you.  Showcase your core values, personal strengths, motivations, aspirations, foundational beliefs, character traits, personality, etc.\n\nHere's a post that might help you:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i6kn6o/it_all_started_with_essay_topics_heres_how_to/",
