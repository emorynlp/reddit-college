  "text": "Last year, I decided to take a gap year and travel to Hong Kong where I would be staying the entire year.\u00a0\n\nAs I'm completing my UC Application, I stumbled upon the question of  \u201cHave you been physically present in California for the last three years, excluding brief absences for vacation purposes?\u201d\u00a0and was offered a \"Yes\" or \"No\" option. Mine is kind of neither(?)--- because I know that if I put \"no\" they will automatically consider me as an oos student\n\nMy answer would be: Although I haven\u2019t been in California for a continuous year, I have been physically present in California for at least three years. I also completed my four years of high school study in the state of California. Would this consider me an Out-of-State student with an In-state tuition? (Forgot to mention I was also born in California if that changes anything)\n\nPlease help! I cannot afford 40k more out of pocket as I'm already saving money but it's not enough when converted to USD...\n\nAny input is appreciated, thank you!!",

          "text": "I'm actually super confused as well, because I think, if I'm not there for a continuous year I will lose my CA residency? But one of my teachers said a while ago that as long as I graduated from a CA High School then they should charge me In-state tuition. I remember last year, when I committed to a CA school, they gave me a form to fill Ab540 i think it's called and they gave me an \"exception\". But i'm not sure if I'll get lucky this time. If nothing turns out well, I'll probably go to CC in Cali and wait for a year to get my residency back, just not sure if it's a good idea.",

You should do so, to try to find an exception to this rule.",

After admissions, the SLR result might come as non-resident but if you file AB 340, you will get waiver and only need to pay in state tuition and admission.",
