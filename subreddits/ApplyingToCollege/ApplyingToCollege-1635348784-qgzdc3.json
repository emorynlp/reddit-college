  "text": "My local CC has this amazing scholarship for high school grads in the same district. It basically pays for everything (including housing) for both years. It's also right next to Cal Poly so I can go on their campus, watch their games, and basically live like I'm in Cal Poly except for the classes. After I getting an associates, there's a guaranteed transfer CSU and a higher tier UC. If you were me, would you take this road or stick to a four year? It's almost November and all the stress from admissions is making me consider CC. Anyone else contemplating community college?",

      "text": "That sounds pretty amazing. Why don\u2019t you take a tour and see how it feels. \n\nAnd apply to a few colleges. You might as well apply yo cal poly and some other csus. And maybe a few ucs. The apps not terrible and you have a month. You can use one of those essays for the base of your personal essay and then apply to one or two other colleges that don\u2019t need supplemental essays.   But it\u2019s nice to know that you have that amazing cc offer in your back pocket!",

      "text": "Apply to the four-years and then evaluate your options in the spring. CC will always be there if you need it, as you can usually register right up through the first week of classes.\n\n(As an aside, it's unusual, and kind of interesting, that the CC has housing. Sounds like what would have been called a \"junior college\" in olden times.)",
