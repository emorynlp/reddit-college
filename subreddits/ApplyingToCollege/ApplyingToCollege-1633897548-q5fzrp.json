  "title:": "Recommendations for my Picky Criteria in Colleges?",
  "text": "Hi! I need advice on colleges to go to. So far my list includes Brown University, Boston University, University of Miami, CCNY (macaulay honors program), and University of Georgia.\n\nI want to go to a college in the North that has either fall or summer weather. I want it to be in a really big urban area or near a big city with transportation. College towns are super appealing to me and I want to be able to walk around campus or the city whenever. I need a left leaning college. Majors I\u2019m looking for include: English, Biology, and Dance. If they have a BSMD program that would also be really nice (but not required). Study Abroad opportunities are really important to me.  Would prefer relatively affordable and with many scholarship opportunities\n\nMy stats:\nGPA unweighted is 3.9. Weighted is 4.0.\n\n90/747\n\n9 APs all gifted/honor classes\n\nDanced for 9 years, volunteered to teach classes for free\n\nI write in my free time and have had my poetry published on a website before\n\nover 1400 volunteer hours from church and leading songs/teaching instruments to people (I was the worship team leader)\n\nin many clubs like NHS BETA HOSA NEHS DECA and AASA, only held a leadership position in one \n\nworked two part time jobs\n\ninterning in childcare right now\n\ngot a 1290 on my first SAT and am waiting for my second results, but I\u2019m also grinding hard af for the december one\n\nplease be brutally honest :)",

      "text": "we actually have a lot of the same criteria and i think these 2 schools would be a great fit for you\n\ngoucher college\n- in a suburb about 15 miles from baltimore and not far from another college (towson university)\n\n- great dance program (no audition required!!)\n\n- study abroad requirement for graduation\n\n- decent scholarship opportunities\n\nbryn mawr\n- super quiet philadelphia suburb with lots of access to transportation into the city\n\n- very left-wing political climate\n\n- decent dance program (and access to dance classes in philly). i\u2019ve also heard they have good english and bio departments\n\n- very generous with merit scholarships",
