  "text": "Currently, I am a freshman in his first semester. I couldn't apply as a first-year due to a tragic event even though I had a good profile and moved on with one of the top universities in my country. (I know it doesn't matter but anyways) \n\nIn my university, you get to declare majors the second year. So I am not officially in a major rn. However, I want to do econ + cs. Would it be better to state one over another for transfer applications?",
