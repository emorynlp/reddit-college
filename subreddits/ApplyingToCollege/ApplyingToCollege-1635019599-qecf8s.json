      "text": "It could be ok if you\u2019re approaching the topic of art to you from a different angle. When I wrote my essays, my CA essay and my community supplement were both about debate, but different ways in which it affected me. My CA essay connected my debate experience to my sense of (or rather lack of) national identity. My community essay explored the tension between my love and dedication for debate vs how debate also opened my eyes to the implicit sexist biases in an overall liberal environment and the conflict I felt over that. I think something like that is fine because it\u2019s really about two different ideas, and debate is just a way to get there. \n\nBut if both of your essays will just be about a general passion for art and come off very similarly, I personally wouldn\u2019t submit both to the same college.",
