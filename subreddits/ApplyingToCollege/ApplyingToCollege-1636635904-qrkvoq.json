  "text": "If I apply to SUNY schools on the common app, will they allow a common app fee waiver, or should I ask my guidance counselor to fill out a SUNY fee waiver and send it to them? The SUNY schools I'm applying to are Stonybrook, UAlbany, and Binghamton. Will I need to fill out 3 different suny fee waivers?\n\nAlso, I heard that not every school accepts common app fee waivers, so does anyone know if these schools accept common app fee waivers? I will search it up myself but if anyone else knows that would be great! Thanks \n\n-Adelphi\n-Howard\n-LIU Post\n-NYU\n-Pace University\n-St. John's University (NY)\n- and of course the suny schools I just listed above",

              "text": "For a Common App fee waiver, It depends on the household size and whether you're eligible to at least one indicator of economic need. You can find these indicators on the Common App at the profile section. However, for most college applications, the general income cutoff can be found on this link:\n\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/20/2020-05982/child-nutrition-programs-income-eligibility-guidelines\n\nThese are specific to figuring out whether someone is eligible for Reduced Price Lunch Programs, but give a general sense to what kind of income one should have, depending on the household size, to be eligible for a college fee waiver. You can find the max income required at the Reduced Priced Meal 185% section. For example, My household size was 2 but make less than $20,000, so I was qualified for a college fee waiver since the income cutoff for a household of 2 was $31,894.",
