  "title:": "A nationally ranked artist who's NOT going to submit an art portfolio: is it okay?",
  "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first post here, and I would love to have some of your opinions.\n\nSo, I'm a nationally ranked artist (even had rank one), but my mother filmed all my stages as memories, not for further evaluation. The videos are low resolution (I can show you in inbox; I don't even know how that works on reddit but I'll learn) and the camera work is a bit shaky. Overall, it seems a bit unprofessional. Now, I don't have a camera or a good quality phone. Hiring a videographer is sort of off-limits in the pandemic.\n\nIn this case, would it be sus if I don't submit a portfolio despite saying I'm a national winner and how important dance is to me? My guidance counselor probably will mention my dance and my national awards too btw.\n\nOr should I submit it anyway? I think the bad resolution will be an inconvenience for whoever will be evaluating my portfolio. Will they get annoyed and think I'm not professional enough?\n\nFor context, I'm applying to few competitive unis, and my name as a winner of this competition is not available on the Internet.",

I also danced for some really reputed programs. That's it. Maybe 'recognized' isn't a good word, more like, I just won good awards",

They must keep records, but God knows; I'm not sure they'll cooperate. I searched a million times for the name list of those who won but to no avail. Again, it won't be in English even if it's found. I can have my dance mentor vouch for me; she's a FAMOUS dancer in our country. I can also obviously explain in interviews, and I can forward videos but the videos I have are bad quality. I have photographs of me receiving the prize on stage, if that helps in any way.",

You can never \u201close\u201d as long as you\u2019ve given it your all and tried to get as much info to them as possible. So write to ask these competitions. You\u2019ll never know until you do. I wouldn\u2019t worry about the language barrier. We live in a small world now and I am certain if they really wanted it translated, it\u2019ll get translated. Finally, if you send all that info and submit the videos, you can rest easy that they have everything possible to form a reasonable assessment. Every piece helps\u2026",
