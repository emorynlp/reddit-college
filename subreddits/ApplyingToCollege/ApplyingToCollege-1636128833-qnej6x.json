      "text": "It's really up to you, but a lot of people change their major in college once they find something they are truly passionate about. While CS/Econ/Eng majors tend to make more money, I'd say that it may not be the case for those who have one of those degrees when it's not something that they are passionate about. Pursue your passions to the extent that you are able, you can look into what jobs tend to be higher paying for your intended major, learn more about these careers in college, but don't force yourself into a career that you'll hate for the rest of your life. Have fun, and good luck!",

Life will take you all over and its up to you to make the most of the opportunities that come up. But if you study something solely for money, you will not enjoy doing it for a paycheck for the rest of your life. Ive seen many people with degrees in English and International Relations branch out to things not even related to the field and been very successful.",
