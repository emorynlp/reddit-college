Now I assume the dean went through the resume I'd emailed them in like May when I was just tryna mess around w the whole process and didn't know I didn't wanna apply to Colby\n\nAND he wrote a fucking note at the end which was personalized to me\n\nThis has touched my innocent parents enough that Colby has been brought up every other day over dinner, the Dean must technically go to heaven considering how many blessings he's received and they probably wanna put him on their will",
