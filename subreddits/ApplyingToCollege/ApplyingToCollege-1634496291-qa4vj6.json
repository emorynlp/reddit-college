  "text": "So I'm a senior with a 3.7 w gpa but by the time I'll graduate I'll only have 6 AP classes (and my school offers a lot of them) on my transcript (and most do not relate to my career). So because most of my classes are at a honors level, and I have a low GPA uw (3.6ish), does that mean I screwed up high school? Im asking because some of my friends have 4.2 w gpa's and took like 11 AP classes. And if so, what do I do to stand out to competitive (but not ivy) level colleges?",
