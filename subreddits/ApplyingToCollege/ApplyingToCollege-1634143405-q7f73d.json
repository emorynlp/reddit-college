  "title:": "Wondering about my Partial IB",
  "text": "Hi, I'm a grade 11 highschooler in Canada, my school has IB Diploma Program with the option to take Partial IB. I know this may sound silly but I have a bad past experience with french and my anxiety still clings to it to yhe point where just thinking of learning it gives me anxiety (gotta love anxiety disorders). Despite this I'm taking all IB (including TOK) apart from Academic Psych and Physics. What I want to know is, will universities still find me more enticing than academic students despite my lack of diploma?",

It's even carried over to my sleep which is a pretty good indicator for if something is deeply troubling me. Especially since I'm interested in going to university in Europe...Thanks :)",
