  "text": "More than 50 thousand students get admitted to T20's every year. I imagine that every applicant that gets admitted to one of these schools is qualified at to get admitted to any other top school. But they get rejected at the majority of them and get admitted to few, most of the times one. Hell, Harvard admits get rejected at BU, MIT admits get waitlisted at UCD.\n\n\"Oh the guy with 1410 SAT and some club involvement was obviously a better fit than the girl with a 1580 and multiple published research papers.\"\n\nIs that right? Where does this weird and naive view that AO's perfectly determine your personality based on a 500 word personal statement and a generic ass \"Why us?\" essay in the 8 minutes they spend evaluating your application. Did the AO at Uchicago admit the guy with 1410 over the girl with 1580 because he was oh so \"quirky\" and wrote an essay about how mac n cheese is an allegory for college admissions? If so that is bullshit.\n\nMoreover, there are so many people with 1550+ SAT scores, great EC's with clubs internships and research, and good essay writing skills. Unless you are an IMO gold medalist or something, it is near impossible to stand out. The only option left is to shotgun at that point, because the process lacks any semblance of objectivity when selecting between this type of student.\n\nAnd as a risk averse person, boy did I shotgun. 26 schools, 2 safeties, 5 matches, 19 reaches. Lady luck smiled at me her all life, but I don't trust her, and I'm not taking any chances. If I get shafted anyways at this point,  I don't care. I don't know what I could do more.",

Besides, I honestly think that what we think of as \"bad luck\" is just the conglomerate of a million small things. Maybe the way someone twitches, combined with their eye contact habits and their propensity for waiting, turns people off subconsciously. Add in other factors like when your admissions officer read your application. You can't ever say with certainty that these factors were responsible, or that they're even bad. But they can still do a lot of harm. \n\nThis has always been my worst fear, honestly, in life. Objectively, I can do pretty much anything I want to. When I get rejected from some positions, it's not because I didn't have the right achievements or because I was a sociopath or something. And I really hate that, because I'm like, I either have to be godly good or I just have to pray. \n\n\"Bad luck\" just makes me feel like other people have guardian angels and I don't.",

          "text": "This feels like a consequence of the state of standardized testing in the US, honestly. From what I can tell, entrance exams in other countries can actually tell you something conclusive about an applicant. \n\nThe SAT and ACT really only test math, reading, and writing. The ACT has a \"Science\" section, but it's really just \"reading with graphs\". No science, no history, no social sciences, no anything else. These tests also don't test advanced topics. A lot of people are ready to take these exams in middle school or early high school. \n\nFinding a \"good enough\" score isn't too hard, but past that threshold, you don't get very much information about applicants. Someone who got a 1600 on the SAT isn't necessarily academically smarter than someone who got a 1510, for instance, and I think that's just ludicrous from a test-writing perspective. I got a 2300 on the SAT back when it was out of 2400, which isn't bad but many of my classmates got over 2300, some even 2380+. Yet, I was the only one out of us to win a national Olympiad award. \n\n(And that's not getting into access questions about these exams. It would make WAY more sense for state governments to make the SAT or ACT their high school exit exam, yet they'll throw money at other dumbass exams that ultimately mean nothing in college applications.)\n\nI don't personally agree with admissions relying entirely on one exam, but it would be nice if we had a reliable standardized exam at all. \n\nAnyways, it's really strange that grad schools will ask these types of personality prompts. In my experience, they wanted a personal statement where you do talk about how you got into the field and what outreach you might do outside it, but the focus is by far on your experience and research accomplishments. (Sometimes schools will split the personal statement into a \"Personal History\" and a \"Research\" section, but this is very much like filling out a form but in essay form.) What field are you applying to?",

I have no idea. Once upon a time, standardized testing was a far from perfect tool, but that's shifting (and who knows if its for the best or the worst).\n\nFor me, the bigger issue is the sheer insanity of being able to apply to upwards of 20 colleges.  This is a recent development; fifteen years ago, you applied to 5.  Because of this, colleges have many more applications to review.  They've tried to limit this through increasingly insane supplements on the Common App, but y'all are in an untenable position, because while it hurts the system for you to apply to more, no one wants to not get in somewhere, so you have to apply for more.  \n\nMeanwhile, because of rankings, colleges get punished for having a low yield rate, so they use [crazy things](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) like cookies to see if you're actually a good fit.  After all, if you're opening every spammy message that they send, then clearly they've captured your interest, so it's a bit safer to accept you.\n\nThe result? You all writing a bunch of applications that barely get read, all while stressed to the max over whether their extracurriculars are good enough or if they bring enough to a campus community, and college admissions officers who have to read a bunch of applications and figure out who actually wants to come be part of a campus that they are passionate about, and who is just hedging their bets.",

You admit everyone who gets into a \"top school\" is qualified and yet... you say it's bullshit that he got accepted and some other person didn't...\n\nYes, it sucks when you feel you're qualified for a school and don't get in, but the upside of all that is that the really good students get to go to all kinds of different colleges, which makes the experience at those colleges even better. It's a lot better imo for there to be a ton of good schools for people to apply to than a smaller number of them that just gobble up all of the high stats kids.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that most people only think there are like 20 good schools in the US. Couldn't be further from the truth. Fuck \"prestige,\" that's really what's poisoned the system.",

      "text": "As a 25 YO professional videographer who's returned to school to finish his Bachelor's, this idea of luck and timing is, unfortunately, something to get used to. Or rather, something to embrace. You learn to accept what it's in your control and do your best to disregard what's out of it. \n\nI'm a 4.0 community college student aiming for a 34-35 on the ACT (currently have a 33) hoping to study either economics or business at a T10. I'm putting myself through school so the private universities with huge endowments really appeal to me, as well as the excellent people I'll meet at one of these places.\n\nI want to revolutionize and reinvent the wheel of Hollywood/entrainment. The way content is produced/distributed is in the middle of an identity crisis and I believe there are business/tech/scientific - based solutions to fix it. I've got no clue what this looks like or where the goal will take me but a place like MIT Sloan, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, etc. would be a great starting point. However, no matter what I do, I can't control how many transfers they let in or if they're even looking for someone like me. This could stress me out to no end or I can let go of the expectation and only focus on what I can do.\n\nIf you want a specific college or job, but they don't want you, you were never meant to end up there. And vice versa... There's plenty of awesome opportunities or schools that have been options for me that I didn't align with. Think of it like a relationship. Even if someone's \"out of your league\" yet they like you back, you've hit the jackpot! Just put your best foot forward, present the best version of yourself, and own who you are. The right path will materialize.",

Second humans can self-actualize, so thinking about it as a certainty will help your nerves and you will be able to get better marks. Chill",
