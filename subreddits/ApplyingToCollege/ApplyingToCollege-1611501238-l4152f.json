  "text": "I swear every time I look through this subreddit there\u2019s someone always like \u201c2 people from my school got into Harvard,\u201d or \u201cwe sent 3 kids to Stanford last year.\u201d Meanwhile I\u2019m sitting over here and the most prestigious college anyone from my school has gone to in the past 10 years is the College of William and Mary. My school isn\u2019t small either, there\u2019s about 450 people in my class. Idk what y\u2019all\u2019s schools are doing, but I literally know no one besides me who applied to any Ivy League or other top schools. I\u2019m literally the only kid in my school who\u2019s applied to MIT in the past five years.\nLike, do you all go to feeder schools or something?",

Clubs and sports in our school regularly let students from other schools in to participate.)\n\nOverall, this meant that a significant portion of our school had fantastic opportunities. Unfortunately, that meant that competition was fierce. Of the top 10 kids in my class alone (graduating~100 or so) the average unweighted GPA was 4.0 with an average SAT or ACT (usually both) equivalent being 1580. Not to mention their EC\u2019s.

How the fuck did they get 8 hours of sleep every night??) It did NOT help with my college applications confidence when I was applying, but it does mean I know some very smart people I can ask for help. \n\nIn case anyone wonders; we sent 3 to Harvard last year, 2 to MIT, 2 to Princeton, 1 to Yale, 2 to Caltech (or CIT as I like to call it), and a couple dozen more t20s. \n\nOnce again, not a confidence booster.",

My schools test scores are below the state and district average and like 30% are meeting the state standard for math and 40-60% are meeting the standard for reading. I don't know if a college will even look at me /s. But it seriously messes with me to see everyone on this sub coming from a magnet school in the bay area with the schools average sat being 1500 lol.",

It focuses on college admissions in the United States. The authors define both the title of this book as well as their goals in writing it as: \"to create greater awareness of the small, distinctive cluster of colleges and universities of excellence that are available to gifted college-bound students.\" In the introduction, the authors further explain their aim by referring specifically to \"the group historically known as the 'Little Ivies' (including Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Wesleyan, and Williams)\" which the authors say have \"scaled the heights of prestige and selectivity and also turn away thousands of our best and brightest young men and women.\"In this book, the authors (using the same criteria often used to evaluate Ivy League schools) discuss 63 American schools that are small in size and are either liberal arts colleges or universities that emulate them.  \n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

But if you're on A2C, you're likely not attending an average school. More likely, you belong to a school more similar to mine which encourages higher achievement and thus sees more students going to more prestigious schools.",

I do think there will be more of an opportunity to present yourself to the Ivies in the future without just the right school but it will also be more difficult to get in.  The internet makes this possible.  Look at the list of the top high schools in America and I am sure the odds of getting into an Ivy are better.  But, I would also like to say there are so many opportunities to excel at the college you go to, you don't need an Ivy.",

      "text": "My school is apparently just really competitive out of our area in Orange County, California. So I *guess* you could say it\u2019s a feeder school, because a lot of admissions officers from nearby UCI, UCLA, USC, and UCSD (my school is literally down the street from UCI) are very familiar with it, some of them even went to my high school. They know how competitive it is compared to some of the other schools in my district and around the county, so when they see good ass stats with people coming from my particular school (not to say that it\u2019s not as good if they come from another school, that definitely would still be good), they\u2019re likely to accept. \n\nOne of my teachers who\u2019s been at my school for 35 years as a teacher is very close to seniors, as he is to all students but seniors especially, because he\u2019s familiar with college applications and recommendations and all the tension and \u201csenioritis\u201d. He told us (junior class) a few weeks ago that three people had just gotten accepted to CalTech and 2 to Harvard so far, from our school. Probably a handful of people to some of the UC\u2019s as well.\n\nSomeone I personally knew last year as a sophomore was accepted to Harvard (he\u2019s a freshman there now), and he\u2019s just insanely smart and talented. I think he was going to major in theoretical math. He was too good with computers and circuits and all that stuff that I can\u2019t even pretend I know about, he could\u2019ve well went to MIT too.",

We also had a couple cornells, tho nobody went. UC results aren't out yet, but we usually get 1-3 cal eecs every year.\n\nI agree w you abt the competitiveness, it's actually insane  if ur reaching for the top. I personally know which ppl have the highest gpas and sats/acts and what their ecs are, so do many of my friends. The grade deflation isn't fun either. But I guess the competitiveness, along w the affluence of the area, introduced me to a lot of opportunities I wouldn't have gotten elsewhere and pushed me to keep aiming higher. It's probably the same for a lot of my classmates.",

However, I have a friend who goes to a rural public school and he says it\u2019s rare for people to even go to college let alone the state school. \n\nIn short, wealthy people have more resources and better schooling and go to more ivies.",

It\u2019s true that people who are more well off have better access to resources that make them better candidates (i.e SAT prep/tutors).

It's literally a norm to apply to T20's and Ivies, so there are bound to be few or many who get into these prestigious schools. Even though I would say my high school is not hyper-competitive like some other schools, it is REALLY competitive. And even though I am somewhat new to this subreddit, a lot of people have mentioned that most of the people here are from the bay area or other such places.",

      "text": "I went 2 years to my local high school,  then 2 years to a prep school. At the public school my class, Danville Ca. Is a pretty affluent area was about 500 students and no one went to Ivy league schools. My mother volunteered to interview students who might be applying to Harvard (she went to Radcliffe, dad went to Harvard). The principal refused her the chance to allow interviews at the school because \"we have the UC system for those students.\"\n\nI transferred to a private school in Oakland where we had 26 students in the class. 4 went to Harvard,  2 went to Stanford,  about a dozen went to various Ivies or Ivy analogs (Middlebury, Oberlin, Amherst, ect.)\n\nSimply put, it is the administration at your school that decides what colleges their students will be likely to attend, and will limit what avenues are available to  those students who could reach higher.",
