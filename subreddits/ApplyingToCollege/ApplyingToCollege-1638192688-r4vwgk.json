  "text": "Hii, I'm a senior high school going through the college admission process. \n\nMy question right now is if you submit your application before the early deadline, but your transcripts come in after the deadline will that affect your application? \n\nHow long does it take for colleges to receive your electronic transcript? \\[parchment\\]\n\nThank you!",
