  "text": "i\u2019ve posted on here so much today, but\u2026 i\u2019ve finished 2/4 PIQs for UC. i want to write about how i got accepted as a peer tutor outside of school hours for my hs and eventually that turned into me being able work with the arizona department of education and a few other students across az to improve similar school programs statewide. i feel like this can be good for PIQ 1 & PIQ 7, so should i write abt this for both or pick a different topic for each?\n\nif not, do languages i didn\u2019t take in HS count as an academic subject for PIQ 6? i self study japanese but my hs doesn\u2019t offer it. (i can write abt spanish as well and i took that class in hs).",
