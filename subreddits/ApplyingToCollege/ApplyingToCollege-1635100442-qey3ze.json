  "text": "Location/Region: Something out of state(I live in Maryland), preferably a mid/large-sized city in an urban area with good enough public transportation that I can survive in without a car.\n\nMajor: Economics\n\nGPA/Test Scores (optional): \nGPA: 3.29(UW) 3.59(W)\nSAT: 1270(going to retake)\nClass rank: 75th percentile\n\nCurriculum: \nTook 2 AP classes, AP stats: Passed with a 4, AP Gov passed with a 2\nHonors core classes\n\nSize: Preferably large\n\nECs: None lol\n\nCosts: Doesn't matter too much, preferably private to avoid OOS tuition. Will be going for aid.\n\nSchools you're currently looking at (if any): \nUniversity of Denver, \nSaint Louis University,\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago,\nUniversity of Seattle\n\nAdditional: \nI'd like a place with sociable/extroverted people since I'm pretty introverted, I'm not really interested in getting into an ivy, mainly want a good college experience(don't care about greek life though). I don't know if I have much of a chance of getting into the colleges I mentioned.",

It is not t100 by any means, but there isn't that huge of a difference anyway. It is also notably cheap, so your student debt won't be super high.\n\nAnother option could be Drexel, also within your reach.
