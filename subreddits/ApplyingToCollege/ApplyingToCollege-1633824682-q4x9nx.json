  "title:": "Lack of major-related ECs -- how big of an issue?",
  "text": "Hey all, \n\nI have pretty standard ECs (nothing crazy like ISEF or anything like others on this sub):\n\nI have strong leadership ECs both inside and outside the school (board of education position, student gov, etc), as well as a good amount of STEM related ECs (software internship, various math/science/engineering competitions), plus other community service + music ECs.\n\nHowever i'll be applying as an Econ major when I don't have any econ ECs. Given that I want to go into econometrics, is my STEM involvement enough? Or would it hurt me significantly that I don't have any econ ECs? Would I be better off applying as a stats major or something along those lines?",

Some people figure it out later in the game, and some others just don\u2019t, and that\u2019s totally fine. You are someone apart from your major so I\u2019d say it\u2019s totally okay",
