  "text": "Hi All,\n\nI applied for early action for UNC, and I sent them my official SAT score report from the college board before the deadline. I guess it's because it takes a bit of time for the college board to send out the official score report, but when UNC supplied me with an account to their student portal, only my self-reported scores are on there. However, when I checked the portal this morning, my self-reported score was gone and was replaced by the official one from the college board. But it says on the website that \"self-reported scores will be the only ones we use in our evaluation\" and that we should self-report within two weeks of the deadline. So my question is this: are they still going to consider my self-reported scores if I report it now? Thank you all in advance.",
