  "text": "Hello! While I am doing the Questbridge match in replacement for ED application, I am also applying to UF and FSU which is due today. I have around 20 extracurricular activities, and 12 activities which I say would be good enough to put on my application, but I also have a lot of family responsibilities. \n\nI do not know if I should use up an ec spot for family responsibilities (20+ hours a week) because I am worried it will look like a filler ec. \n\nThere is not an additional information section, so what should I do? Thank you. :)",
