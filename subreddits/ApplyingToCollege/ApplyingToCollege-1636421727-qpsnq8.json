          "text": "idk, ppl said that filling up all 10 common app slots with activities are bad - ik this goes for stuff that's limited to simple paying dues/putting ur name on a form, but idk if it goes for too many leadership roles or subject-area internships that it discounts from the primary activities that are focused on in ur application (e.g if ur an low-level lead in a 10-member history club and many, many other clubs like it vs. president of science olympiad and president of amnesty intl).",
