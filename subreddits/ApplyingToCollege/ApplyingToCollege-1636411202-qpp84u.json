It's lovely, but very manicured and imposing, doesn't feel warm or welcoming at all. FCLC is 4 skyscrapers connected by underground tunnels and with a big green space on top of the admin building a level above the Manhattan streets. Despite being in the middle of Manhattan, the green feels very lush and quiet and you get a view of the Lincoln Square area from up on the admin building. Inside, the buildings all felt elegant and cozy and the views from the higher levels are unbeatable.\n\nUChicago was gorgeous, too, though.",
