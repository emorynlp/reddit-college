  "title:": "Check \u201cYes\u201d for Financial Aid if I end up not applying for FAFSA?",
  "text": "Title is probably a bit confusing, but basically, my chances of receiving any financial aid from FAFSA are pretty low considering both of my siblings have been rejected from it in the past. Obviously, it\u2019s always good to at least give it a shot and apply just in case, so my question is:\n\nLet\u2019s say I check off \u201cYes\u201d (and give SSN) on the Common App (and any other applications) for the question asking if I plan to pursue need-based aid, but in the end, decide not to fill out FAFSA. Will this affect my admissions decisions since I said I would pursue need-based aid but ended up not applying for any?\n\nI don\u2019t wanna check \u201cNo\u201d and screw myself over if I do decide to fill out FAFSA later on, but if checking \u201cYes\u201d just to end up not applying will hurt my chances of getting accepted somewhere, I won\u2019t.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "If you check Yes and decide not to apply for aid, you may need to notify the admissions office. For schools that are need-aware in admissions, they may be waiting on your financial aid forms before making a decision.\n\n\"Apply for FAFSA\" FAFSA is just a form. It makes students eligible for Pell grants and federal student loans. The bulk of need-based financial aid grants comes from the colleges themselves. Information in the form is used by colleges that offer need-based aid to help calculate need. Note that colleges often require other forms in addition to FAFSA, such as the CSS Profile. If you decide to apply for aid, be sure to follow the instructions on each college's financial aid website.\n\nYou don't have to guess. See whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. If it's close, it makes sense to apply for aid, as the estimate should be in the ballpark but ultimately is just an estimate.\n\n(Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
