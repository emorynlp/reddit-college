  "text": "So Uni admissions are coming out for semester 1 next year and I'm getting some offers which is a massive relief. Before I was getting at offers, I have decided that I should maybe do a Bach in Music because I always had a love for music since I was a kid, and I do have the skillset to complete one successfully. All the auditions are closed for applications for a Bach of music so I was planning on getting a diploma and trying next year. This was all before I got any Uni offers because I feared I wouldn't get any. Now that I have one, I am extremely thrilled as I found that I was super interested in areas of study covered in Biomed. I was always interested in the sciences and electing biology for year 11 & 12 only worsened that. I have an idea of a career for Biomed but I don't have one for music. \nSo I'm torn. I know I am far more passionate about music but that does not mean I am not passionate about Biomed either. I see a career in Biomed compared to music, but it's just that interest in music is greater than Biomed. So what should I choose?",
