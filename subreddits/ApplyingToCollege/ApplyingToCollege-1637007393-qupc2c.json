  "text": "I'm an early college student, so legally I am considered a high school student but I go to a college. When I go to university I will apply as a freshman.\n\nHowever, my college GPA is an abysmal 1.6 (thanks covid). I'm worried my GPA will prevent me from getting into anywhere because to my understanding I *do* have to submit both my high school and college transcript despite being a high school student. What is my situation looking like and what should I do?",
