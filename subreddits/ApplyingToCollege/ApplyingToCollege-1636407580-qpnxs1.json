  "text": "I'm applying for undergrad and I'm having some trouble knowing whats acceptable to write for the essay part of my academic performance. I've looked back at similar questions to mine and I always see mixed responses. Someone who worked admissions said no personal stories whatsoever because \"they don't care?\", other said personal stories is what separates you from the rest while others said to speak about the major. I as well asked my counselor and she said \"remember if something personal was happening or if it was because of the instructor\" If it's important my AP was a few years back (when I first started) so between then and now my grades have improved significantly.",
