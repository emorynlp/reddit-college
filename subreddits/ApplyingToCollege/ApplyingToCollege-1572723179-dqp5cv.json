Couldn't Gates or Bezos or Buffet throw 20 billion at a new university? That would leave a legacy that could past 1000 years. Surely Stanford will be around in 1000 (baring some sort of apocalypse).\n\nThe closest anyone has come recently was Henry Rowan who in 1992 donated $100m to a small college which became today's Rowan University.
