  "text": "I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019m really worried about my calc grade. I have a 68 right now and i\u2019m planning on applying regular decision to a lot of places. I think the highest I could get it up to would be a C+ and a B- if i\u2019m really lucky. Idk what to exactly ask abt but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position and how that worked out for them",

      "text": "If you choose to drop the course, you will have to email every single college you applied to and tell them that you dropped it (because your transcript will no longer be accurate), which I unfortunately learned the hard way when I dropped AP Physics. This is a hassle to deal with, so I don't recommend that unless you are actually going to fail the class.\n\nIDK what system your school goes on, but I sent my transcript before my first semester senior year ended, so the final grades weren't published and it only sent freshman-junior year grades. If that's the case, then it doesn't really matter what happens with your calc grade because the only grades/GPA colleges will see when they review your app are the ones from previous years. \n\nHonestly, if you're doing well in other classes, you don't really have to worry about your calc grade too much-- just try not to fail. At this point, the grades you've gotten consistently for 3 years will matter much more, as well as the essays and stuff. Your grades only matter so much, but someone with a stellar essay and average grades is much more likely to get into a top school than someone with a shit essay and stellar grades. You can try to raise your calc grade, but if it won't affect the GPA colleges see when you submit your app, then don't worry about it too much and potentially put everything else on your app at risk because you're too focused on calc.",

I\u2019m really betting on my state school (uw) and csus since i heard they dont look at senior year regardless. I still dont know about regular decision stuff bc i thought a mid year transcript was required?",
