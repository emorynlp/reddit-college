  "text": "MIT and Georgetown, you think you\u2019re so special don\u2019t you. News flash: you\u2019re just another overpriced institution. You could easily be on the Common App.\n\nEven worse than that are UWash, UT Austin, etc. Why are they on the Coalition App and not the Common App (or both)?? It\u2019s the exact same thing but less popular. Now I have to fill out the paperwork all over again, self report grades all over again, and rewrite all of my activity descriptions (different character limits) all over again. I\u2019m seriously considering just not applying because it is pure pain.\n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the elephant in the room: self-reporting grades. WHY IN THE NAME OF TREVOR PACKER DO WE NEED TO MANUALLY ENTER ALL OF OUR GRADES WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE OUR TRANSCRIPT. I know it\u2019s to filter us digitally, it isn\u2019t that their job? Or at least the job of the school transcript system?\n\nAnd why does it cost money to send transcripts and test scores when it\u2019s completely digital.\n\nIt\u2019s all kafkaesque, if you will.\n(I just finished reading Metamorphosis I\u2019m sorry)\n\nAHHHHHHHHJJJJHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nim okay \ud83d\udc4d just a bit sleep deprived",

The Coalition was a valiant effort....but stick a fork in it.\n\n(also fwiw, \"digital\" systems don't write, operate, and maintain themselves).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut MIT is somewhat special. And back in my day (when we walked to school in the snow uphill both ways) every single school had their own application.  Completed by hand. In pen/pencil.  Get off my lawn!",

This is their very first year on Common App\n\nThat's the reason why they force you to fill out your grades separately on Common App - their internal system is not set up yet to use the Common App C&G.\n\nhttps://www.news-gazette.com/news/all-state-universities-including-ui-to-start-using-common-app-for-admissions/article_976f2004-7f1a-580d-bc8b-08de0b9d12a3.html",

Then you also apply to UF and they ask for the SSAR..same thing, different website, ergo, new account. Beauty is, SSAR let\u2019s you import from the SRAR\u2026  but it doesn\u2019t do it correctly and you find enough differences that you have to do it all manually anyway.

Both states are large enough to support their own state-level apps, which almost certainly results in more kids applying to (and attending) lower-tier public schools in each state than would do so if ApplyTexas and the UC application didn't exist.  State governments want to juice application/enrollment to those schools and keep kids in-state if possible.\n\nFor instance, consider that the top two public schools in the country for # of applicants are UCLA and UC San Diego.  More people applied to UC Davis than applied to Michigan.  More people applied to UC Santa Cruz than applied to UT-Austin, Ohio State, U. of Washington, UIUC, UVA or UNC.",
