Really don't know anything about the application process; and,  \n3. Share advice that is neither useful nor wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv1divcvx9t71.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1099fe3c407f4576696b36049013166f3cceb6f",

They cut a lot of very good schools off the list because the schools weren't a right fit. Kid is satisfied and confident in their choices. That's good enough for me.",
