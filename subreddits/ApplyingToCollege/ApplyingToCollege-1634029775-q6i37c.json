  "text": "not sure if this is a stupid question, but i've gotten mixed responses about whether colleges place quotas and limit the number of students they admit. for this reason, my school is crazy competitive and cutthroat - people even try to steer away from applying to their dream schools because they're afraid that somebody else will take \"their spot\"\n\ndo quotas exist? are they different for every high school?",

      "text": "This is a really tricky topic and it will vary from college to college. In my experience, there's not exactly a quota, but we do look at students from the same high school in a group together. \n\nFor example, if there are 10 students applying and two of them are super strong, three of them are pretty good, and five are weaker, we might take the two top, waitlist the middle three, and deny the bottom five. This isn't because there's a quota, but rather because we can see the five lower students are weaker than their peers from the same school.\n\nIn that same example, though, if all 10 students are legitimately at the top of the class, or are all equally as strong, we might take all of them.\n\nThere's definitely not one right answer to this, as every college will handle it differently.",
