  "title:": "Dartmouth Writing Supplement Mistake",
  "text": "On my second Dartmouth supplement, I accidentally wrote two \"ands\" in a particular line, and didn't notice the error until recently. Would this have any effect on my application decision? Also, on the portal, I was able to update my writing supplement **today** and just removed the extra \"and\" on it. Would the college be using the writing supplement on my portal, or the one that I had uploaded way back on the Common App? Thanks!",

      "text": "My guess is that they would use the writing supplement you submitted along with the common app. I could be wrong though. Either way don't get too bogged down over it. AOs are primarily looking to gauge who you are and whether you would be a good fit at the school, so a simple typo won't break your application. Good luck!",
