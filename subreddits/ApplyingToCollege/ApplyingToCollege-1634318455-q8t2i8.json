  "text": "my dad has some weird confidence in my college application that I don't, so much so that he is compelling me to apply to Stanford (REA) when I know that my application isn't Stanford material. obviously, I like the fact that he has confidence in me but I think that applying for REA will result in me losing an opportunity to apply ED to a reach school instead. what do I do? for context, I have decent grades (90+ every year), pretty good ECs and a 5 on the only AP I gave (mechanics). plus I'm going test optional as an international so I don't think applying to stanford is a good choice.\n\nWhat do I do?",
