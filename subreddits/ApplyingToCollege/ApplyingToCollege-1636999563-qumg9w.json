  "text": "For weeks, it seemed like everyone else was getting college interview requests and as much as I tried to not overthink, I got a little bit anxious. \n\nAfter my close friend got hers, I was frustrated and checked every tab of my email with no luck, but then it struck to me that I haven\u2019t checked my spam in a while. Turns out I did receive an interview request a few days ago!",
