  "text": "\\- My grades are on an upward trajectory, this year they're the best they've ever been.\n\n\\- I don't intend on retaking the SAT, I'm sending my current score.\n\n\\- I'm conducting a blood drive that will attract up to 100 donors and may get my Eagle Scout for it in late November.\n\n\\- My essays are good according to feedback I've gotten from them but I still haven't fully finalized two 250-word supplementals and I don't know how I feel about it.\n\n\\- Statistically speaking applying early has higher acceptance but maybe that's because of confounding variables...it'd be nice to get a decision mid-December but I'll already have done most of my RD applications by then anyway so it doesn't save me much trouble.\n\n\\- Is there any DISadvantage to applying early?\n\nWhat do I do",
