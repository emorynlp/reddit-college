I\u2019m lucky to have gotten merit in that range to attend Oxford/Emory, which I recognize is still an awesome choice, but I\u2019d be a lot more excited about that without my dream school dangling just out of reach.

I guess that's all \"their fault,\" not the college's, but for anyone like me, any need-only schools are basically out of the picture, because their vision of need will not match realistic, real-life need.

I had to stay in state not only because of the financials, but also because I had to stay with and care for my brother. Honestly, best fucking decision I ever made. I saved so much money, and I never had to worry about my family like I would have had I gone to UChicago.\n\nI am so sorry for everyone devastated by the crushing realities of financials, among other extenuating circumstances. I know how it feels, and it really sucks... But remember: a school is just a tool. Any brand hammer will work if you learn to use it properly. It is far less important where you go. It is what you do while there that makes the difference. No matter where you end up, do well there and you will reap your rewards.",
