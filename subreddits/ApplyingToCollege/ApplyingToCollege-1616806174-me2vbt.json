The person has most likely busted their ass off studying and has a right to be upset even if stats aren\u2019t everything. They worked hard, so let them feel furious. Let them feel like their hard work deserved to pay off temporarily. Don\u2019t rain on their sadness or fury. Let them cope.",

With that said, it will not always be a fair distribution of only students who have worked the hardest. This is not those students faults, it is the college admissions. Especially if you are applying to higher level schools, there is a high possibility that other students are putting a lot of effort and time into their applications as well, so it\u2019s a kind of strange assumption that there\u2019s a lot of people who barely scraped together their application. Essentially what I\u2019m saying it that your feelings of being upset are very valid, but deflecting this anger on students who did get in who you have determined do not deserve it (due to how much effort *you perceived* they put in) is unproductive, and ultimately just salty and misdirected.",

While I\u2019m also in the rejected pile thinking these ppl didn\u2019t get in, who was I to hope? How many times have you gotten rejections yourself and read through these moments and think fuck I\u2019m so under qualified? When I get rejected I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to be accepted anyway bc of how my stats are, but in the midst of ppl who get rejected, there are people who think they deserve an acceptance just bc of their stats. There are a range of ppl who express their emotions like this here and I am talking about the worst of them, *only a few of them* who shits on others bc they got rejected. I have never said they cannot express their frustration and disappointment, but there are other ppl who are in the same situation who are doing that perfectly while not making others feel so down.",
