That area (the more buzzing area north of campus) is kinda soulless to be honest. A lot of 10 or so story condo buildings built on three story parking podiums. Good train access via blue line. It\u2019s not urban the same way DePaul or Loyola is. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever visited IIT, but the campus feeling is pretty similar. If you haven\u2019t, you should check that one out as well. It\u2019s a more central version of IIT.",

IIT has some more modern architecture gems mixed in though. Crown Hall was designed by Mies Van Der Rohe (who taught there) and the student center was designed by Durtch \u201cstarchitect\u201d Rem Koolhaas.  There are some nice things going on in Bridgeport (neighborhood west on the other side of the Stevenson Expressway) and Chinatown is also nearby. \n\nIf you ever come across a client who wants to study architecture in a big city but who doesn\u2019t have the standard 1500+, tons of APs, top GPA/rank to gun for the usual suspects, IIT is a good fit. Especially if they\u2019re looking for a more international feel. A lot of quality internationals go through there for a year or two as part of study abroad programs and they end up networking back in for jobs in Chicago.",

Blackbird had been around since about 2000. Paul Kahan had Publican and Moto was a very big deal. Stephanie Izard started Girl and the Goat c2008 or so. Things have boomed since then. Overall, it\u2019s a great restaurant destination scene. But the Near West Side is not a great place to live. The \u201cbox style\u201d condo building is ubiquitous. It doesn\u2019t feel \u201cneighborhoody\u201d the way some areas do with their mix of three story and taller buildings (most of the \u201cusual suspect\u201d nabes in the city) and it also doesn\u2019t have the super dense vibes of other areas of Chicago, Manhattan, SF, etc. it\u2019s kinda in between. Some of the things that did make it more cozy\u2014like less expensive pubs with a locals scene\u2014have been priced out. For college kids, it\u2019s more of a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d destination now vs a place to grab a cheap bite and a drink.\n\nThe vibe south of campus is totally different. More of the \u201cneighborhood feel\u201d with cheap eats, neighborhood bars with some\nReally good restaurants mixed in as well.",
