  "text": "Hey I\u2019m a sophomore who didn\u2019t do as well as I would have liked freshman year but I am taking and doing very well across the board with My AP, Honors, and required standard courses. I\u2019ve been interested in UC as they no longer use freshman year to calculate their GPA. My school does not offer very many Art classes, and I am thinking about putting my name on the list for the few art classes for next year, but I haven\u2019t ever really been too artistic. Will only classes like AP art history or Chorus/Band/Orchestra count or will graphic design or photography courses also be considered as something to fill the requirement. Hell last year I had to take a DDP class (Design, Drawing, Production) and that counted as my required art credit for graduation. I know they only count 4 semesters of AP classes for extra weight on their GPA scale ,per year, something that I am satisfying this and next year. So a non AP class would be fine.",
