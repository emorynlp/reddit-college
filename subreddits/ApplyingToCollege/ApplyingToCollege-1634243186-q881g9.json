  "text": "Case for Northeastern:\n- best coop program in the whole world\n- is located in Boston, with many tech careers\n- excellent financial aid\n\n\nCase for JHU:\n- it's Johns Hopkins, duh\n- elite connections and on campus recruiting\n- excellent financial aid\n\nI don't know which one to pick. From the looks of it, Google and Facebook only recently started having a presence around JHU campus, but it's still in Baltimore compared to Boston which has more tech careers. I'm not sure which to pick.",

      "text": "Some notes here:\n\n1. JHU overall prestige may win here and across all majors generally does too, but CS is not going to care about that as much.\n2. JHU's CS is not very known, but their overall prestige gets them in the door, where interviews matter more. So both can lead to pretty equal careers.\n3. CS is so portable and as mentioned DC is close, so I'd leave location out of it in terms of careers. Living, def consider Boston vs Baltimore.\n4. Northeastern has a very well regarded CS program for both [teaching](https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html) and [research](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us). Again you can see here JHU is just not as big on CS.\n\nI think many here prefer JHU off their overall name, but if you're confident in doing CS, I think this is very much advantage Northeastern.",
