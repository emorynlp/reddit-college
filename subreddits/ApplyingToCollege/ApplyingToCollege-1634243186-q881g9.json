  "text": "Case for Northeastern:\n- best coop program in the whole world\n- is located in Boston, with many tech careers\n- excellent financial aid\n\n\nCase for JHU:\n- it's Johns Hopkins, duh\n- elite connections and on campus recruiting\n- excellent financial aid\n\nI don't know which one to pick. From the looks of it, Google and Facebook only recently started having a presence around JHU campus, but it's still in Baltimore compared to Boston which has more tech careers. I'm not sure which to pick.",
