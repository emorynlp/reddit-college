  "text": "Hi everyone! I just had my Yale interview last night. It was super chill and my interview was so nice. Please, feel free to ask my anything, but here\u2019s a little rundown of questions asked for those or you wondering. Remember each interview is so subjective and two interviews are never the same! \n\nQuestions:\n- Asked me if I liked my high school and what I liked about it \n- Did I feel it was rigorous\n- What classes I was taking \n- My favorite/least favorite class\n- What extracurriculars do I take part in\n- Why Yale \n\nIt was truly a low-key conversation. Everything flowed naturally! \n\nSome of my information for people who find it helpful\u2026\n- I submitted my application on October 31st, but had all my materials in by then too (letters of rec, transcript, fafsa, css, etc.) \n- I\u2019m from Minnesota \n- I am not a Questbridge applicant \n\nI just came across the Yale \u201cASC Orientation\u201d booklet. I found it super helpful. It can give you a sense of the what Yale interviewers are look for and when deadlines are! Page 16 was particularly helpful in my opinion! [ASC Orientation Booklet](https://asc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/ASCOrientation_2_0.pdf) Remember though, this was written before they switched to virtual interviews, so some of things may be different. \n\nFeel free to ask my questions! I\u2019m happy to offer any help I can. Good luck to everyone applying, prepping for an interview, or waiting for an interview- you got this!!",
