  "title:": "Is it sad that I stress more about college than school?",
  "text": "Like, I think I've become so stressed that school has literally become \"fun\" for me. No seriously, I find lectures really interesting and learning new material really engaging. I used to absolutely hate schoolwork and everything school, but I think my mind has become so twisted that it finds school to be more relaxing than outside of school. I could probably go online and learn like five new courses on coursera and still have more fun than thinking about college tbh.\n\nLowkey think I'm slowly breaking inside, but hey, at least there's a positive right?",

              "text": "im gonna try my best to relate to u cause i also stressed a ton abt college senior yr\n\nlong story short, it literally doesn't fuckin matter. i applied to almost every single t20 and got rejected by every single one except for one. even though i knew i should've been thankful i felt like shit for a long time, telling myself i was going to transfer out to some HYPSM school like *that* was what success was. \n\n95% of my friends were also rejected by every single t20. we all spent weeks mourning and being awkward, not talking to each other, etc\n\nbut guess what? summer came, and it was the best summer I've ever had. senior trips to the beach, late night hangouts, zero responsibilities, etc. summer helped me forget the pain and the year of stress i went through my senior year. in the back of my head i knew i still had to go to a college i wasn't completely satisfied with, but summer made it better\n\nI'm a college freshman who's been on campus for not even 3 months, but let me tell u: *you will look back at yourself and laugh.* i love it here. i have friends i've gotten closer with in 3 months then my friends that i've known for 10+ years back at home. parties. study grind. dorm life. etc. \n\nstuff moves by in a blur so fast that by the time its all said and done, you realize how perfectly fine you were the whole time, or how perfectly fine you were going to end up being\n\nso don't stress!",
