  "text": "I know this is a super minor, and basically inconsequential thing, but I look young. People have told me I look like I could be a highschool freshmen when i'm really turning 19 in a few weeks. Then I look at colleges and their pages have pictures of students who actually look their age, and some even have beards and everything. I know this doesn't matter at all when picking colleges but it's just something I noticed.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Or maybe I am just weird, I think i'm just weird.",
