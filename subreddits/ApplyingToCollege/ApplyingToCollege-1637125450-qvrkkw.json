  "text": "so the UC admissions page says they require 3 years of math and recommends four. do 'years' just mean classes - for example, does a class taken over the summer count as a 'year'? what if you take two math classes in the same year? a series of unfortunate events led to me not having a math class my junior year, so now i'm wondering if the geometry class i took the summer before freshman year will count as a 'year' and, if not, if i should take two math classes next year to get all four. i will have to take one of them outside of school because we're only allowed to take one math class a year.",
