  "text": "for context, i'm very very big in poetry and that's very well reflected in my application. basically my entire personal statement is about my love for poetry and how it's empowered me to be true to myself. one of the majors i am planning on pursuing is english lit with a creative writing focus. uchicago is one of my top choices (fine it's currently my very top choice) so i've been really stressed about the extended essay and was just hoping to get y'all's opinion on it\n\nthe most similar stylistically to what i'm hoping to submit would be this personal statement from an emory blog that gave me so much hope because the majority of the feedback that i've received regarding my writing so far is that it's just not going to work and that i should just stick to a more classical approach to essay writing: [https://blog.emoryadmission.com/2020/08/poetry-and-prose-can-elevate-your-essay/](https://blog.emoryadmission.com/2020/08/poetry-and-prose-can-elevate-your-essay/)",

      "text": "I\u2019d try to make drafts in both styles and see how they work. I come from a creative writing background (/speaking) as well, and actually based one of my earlier drafts on a poem I wrote. It turned out how I wanted but I felt that my other ( third topic)  more normal essay was better. For you, it depends on how you write both. The draft I ended up using was mostly traditional, but influenced by my writing and speaking styles. The thing that pushed me more in the style of the traditional is the  knowledge of the time that AOs will spend  on it. They read extremely quickly and generally don\u2019t reread. Really different from how most people approach poetry, or how peers/teachers will help revise your essay. It\u2019s easy for an AO to miss shit if you don\u2019t beat them over the head with it directly. My second draft was a story with a strong metaphor of a poster project I did representing me. My teacher who read it three times saw that, but everyone who read it once missed it entirely. Having  \u201cinfluences\u201d will strengthen your essay and make it stand out, but I\u2019d be weary of the overly artsy stuff. It can work but I don\u2019t like looking at successful ones because it kinda leaves out the waves of ones that were awesome to authors and reviewers/ teachers who knew the person and took the time to read them and understand it, as compared with AOs who don\u2019t know them and aren\u2019t spending time with it. I wish you well.",
