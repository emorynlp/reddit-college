  "text": "After a nice 2 hours of crying about today's rejections, I thought I finally had no tears left to cry. So, I decided to brave the Chick-fil-A drive through for some pity nuggets. Needless to say, that was a mistake. I guess the guy taking my order could tell something was off and so he asked me if I was ok - that was HIS mistake. I don't know what came over me but I immediately burst out sobbing. Am I absolutely mortified? Yes. Did I get a free cookie? Yes. Am I ok? No, but now I have a cookie, so I will be. \n\nLesson learned: there will always be more tears left to cry.",

      "text": "This might be a good time to watch the Free Churro episode of Bojack Horseman. It's an amazing achievement in animation in that the whole half-hour episode consists of a monologue, but it is never for a moment boring. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't recommend it as the first r/BoJackHorseman to see if you're not already a fan, since it deals with some pretty heavy subject material. But the reason it's called Free Churro is that the monologue centers on a story about going out for something to eat while grieving, having a clerk ask a \"How ya doin'\" kind of question, and ultimately getting a free churro out of the transaction, which became a sort of bright spot in the whole experience.\n\nIn any case, OP, I hope you are feeling better now, and I hope you land in a situation that turns out to be a great fit that you had never expected.",
