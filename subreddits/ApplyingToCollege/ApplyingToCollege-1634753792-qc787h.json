  "text": "so i started a new school and the counselor rubbed me the wrong way. She said (rudely) that she doesn't write counselor recommendations anymore. I also just started the school so she doesn't really know me..and the one at my old school was new so she doesn't know me either. My question is.... Can I just hire my own personal college counselor for a year and make her write my recs for me?",

      "text": "If you are applying to schools in the US, a private counselor will not substitute for your HS counselor. You will need, in addition, for your HS counselor to send your transcripts and school profile as well as shepherding your apps from start to finish. If she doesn't write recs why is she there?",
