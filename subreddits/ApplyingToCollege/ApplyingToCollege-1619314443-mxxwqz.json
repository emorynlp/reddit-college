If you go to a good school it would be a flex and people would think you\u2019re a pretentious cunt and if it\u2019s a shit school people would label you as an idiot. Idk people are so much more than the school they go to. I get posting an acceptance letter in your story because you\u2019re proud of your accomplishment. But the bio thing I still find weird",

We do high school here so everyone in ur nearby area knows which district/school u go to and then college is just a similar reason. SOME people use it as a flex tho.
