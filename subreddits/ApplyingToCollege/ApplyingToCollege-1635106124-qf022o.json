      "text": "Most colleges superscore. So, you would want to report the highest section scores.\n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll - the Common App asks only for your highest SAT sectoin scores.\n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for these colleges, order an official report on the College Board website, using Score Choice, including the test date(s) with your highest section scores.\n\nOnly Georgetown and CMU require all scores.",

Some people are afraid that if someone sees their \u201cother\u201c scores, it would be bad (I don\u2019t).\n\nFor schools that require all scores (CMU, Georgetown and a few others. - check), send them all.",
