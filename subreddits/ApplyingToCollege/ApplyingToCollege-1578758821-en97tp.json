  "text": "Alright so basically what I\u2019ve noticed about people who get into top schools that I\u2019ve been friends with is that they\u2019re all nice people and actually have a life. If you have to study 24/7 and don\u2019t have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don\u2019t belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond \u2018I need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT\u2019 they\u2019re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y\u2019all really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think \u2018why did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college\u2019 then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don\u2019t want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you\u2019re not getting in to your top choices.\n\nEdit: just because you didn\u2019t get into a top school doesn\u2019t mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons\n\nEdit2:  I\u2019m apologize to any 1 specific person who read this and got upset. I am sure you have a life. I never tried to say that you didn\u2019t, you can have exactly 7 ECs but still have a life. The number was arbitrary, I didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone with the post it was just my opinion.",

You fall into a spot where you don't even care about your straight As or 1550 SAT score because you are so focused on getting into CalTech or MIT or Harvard or Stanford. If you don't get it, then it feels like all of that hard work was for nothing but the problems don't end if you do get in. Instead of being a stressed out high schooler focused on college, you are now a stressed out college student focused on keeping up with your peers, not letting yourself down, graduating with honors, setting yourself up for the best grad or med school, etc. \n\nMost of y'all just need to chill. I get that it's hard. My kids go to a high performing high school and the pressure is intense, but you can't spend your whole life focused on a future that you'll never allow yourself to actually enjoy.",

                  "text": "I have taught at an ivy league school (ecology and biostatistics, both required for bio majors including pre-med) and I think everyone here is over-estimating the demands on students at these institutions. I firmly believe that the hardest part is getting in, and that the student's abilities had little to do with that. \n\nGrade inflation is insane. I was basically not allowed to fail students. I was required to ensure that my classes had a B average. Rebellious by nature, I addressed this by grading students incredibly harshly, failing almost the entire class on every assignment, and curving the grades to a B average. Students' writing skills were barely literate and made me strongly suspect that most had their entrance essays written by someone else, or the essay was not important in getting them accepted. I found myself not getting through biostatistics material because the students (sophomores) had never learned Microsoft Excel and I had to walk them through that. Many of my ecology students (freshmen) had clearly breezed through high-school without challenge, and had to be taught how to study and take notes. \n\nI have also taught at flagship State Universities with relatively low admissions standards (48% and 63%). Qualitatively, the only difference between students at the Ivy and at the public schools was that the class sizes at the ivy were significantly smaller, and the worst students weren't present. If you took the 5 best students from my public school classes, and randomly selected 15 from the remaining students who actually bothered to show up to class, you would have the kids in my Ivy classes.\n\nI believe it is truly one of the biggest scams in history that so many people believe that Ivy League students are the brightest our country has to offer. As I mentioned above, they were on par with my public school students. I will say that because of the smaller class sizes students received a somewhat better and much more personalized education, if they took advantage of it. But overall, once they were in, it was basically impossible for them to fuck it up, and most of my students put in the minimum amount of effort necessary so they could focus on socializing.",

But what that comes down to is doing things only for the purpose of college. Pushing test scores even past 1500 and a 34, doing extracurriculars that you don't care about only because they will look good on a app. Only participating in clubs where you are sure you can get leadership. All of these things are problematic, but don't necessarily fall under the umbrella of \"not having a life.\" \n\nTelling these people that their problem is they \"don't have a life\" doesn't acknowledge the reason why they threw away their life in the first place. Not only is the phrase practically nonsensical at this point, I can't see it actually helping people. My point is that at the end of the day it comes down to happiness. The real problem is that people are spending their time doing things that don't make them happy, with the idea that only getting into an amazing college (which is pretty much a game of chance) will give them this happiness.",

If they were really competitive they wouldn\u2019t have had to go through all those hoops and still get below average for Ivy League. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, they should just go somewhere less prestigious instead of wasting money and years of their life to get something they don\u2019t have the natural aptitude for anyways",

I probably have a 140 iq) but I know that's not at all accurate since the test from the 90s is unrecognizable from the one we take nowadays.",

Massive curves, passing grades were sometimes as low as 30%, professor essentially refused to fail students regardless of grades, the person I know basically had to beg the professor to fail a student even though then student did not submit the overwhelming majority of assignments or show up to class.\n\nObviously this is not be the case in every program or at every school but the point is that a schools selectivity is not necessarily reflective of the difficulty of course work especially at the undergrad level.

I only confined myself to one friend and just tagged on him for stability. Tbf my parents were first gen immigrants wo college education so I didn\u2019t grow up with books but hardcore video games. Eventually I study like 1000 hours for the SAT (more like several hundred) and get 1550. Then the essays I just wrote out woke thoughts I had. It wasn\u2019t that great but I felt like I manifested my personality from what I wrote in college apps instead of the other way around. I graduate valedictorian and go to Stanford. \n\nThe people here at Stanford? People who are used to their whole life naturally curious, ambitious, smart, and resourceful. I worked in high school a lot just to make myself feel better than my other peers, and I benefitted academically from self alienation. \n\nSo... yeah. I don\u2019t belong to go here. But guess what? Fuck you im here right now. Respect to anyone who can make it to Stanford from a first gen background. I may feel very culturally different from my peers but I realize now it\u2019s the companionship you feel from others that is worth it. \n\nI let myself have fun now in college and it\u2019s just now I see it was totally fine for me to work so hard in high school, but I should have definitely made more friends and do more social things. This early social development would\u2019ve helped me but I feel again my school is very awkward. I never had a friend group. Now I do. I feel a special sense to each person within our friend group, and it gets better from here. \n\nTLDR: this guy is right but Know first how much you are willing to sacrifice before you make it. I would fit better in a more introverted UC environment but I learned so much more about life eventually so it all works out. For me? I don\u2019t deserve it but it was fucking worth it.",

Some of these companies also aren't well known because they are hedge funds and can't advertise to the public. Prestige doesn't even matter if you are getting paid a lot.\n\n> I recommend you spend some time thinking about what you are really trying to accomplish and more importantly, why. \n\nIt's quite obvious because some people just want to become rich and make sure that it definitely happens. There are only a few paths that are guaranteed to give you success which is why some people have a narrow way of thinking. Going to a top school and getting recruited to one of these companies is guaranteed to make you rich.

And again, my original point is that companies like mine are not hiring Ivy League candidates. \n\nI was unclear before but money is one reason people become quants. In a short summary, *quants   develop and implement complex mathematical models that financial firms use to make decisions about risk management, investments and pricing.* So you see, it's a very highly technical job that rewards you for being exceptionally good at math. There are a lot of high achieving and ambitious kids in this sub that would major in a STEM field like math and prefer a career that's highly technical. A career in engineering would suit them, but if their goal is to also become rich then most would choose to be a quant because it's a mathematically intensive career that also pays well. Yes, there are only a few quant jobs, but as I mentioned, a lot of kids in this sub are ambitious and driven so I wouldn't doubt that they'd be capable of getting those jobs.  \n\nBesides, if your company is in the top 50 like Amazon or Facebook, I'm sure it's a well known company that lots of ivy league students are trying to apply to. It seems to me that you are leaving out some information because you don't even mention the name of the company and you imply that you recruit from state schools and pay them as much quants in the mid 6 figures/7 figures range.

Everyone wants someone that is outgoing but smart, when reality is quite off. Most of the people here, even though they vent their frustration at spending too much time and effort have a personality and a social life. But we somehow have to pretend \"you've got to have a something in order to get T20\", I'm sorry but I'll be blunt: the students are normal, as everyone else. They are hardworking, they have aspirations, they can be great as persons but also commit mistakes. \nYou are making it look like T20's should care about personality, for god's sake, maybe it's because I'm not American but colleges are first institutions of higher education and then communities. Let's stop judging our character for education, most people here are not even adults goddammit.",

The vast majority of students that feel like they NEED a 4.0 GPA/36 ACT etc. etc. generally go to high schools where people regularly get into such colleges and there's a general mindset that if you don't get in, you're 'stupid' or there's something wrong with you. I don't think you intended to come off this way, but it feels like you're saying \"unless getting into a T20 took very little effort for you, you shouldn't go there because you're not cut out for it.\" This is EXACTLY what contributes to Stanford Duck Syndrome type mindsets where students feel like they have to maintain the perfect image of balance, where they act like they don't study and get perfect grades, sacrifice sleep to seem like they have a life, or where they feel anxiety since everyone around them acts like they have it together. Yes, you'll be better off at a top school if you manage to have a good work/life balance, but I don't think we should be telling people \"you don't belong here if you don't.\"",

The moment I started tackling the workload and then getting stressed out and procrastinating last semester was when I thought, 'If this is already hard now, imagine what it'd be like at MIT doing psets.' I didn't have the work ethic or drive to even accomplish my homework at the time so how could I possibly even survive in MIT or NEU for that matter? Point is, you're absolutely right. Some of us really don't belong at top schools and one of the reasons being this most likely as well.",

For many people and especially people in my area, focusing on grades and school is truly the best thing for them. Higher education is one of the best ways for someone to achieve upward mobility and you have no right to make people feel lesser than for seeing it that way. I honestly don't understand why posts like \"how do people not have a 3.9+ and you shouldn't go to a t20 if..\" get popular. Everyone who posts these are like 17/18 and have very sheltered lives (despite not knowing it).",

Good doctors have amazing people skills and to have good people skills a person needs to be relatable, which means that they need to have some sort of life outside of medicine.  Medical schools know this and intentionally weed out applicants who are pretty much just premed machines.  As an applicant you need to prove to medical schools that you not only have the intellectual capacity to keep up with the curriculum, but also that you have healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with the stressful and depressing nature of the job.\n\nSource: I am a second semester college senior who got into their top choice med school as an early decision applicant.",

      "text": "The thing people have to understand is that working hard doesn\u2019t mean only studying. Let me give you an example. Let\u2019s say 20 years from now you\u2019re looking back at your life and there were two possible paths in high school:\n\n1) you worked hard and got a 3.6 GPA and a 1450 SAT. Which are very respectable. You studied a good amount but you made time for your family and friends and to build meaningful relationships. \n\n2) you have a 4.5 GPA and a 1590 SAT but you couldn\u2019t do much outside school other than study and work on extracurriculars which you only did for college apps.\n\nI GUARANTEE you would be much happier with the first option. Cause when you have a job and live alone you\u2019ll regret not spending more time with your mom, talking for half an hour about how your days were. Making sure your dad was okay cause he isn\u2019t perfect. Trying to help your siblings get through the difficult times they\u2019re  going through. \n\nAlso another thing yall have to understand is that a big name doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good school. \n\nFact: UIUC and Purdue are ranked higher than any of the ivies for engineering. \n\nHowever, no one cares about them but you go to Princeton for like music or smth and everyone makes a big deal out of it.\n\nWhat matters more than where you get your degree is what you do with it. \n\nI know people who have gone to very mediocre schools and become super successful \n\nI know people who have gone to amazing schools and crumbled after cause they thought their life was made out for them\n\nDon\u2019t put this much pressure on yourself to get into these universities when, in reality, they matter very little when it comes to everything life will throw at you after. \n\n\nPS. I got into a top ten engineering school in the world (although I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going) so I\u2019m speaking from experience and not just some salty senior that got rejected from MIT",

Well, i dont think its feasible for every highschool senior to have a legitimate passion they are passionate about. And college is where they can find it. Working hard to get into those colleges to be able to explore better opportunities later is not bad thing at all. I mean, while socializing and enjoying life may worth it as a personal development, devoting time to SAT/ACT would develop your critical thinking and other relevant skills. People are trying their hardest to be able to pursue their passion later in their life, and you can't blame it on them.\n\nNext, it seems like your generalizing. Those people who study 24/7 and work their ases off to maintain that 4.0 gpa aren't always bad at socializing. \n\nWhile it may be true that lack of character and personality in your app might reflect negatively, your completely ignorant and negative view towards those students seems a bit too much. Based on your last paragraph, I also can't understand how \"outside competence and perspective\" relates to socializing. In college apps, it's completely possible to show such \"competence and perspective\" without socializing(they can just pretend?) and still work hard. \n\nThey're trying their best to achieve their dream, and without a clear passion or goal, such approach to academics may be better for them. It simply doesn't make sense to say \"they don't belong at top schools\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwell, that's probably my unpopular response; it's like 3 am and I don't even know what I'm writing lol",

Colleges are a lot more impressed by people actually going out and doing things. And your point about the people at top schools being the ones who don\u2019t need to study constantly in high school is a good point I never really thought about. I\u2019d add that it\u2019s not just the people who didn\u2019t need to study though, it\u2019s the people who didn\u2019t need to study, but still managed to have good study skills in college.

It\u2019s true though, and anybody who has been in a weed-out class would understand that. Getting a 4.0 in high school means absolutely nothing. It basically just means you stayed awake and did your work. \n\nLiterally every single person you encounter in college will have been an honor student, with the vast majority of them being in the top 10% of their high school class. That is the absolute bare minimum required for a school to even look at you. If you have to spend all your time to get those grades, you don\u2019t belong in college because there\u2019s no way you could handle the workload if high school is that much of a burden. \n\nBasically what I was trying to say is those people are just salty because they\u2019re not as smart as they think they are.",

A lot of rich people, who are academically inclined, groom their children from early on. So when they are at college going age, they already have the necessary social skills and academic knowledge. But people from poor background have to first get the academic knowledge before they can even compete. There are exceptional people but in general rich people have better social skills in addition to the academic skills.\n\nSo the issue basically goes to rich kids vs poor kids. Its unfair to poor kids but the whole society is geared towards the rich hence its not really unfair.",

Just be an interesting person and don't give yourself off as a boring scholar. College would suck if it only had people who obsess their lives over some numbers on a piece of paper. Of course, good stats do help, but once you're in a certain range a few decimal points won't matter at all.",

      "text": "I disagree with you. I think that most high school students (not necessarily the ones you see on this subreddit) do extracurricular activities that they find fun and enjoyable, not because they think the activities will look great on their college resumes. It seems to me that if you\u2019re feeling this way, you must go to a very competitive high school. Maybe you feel like those students who work their butts off aren\u2019t genuine. But you don\u2019t necessarily know who these kids are outside of school. Maybe they love video games, or comic books, or nature, or baking, or filmmaking, but you only see the kid who tries to hard and has no life outside of school. Everyone, even the most \u201ctry hard\u201d person has a life outside of school, but the things they make time to do out of school might not be something they are listing on their college apps.\n\nThere are a ton of paths to top schools. You guys are teenagers. Some students have true academic passions in high school, but you don\u2019t need to have everything all figured out right now. Some of you are stressed out. Some of you are being pushed by their parents and some of you think you have it figured out but will change your minds once you enter college. You don\u2019t need to have your school work and social life and outside interests all perfectly balanced to get into a top school.\n\nWhen I was in college, I once told a professor that I wasn\u2019t sure if I chose the right major because I found my classes to be really challenging. She told be that it was supposed to be challenging\u2014that you don\u2019t major in something because it comes easy to you. Even the smartest, most naturally gifted kids in high school can study something that challenges them in college. Like in high school, in college you have to prioritize between your schoolwork and grades, mental health, and having fun. But in high school, you have demands from your parents and teachers, while in college, it\u2019s all on you.",

I hung out with my friends all the time, lead extremely time consuming extracurriculars (and excelled in them) have great grades, took AP classes, and also leave almost all my weekends as a time to relax and wind down. If you can manage your time, you can enjoy your time in HS and not stress. I keep a color coded calendar on my phone and put rehearsal dates and times, assignments, tests, quizzes, events, and competitions on there. It keeps me on track and lets me see where I have free time to relax and make plans. Now, I made it to my dream school.

People who aren't suited for a high school environment (lack of academic and personal freedom) often have the expectation that they will perform better in university and it will be a worthwhile investment (which is factually true), so they tough it out. Some people are enabled/conditioned from a young age to work efficiently in school. Others are not and they only have the conviction to perform later on  (at around high school or late middle school age). This creates an obvious strike against efficiency, which is why there are a lot of people who don't have the best life balance. But they're not living life wrong. For most of these people, they care deeply about their futures and acknowledge that the top 20s WILL grant them networking, income, and academic benefits. You're not a guru, and we get that you got attractive test scores. However, that gives you no authority to command that you're somehow the shepherd to these wayward students. Stop stroking your wee dick with these obviously self-serving statements like \"they\u2019re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that\", only to turn around and pull out your 36 in the comments. You're here for yourself, and you operate on some cynicism and self-obsession that is so obvious and really fucking lame. Get your head out of your ass and into the big picture.",

I did try to learn all of physics 2 in two weeks before my subject test, which meant I had to study while I was at an all nighter party my friend was hosting, so that is kinda extreme. I didn\u2019t study as much for my math 2, but it reflected in my score. My EC\u2019s are kinda garbage compared to other people because I just volunteer a lot and help organize a couple community events.

We have different profile, one of them is like... extended extended maths and it is the hardest class to get into in Poland I think. At least the most respected one. We are taught by university professors and I've looked at maths AP class programs... they're laughable.\n\nBut I am not aiming to be condescending. Hear me out.  I got 800 from Math II and Physics, studying not at all for maths and like 4 days for physics. I just browsed through the prep book and I will be honest: I wouldn't have known the answer to half the questions on the test if it weren't for that book. But the effort was minimal.\n\n1500 from SAT with, again, a couple days of preperation and afaik it is a great score. I kinda regret I didn't prepare better but the reading and writing part was so exhausting that I lost the motivation. I know, this is NOT a good sign but eh. People say 1100, 1300 are good and great scores respectively and I honestly do not know what to think about it. \n\nBut if I do not get into any uni in USA, it is not over for me. There is still the University of Warsaw, which has a good program and it is a great opportunity given that I live 5 minutes away by bike and it's free.\n\nEntering high school I thought it is going to be like every other school but... just better. It turns out that, well... that is true, but there's so much more. The people and interacting with them matters a LOT. I learnt electronics just because my friend let me work with him at his house in his workshop on some projects. And he is a JERK but I befriended him because I explored him and made it work and we're pretty close now.\n\nThere are many more examples in which developed not by cramming or maintaining grades but by leaving that and exploring and uniting with other great people. I helped others develop too, I'm not just a leech.\n\nThe point ia that I know that whether I end up in the University of Warsaw or MIT, the best place to learn is not directly in class (even if it offers great material) but, as long as you are not behind on the classwork, by exploring and seizing unofficial opportunities among the people you meet daily.\n\nI am no longer worried if I end up in a top top school, because I've already learnt how to.make the most of education. But I won't lie... being in a top school defimitely helps because there's simply MORE brilliant people than elsewhere.",

If you take a lot of ECs that shows work ethic, a personality trait. if you care a lot about grades or are competitive, that is a personality trait. Its not sacrificing your personality its expressing it. \n\nIts probably just that there is limited spots and they didnt stand out on their essay.  Mixed with heritage entrances and all the other specialty entrances, there just isnt enough spots for everyone and great candidates miss out.  \n\nSure, personality is relevant but lets not act like doing everything youre supposed to do is why people are not getting into the schools they want.  You need to reach the baseline requirements and have competitive stats, bare minimum.",

Don't buy the hype, don't be that person who keeps deferring looking for their dream school; go to another great school and move on with your life.",

Maybe if I studied my gpa would be a bit higher, but we\u2019ll never know.\nThe only ivy I applied to is Brown, just for fun. I did good on the supplements I feel, but I by no means expect to get in. The rest of the schools I applied to are all around my ACT range, and are liberal arts so I would be able to enjoy the same academic freedom that the ivies offer. I never saw the point of taking 7 AP classes and having no social life just to be rank 1 in the class. I simply do not do well in classes that don\u2019t interest me. I have taken 4 AP classes in my entirety of hs (US gov, Chem, Stats, and Psych). I took those classes not because they can boost your gpa, but because they interest me. I would much rather go to an above mid tier school that offers open curriculum and is a better fit for me than killing myself to get into a school that I didn\u2019t belong in the first place.",

      "text": "So, if you think of an application as running on a point system, you have your high school transcript, which is basically your resume. Your GPA will be worth it's weight in points, so up to 4 points on gpa. Next you'll get your ACT score divided by 9 as another set of points. Lastly, you'll get one point for a physical extracurricular activity that requires a commitment, and 1 point for an extra curricular activity that is academic in nature.\n\nSo, If you are competing without extracurriculars against someone who has extracurriculars, Your perfect ACT score and your Perfect GPA will put you on par with a B average student who does a varsity sport and some sort of accademic or community service project.\n\nYour 8 points from grades is worth their 6 points from grades + 2 bonus points.\n\nSecond, around 16-18 years of age is right around the time many people start to show major symptoms of psychological problems. If you are going to develop Schizophrenia, or Bipolar disorder, etc, it will happen by the time you are 25 years old in most cases. 25 is the end of a period we'd called maturation of the human brain. For better or worse, this puts a critical time for your brains development at a time when you aren't used to actually handling your own problems yet. People that are more social are more likely to have others who can recognize issues and let you know. So, if you are a perfect student, being well socialized will alleviate some of the risk that you will not finish school due to a medical problem that can be medicated.\n\nLastly, forget about your school. Your own body of work should speak for itself, and your own efforts should get you your opportunities. The school you attend should simply have the opportunities you desire. If you want to study abroad, and are interested in a specific country, make sure your intended school choice offers that. In most cases, 5 years after you have started working, your Alma matter doesn't matter.  All schools foster unique environments, find one that works for you.",

I got into 2 of the top schools in my state but I chose not to go to either one. Right now I'm a first year college student at a community college, finishing my 4 year degree in 3 years because of all the credits I took in high school. Now that my grades matter, I've been putting in the work. Nobody really gives a shit what college you went to. If you actually decided to invest your happiness and mental/physical health into getting into Harvard that's great but you just wasted a portion of the little time you have on Earth. Employers take it into consideration a little maybe but at the end of the day, it's more important to be a well rounded person with actual interpersonal skills, a diversity of qualifications, and a reasonable work ethic.",

      "text": "This is 100% the opposite of everything I saw growing up.  And I'm old now, so I can tell you how life turned out for all my high school friends.\n\nOne of my best friends was the literal valedictorian of our school and while he was smart, he was driven to be successful.  I don't know what you mean by 'have a life', he did a lot of activities, all with the purpose of getting into a top college.  He did all the nerdy academic crap, scholastic bowl, science club, you name it.  He absolutely went home and studied, every day.  He did ACT prep starting in Freshman year.\n\nWhat did my lazy ass do?  I played a lot of video games.\n\nI've met quite a few people.  The smartest guy I've known nearly failed out of high school.  The truth is, nobody is smart enough to get a 4.0 without trying.  School isn't designed to reward raw intelligence or aptitude.  It's a *lot* of busy work.  Without a desire to do these things, you will fail.  This kid scored a 35 on his ACTs - but he still failed class after class because he didn't do any of the assignments.  Even as smart as he was, it didn't matter, you have to work to get a 4.0 - or even a 2.0.\n\nHe ended up graduating and getting into a good school based on his test scores alone.  He failed out of college after a year.  He moved back in with his parents and was going to 'write a book' then he was going to 'start a blog'.  Then he decided he wanted to write his own blog from scratch - to program his own.  Then, apparently, he got really good at programming.  He got a part-time web dev job somewhere and in about two years, he became a legit expert.  I was studying Computer Science and it was heartbreaking to see how quickly he surpassed me.  And not by a little, I mean, he was waaaay ahead of me.\n\nI graduated and took some boring job with an insurance company maintaining some legacy application, and shortly after that he moved to Palo Alto ( think?) to work for Google.  He went on to have an incredible career, getting promoted, leading a team, quitting Google for some fancy start-up that was exploding, then they sent him to the UK to open their EU branch...and still - he couldn't effortlessly get a 4.0\n\nOh, and he had even less of a life than any of us.  He was/is an extreme introvert.  He'd come out and play Super Smash with us on the weekends sometimes and we'd chat online...but that was about it.  No sports, no clubs, no dating, no parties, basically only one group of friends....he read comics and played video games.",

At smaller, less funded schools that can\u2019t offer as many AP/IB classes, it\u2019s just plain harder to even get the track record that too schools are looking for. I tried to get as many AP classes as possible, yet my school decided to schedule two unrelated and traditionally senior year APs on the same block so I had to choose between the two of them. In addition to that scheduling mishap, AP Chem was only offered every other year. The max you could take at my school was 8, and it was rare you could schedule all of those within the 4 years you were there. Last I heard, within the past 50 years of graduating classes, less than 10 people had attended an Ivy League university. \nI seriously respect the people that have the desire and drive to attend these upper level universities, but that desire died out in me when I realized that people from my town didn\u2019t go to those schools.",

                  "text": "I mean, aside from just looking at the data or literally looking at firms' recruitment processes and applications (some literally say \"only undergrads from Harvard and Yale\"), I can provide some anecdotal experience. My entire family and most of my friends' parents are professors, most of whom recruit PhD students to their respective programs at a T10 research university. They've told me that kids from high performing research unis (think HYPSM, UChicago, Caltech) immediately get considered regardless of their GRE score and GPA, unless it is literally abysmal. My dad monitors admission for the physics graduate program, and kids from Tsinghua (best uni in China) are literally placed into a separate pile and immediately get interviewed. Again, you can literally just look at top research programs and see that 80% of the kids come from T20s, its not hidden at all.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman-Sachs have a resume-reading program that immediately gives HYP kids the virtual interview thing via email, which is round 3 of the process for a normal applicant. The ONLY exception is if you are a URM, which is a MASSIVE boost in graduate admissions for almost every single field.",

(Yeah I know not EVERY, but you get my point).\n\nI can only see this post making people upset and even more unhappy with themselves than they were before. There have already been at least 3 posts in the past week about what it means to be socially awkward and high-achiving (the one by u/tetridigger was especially good). I don't see any of the \"so what\" or the optimism that made those posts meaningful. Sure, call people out on being awkward, focusing too much on surface level achievement, and say that ruined their life, but so what? \n\nIts a lot of negativity directed at the people who are most vulnerable to it, and the wording is so vague that almost anyone can use it as fuel for their own self-hatred. The fact you have made those edits shows this post was flawed from the start. Yes it is your opinion, and you stated it terribly.",

Well I would say for some students a t20/ivy may be easier than HS even, because it would not only give students more time to do things besides attend class, but you can also actually choose your classes. \n\nWhat I mean is, lets say a student lives and breathes computer science. In HS, they have to take 4 core classes no matter what, subjects they don't necessarily care about, therefore having to go through \"mental torture\" and end up spending a lot more time to do well in compared to their peers. However, in college as a CS major, they may already have AP Credits for those gen ed classes, and get to take CS related classes, all of which come naturally, are enjoyable, and pretty easy for the student despite the work being extremely high level. Pretty sure that student would find college easier than HS.",
