  "text": "I\u2019m not super sure what to do here. I\u2019ve been trying to get into apply Texas, but the website won\u2019t load for me and it only shows a blank screen. It\u2019s worked for me in the past, so this is definitely just a recent thing. I\u2019ve tried it on my laptop, phone, and with wifi turned off, same thing each time. Has this happened to anyone else or do any of y\u2019all have ideas for how to fix it? Thanks in advance!",
