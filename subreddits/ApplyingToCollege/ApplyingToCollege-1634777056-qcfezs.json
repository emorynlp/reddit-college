It truly just varies from case to case\n\nTLDR - short answer is it varies but general consensus for the average applicant is like 25 at most",

      "text": "1. Uhhhh about 25\n2. It depends completely on your financial situation and time. If you are willing to write a lot of supplements/reuse ones and if you can afford to apply somewhere or get a fee waiver then whatever you feel like doing. Personally I wouldn\u2019t do more than 30 because CommonApp only allows 20 colleges and unless you have another commonapp-sorta thing like for the UCs and ApplyTexas you will have to spend a lot of time refilling out all of your information for each individual college",
