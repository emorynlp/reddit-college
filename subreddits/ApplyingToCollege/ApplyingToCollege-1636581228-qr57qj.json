      "text": "I applied last year but my interviews were a mix. Some felt very much like what I imagined- tell me about how you do in school, what you do outside of school, favorite extracurricular, major successes, why X school, etc. Some felt completely different. Most would ask at least one question on extracurriculars- usually a straight up \u201cwhat do you do outside class\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite extracurricular\u201d and then they\u2019d ask follow ups.",
