  "text": "SO I had my Harvard interview today, and it went well \u2026 EXCEPT She started asking me about my college essay, and as we started discussing, she began to ask a few specific questions out of the blue. Specifically, the age of a person in my essay. I said \u201c10 years old\u201d but I am just now realizing that I wrote 8 years old in my personal statement. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the end all be all and that she doesn\u2019t even have my personal statement, but I\u2019m worried she jotted down the age and admissions counselors will think I\u2019m irresponsible OR EVEN MADE UP THE STORY! \n\n*My interviewer was vigorously typing as the interview was happening\u2026\n\nI\u2019m really nervous now- just want some thoughts on this situation!",
