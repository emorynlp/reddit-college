  "text": "Okay, so the \u201cFuture Plans\u201d section on the Common App. Since I filled it out back in the summer, I have \u201cPhysician, Medicine\u201d there, but I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not applying pre-Med anymore. I ended up submitting my Boston College application indicating I wasn\u2019t interested in pre-professional programs, but forgot to change future plans to something else/undecided. Do I need to contact my admissions officer about this? Could this negatively affect my admissions decision at all?",
