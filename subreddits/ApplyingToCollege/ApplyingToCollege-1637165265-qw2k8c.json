As for loans, you should still be eligible for federal loans depending on your FAFSA numbers.",

(Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nKeep in mind that many universities, especially private ones, require other financial aid forms in addition to FAFSA, such as CSS Profile. Make sure you read the instructions on each college's financial aid website to make sure you have completed all the financial aid application requirements for that college..",
