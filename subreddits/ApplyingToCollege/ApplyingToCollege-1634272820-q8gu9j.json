  "text": "I am a foreign national (went to school outside of Korea but have citizenship) and was looking into applying to Underwood International at Yonsei. But their deadline is in May and decisions are June 30, which is far past US and Canada deadlines to pay and choose a college. Is this normal or am I getting it wrong because if this is true, how do any North American students apply to Korean universities?",

      "text": "It's pretty straightforward to apply actually. Go to the English version of their website and they have a very detailed document detailed how and when you should apply. You should probably apply with your actual grades.\n\nIf you want a more popular and well studied example, look at NUS in Singapore, they have similar deadlines.\n\nThe only issue is that you won't really be able to pay deposits to any American colleges before getting your Yonsei decision, due to the clash in deadlines.",
