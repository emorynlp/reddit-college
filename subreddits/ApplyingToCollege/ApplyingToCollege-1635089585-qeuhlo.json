  "text": "Hi guys I am an international student and still not sure if I want to ED. What are some good Mid tier colleges that offer co-op or internships for cs/business. I am really scared.\n \nI have university of Rochester, Umiami, Skidmore in mind. But I am not sure about these. Specially UMiami as I can't find any opportunities related information for these. \n\nPlease suggest some good colleges that are also good with aid too. I have done research but it still doesn't feel enough. ED feels like a huge commitment and I can't have the most thorough information about colleges.",
