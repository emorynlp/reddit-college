  "text": "This might sound like a trivial question but I\u2019d appreciate help as I\u2019m doing this as an international. How do I submit my academic and extracurricular certificates? \nIn the Princeton application, you can only submit 3 additional accolades (no more than that).\nIn Harvard application, you can submit only 5 academic certificates. \n\nThe thing is\u2026I have many accolades and there\u2019s not enough space in the app.  Would I have to use application portal for their submission? \n\nAnd also, how do I send them the proof of my extracurriculars? Like the thousand of hours, I worked at my foundation and in my summer jobs? \nMy summer job employer is writing a \nletter for me, Would he have to emphasize that I spent this many hours?",
