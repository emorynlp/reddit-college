  "text": "I honestly have totally stepped away from this sub since starting my freshman year of college this fall, but wanted to take a sec to hop on and put out one of those posts I really appreciated seeing this time last year... because I lived on this subreddit lol. \n\nYOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE FINE. I know everyone says it and I really did not believe them when they saw me stressed and near my breaking point over where I would end up. But it's true I promise and this super f\\*cked and stressful period is going to pass, and then you'll start college and get stressed again lol. \n\nLooking back I swear if there is one thing I would change it would be to just take a huge chill pill. Stressing over the order of activities and nit-picking every word in your essays will NOT make a difference. You and the stories and experiences you bring to the table will be enough if you just are honest and speak from the heart. I was so unhappy during app season when I really didn't need to be. And if this first semester has taught me anything, it's that you have got to live in the present and just work on feeling content each day as opposed to constantly reaching for something bigger.  That is all,,, you guys have got this:) just breathe!",
