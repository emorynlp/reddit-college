But I just clicked \u2018no\u2019 when they asked me if I can access a copy of my transcript. \n\nI got a school in the UK, and so don\u2019t really have something to put in that section (due to difference in curriculum) - did I just horrendously mess up or will they just look at my official transcript that my school will send to them?",
