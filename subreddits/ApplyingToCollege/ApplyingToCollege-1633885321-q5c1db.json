  "text": "Last year, I missed the cutoff for USAMO by only \\~10 points, so now the highest level I've qualified for is the AIME, even though I am better than the average AIME qualifier. Do you guys think the AOs will care about the score I get, or just see that the highest I've qualified for is the AIME? I'm worried that they only know the AMC -> AIME -> AMO progression, and not how the scoring system works. So maybe they will just look at what I qualified for and move on.",
