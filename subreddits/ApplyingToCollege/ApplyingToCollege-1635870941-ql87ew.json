Transfers do have a hard time getting research at UCs due to their lower div. courses\u2014 especially something STEM related. I am not sure if it is the same experience for top private universities but even then it is almost impossible to transfer into them as they sometimes accept less than 20 transfers\u2014 usually from already top performing colleges.",

I know you said they are fairly well off, but if they are willing to file a FAFSA you should have them do that ASAP.\n\nI also see that you mentioned being kicked out, so I can imagine your parents helping with the FAFSA might not be possible. If you are being kicked out now, you should talk to your high school counselor about a McKinney-Vento determination. The McKinney-Vento act is centered around helping homeless students, and if you are being kicked out in high school you could potentially qualify which would make you automatically an independent student on the FAFSA, meaning it would only go off of your income. \n\nIf you don't meet the requirements for a homelessness determination, you could still as for a dependency appeal, arguing that you are fleeing an unsafe situation at home due to your gender identity. This will require some additional documentation and would be considered separately at each school you apply to. \n\nI'm happy to answer any other fin aid questions you may have to try and help you out and navigate your situation as well!",

Beyond that, you could also try getting full-ride or full-tuition scholarships based on SAT/ACT scores, or merit-based applications. If you try applying to lesser-known schools with great stats, they're also more likely to give you a lot of money. Best of luck!",

So why not start now? \n\nBy not paying for your college you'll learn how to properly manage your money. A skill so many people do not have. And just because they won't pay for it upfront does not mean that they won't help you if you get into a tight spot. \n\nA separate bit of advice from my own person experience: \n\nDon't rush. The program you wish to apply to will accept new applicants next year. And likely the the year after that. If you can't afford it, don't go. I rushed right into a program out of high school and it resulted in getting removed from the program because I was not ready for post-secondary education. Some people are able to cope, at that time I was unable to.\n\nA year off allows you to fully relax, and to reflect on where you want to go with your education. Just something to think about. There is nothing wrong with taking a break after your K-12 journey.",
