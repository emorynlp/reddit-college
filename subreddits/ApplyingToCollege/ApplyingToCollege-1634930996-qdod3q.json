  "text": "I was real dumb and waited till the last day of the free application week to get this done and im regretting my choices. \n\nSo the thing that\u2019s confusing me the most is the work experiences question because it\u2019s worded like this:\n\n> List your work experiences. You must provide the dates (duration) of each experience and indicate whether it was full-time, part-time, or for summer only.\n\nI know that for the common app, you can consider odd jobs as paid work, but this wording makes it seem like they want \u201cactual\u201d jobs, not things that you do for quick cash like babysitting. Should I just put stuff like babysitting and pet sitting? I did it quite often but it doesn\u2019t feel like enough to consider it a job. \n\nI would put the art commissions I do but that\u2019s something that\u2019s so spaced out and isn\u2019t a constant. If I do put it, how should I specify the dates? Is just a month and year enough (ex. 3/21)? Also because I still do them, is \u201cSince 3/21\u201d the best way to write that?",
