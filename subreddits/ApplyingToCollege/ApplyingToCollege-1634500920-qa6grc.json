  "title:": "How Do I 'Self-Report' Scores on Common-App?",
  "text": "Hey all,\n\nSo basically the question in the title. But I am just asking because it seems that I reported individual parts (two subscores, not from the same test date) of my SAT on the testing part of the common app, but it doesn't seem that \\*official\\*. Like do I not have to write in the details of my SAT? Also, is there an advantage to sending in an official report rather than self-reporting?\n\nThanks!",

However, others still require an official report prior to admission.\n\nWhen you get login credentials for the college's admission portal, go into the portal and make sure your scores were received. (There will be a list of items, with green checkmarks.)",
