      "text": "I'd reach out on the Purdue sub and see what the thoughts are of current students.  If you look at the minor in their catalog, the required classes are split across biochemistry and CS.\n\nSome of the professors in the computer science department are focused on bioinformatics and computational biology, so CS or data science seem like a reasonable option.  That's also true for the statistics department, so applied stats might make sense  -- it's a multi-disciplinary field, so there are a lot of approaches that can work.",
