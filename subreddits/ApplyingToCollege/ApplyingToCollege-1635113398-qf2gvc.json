  "text": "It's the THIRD TIME my test had not been certified because of \u201chaving another application running\u201d (despite making sure that they're all closed at least three times and disabling any add-ons)  and at this point I'm done. Has anyone appealed and received their results in response? My deadline is Nov 1st and I won't be able to take it again before that date. \n\nPS - I know that some don't require English proficiency exams; it's just that others do.",

      "text": "That\u2019s awful. Have you asked them what other application is running?  I doubt they\u2019ll reverse their decision, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to say, \u201cI checked my machine three separate times prior to taking the test and also disabled all add-ons. Is there any way for you to tell me what you think is running?  Was it on the entire time or was it something the system picked up on in the middle of the test?  Is there some diagnostic tool you would recommend to make sure nothing is running?  Because I am not seeing anything on my side and I\u2019m trying to figure out what could possibly be running that would trigger any sort of issue.\u201d",
