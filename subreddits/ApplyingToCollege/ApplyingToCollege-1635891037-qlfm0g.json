  "title:": "HELP! International with Shit ECs moves to US for Junior Year in High School.",
  "text": "Hello, I'm an international who recently who's obliged to stay in the US for my Junior year in high school due to political reasons in my poor country. I also planned on going to college here.\n\nBut there's a problem, where I come from EC's don't matter, it's all about academics, the workload there is brutal. As I moved I've realized that EC's can be the reason you can't get into top schools here even if you have good grades.  PLS help me figure out what to do ...\n\nEcs done in my country\n\nAltar boy (secretary): basically you help setup, conduct, and clean after mass. I was secretary/3rd in command and in charge of getting info about everyone and choose who would serve during Mass. I did this for a minimum of 2 days a week for all 52 weeks of the years. So like 6h/week. (I joined in 6th grade, was secretary for 9th-10th grade before I left home)\n\nClass rep 10th grade: In charge if a class of 40 students. I had to be their guide both academically and behavior, help them when they have problems, and make sure that the class is always and has all the necessary materials.\n\nCoding: Learned html and css in my free time, don't have any really good projects though. \n\nBasketball: I played for fun after school for like 2 to 3 days a week.\n\n\n\nEcs in current US high school \n\nInvestment club: i learn about investing and personal finance, 1h/week\n\nI'm thinking of joining fencing but idk if I'll like it. PLS help me, it's so stressful knowing that I'm 2 years behind everyone.\n\n*My country is not safe btw, staying after class( if there is class that is) is not a good idea unless you want to get kidnapped or something when you leave at night. (Maybe saying this can help in college app, cuz I'm not exaggerating at all, a quick Google search and you'll see that I'm making this look nice)\nSrry for making it so long.",

      "text": "No, dude, you're fine.\n\nYour story and your EC list is more rich than 95% of American high school seniors. Keep in mind that this subreddit is basically the top 1%, it's a very biased sample size of the American population.  I don't know anyone who's taught themselves to code, you did it in your past country - and I'm at the very top of my class.\n\nDon't do something just because 'it'll look good on a college application;' colleges can see right through it. Just do you, you're literally in a brand new country - focus on other things, honestly. You're good.\n\nPlus, before you focus on *any* aspect of your college applications, look into colleges first. The 'T20' schools that everyone's talking about aren't everything they're cracked up to be, in my opinion (and many others). State colleges with 50-70% acceptance rates are more than enough for a quality education. One of my friends went to a public school with a 90% acceptance rate, with SAT scores from 980 -> 1170 and is now set at a high-quality job at a Fortune 500 company right out of college. I'm not saying that you shouldn't shoot for the top schools, but it's not the end of the world if you don't get there. \n\nOne last piece of advice; I started the entire process as a senior in September, which was late, but I still got everything done for EA deadlines yesterday. Starting as a junior is okay but in your current situation you should really focus on your schooling and finding your place until later in the school year.",

          "text": "Thank you so much. You're right, maybe I'm panicking a bit too much. The things is, my parents would like me to go to a top school so I can get an amazing financial aid packet because there's no way they'll be able to afford tuition prices here while working at my home country. So yeah, that's probably the main thing bugging me and making me want to look better for college.",

              "text": "I think you're looking at the wrong aspect of it. \n\nTop colleges are still very expensive to go to, and if you're looking for a full ride it's damn near impossible. The stereotype is that they're filled to the brim with upper-class kids, so it might be smarter to focus your grades so you can get maybe even a full ride at a smaller school, which is much easier than that at a t20. Your story truly is amazing, I think you can do it if you prove yourself academically! And, even if you struggle with American academics, community college for two years (very cheap) then switching into a state school is still a lucrative option.",

      "text": "you'll be fine, there are very good state schools that dont care much for extra-curriculars (unless your grades are poor, in which case you can compensate for them with good ECs). most of the UCs and umich will care though, but look more local. transferring schools is quite common here, especially for international students or students who moved to the US very late (elon musk attended a south african uni, then a canadian one before transferring to upenn) \n\nfor top schools: you def have a good chance, just start ECs now. if the academics are as brutal as you say, you can try to qualify for US olympiads or do other ECs involving subjects you're strong in. but even if you can't, that's ok, just do ECs you enjoy.\n\nyou'll def have strong essays, just make sure to not do them last minute",
