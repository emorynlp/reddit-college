  "text": "For the last few years, Columbia has consistently been ranked in the top 5, this year tied with MIT and Harvard for 2nd place. Meanwhile, Stanford has consistently been raked out of the top 5, tied or beaten by schools like UChicago. **Isn't it time to redefine the T5 as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and** ***Columbia*****?**\n\nJust wondering y'alls thoughts. Also ik a lot of people on this sub are in Cali/SFBA, but I urge you to think from an international perspective. For example, most Europeans see YPC as right below Harvard, but don't know Stanford is that good (even if it is in reality).\n\nAlso, this sub has a LOT of bias towards computer science. **Taking a more broad, international look at top colleges, I think this T5 is fair.**\n\nThen, **T4 computer science is of course MIT, Stanford, CMU, and Berkeley.**",

      "text": "HYPSM are the five most prestigious undergraduate programs in the US because they have historically attracted the greatest share of the most accomplished students. It doesn\u2019t matter what the us news or anyone who isn\u2019t really educated on top universities thinks. Columbia is not as prestigious for undergrad not because it\u2019s not ranked high enough on some list a journalist invented, but because it doesn\u2019t effectively compete for the students who go on to be Rhodes scholars, Marshall scholars, Yale Law grads, etc when compared for HYPSM. It\u2019s  really as simple as that. Same goes for UChicago. The gap isn\u2019t big, but it\u2019s there.",

      "text": "Columbia is a great school, but they are a bit misleading when they report their statistics to ranking agencies. For example, they greatly under-report the number of undergrad students, omitting SGS (outright wrong, even by Columbia's enrollment data), Barnard (gray area), and SPS (very gray area) -- which then affects variables used for ranking like student:faculty ratio. That's not just my opinion, [even Columbia profs see all of those as undergrads and note how it has stretched the university's resources](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/undergrad/thoughts.html).\n\nFudging the numbers is not something any of the true top 5 need to do nor something they choose to do.",

The biggest difference between a place like Harvard and a place like Dartmouth is the peer group and perception as it relates to OCR. There's a reason why Harvard pops up everywhere you look when looking at big awards (Putnam, IMO, IOI, Nobel, etc.). It has about the best peer body you can find in the world. And it has a desirability far surpassing Dartmouth.\n\nNot sure why a lot of people bring the \"academic equivalence\" thing up as if the academics of a university is the reason why most people go to them.\n\n>The thing is most people on A2C are from the US, it doesn't really matter what internationals think of our schools because very few people here plan on leaving the country in the future.\n\nFair enough. Though, even within the US, I don't think Stanford has notoriety anywhere near the level of Harvard, outside of the West Coast.",

      "text": "Stanford undergrad ranking takes a hit partly due to its lower four-year graduation rate compared with peers (~75%, while the rest of HYPSM are generally in the mid to high 80s). Since graduation/retention rates make up 22% of a school\u2019s US News rank, lagging in this metric brings down Stanford\u2019s average score. Of course, folks dropping out of Stanford to found tech companies is part of what the school is known for. I don\u2019t think as many CS students are leaving Columbia or Princeton to found unicorn tech companies. \n\nAnother reason HYPSM lives on in the public mind has less to do with undergrad reputation and more to do with overall institutional brand. Yale, Stanford, and Harvard have been the best law schools for decades; Stanford and Harvard are the best business schools and two of the best med schools; and MIT and Stanford are synonymous with tech and engineering. Columbia ties Stanford in medicine but lags in everything else. As such, Stanford\u2019s institutional name continues to carry more weight than Columbia\u2019s.",
