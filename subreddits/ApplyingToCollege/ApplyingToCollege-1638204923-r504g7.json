  "text": "So Im confused cause the course on Curtin uni says something about having work experience (I have only completed my bachelors). \n\nIm hav applied to RMIT and want to apply for a similar course in other universities in Australia. \n\nI want to apply to Curtin University too, but Im not sure if the course is similar and also if its for people with work experience.\n\nHeres the link to both courses\n\nRMIT \nhttps://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/master-of-food-science-and-technology-mc237\n\nCurtin\nhttps://study.curtin.edu.au/offering/course-pg-master-of-science-food-science-and-technology--mc-foodstv3/",
