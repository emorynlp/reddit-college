  "text": "So I'm 17 and applying to college this year and the country I'm currently situated in doesn't offer schools specifically for animation, the closest there is to it is computer science which offers multimedia. I was planning on majoring in that but I was wondering if it was possible to get jobs as an animator, or how likely it is to be hired by a studio for anything to do with the actual art aspect of animation with a computer science degree?",
