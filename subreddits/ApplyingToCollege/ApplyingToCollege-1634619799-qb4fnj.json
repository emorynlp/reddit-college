  "title:": "Creepy: Found this old AMA thread for Minerva University. All of the accounts are fake.",
  "text": "Okay first of all, I got 0 skin in this game. I'm a freshman in college somewhere else and I've never considered nor applied to Minerva. I only really got to know what Minerva was after reading [this](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-minerva-delusion/) article, which I highly recommend y'all read. The skinny on it is that Minerva is this bay area \"nonprofit\" educational startup that aims to provide an education to those students that top schools like HYP missed (and rejected), yet they have an acceptance rate that's technically even lower than Harvard or Stanford.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I went down the rabbithole and found this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2w4l3s/we_are_founding_class_students_at_minerva_a/). It seems like a normal AMA... right? Except when you click on their accounts. Almost every single one of them has posted a single comment, which is the one on the AMA. When you take a closer look at the questions, they seem super generic and easy questions. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it seems that the official minerva school account created a bunch of fake accounts to ask questions. If you take a look at its other threads, there are similarly an amount of \"fake\" accounts, though there are some genuine questions. \n\nJust an interesting note I'd thought to share and another reason to be wary about this school. Don't apply to Minerva! It's sketchy af.",

Who else talks that way? Never mind the excessive stroking of \u2728Ben's\u2728 ego; I'm sure that isn't a clue who wrote most of the text.

      "text": "Just a heads up, Minerva was super sketch in its beginning (really weird vibe, for-profit, artificially lowering acceptance rates through fake data, and I guess now fake AMAs) but very recently it has become a legit college. They've been fully accredited and are non-profit (they have a for-profit for some software). \n\nI personally wouldn't recommend it because it only appeals to a certain type of people: the people who think college education is a scam and would rather start a business (or already have businesses). It does have its merits though.\n\n* Rotating living between 6\\~7 countries. (pretty unique experience)\n* Fully online (fitting for the covid situation, as well as provides a lot of flexibility)\n* Classes are discussion-based, kind of like a socratic seminar\n* Potential to gain a lot of connections (a lot of rich students, plus the school is founded by a businessman (went to wharton). \n\nEssentially if you question the current higher education system, are fairly well-off, want to start or already have a business, fine with online classes, can talk/discuss a lot, and want to have a unique experience, then Minerva is for you. If not, don't apply.\n\nSource: A friend attends",
