  "text": "like logically i know i have a good safety and i\u2019ll be fine but i suddenly panicked and applied to 3 more schools, including another safety. i just copy pasted the relevant essay supps, edited right in the text box, and submitted lol. \n\nit\u2019s for piece of mind bc the safety is rolling so i\u2019ll feel secure and then the other two schools EA release decisions in january so i probably won\u2019t get rejected everywhere EA and freak out",
