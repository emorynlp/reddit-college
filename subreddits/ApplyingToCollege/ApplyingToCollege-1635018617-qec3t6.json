If they're recruited to play a sport at Dartmouth, their app will also be in a completely different \"bin\" or \"pile\" from yours. I had a lot of very artsy classmates at school who were not sports people and Dartmouth really values those folks to contribute to the liberal arts community",

But if your tour guide was an athlete, that may have been why they put such an emphasis on sports. As for the \"whole frat preppy white guy stereotype,\" it's an anachronistic stereotype that's stuck around. Greek life is big and the school is working on its diversity, but that doesn't apply to most kids I'd say",
