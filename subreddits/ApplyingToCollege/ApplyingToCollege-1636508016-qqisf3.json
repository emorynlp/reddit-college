  "title:": "How should I address this? Hospitalization led to terrible grades.",
  "text": "In my freshman and Sophomore years of high-school I had terrible grades because I had horrible mental health. My self-esteem was nonexistent and I contemplated suicide regularly and had to be hospitalized at a psych ward several times because of it. I'm currently seeing a therapist and I have gotten much better. I'm a Junior now and I currently have As in all of my classes. I took the PSAT and am projected to do very well ( At least a score of 1450 ) but I know my GPA won't be competitive for college admissions. My question is should I try to explain why I did so poorly, and if so how? I know many colleges see depression as a massive red flag and I could be seen as a liability to admit.",
