  "text": "Ok it\u2019s not this bad but me and my dad have been in a disagreement in what I should major in. He really wants me to major in chem engineering and I want to major in biochemistry. I know that engineering has a positive outlook after college and good pay right out of college but I don\u2019t know if I can handle the intensity and competitiveness if I\u2019m not extremely interested in the subject. On the other hand, I have more of a stable interest in biochem and and very passionate about research in biochem but the future job growth seems to be not as great and finding a job after bachelors seems to be harder without a masters or doctorate. It\u2019s kind of too late anyway cause I already applied to biochem in a majority of universities I applied to but I can also petition to change it now and I have been very anxious about it because I don\u2019t want to ruin my future by choosing the wrong major. Any advice is greatly appreciated :)",

      "text": "For most schools, especially private ones I think, changing majors should be relatively easier. You should check how easy it is to change major in the schools you are applying to, but usually, it's not that big of a deal. I think you should go with your choice, since you're passionate about it. :)",

      "text": "First, you should pursue whatever major interests you the most. Regardless of what others want you to do, your own mental stability during college and how happy you are in whatever field you choose are much more important. Also, many colleges afford you the opportunity to switch majors within you first year, so if you feel the need to swap to another major, that option may be available even when you are in college (depending on the college). In my opinion, there\u2019s no need to stress about changing your major at this very moment as you may be able to change it at a later date if needed, and as long as your are interested in the major you\u2019re applying to, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.",
