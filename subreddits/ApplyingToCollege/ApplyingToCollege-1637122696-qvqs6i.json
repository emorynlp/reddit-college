  "text": "Declared cs during spring of freshman year. 2nd year I took a gap semester to intern at a tech company and skip some covid school. I've been enrolled in both lower and upper division cs classes. AMA, I'll keep my answers brief. Ex:\n\nDorms - Overpriced (2k/month, food included), but good social experience. Most don't return after freshman year because 1. they found cheaper/better housing 2. not many can get dorms after freshman year. \n\nFood - Cafe food is mediocre buffet quality for 7 per meal. Local food is like 7-14 a meal, but very good and diverse. Not as many fast food options.\n\nStress - Not very stressed but only because I've been purposefully taking a lighter courseload.\n\nClasses - Kinda meh. Content and homework are high quality but sometimes professors are boring to listen to. You also will be waitlisted for more niche upper division classes. Usually you'll be able to enroll but sometimes you'll have to take different classes than what you planned for.",

          "text": "> How hard is it to declare a CS major\n\nI thought it wasn't that bad. If you take all the classes separately, then have a schedule that you can handle, you have a very good chance of declaring. Still, I *think* roughly 40% of people can't declare. If you don't declare and you're interested in data science, you can major in data science and still have a very lucrative career. Avg salary of a DS major grad in 2020 was ~105k, and if you know anything about tech, then you'd know that this is missing a huge chunk of equity per year which would be around +20 to 40/yr.\n\n> How hard is it to graduate in four years?\n\nEasier than declaring. The cs requirements are very light and flexible, so that if you take 2 or sometimes 3 cs classes a semester, you can graduate in 3 years.",

I have no interest in EE but I don't know if the cons of taking 3 EE classes outweigh the pros of avoiding the GPA req.\n\nDo CS and EECS kids intermingle in and out of classes? I guess I'm trying to see if EECS is really regarded more highly than CS around campus.",

From what I\u2019ve seen so far, not really any difference between EECS and CS. In fact (this is a limited sample) my friends in LSCS are more academically outgoing than those in EECS.\n\nSocially as well I feel like we\u2019re the same? We have nearly the same exact opportunities and in fact we even take the same EE courses.\n\nAs for the GPA Rec, for me it\u2019s personally been straightforward, but then again, it depends on a person to person basis. I\u2019ve had some friends declare freshman year summer taking all three classes at once and some who pace it out to 1+1+1. The perceived difficulty depends on ofc on one\u2019s background and is super individual but I think it\u2019s doable with planning and persistence",

I believe a stronger consideration is admissions. If you believe you are smart but you don't have the strongest application, go CS. If you have a strong application, and you're ok with lower chances, ie, you believe you'll get into other good schools, go EECS.",
