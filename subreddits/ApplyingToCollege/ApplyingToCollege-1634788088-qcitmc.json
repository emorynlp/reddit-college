  "title:": "Pitt's TOEFL Requirement as an International First-year",
  "text": "im applying to Pitt as a first year international student. on their website they said that the TOEFL requirement can be waived if you have an SAT over 660 (I have a 780, I also go to a school where english is the primary language of instruction). BUT it says it's done on a CASE BY CASE basis. The website however doesn't offer anyway to apply for this waiver. So I'm confused as to whether or not I should contact the AOs or just wait and see if they ask for my TOEFL score.",
