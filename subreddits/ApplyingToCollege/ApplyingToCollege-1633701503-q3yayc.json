  "text": "Our college recently changed their Programme manager and I as a student looking to apply to universities this fall meaning I would have to go through him but since he has been there for only two months and he barely knows us. I am skeptical if I should be going through him or not and We don't have a guidance counselor so the programme manager is looking after the admission process of our juniors as well, would it be valid if we go through our College administrator who has known us for 3 years for college application process. All the documents and the student profile will be with correspondence to the programme manager.",
