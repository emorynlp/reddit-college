  "title:": "STOP pushing \"sob stories\"",
  "text": "Edit: Wow this got popular! My goal is to respond to everyone's questions by about 10pm Pacific on Monday. Thanks for your patience.\n\nI've seen this sentiment circulating around here and some sister subs so instead of just making a dozen comments, I'm going to post this.\n\nIn response to anyone saying things like \"admissions officers love 'trauma porn' \" or \"sob stories are the way to go, anyone saying otherwise is lying\" or anything else disgusting like that: No. \n\nNobody cares about your \"sob story\". I've been in the college amissions game for 8 years, first in Cal's Admissions office, then in the private sector.\nI am so sick of hearing all this entitled, unqualified, ignorant nonsense.\n\nIf someone chooses to write about overcoming obstacles - and I've gotten numerous students into Ivies and flagship public schools (UMich, Berkeley, etc ) without them doing so- the focus needs to be on the skills the student gained from OVERCOMING said obstacle, not some \"sob story\" nonsense. \n\nAre you a skeptical cynic? Well then, think of it this way, nobody, I mean NOBODY, is going to admit you because they feel bad for you. Nobody reading your app could give half a clipped toenail about your personal circumstances unless they think those circumstances have made you a valuable asset to their school. \n\nHere's WHY students with shocking backstories get in to colleges. Because they became mothertrucking b*d*sses from it.\n\nIn research and in your professional life, spaghetti is gonna hit the fan all the time. Didn't get a research grant? Great, how are you going to get a new one or do without? You know what a good parallel for that is? Resourcefulness in the face of childhood poverty as a first gen college  student, as you figure out how to apply for food stamps and the FAFSA all on your own while your dad is outside the trailer drunk with the boys again.\n\nYour undergrad minions all caught COVID and now they can't  ZOOM Interview research subjects? Great, how are you gonna juggle all that? Maybe with similar time management skills you developed having to work 20 hours a week in minimum wage jobs after school while maintaining a 3.8 and being president of your school's speech and debate team.\n\nYou're in residency and dealing with some very recalcitrant patients. You think back to when you were translating for your diabetic mother who couldn't speak English much less read an English nutrition label. You remember what you did that finally got her to listen and try the same type of empathy and understanding on your patients. They finally start getting it.\n\nOr maybe you think back to when you were bullied because of an autoimmune disorder that had some unsightly physical effects and made you weak. You think about how you got through that, no way in heck you can't get through the disappointment of getting a C your first OChem midterm. You study your butt off and pass with a B (not great, but there's legit hundreds of thousands of doctors who still became doctors with a B or even a C in OChem. It's OCHEM.).\n\nI could go on and on and on.\n\nSo many kids who have never faced anything remotely like hardships or setbacks CRUMBLE in these kinds of situations because they've never had to pick themselves up and wipe all the mud and blood off themselves. Resilience, tenacity, resourcefulness, determination, perseverance, ALL of these are qualities that are key for success in the real world. Colleges WANT PROOF of that. The ability to APPLY your smarts is just as important as being smart. That's why 4.0s with zero proof of life skills are sometimes rejected over super capable 3.7s.\n\nSure, a couple spitheads might slip through the cracks and get in with a pity essay - that was likely because they had a really strong rest of their app, or they're just really good a BSing. One shyster succeeding with crap isn't enough to endorse the sob story method. Plus,  most of those people  flunk out and wind up working a pity job at their daddy's company or minimum wage somewhere else. \n\nNobody cares about how hard you had it if you didn't develop some valuable skills because of your experiences. We hate sob stories that are clearly looking for pity instead of narratives of overcoming obstacles that prove how powerful the applicant is.",

There was no farm. We live in an area where the average household income is over $150k & families making $80k or less qualify for \"low-income\" housing.\n\nCornell accepted him, and then once he got there, he switched into his desired major.\n\nI still don't know whether to be impressed or mad.",

As you said, it is not pity that makes them effective (when they do work), its because they show resilience, grit, or other positive qualities.\n\nTo put this in perspective, ask yourself - would you date someone you otherwise wouldn't be interested in just because they had a tragic story?  No.  You would feel bad, and you might try to help, but you wouldn't hitch your wagons to that person out of pity.  Same goes for job interviews - companies don't really care about how badly you need the job, how hard your life has been, etc.  They care about the value you can produce, the skillset you have, and your ability to succeed in the role.\n\nThis is the same for colleges.",

This would just be you giving us the information we need so we can stop scratching our heads. We won't think you can't handle it if you've proved yourself elsewhere by succeeding in your grades and ECs.\n\nWherever you wind up, you might want to look into the schools DSP (disabled student program) services. You have rights, and if things do get tricky while in school, you can potentially appeal for a reduced course load on the basis of your narcolepsy. That doesn't mean you can't handle the school or don't have valuable contributions to make, it just means that if push comes to shove, it's better to have DSP protection in case you need to be a part-time student.",

      "text": "Couldn\u2019t agree more. If anyone wants to see what not to do in an adversity essay, look up examples on College Confidential (also... never post your essay online.) \n\nOP (or anyone,) would you mind giving some advice to a student who has overcome significant challenges, but hasn\u2019t necessarily done anything extraordinary? I was raised by heroin addicts for the majority of my childhood before being forcibly removed from the home. After that, I went through six families and thirteen schools before graduation. I often lived out of bags and slept on couches. It sucked! \n\nNow I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019m finishing up my AA. I\u2019ve worked full time to support myself during college, and recently I\u2019ve assumed the role of caretaker for my infant sibling about 30% of the time. My free time is scarce. I have virtually no EC\u2019s\u2014no internships, no clubs, no research experience (although I can\u2019t say things would be much different if I didn\u2019t have work, seeing that my CC is tiny.) I\u2019m starting my transfer applications and all l have on paper is a 4.0, a couple of jobs, and solid time management skills. But I can\u2019t express how proud of myself I am. And while I don\u2019t love placing myself into the \u201cchild of a junkie\u201d box, it just feels *wrong* to completely omit something that had such a profound impact on my development and that spurred what I considered to be my greatest asset: grit. \n\nI guess my question is, can \u201cextraordinary\u201d performance be relative to a student\u2019s circumstances? Or should I bite the bullet and explore a different avenue for my essay? Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated.",

          "text": "I think that this can be a viable topic, and you don't need to place yourself into the \"child of a junkie\" box nor do you need traditional ECs, especially as a transfer student. Your work experience means a lot, and succeeding in your work counts for more than most clubs. When it's a paying job you can get fired from, everyone knows you're held to a much higher standard and you need to be actually involved. What are you interested in majoring in?  \nDon't omit your story, as you said, this gave you grit.  I would love to read this essay, you've put your money where your mouth is and managed to juggle work, caretaking, and still get a 4.0. This is a narrative of overcoming obstacles, not a sob story.  It's not so much that \"extraordinary performance\" is relative to a student's circumstances, it's that the criteria used to define extraordinary may expand or be different.  You have levels of self-sufficiency and resilience that most people don't - I'd trust you to, even if you don't have research experience, jump at the chance once that resource was offered to you and excel at it.  You already had to navigate everything else on your own, be reliable, handle multiple stressors, you've proved a lot of crucial qualities in a non-traditional way, because those were the cards life dealt you. Another applicant who had a much easier time navigating things and didn't have to work would then need to do something else to prove those same qualities to me, in their case maybe that would be excelling at science olympiad and being a leader on the team, or a collection of other activities.  \nAs I mentioned before, we need people who can produce results in the real world, not just  people who can be smart under ideal circumstances.  \nFeel free to PM me if you have draft up and running or if you have more questions.  \nI hope that helped, I'm on like 3 hours of sleep so if I sound a little rambly that's why.",

It's just what a lot of people who are such crummy applicants they think everyone else must just be getting in off of pity call narratives of overcoming obstacles. In your case, you're definitely in the overcoming obstacles camp.  Talking about putting school on pause in favor of working and experiencing life is fine, especially since you've had to manage a small business! You can talk about how those experiences made you stronger and a more valuable applicant, that alone makes sense.

          "text": " The content of this comment may be triggering for some readers.\n\nThere's not really a clean answer on this one. It's not uniform, and it's not always discouraged because of a liability issue. Sadly at this point I think a lot of colleges figure at least some of their students are going to commit suicide, even if they wrote perfectly happy essays. Especially the premeds, the suicide rate for prehealth students tends to be higher, rates of suicide for those in med school, residency, and practicing physicians is higher than many other occupations (I need to dig through my files to find the articles on this, I heard about this issue during a lecture at a conference not too long ago).\nBut I digress. Sometimes it's because of implicit bias against people with mental health issues, whether or not the Admissions Committee thinks they'll commit suicide while in college. \n\nIf however, a mental health issue has caused a huge impact on your grades or participation in ECs, I'd reccomend mentioning the issue and approaching the topic VERY CAREFULLY. It's crucial to show resilience and a willingness to seek resources. You definitely need to make it sound like that was in the past and you've recovered and through therapy or meds or whatnot, you're \"all better now\". Is that how it ever works when it comes to mental health? Yeah no, not really, but if you do wind up needing to talk about this somewhere in your app, and I'd avoid doing so unless it's *absolutely* necessary, you do really need to emphasize that you're ok now.\n\nGetting into the gray area of like \"sometimes I still struggle with X but I feel like I'm regaining more control every day\" is going to muddle things a lot more than like \"It's been 2 years since I self-harmed, thanks to therapy that helped me process X trauma. My personal experiences with Y diagnosis have made me passionate about psychology and public health. I started a mental health awareness program at my school to help destigmatize seeking resources in our community. This past year we've [name some quantified impact]\"\n\nIt would be great if I could give a nice neat answer to this, but it's not quite that simple.\nIf it's something that has severely impacted your HS career, talk about it VERY CAREFULLY.\nIf you don't have to talk about it to explain a dip in grades, I'd avoid talking about it. Everyone is so much more than a diagnosis, write about other things in your life and other interests.\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "I'm not sure if you're still taking questions but this has been weighing heavily on my mind  since I'm beginning to plan for transferring to a four-year.\n\nI'm a non-traditional student who graduated hs twelve years ago. I experienced ongoing emotional abuse from early childhood into adulthood, my last year of high school through freshman year was in two emotionally abusive relationships, and experienced another significant trauma I don't feel comfortable describing here. I also had ADHD that was not diagnosed until the age of 26 which I believe also significantly impacted my performance. As a result of all this, my grades in the latter half of high school took a hit, I never took my SATs and ACT, dropped my ECs, became isolated from my friends and family, and I ended up with almost exclusively Ws and Fs my freshman year which I am still recovering from academically. I intend NOT to use this as a sob story but to give explanation for my poor grades. I had a child in 2016 and stayed home with him until he was two when I re-enrolled in CC with what I believe was less than a 1.0 and have admittedly faced difficulty maintaining my grades while parenting, participating in ECs, and working. I have raised my GPA to 2.7 making mostly As and Bs with a few Cs and working to replace all the Fs from before. I'm going to receive my Associate of Science this fall with one more science class, which I intend to take as my ultimate goal is to major in Marine Biology at (I am praying) a CSU or a UC, both of which I realize are huge reaches with my grades.\n\nI'm just not sure how to write about any of this without it seeming like a grab for sympathy or how to connect it to my desire to study Marine Bio. I'm also quite frankly feeling discouraged by the whole process because I've been busting my ass for two years and still have a GPA incongruent with my ambitions, which ultimately I think hurts my chances at demonstrating  resilience if I'm relentlessly critical of what successes I HAVE had, if that makes sense.",
