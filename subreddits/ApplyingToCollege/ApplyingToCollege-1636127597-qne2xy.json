  "text": "Hey everyone, UC App Time is upon us, so let's get to it! Please share any advice you have learned from applying or going to info sessions on your own. \n\n# First, some general tips about the UC application:\n\n\ud83d\udcbbThis is from the UCs themselves: When creating your UC account, you should choose one email address and stick with it throughout the entire application cycle. School email addresses aren't recommended due to how they tend to shut down after you graduate and the UCs may need to reach out to you the summer before you start college. Some school email addresses may also block the UC schools' emails. Once you choose an email address, make sure to check your inbox and spam folders regularly for any important information.\n\n\u23f0 You've got a few weeks, so make these PIQs as strong as you can. You have until November 3**0 at 11:59 PM Pacific Standard Time**, regardless of your time zone. This doesn't mean you should wait until the last minute. The UC website could crash, your credit card could have issues, your dog will get sick, your internet will go out, a thunderstorm could hit and knock a tree into your house, of course there\u2019s always the potential for a zombie attack, or your computer could lag\u2014it's just not worth the risk.  Did y'all see all the things that went wrong in the last hour or so of submission for the Nov 1 Deadline on Common App? It wasn't pretty. \n\n# I recently went to some UC info sessions and learned some great stuff about the PIQs. Here's what they said:\n\n* PIQs are NOT essays. They are answers to questions.\n* They want NO style. To them, it detracts from your message.\n* Focus on Content; Make sense, not style\n* They want you to TELL - not show\n* Use your voice to answer the 6 W's (who, what, when, why, where, and how)\n* Who you are, what you've you've done, and why you've done it\n* They are looking for: Clarity, Depth, Context\n\n# \ud83d\ude0aHere\u2019s the list of what they do want:\n\n* **EXAMPLES AND DETAILS:** provide written examples that show a sense of who you are. Recent events are preferable as they're closer to who you are today.\n* **USE LOTS OF \"I\" STATEMENTS:** the UCs use PIQs to learn more about you. Using \"I\" and \"my\" statements will help you better express your personality and accomplishments.\n* **BE ORGANIZED:** Your answers should have a flow to them. It should be easy to track the point you're trying to convey. Make sure that your answers would make sense to someone that's never met you before.\n* **STRAIGHT UP ANSWERS:** Just pretend like you're sitting and having a chat with them and telling them like it is.\n* **PERSONAL EXPERIENCES:** They want to know about you, so share your life.\n* **SELF-REFLECTION:** Look within. Give them some commentary and analysis about why things are significant to you. Share the \"so what?\"\n* **CONNECT THE DOTS:** \\-- explain the significance of the stories and experiences you're sharing\n* **ONE PARAGRAPH:** Don't do fancy formatting or bullet points. It doesn't translate in the app.\n\n# \ud83e\udd13Be sure to:\n\n* **PROOFREAD AND EDIT:** It's important to double-check your answers before submitting them. While the UCs say that they won't mark you down for any grammatical errors, those errors can be distracting to anyone reading your responses.\n* **ASK FOR FEEDBACK:** While editing, there's always a chance that you may miss an error or two. That's why asking someone else to look over your work can be helpful. Ask them to check for grammar, sentence structure, and flow.\n* **RELAX:** The PIQs are not the only piece of information the UCs use to review your application. Try your best and you'll do great!\n\n# \ud83d\ude21Here\u2019s the list of things they hate:\n\n* **TALKING ABOUT ONE CAMPUS:** Your PIQ responses will go out to all the UC campuses you applied to. You don't want to focus on just one school when they're all going to be reviewing your application.\n* **CREATIVE WRITING:** Poems, cliches, etc.\u2014the UCs would like you to get straight to the point.\n* **QUOTATIONS:** Whether it's a famous quote or a song lyric, it's a nope. All of the words you use in your responses should be your own.\n* **GENERALITIES:** Generalities aren't very useful. They don't help show who you are. Use specific examples about your experiences.\n* **ACRONYMS:** Not every acronym is as well known as you might think. It's better to spell them out.\n* **REPETITION:** Don't discuss things that can be found in other parts of your applications. Bring in new information\n\n# \ud83d\ude31More Stuff They Say They Hate:\n\n* PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS\n* LITERARY DESCRIPTION\n* ATTEMPTS TO ENTERTAIN OR ADD HUMOR\n* HOOKS\n* BULLET POINTS OR OTHER FORMATTING\n* METAPHORS and ANALOGIES\n* DIALOGUE\n\n# \ud83d\udcddNotes about the Covid Update\n\nIf you've experienced hardships due to the pandemic, don't hesitate to share with them. They want to know about things like internet issues, whether or not you had sufficient space to work at home, your home responsibilities, outside jobs you might have needed to take to help support your family, and any Covid related illnesses you or your family might have experienced.\n\nIn particular, they want to know your grades, ECs, and activities might have been affected, changed, or adjusted.\n\n# \ud83d\udd25Additional Comments Section\n\nThe additional comments section is a completely optional section with a 550-word limit. You can clarify information about an award or activity, talk about any circumstances you've faced, or discuss anything that you haven't had a chance to talk about elsewhere in your application. However, you should not use this section to continue your personal insight questions. Be sure to check out their website for more information.\n\n# \ud83d\ude31Here's a whole pile of UC Resources for you\n\n**Be sure to go watch this video and read this info from the UC Apply site:**\n\n[https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html)\n\n[https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-transfer/personal-insight-questions.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-transfer/personal-insight-questions.html)\n\n**And here\u2019s what UCLA says about how they evaluate freshman apps:**[ https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/freshman/freshman-requirements/application-review-process](https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/freshman/freshman-requirements/application-review-process)\n\n[https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html)\n\n**More places to go learn more:**\n\n[https://admissions.berkeley.edu/personal-insight-questions](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/personal-insight-questions)\n\n[https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/personal-insight-questions](https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/personal-insight-questions)\n\n[https://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/virtual-admissions-events](https://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/virtual-admissions-events)\n\n[https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html)\n\n**UC for You** \u2014 **Non-California residents and International** **students** will be held on **November 6** from 8:00 \u2014 10:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.

For some students this is significantly easier than the \"UChicago style\" essays.  For others it's a struggle.  If you want a framework for tackling these that has worked ridiculously well for my students, think in terms of breaking your response into three parts - the Answer, the Evidence, and the Interpretation.  Usually by the time you've finished each of those, you're pretty close to 350 words.\n\nIf you want info on what this looks like and how to use it, here's a post with more details:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dfawfe/a_short_guide_to_short_essays/",

A few had dialogue, and all of them were multiple paragraphs. One of them kind of had an overarching metaphor I think, but I\u2019d have to re-read it.\n\nPoint being that while I believe these guideline (which I am hearing for the first time) are probably important, from my own experience, I feel like you shouldn\u2019t stress *too* hard about them. If your writing is good, it\u2019s good. Idk maybe the rest of my application was just really strong, but I\u2019d like to thing my essays were decent as well.",

          "text": "That\u2019s awesome. This is just a perfect example of how students can\u2019t rely on individual experiences when creating their applications, but they need to do a lot of research and learn from many people. It makes it so much more confusing for the process but worth it for them.  All I\u2019m doing is relaying what I hear from UC admissions at various webinars and info\nSessions for both counselors and applicants.  And I also spend a lot of time reading their resources they make available. My students who\u2019ve applied have also had a lot of success with the UCs writing in a much more straightforward way.  \n\nAlso don\u2019t forget one persons idea of creative might be another\u2019s idea of matter of fact.  But as long as you answer their questions I think you\u2019re in good shape.",
