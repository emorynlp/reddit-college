  "text": "Hey, so I\u2019m a freshman in IB MYP who\u2019s taking physics chemistry biology maths extended english spanish and history.\n\nThe three-science combo plus extended maths and one of the more difficult humanities is considered one of the more intensive subject choices in the MYP.\n\nI\u2019m scoring well in everything apart from history - i just dont get the subject and struggled to get my grade up from a 5/7 to a 6/7 for the upcoming midyear reports.\n\nIts practically impossible for me to get a 7 unless I ace (legit 100%) every upcoming test until around march. \n\nRight now, though, they\u2019ve given us the option to change subjects, and I\u2019m not sure what to do and where to go if I decide I wanna drop history.\n\nIf I do drop history, I have a choice between Business, Econ and Geo. I despise geo and its the subject that ppl take for an easy 7. Similar situation with business, except I wanna take it but the teachers absolutely hate me. Econ is fun but way too difficult.\n\nI\u2019d rank (from hardest to easiest) the subjects as econ, history, business and geo.\n\nIn terms of interest (from most interested to least) econ, business, history, geo\n\nWhat do I do?",
