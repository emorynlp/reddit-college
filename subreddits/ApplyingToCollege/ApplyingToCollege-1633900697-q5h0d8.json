  "text": "I\u2019m interested in public policy and poli sci(though less than I am in public policy) and have also thought about going into law school or business after college. I know that in terms of internships SFS is unique in that it is in DC, but I also am not that interested in international relations, which I know Georgetown is more focused on. I like the locations of both schools and the social aspects of both(more so for Duke). Based on the academics of the schools, which should be my first choice?",
