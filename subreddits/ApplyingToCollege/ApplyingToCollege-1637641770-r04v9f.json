      "text": "It depends on the stage of each process. Biofuel growing might be something like Crop Science or plant biotech. Refining the raw plant to fuel is CHBE, but designing the robot is MechE. AI is either Data Science, systems E or CS. \n\nLike you should check out the course catalogs for electives at any school you are interested in. Also if you are really interested in Biofuels I would recommend checking out Iowa State. And this [website](https://genomicscience.energy.gov/centers/). Since being next to a campus with one of these could help your cause. Schools: UIUC, UC Berkley, UW-Madison, Michigan State, and something in Tennessee.",
