  "text": "I was talking to my friend today about where I thinking about applying next year and I said that I would apply to one of the Ivy League, probably Harvard, for \u201cfun\u201d. I didn\u2019t actually mean for fun, but I know that my chances are small of getting in because I am not the top top student but I have a great resume and great grades. My friend told me that I shouldn\u2019t apply to any Ivy Leagues if I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get in. If I was to get into an Ivy, I would go to that Ivy. What do you all think?",

Would you go to any of the other Ivies that have slightly higher acceptance rates if you got in?\n\nObviously, the cost and time to write additional essays/supplements has to be factored in.  But if you are going to go for it, then you might as well consider other options.\n\nEven for highly qualified applicants, you have to apply to multiple reach schools as there are no guarantees of admission for anyone (without a true hook) so your best bet is to at least try for many.  In other words, the same stats/person might get into one but not the other (and vice versa for a person of similar makeup) for no apparent reason.",

No one can and should stop you. College admissions are a crapshoot. There is a very very small minority of people who are >90% likely to get admitted to an Ivy, and these are the sorts who bag a $250,000 scholarship on a global competition - but the majority of T20 students are nowhere near that level. \n\nGood luck, hope you get into a decent school (or perhaps an ivy!)",
