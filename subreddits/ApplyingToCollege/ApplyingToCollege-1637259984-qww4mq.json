  "text": "\nI did choir concerts in some of the most important Opera Festivals in Europe and numerous solo concerts in important theatres of my country. \n\nToday, I recorded my music supplement and it came out okay, but not perfect\u2026 Should I submit it? (please take into account that the music supplements consists of a resum\u00e9 and a 10 minutes recording; so if I don\u2019t sent the recording, I can\u2019t send the resum\u00e9 either).\n\nThank you in advance!",
