      "text": "Hope you're doing well, OP!  When I applied to Rice, I struggled with what to put in the Box too, so I totally get where you're coming from.  My personal recommendation is to put a picture you really love that you think says something about you.  I ended up submitting a photo of a former high school classmate of mine and me coincidentally dressing up for Halloween at school because I had a great time doing it.  \n\nI hope this helped, and I wish you the best with your Rice application!\n\nHave a nice day!",
