  "title:": "Should I send an email to the AOs explaining my mistake?",
  "text": "In my supplementary essays for UF and Purdue, I mentioned only being able to attain certification upto level 5 in the EC I wrote about. However, I actually attained level 6 certification, and accidentally typed and sent the wrong number last minute. I've mentioned having level 6 certification in my activities section, and am worried about the inconsistency.\n\n Will the AOs think I'm lying in the essay and punish me for it, or will they be able to guess what happened? \n\nBy sending them an email explaining this situation, I risk a) Bringing attention to the mistake, and making it look like I'm lying\nb) Making them think I did my whole application last minute\n\nSo I'm really confused. What should I do? Do I send them an email or not?",
