I stg every once in a while I pull it out to read in my head, and catch myself grinning from ear to ear. \n\nSo, to the admissions officer who rejects or accepts me after reading it, I don\u2019t care what your feelings are on my essay because I am super pleased with it how it turned out!!! \n\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to make anyone else feel bad on here!! I spent months working on it and I just want to express my feelings :))",
