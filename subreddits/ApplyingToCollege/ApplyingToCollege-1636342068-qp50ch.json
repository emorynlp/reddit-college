  "text": "I followed all the colleges I'm applying to on Instagram to 1. get those sweet sweet demonstrated interest points and 2. to yearn after pictures of campuses I will probably never set foot on. I did this probably back in April or May. Keep this in mind.\n\nI don't really use Instagram, so when I randomly scrolled through, my feed was pretty much just full of college posts. You know, the standard campus beauty shots, pictures of diverse students in labs and classrooms, that sort of thing. Except for this one college. This particular college decided to post exclusively photos of their new merch. I'd be scrolling through, looking at lovely nature views and trying to astral project myself there, when the next photo would be a crew neck or a T-shirt emblazoned with this college's name. Honestly, they didn't even look that much like other college merch. They had weird block designs and odd color choices, but they weren't *too* weird.\n\nI'd sigh and scroll on. I really didn't care about their new merch. Especially when there was *so much* of it. Seriously, they seemed to release a new design every single day with the amount of posts they were making. They clogged up my feed and annoyed me every time I saw them, but of course I couldn't unfollow them. Those sweet sweet demonstrated interest points, and also I was too lazy to click the unfollow button. So I continued to see their new merch posts every single time I went on Instagram, and I continued to sigh in annoyance.\n\nUntil finally I got so annoyed I actually went to unfollow them. That was when I discovered that I hadn't actually been following the college at all. I'd been following a fucking fashion page that had the same exact name as the college. No fucking wonder they'd been posting new merch\u2014they were posting their literal products. And here I was thinking this college just dropped new merch every single day for the hell of it.\n\nI have literally been following them since April. This is the stupidest I've ever felt in my life.",
