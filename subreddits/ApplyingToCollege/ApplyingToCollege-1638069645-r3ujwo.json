  "title:": "Should I switch Duke to RD?",
  "text": "So basically I had my interview with Duke and thought I was good with Duke ED, but then had MIT interview and started liking MIT a little more. I thought my mom would be against switching Duke to RD (me going to Duke has been her dream forever), but she said she was good with whatever I wanted. I know there's only like a very very very very very small chance that I get into both, but in the event that it does happen I'd have to go to Duke instead of MIT if I was accepted. If I switch I wouldn't have to worry about this, but at the same time I'd be lowering my chances of getting into a school that I also like a lot and possibly for no at all. So basically I'd feel major regret if I switch Duke RD and get rejected from MIT which is highly likely to happen, but if I stayed and got into both which is highly unlikely to happen I'd feel super bad. \n\nI kind of just wanted to see what other people think.\n\nedit: so its not getting rejected that's bothering me, it's more of the feeling that i may end up shooting myself in the leg no matter what i do.\n\nedit: yeah you guys are totally right. i'm literally jumping the gun for something that has like less than a one percent chance of even happening.",

      "text": "Okay, a lot of people like to say that you should only ED to a school if you are 100% committed to that school.\n\nThis might be considered controversial, but personally if you started \u201cliking MIT a little bit more,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t be enough for me to switch my ED. MIT\u2019s acceptance rate is 4.1% overall (5.0% for EA and 2.1% for RD). You can find this data [here](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/)\n\nDuke\u2019s ED admit rate is 16.7% [(data here)](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/12/duke-university-early-decision-acceptance-rate-lowest-history-record-applications-class-2025). This is a massive boost from MIT\u2019s admit rate. You have a significantly higher chance to get into Duke as an ED applicant, while Duke\u2019s RD admit rate is 4.3% [link here](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2021/04/duke-regular-decision-application-decisions-record).\n\nThe reality is that if you do not apply ED to Duke, your chances into getting into none of the two schools is very high. Whereas getting into Duke ED is three times as likely. I don\u2019t want to influence your decision per se, but just want to lay all the cards out on the table. How disappointed would you be if you got into neither of these schools, compared with having to rescind your MIT application if you got into Duke? Be aware that your changes are low regardless, and it is definitely possible that you don\u2019t get into either of these schools.\n\nYou have to decide where your priorities lie, I wish you luck! I know how hard the college app experience can be.",

          "text": "Everything ablaha51 said is spot on.  I think if you switch Duke to RD and try to switch MIT to EA, the most likely scenario will be you do not get into either one \u2026 even if you have a stellar application.  \n\nIt will definitely lower your chances at Duke, and your chances at MIT will go from extremely unlikely \u2026 to extremely unlikely.  This past year, my next door neighbor\u2019s daughter applied ED to a certain prestigious T20 university \u2026. got deferred and then denied \u2026.but got into MIT RD.  \n\nYou never know what is going to happen, but I wouldn\u2019t change your plans now.  If you get into Duke ED, promise yourself you will work hard to get yourself into MIT (or a similar top 5 university) for grad school (if you decide to pursue grad school).",

      "text": "i wouldnt. unless going to duke would make you unhappy. only because if i were you i wouldn\u2019t want to risk not getting into either since you have a lower chance when u apply ED. So if you still really like duke, but you just like MIT a little better, i would play it safe. and who knows u could always still get rejected from duke and into MIT. If that\u2019s not the case and you just don\u2019t want to go to duke anymore, then switch to RD.",
