I think I scheduled my dentist and optometrist appointments when I would be home visiting my parents.  Summer, and winter holiday.  Haircuts I just went to a local chain I could walk to from campus.",

      "text": "You should have your annual doctor check up over the summer or during winter break.  You'll almost certainly have to stop in over the summer to get proof of vaccination in order to enroll at your chosen college (or a doctor's letter about why you can't be vax'd). If you're scheduled to go in between now and April, cancel and reschedule that appointment for late May so you can do the paperwork and reset your 365 day preventative care clock.  \n\nMinor illnesses and injuries can be handled at the student health center.  You'll probably pay a hefty fee to support it so feel free to take advantage.  They probably do vaccination clinics for flu shots every fall and any further necessary Covid boosters. I got my birth control there when I was a student and they always had free condoms.   \n\nIf you have a health condition that requires frequent appointments then talk to your current provider about how they want to handle things.  If you don't need to be seen in office and poked and prodded, tele-health may be the way to go with in person visits during breaks.  If you hate talking on the phone or doing Zoom, or your provider does, then they should be able to refer you to someone local to your college to take over your care.\n\nAll of my kids were out of braces by the time they went to college.  If you're just going to be in the post treatment monitoring, again, schedule the appointments during school breaks.  If you're still in active treatment that's something to discuss with your orthodontist and parents to decide how best to handle.\n\nHaircuts are your choice.  I have daughters and they just let their hair grow until they're back home. A lot of their male friends do the same, honestly. The people who care more find local salons/barbershops to keep their hair trimmed.",

Also there will be student Facebook groups and Discords for you to ask these questions at. Also, you'll have people in your dorms and classes and you'll ask them too. \n\nYour orthodontist? You'll schedule visits for when you're home. When you're sick you'll go to the campus health center. Haircuts, you'll ask the friends you make.",
