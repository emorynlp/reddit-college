  "title:": "How much will this hurt me? (college algebra and precalculus)",
  "text": "I'm a senior in highschool and want to major in engineering. My top pick is Northwestern, and if I get in, I'd like to do Manufacturing and Design Engineering specifically. I'm female. \n\nAlthough by the time I graduate, I'd have only taken up to honors precalculus. Junior year I took honors College Algebra, sophomore year I took honors geometry, freshman year I took honors algebra 2. At the beginning of my junior year I didn't really know what I was doing, and my school said I should take college algebra, so I did. Also, all my math grades (until this year) have been in the 88-92 range. Not bad, but not excellent either. For a little more context, I've been on the robotics team all 4 years and am the captain this year (we won 3rd place in the marketing and robot categories last year). I've taken the engineering course at my school as well as CATIA and have done very well in both, and both of those things are related to engineering. I worked in my school's IT department over the summer (my school gets new computers every few years, so I helped with the process). I have an internship at a local tech company. I'm on the design team at my school (we basically interview clients (staff at school) who request for us to build something for them that will help the school/their class/etc. in some way). I made a business at my school where I make and sell things, profits going to my school's makerspace. I'm also a visual artist, and considering that Northwestern seems to emphasize having broad interests, could that make up for it/make me stand out a bit in compensation? Considering all that, will having both college algebra and precalculus on my transcript hurt me? Or would those ECs be enough to compensate? Ofc there's other aspects that are important like the LORs, essays, etc., but I'm just listing the things that are (mostly) related and things that might make up a bit for my semi-weak math.",
