  "text": "Hello y'all so I have a question. So I am applying REA to Harvard and EA to U Wisconsin Madison and Im basically done, but harvard requires 2 recommendations (and it would be better to have 2 for uwm), and my 2nd recommending teacher hasn't finished it yet. 1stly, if I submit and he submits the recommendation later, will colleges download it and look at it? And 2ndly, if another college sees I added a recommendation and I already applied there, for me its University of Illinois at Chicago, would they download it? Thank you!",
