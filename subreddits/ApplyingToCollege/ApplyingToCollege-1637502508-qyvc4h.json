  "text": "Hello guys. So I applied ED to UPenn Wharton and haven't received an interview notice yet. I am from Germany for reference. I know that the interviews are assigned according to availability, but I still believe that some students are not given interviews purposefully, such as the clear admits or rejects. Clear rejects not getting an interview is quite intuitive but I was wondering, for my own sanity, if that would also be the case for a select number of students who AOs think would be admitted without the need of an interview. I was quite confident in my application, and while trying to be not overly optimistic, I couldn't keep myself from wondering this, so if you know anything, please share :))",
