  "title:": "I have a theory on why SOME Ivy League/T10 colleges feel more accessible",
  "text": "Their prompts. They're so personal and make us think so many fun things that we see ourselves chilling with the admissions officers, letting our guard down.\n\nThink about it. Nobody thinks, \"ooh I can't wait to see the Harvard decision\" because the prompts are boring and you always feel you're screwed no matter how you wrote them. Chances are you just recycled them or wrote the essays while reminding yourself, \"that's going to be read by uptight Harvard douches\".\n\nBut when you pour your heart into those 'Letter to your roommate' (Stanford), 'What would you teach at Yale', or 'List some movies, TV shows, etc. you watch' (Columbia) questions, you think \"you know what? I was myself and those essays were great!\"\n\nBut damn that's why until I got rejected from Yale, I thought I had a good shot. We gotta remember until decisions day that all these warm, 'cute prompt' colleges are the same as your Harvard douches. DON'T LET THE FUZZY PROMPTS FOOL YOU!",

      "text": "I understand the sentiment.  HOWEVER.  Painting admissions officers as \u201cdouches\u201d shows quite a lack of awareness for their job.  All of these highly selective schools have around 10,000 plus applicants (probably more like 20-30k\u2014that information is public and you can google it) for around 1,000 or so spots.  Maaaaybe 1,500ish depending on the school.  Of these 10,000+ applicants, at least 1/3 applicants is more than qualified for to succeed at any given school in the country.  By more than qualified, I mean valedictorian.  Winners of competitive coding tournaments.  Math olympiads.  Many of these applicants have achieved more at 18 than some people will achieve in a life time.  Granted, many of them have been groomed for such since they were born.  But the achievement is there all the same.  \n\nAdmission officers are not \u201cdouches\u201d.  They are doing a job that is sort of impossible.  Their goal is to create the best possible class of incoming freshman when they have enough students to likely create 2 or 3 phenomenal classes.  Somehow, they need to narrow it down.",
