  "text": "so it says to enter GPA (mine is 3.67) on a scale of \"blank\".\n\nWhat do I put for my school? It used to be 4 point scale obv, but idk if that's changed because I'm in dual enrollment and have an AP class. so last year the most points I could get was 4.33, and now this year the most points I can get is a 4.66. So what should I put?\n\nMy dual enrollment courses and the AP class is worth 5 points",
