  "text": "Accidentally said \"YES\" to the question on common app for financial aid but I don't want to apply for it. Now I got a mail from the university telling me about how to apply for financial aid. I mailed them 3-4 days back that I will not be applying for aid and haven\u2019t received a reply yet. The deadline to submit the financial aid documents is the 15th. If I don\u2019t submit them will they automatically consider I don\u2019t need any financial aid or should I go to my portal, request an application change and let them know there. What can I do?",
