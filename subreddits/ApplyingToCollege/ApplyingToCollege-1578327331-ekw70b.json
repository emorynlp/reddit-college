I don\u2019t think design can ever be outsourced to technology, so there will always be a demand for it. People automatically assume you\u2019re going to be poor because it\u2019s an artsy major, but they\u2019ve just bought into the idea that you have to major in something STEM to be successful. My mom started as a graphic designer and quickly worked her way up. She\u2019s now the director of marketing at her company and she\u2019s doing just fine. Go prove everyone wrong and kick some butt!!! \n\nP.S. If you want to really grow your wealth, open a Roth IRA and try to max it out every single year. Put your money into long-term index funds (I personally use the Vanguard 500 Index Fund - Admiral Shares; it\u2019s the one Warren Buffett uses). You will easily become a millionaire by the time you retire. Then you\u2019ll really prove everyone wrong.",

I doubt there are more then 5000 jobs in the world paying that much for designers and ux isnt the only part of design. Most jobs seem to be 15-30 an hour. If your good maybe you can make 50-80k. I'm sure the best of the at places like apple make that much but on average they are not making more than primary care physicians",

As much as the bootcamp places like General Assembly want people to get some BS certificate for UX only, you can't.  You have to have both skill sets. Most of what we see is junk--UI designers who claim to have UX skills, but clearly they don't. I see so much crappy/poorly thought out UX that looks pretty (or worse cookie cutter).  I have also interviewed people who go to bootcamps for UX in an effort to fill entry level spots and those people are also not qualified because those bootcamps don't give good instruction and they have no UI  skills The last person I hired was a contractor who worked PT for us making effectively $240K. She is good, but not great. In NYC, you can hire a solid graphic designer with 3 years of experience for about $80K-$100K. You can't really hire anyone in tech in NYC unless it is in a support position for less than $60K. \nI also have several family members in medicine and the starting salary in family medicine or even pediatrics is about $120K.",
