      "text": "As long as each essay has value in showing who you are (and most important how you\u2019ll bring your traits and skills to improve the university and beyond), you\u2019re fine. Themes are nice at times especially to show focus on a trait you value, but they can be restricting. Having a theme as broad as making a global impact is completely fine! They don\u2019t have to be similar, but at the end of the day after you read them all, the AO should be able to pick out around 3 adjectives to describe you, not 10-15. Don\u2019t try to stretch parts of yourself.",
