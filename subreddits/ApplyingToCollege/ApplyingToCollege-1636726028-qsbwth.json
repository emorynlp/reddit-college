  "text": "I keep seeing comments on here saying schools don\u2019t admit by major but they ask in the applications what your first, and sometimes second choice would be. I assumed they want to create a balanced class so took majors into account that way? Also, I low key want them to consider my scores and GPA in context of my major - because I\u2019m much stronger in humanities, which is my area of major, than STEM.",
