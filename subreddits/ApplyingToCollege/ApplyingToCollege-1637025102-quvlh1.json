  "text": "I am in my first year of community college and I plan to go for one more year then transfer. I have decent grades so far my gpa is a 3.7 and i am currently in business administration, however for next semester i switched to communications and media program and i think i will get better grades in this program. But for my 4 year school i really want to go to a southern school. My top schools are university of florida and umiami, but it is definitely a reach for me. I was wondering if anyone had some other similar schools that would attainable for someone like me.",

      "text": "Consider your budget. UF is a public university. I don't think UF gives need-based aid to out of state students, though merit scholarships may be available - check their scholarship webpages. U Miami is private and might give need-based aid. Check colleges' financial aid websites to see if they offer need-based financial aid to transfers. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",
