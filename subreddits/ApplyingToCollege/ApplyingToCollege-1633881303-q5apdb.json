Try cutting out a paragraph at a time and see if your message still gets across. Try eliminating the introduction\u2014if it straight up doesn\u2019t work without the intro, try cutting out the next paragraph. That doesn\u2019t work? Try the one after that. If you can\u2019t eliminate any of your paragraphs, try combining them. Cut out sentences, see if it still works. This is arguably the hardest part of this essay, but you can do it\u2014I cut my 1,450-word first draft down to 648. It\u2019s just a matter of pulling the trigger, honestly. Keep a separate doc of all the stuff you\u2019ve cut out so you don\u2019t have to entirely let go of it; you can use that in supplemental essays!",
