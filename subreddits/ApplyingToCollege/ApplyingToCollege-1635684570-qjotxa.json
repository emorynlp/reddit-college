  "text": "I just submitted my ED school application and checked off that I want my testing scores to be considered. The school allows self-reported scores and the information is filled out on the Common App section. But I just realized that in the application preview they gave, my scores don't appear. Does the school still see it? Or should I email someone to confirm they will?",
