  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI am a Junior in high school with a 4.05 GPA weighted, 4 AP classes so far, a Musician for both my school's Honors and Jazz bands, a varsity athlete, and president of a club with an officer position in other clubs. I am aware this resume is good, but I do have a problem. I took the SAT twice, and I wasn't able to get over 1350 both times. Usually, I am a good tester, but something about the SAT doesn't work for me. My whole family came together to pay for an expensive SAT program that I know produced students with fantastic scores, many of which are my friends. I will be the first one in my family that will go to college in America (I am an immigrant and moved here in 8th grade). I always felt the need to go to a top college because otherwise, I could go back to my home country and live a much simpler and easier life. \n\nBut the SAT thing worries me; because of my rigorous schedule, I don't know if I will retake the test with a good mindset. I am terrified of retaking the test and failing again like I know that intellectually I can score above 1400, but I am legit shaking at the thought of failing again.\n\nI would be glad for some motivation, tips, and everything else. \n\nAppreciate it a lot, thank you very much.\n\nPW",

      "text": "Did you already do the SAT program?  Most students improve significantly with study and practice.  Most also improve after the middle of their Junior year, so if you're currently a Junior, your best shot will be between Junior spring and Senior fall.\n\nFinally, test optional admissions is a thing.  It's not perfect, but it's an option.",
