FYI, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to *out-of-state* students and charge them more.  U Mich may be an exception for some low income out of state students. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.)",
