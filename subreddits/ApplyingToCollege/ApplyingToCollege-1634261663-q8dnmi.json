I\u2019m not even a CS major nor do I ever want to be (EE major) so the risk of me getting completely fucked by trying again wouldn\u2019t have been high.!<\n\n>!if there is any blessing from covid it\u2019s that i was able to go and knock out all the gen ed requirements + even a major requirement at community college and set myself on a path to graduate a year early this coming May, because holy shit i just can not justify paying this much money for school anymore!<\n\n>!could probably argue that WashU whipped me into shape to do well on the MCAT but honestly the lack of grade inflation at UCs and knowing I can\u2019t rely on school prestige to provide that lining of fluff would have had the same motivating effect. esp with covid it was a raw fuckin deal to go straight to a 4 year and paying private school tuition for 1.5 years of zoom was salt in the wound for a lot of people!<\n\n>!edit 2: alright i\u2019m blowing off steam and have some free time after my data structures and algorithms midterm, let\u2019s do this.!<\n>!administration is pretty shitty and our new chancellor played himself by accidentally CCing a bunch of people in his email a while back to another school admin calling a grad student strike demanding better conditions \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d.!<\n\n>!The 9/11 fiasco a month back made national news and our glorious admin sent out a shittily-worded email that did nothing to stoke the flames on either side of the argument.!<\n\n>!Our tuition gets hiked significantly every year for some reason \u2014 went up $2000+ during Covid.!<\n>!i compared the syllabi of a bunch of classes my friends and I have taken to those of my friends attending other universities. im not trolling when i tell you our undergrad-level classes aren\u2019t even that much more rigorous if at all which is disappointing:!<\n\n>!* our calc 3 class doesn\u2019t even cover the last couple topics like stokes theorem or surface integration of any kind. i\u2019ve seen a lot of community college multi classes that are more rigorous and comprehensive. the math department basically passes on the burden of teaching the remaining material to future classes (or the departments that use calc 3 as a math core class) to deal with. same goes for diffeq depending on who teaches!<\n>!* my friend at san diego state covered several more topics in their DiffEQ class than we did. they also had application & computational modeling components serving as motivation for learning the material, which we didn\u2019t have!<\n>!* the professor who teaches circuits 1 (EE 98) at SJSU fields more rigorous assignments and midterms than our circuits 1 professor. they also do far more useful labs!<\n>!* Our Gen bio sequence doesn\u2019t even teach organ systems unlike 90% of other universities.!<\n>!* Surprisingly enough people here still have the gall to complain about classes being \u201ctoo hard\u201d despite having all the cards in their hand, but that\u2019s a whole other rant I won\u2019t get into!<\n\n>!For CS majors: Many classes in the CS department are basically copy pastes of other universities\u2019 equivalents and then dialed down (CSE 361 is a copy of a CMU computer systems class, CSE 412 is CS 188 from Berkeley with material cut out). Some are outright useless like this required intro to CompE class (CSE 132) where you fuck around with an Arduino and learn so little that people literally tell you to take it 2nd semester senior year.!<\n\n>!Because there\u2019s no enrollment restrictions or limits on major switching, all of the valuable CS classes are impacted to hell and back and you need to sit on a waitlist hoping you can get off for classes like Intro to Data Science or Machine Learning.!<\n\n>!How is that much different from resource-strapped public universities and their enrollment woes that people try to avoid at a private school? You might say \u201cwell CS is impacted everywhere\u201d, true, but if anything that\u2019s an even better argument to not shell out the big bucks. It\u2019s easier to get into an introductory data science class @ Cal (Data 8) than it is to get into one at WashU which is hilarious given how infamously impacted Cal\u2019s DS and CS majors are in their own right. Oh and if that\u2019s not enough, WashU CSE is trying to add a Data Science major in the future which will be crowding many of the same classes. Very cool!!<\n\n>!The CS degree itself also misses a lot of key requirements which should 100% be in a CS major such as Computer Architecture or Operating Systems to the point where students had to figure out how to build the CS major here to be even remotely comparable to that of rigorous programs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/nmjcml/how\\_to\\_make\\_the\\_most\\_of\\_your\\_cs\\_degree\\_the\\_rwashu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/nmjcml/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cs_degree_the_rwashu/)).!<\n\n>!if all you give a shit about are career outcomes then sure, washu\u2019s outcomes are decent and we have representation at top companies in spades, that being said if you actually want to learn shit from your degree you\u2019re on your own to call the shots unless you want a BS in Software Engineering in all but name. I can go dig up a post where CS majors themselves @ WashU were calling the program a joke but i think i don\u2019t need to and my point has been made (edit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/nje2z1/comment/gz8k34u/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/nje2z1/comment/gz8k34u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))!<",

It also forces people to actually explore, because your notions about what you might want to study or do in the future aren't exactly as set in stone as people think, especially when you consider the fact that they're basically still pimply 17-18 year olds.\n\nAlso my unpopular \"hot take\" is that everyone should read whether they love it or not, though ideally they'd love it too (I usually ascribe that to the fact that people haven't actually found the topic or genre that interests them). The people who annoy me the most are STEMlords who practically boast about how much they hate reading or how badly they're failing their freshman writing class like it's edgy or something.",

I understand you need to get kids active somehow, but past middle school i think they can figure it out themselves, and they most definitely can in college. plus PE has NEVER been about getting active, it is purely an elitist social activity that just so happens to involve activity occasionally. it is only fun for those who are very good at it, and the coaches put them in control of judging and bossing around everyone else. the only time I've ever enjoyed PE was one time when I had the rock climbing wall to myself and I could just be at fucking peace. I haven't been in school for the last 3 years, and I have never ever been more healthy\n\nsorry I'm just very passionate about this, meant no hate to anyone",

You obviously like Rice more, which is fine. And I am sure that Rice is a better option for your child. But, again, for many others it isn't -- and the reason the higher profile scholars tend to be at UT is not simply because Rice is focused on undergrads. It's an R1, research is the most important thing there.\n\nRice is a great school. But with academics, in USNWR it actually has the same score as UT for undergrad: 4.1. I'm not bashing Rice. Or Stanford. Amazing schools. But acting as if there is a clear hierarchy in quality of education, based on a bizarre list where academic strength is not given a huge weight is silly. \n\n(All the other stuff, post-graduate earnings should be taken with a grain of salt too--what percentage of students are coming from prep-schools and richer families, whose connections help set them up with higher paying jobs; how many social work and education majors are graduating who do great work but enter a low-paying industry? What about the arts?)",

              "text": " > It would not be accurate to say Notre Dame has mediocre finance placement lol\n\nIn comparison to all schools? Yeah. But in comparison to other top schools? It's a semi-target. \n\nMendoza has the same amount of kids in their business schools as Stern/Ross they send around half as many into banking. Georgetown has 1400 but sends more than Notre Dame. Notre Dame just really isn't in the conversation for top targets. Also, a lot of the kids they do place really only place into the Chicago offices. Also, [look here](https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2019/12/31/starting-salaries-bonuses-for-business-majors-in-2019/2/). You can see how Mendoza lags behind all the bonafide target business schools. \n\nWhen you consider that it's ranked over several bonafide targets, I think it's fair to say its finance placement is mediocre. While there are T20s with worse placements (see: Hopkins), I'd argue that those types of schools make it very clear that their objectives are different. [However](https://www3.nd.edu/~instres/CDS/2020-2021/CDS_2020-2021.pdf) it is clear at Notre Dame that business (20%) is their most common major followed by social sciences and engineering (and their engineering isn't particularly standout either). \n\nTo me, the issue is that the only thing that really makes Notre Dame standout to me as its unique selling point is being one of the top Catholic schools that offer a traditional college experience. Which is fair. However, for career options, basically anything Notre Dame does, a student who got into Notre Dame could probably go to another school that does it better. And that's why I'm confused as to why it's as well-regarded as it is. Anyone who wants to do finance and is a good Catholic would probably fare better going to Georgetown, and Georgetown also has the niche of poli sci/IR/foreign service that helps give it an edge.",

                  "text": "I mean, its not a super target like HYPS, but to say its not a target is just straight up false. Notre Dame IB literally [places 9th highest when adjusted for student size among all US universities](https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/ib-target-schools), above T-20 schools like [Berkeley, UCLA, Vanderbilt, WashU, Rice, Northwestern, Brown, Princeton, Dartmouth, and even Duke](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dp8TGmiBeQYa2S98vOmncJchYat3gwlu/view). In fact, the only schools that are better in placement are Wharton, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, and business schools Stern and Ross. While it is historically true that ND has placed most of their class into Chicago, they have been growing in recent years, expanding as much as [40% of their graduating IB commit class last year into New York](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/why-you-should-consider-notre-dame-for-undergrad). Similar to what you [said in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q4c25z/nyu_vs_top_lac_vs_state_school_is_it_even_worth/hfy55jo/?context=3), most students at ND go to Chicago because its close by to ND, not because they can only place into Chicago.\n\nYou point out how Notre Dame lags behind all the bonafide target business schools in regards to first year salary, and yet when you consider the first 1-5 years post-grad, Notre Dame business students on [average have a higher salary than NYU, Cornell, WashU, UMich, UCLA, Duke, Vanderbilt, and even Harvard.](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-majors/business?orderBy=earlyCareerMedianPay&ascending=false) When accounting for both mid-career pay (10+ years post grad) and early career pay, Notre Dame ranks 7th, tied with UPenn in salary and ahead of Stanford, Brown, NYU, Rice, WashU, CMU, and Cornell. \n\nAmong people experienced in finance, [Notre Dame Mendoza is considered to be on par with undergrad target schools such as Georgetown, Stern, Dyson, Brown, Duke, UChicago, Ross, and UVA McIntire.](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/undergraduate-target-schools-tier-list-2021-updates) The only unequivocally better \"target\" schools are HYPS, UPenn, Dartmouth, Columbia, and MIT.\n\nFor students thinking about pursuing a MBA in the future, [ND also sends the 8th most students to HBS (Harvard business school), tied with Cornell and behind only Harvard, Yale, Princeton, UPenn, Stanford, Duke, Dartmouth, and in front of Columbia, MIT, Georgetown, NYU, and Brown.](https://poetsandquants.com/2019/11/21/feeder-colleges-companies-to-harvard-business-school/)\n\nI'm not trying to fight you on this, as I perfectly understand that ND was considered a semi-target as recently as just a couple of years ago, and thats why you probably thiught the way you did, but in the past year or two the school has really improved in terms of finance opportunities and jobs post-grad. While Georgetown is still a little bit better for opportunities, I would make the argument that Notre Dame pulls ahead in the near future simply because ND has been attracting more and more top finance students and devoting more and more of its resources from its $20bn endowment to the undergraduate business school, recently developing a Business Honors Program to help top students of each class. Georgetown doesn't have the resources or endowment to focus on improving its undergrad b-school at the same rate ND is, and it has shifted more and more in recent years to focusing on improving its political science/IR program, as even you have mentioned.\n\nI chose ND over schools like Dyson, Berkeley, and even Georgetown not only because it offered me less money, but because the culture here really is amazing. I'm not white and while that does make it a bit lonely at times, [ND has focused on becoming more inclusive and diverse](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2021/08/notre-dame-welcomes-most-diverse-first-year-class-in-history/), and people here genuinely just want to help each other out. I've attended a toxic environment during my time in high school, and I didn't want to feel that same culture in fear of becoming a toxic person myself. While I know its subjective, the people I know who attended Dyson, Berkeley, and Georgetown simply weren't people I wanted to associate myself with.\n\n>However, for career options, basically anything Notre Dame does, a student who got into Notre Dame could probably go to another school that does it better.\n\nI agree with you on that, and Im not deluded enough to say Notre Dame is the best university, as I have my own personal struggles and questions about potentially transferring while Im here. But what you're saying can apply to literally almost every single school. Why attend NYU when other schools are better for everything including finance, pre-med, liberal arts, and even film? Why even Columbia, Vanderbilt, Brown, or WashU? In short, just because a college doesn't rank #1 in something doesn't mean students there can't get the same opportunities as someone who did attend that #1 college. It's fine that you think ND or even Rice aren't impressive, but please be open to at least changing your opinion or hearing others out when presented with new information. That mindset worked wonders for me, and its something I think everyone at A2C needs a little bit of.",
