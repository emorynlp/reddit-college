  "text": "Wtf, my parents say getting into a top tier school for undergrad (e.x. Stanford) is far more prestigious than going to a no name undergrad and then top tier school for masters (e.x. Stanford). And ofc I got yelled at for not getting into one during undergrad. Do your parents have similar views?",
