  "text": "Ever since I found out about CU Boulder, I've been obsessed with it. Every day I check my email to see if I got a response from an admissions counselor about a question I have. If everything goes well I'll be accepted for spring of 2022, but even then my admission isn't guaranteed. I'm so anxious, and I know I have a bad habit of obsessing over colleges that I might have a chance to get into, especially when the school seems like a good fit for me. Idk what to do :/",
