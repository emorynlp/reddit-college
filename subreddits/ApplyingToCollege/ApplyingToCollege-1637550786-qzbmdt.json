I would say I'm interested in business, maybe public speaking and I want to do finance/econ is college. I have very few ecs, not because I don't want to do them but honestly cuz I don't really know what could really be an impactful ec. I asked my gc and she said to join NHS but that's barley a high commitment club. So please, lmk any recommendations that you think you be impactful and one that I can really focus on.",
