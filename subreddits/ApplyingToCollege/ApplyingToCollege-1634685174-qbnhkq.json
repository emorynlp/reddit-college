  "text": "Hey Guys. So I had a quick question. I am writing my why us essay for Columbia. I am engineering major so I already had to write an essay kind of explaining the origins of my interest in engineering and kind of a prospect into what I want to do in the future. In this engineering essay, I mention Columbia at the end (saying that it will provide the way for me to fulfill my goals something like that.) But nothing specific like a class or a research project or professor or anything of the sort. I am drafting my why us essay and I kind of want to apply it to my interest in music. Meaning talking about music and how Columbia will help me develop this interest. I was wondering if you guys think that this would be a good approach to take. I normally speak about my major in any of the other why us essays, but I don\u2019t want to be redundant as to why I would want to take some engineering opportunities in Columbia. Should I mention my major or do you guys think that doesn\u2019t matter",
