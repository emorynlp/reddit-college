Stevenson maybe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I look for:\n\n* Closeish to home (So not like in California)\n* Not entirely academically focused but not overly sportish (not a fan of sports)\n* Good comp sci programs of course\n* Not \"rich white kids\" (I'm an Asian male)\n* School size does not really matter, but my high school is 400 per grade level so I'd like a similar feel or bigger.\n* Surroundings: Not rural. I grew up in the suburbs so I'm comfortable with that, however a city is ok too.\n* Not interested in greek life\n* Probably 10 other things I care about but haven't realized yet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI am late in the college admission process I know",

      "text": "UMBC would be a good safety - you are probably good for UMD but I would want one \"sure thing\" option.  George Mason would fit too, but you get in-state costs at UMBC.\n\nDrexel could be worth a look as a fairly easy target.\n\nJHU would be a good reach I think. \n\nSome of the private universities in Boston like BU or Northeastern can be worth a look - it's definitely one of the best areas for biotech opportunities and there are a lot of good schools up there.  Not as close to home, but not across the country either.",
