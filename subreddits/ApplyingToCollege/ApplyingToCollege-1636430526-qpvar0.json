  "text": "Title. One of the college application portal where I applied to says they received the FAFSA without signature page but are awaiting for the signed FAFSA. I just checked my FAFSA and it says it was processed successfully on November 3rd but the college hasn\u2019t received it, so is there a way to resubmit?",

      "text": "That's surprising because the FAFSA is sent all together, so not sure how they're missing the signature page... Go into your FAFSA, and delete a school and then add a school, and submit it for processing again - that should resend it to the earlier schools as well.",
