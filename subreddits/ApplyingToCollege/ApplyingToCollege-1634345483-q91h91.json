  "text": "I visited northeastern this week and the pamphlet said that there 50% act range was 34-35. The lady also said to not submit if you are under the range. I know northeastern is a good school but I didn\u2019t think the act ranges were that high. This is making me feel very nervous and hopeless for the other colleges I\u2019m applying to. I got a 33 and thought I would submit my scores everywhere. I works really hard for it but I feel like the last cycle (since test optional) makes the schools scores way more inflated and a lot more competitive.",

On top of that, class of 2025 stats everywhere are skewed high due to test optional policies.\n\nThe middle 50 percentile range for Northeastern's enrolled class of 2024 - or two thirds of them, anyway - was 33-35, notably with math 30-35.
