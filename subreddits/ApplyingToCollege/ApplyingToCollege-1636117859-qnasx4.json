      "text": "It makes me sad to see the responses here. Most HS students don't really know what they're getting into and most people, in general, don't know what college is for and what students study in a major.\n\nEnglish majors mostly study literature that is written in the English language. Since most English literature is from the UK, that's mostly what you'll be studying. Of course, it could be American Literature or Australian Literature or etc. as well.\n\nEvery language or continent could have its own Literary focus. E.g. Asian Literature or perhaps Modern Chinese or Japanese Literature can be a major. Just as one could be a French or German Lit. major. One would generally have to take a lot of those language classes and be fairly fluent to read the text in its original language too by the time they graduate. \n\nCreative Writing is a different major as well as Comparative Literature. \n\nJournalism can be a major but you don't really need it to become a journalist. This is very distinct from a Communications major or Mass Communication major or Public Relations major. These all have a lot of crossover in classes and subjects but they are each distinct majors.   \nWhat most people don't understand is the structure and system of higher educational institutions.\n\nAn apt analogy would be, most people don't understand government as an institution. It's got a lot of moving parts and integrated systems but each part has is distinct from another. \n\nYou don't go to a police station for a building permit or take a small claims court to the military. Public universities, private colleges, community colleges, and for-profit schools serve different purposes and function differently and so does every major.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: Systems are complex**",
