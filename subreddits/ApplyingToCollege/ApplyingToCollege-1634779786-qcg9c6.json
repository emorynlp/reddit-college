  "text": " So im applying to George mason university and Virginia Tech, James Madison, and a few other schools I decided to drop math this year since I already have 4 credits for an advanced diploma. I did take math class which was stats for the first two weeks in the beginning, but then I was like I cant do this bc the teacher was sooooo bad so I decided to drop the class is it gonna affect my admissions, and im pretty sure it's not gonna show as withdrew on my transcript. So please let me know",
