  "text": "It just SUCKS because I\u2019m so fricking privileged to live in a place with soooo many opportunities to take advantage of and I can\u2019t! Stupid green card gives me noooo street cred without being a citizen.\n\nI know I\u2019m not competitive enough to actually get a DC internship or to intern with NASA but I\u2019d like the opportunity to at least *try*. I never realized how disadvantaged being interested in political science/public policy is without being a citizen. I feel like I\u2019m just realizing this major isn\u2019t going to be sustainable for me to pursue in college if I can\u2019t actually get DC political experiences as I probably won\u2019t get my citizenship in time.\n\nLOL okay rant over, this post is the definition of first world problems *cringe*",

I sent in a application a few days ago to the Bernie campaign for an internship, but he dropped out :/...but I\u2019m not too mad since I wouldn\u2019t have gotten it either way. \n\n I can\u2019t really find any congressional, senate or governor campaigns that are happening now near me to intern for. And actually interning for them in their office is only limited to college students/ post grads\n\nI\u2019m a field organizer for a mayoral campaign but our election has been suspended to November :/\n\nBut I\u2019m only doing grunt work research for the campaign so I\u2019m not really learning anything.\n\nI know I\u2019m being super negative and you\u2019re only trying to help which I really I appreciate.",

Most likely you won't be paid and you'll be doing a shitton of grunt work (everyone does it) but it's a shitton of fun and you're helping your locality so it's worth it. \n\nAlso, if you plan to go into politics, find out who you need to know in order to get more jobs. They're pretty hard to find but youll start to get a feeling once you're around them a bunch. They always have an eye on young politically active people so they'll probably find you if you're doing good work. Good luck!",

I had the time of my life campaigning lol.\n\nI got a possible job offer for this summer to help elect a coalition of democrat-backed judges into office which i'm super excited about. Apparently it's more than an internship but things have been pretty vague so im not entirely sure about it yet lol. I'm also a camp counselor though so i'd probably have to decide between the campaign and camp. \n\nGood luck though!! Interning is legit awesome so I love helping people get into it",

Or they\u2019ll tell me to phone bank 300+ people in one day but not tell me what to ask. Also my supervisor does quarter of the work but gets all the credit and PAID! And I keep trying to emphasize social media use because our opponent is ballin on IG and FB but they won\u2019t listennn\n\nI\u2019m really sorry that was a really long digression of a totally unrelated rant.\n\nI will check out the senate campaigns but strangely there\u2019s neither a lot of democrats running for Congress or senate in my local elections. For instance only one democrat is running for senate (https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Virginia,_2020).  \n\nSomeone in reddit hooked me up with a congressional campaign though so I\u2019m feeling super relieved!!\n\n\nAlso since Bernie dropped out and my application for an internship is probably going to fall through. I can\u2019t even volunteer anymore :((( Biden\u2019s internships are all in philly and volunteering is really weird because you can\u2019t sign up for shifts...they\u2019ll email you with opportunities ??\n\n\n\n\nBut the thing is I can volunteer for political campaigns, work for NGOS, intern at think tanks anywhere in the country but I can only get federal government experience at DC. I think I\u2019m just fixating on something I can\u2019t have though and not taking advantage of the opportunities before me.\n\n\nI\u2019m being super whiny but thanks for your insight! I legit did not even know a senate race was happening right now because Tim kaine didn\u2019t say anything about it on his site lol...I\u2019m super dense.",

      "text": "I'm undocumented and was able to volunteer on some political campaigns. They don't ask for much other than your high school, name, and phone number/email address. As long as it's not an actual paying job, then they don't need your social security number, iirc.\n\nI knew a lot of students who built strong connections through volunteering on campaigns and had it on their resumes. \n\nNow, I'm not going to be a political science major or do anything in public policy but there are more opportunities than you think.  Ask your counselor or any career centers at your school - I'm sure they're willing to help.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of other scholarships and contests you can enter without legal residence. Keep your head up, there are a lot of privileges I wish I had with a US citizenship but I was able to make the most out of it without the status. I was able to get a lot of offers from colleges that I never thought would accept me and found a lot of undocumented student communities from my top choices of universities. \n\nMost of all, you will be successful as long as you keep trying. It may not be success in the way you expected but it will be worthwhile. Also, remember your roots. You're the start of a new family legacy. Honor it.",

I really wish I discovered my political science interest earlier before to gain more enriching experience. I don\u2019t even know how you did half the things you mentioned!\n\nMy rant is very very privileged and very bratty. I was short sighted when I made this post and failed to realize that I will (hopefully) gain citizenship eventually. I should be grateful for the opportunities I\u2019m able to have right now (but where are you finding permanent residency DC internships?? LOL)\n\nAre you on the path to a green card or can you apply for one? Maybe you can work in immigration, or for the embassy or maybe even the UN! I don\u2019t think your political journey is over for you mate, I hope you stick with politics in the US",

Maybe try looking at other field even if you are politically inclined i.e business which I don't thing are exclusively citizen",

You should probably not be applying to competitive colleges as a poli-sci major if you live in DC, and can't take advantage of the opportunities there. If you're going for less competitive schools, you're probably fine, as stats are enough, but top schools want to see you taking advantage of the situation. They compare your app to the other people in your area, and if the other people in your area are interning for presidential nominees, you've been beat.\n\nAlso, you're definitely NOT taking advantage. Maybe its different in DC, but over here many internships and volunteer opportunities do not require citizenship. In fact, I'm sure if you emailed the ones that do and explained your situation, at least ONE would make an exception. But you're not, instead you're on reddit, ranting obnoxiously about privileges many people in the world aren't afforded.",

I\u2019m working on local mayoral campaigns, I\u2019m on the board of a local non profit, I\u2019m part of a lobbying campaign, I even started with basic volunteering/canvassing for a political candidate because I was just so invested and was willing to do anything (rip Bernie). \n\nI\u2019ve tried to seize every opportunity i had available. I cold emailed over 60+ people just to get those (except volunteering, anyone can do that). It was so much effort, I thought about giving up. I know I\u2019m so grateful for these opportunities and ppl to take me on despite citizenship situation. \n\nYou can\u2019t just make broad sweeping statements when I only provided a sliver of my life.\n\nAlso a citizenship isn\u2019t just \u201coh you don\u2019t have xyz experience* or *oh you\u2019re not xyz age*. It\u2019s a vital aspect of security clearance for federal government . I even tracked down the heads of different departments that were recruiting ppl on social media to beg them to let me apply! \n\n\nSo yes I\u2019m going to obnoxious. My dream isn\u2019t to work for a private entity on stick with local community politics. I want to engage with the different departments of government and have the opportunity that every other American citizen has. It\u2019s just so demoralizing to see people pursue internships at NASA (not that I\u2019d get accepted either way) when I wasn\u2019t able to send in an app.\n\nAgain this is a rant and I even qualified this in the end up stating my privilege. I even called this a \u201cfirst world problem\u201d.\n\nAlso you\u2019re clearly just looking for an argument and I\u2019m probably feeding your ego by engaging with you but whatever.",

After another useless venture through hours of scouring through usjobs.gov, I vented on a platform that enables students in the college admissions process to rant (hence the rant flag).\n\nAlso I meant has the opportunity to *apply*.

It's a GREAT book though, I think TJ was one of the most contradictory, crazy men to exist. Him and Alexander Hamilton's rivalry/friendship was soo intriguing.\n I myself love YA fantasy teeny bopper books, I could recommend like 100 of them if you want! I think it all depends what you're into. Any reading is good reading",
