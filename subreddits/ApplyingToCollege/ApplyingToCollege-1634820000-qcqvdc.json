  "text": "I am a high school senior who scored a 23 on act, and I haven\u2019t been able to retake it to get it higher. My questions is if I were to apply to school totally test optional and only submit ap/ib tests would I put myself at a disadvantage? My gpa is 3.84 unweighted and I have around 6 extracurriculars listed in common app. I\u2019m really not sure what to do here and might do community college for 1 year to get my gen eds and act score up then transfer to a strong engineering school like Purdue or Carnegie Mellon which I really want to get admitted to but feel as though I don\u2019t stand a chance against other students. Thank you for any help!",

You don't have to start your own initiative because there's no time for that but you can join people in projects and initiatives, maybe help out at a small business or something, that can fill a few spots in the EC section.",
