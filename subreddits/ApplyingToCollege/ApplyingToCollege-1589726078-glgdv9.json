          "text": "Honestly, my high school was terrible about assisting in the admissions process. Nobody informed me that it was going to be as brutal as it *can be*, but I made that discovery for myself. That being said, it isn't all that bad if you spread out the work!\n\nThe #1 piece of advice I have is to think ahead, and be prepared as hell. Starting by writing essays now and thinking over what you'll say about your extra curriculars on the application. Additionally, do any of your schools of interest accept the common app? If so, choose an essay prompt over the summer and start writing. It doesn't need to be perfect by August, but progress is good. Remember to choose the prompt you can write well about and that conveys your personality the best, not the one you think schools will like the most.\n\nBy the first day of school this fall (hoping it's in person) be ready to ask for some Letters of Recommendation (LoRs) or at least have some people in mind. Asking sooner is better because you'll be ahead of the curve in terms of other students asking, and you **do not** want the reccomenders to be in a time crunch for you. Once schools has started, begin cranking your way through applications and filling them in. I did all of my work in Google Docs and then copy/pasted all the information in. This process can help keep your grammar clean, as well as give you the ability to share your applications with people so they can proof read.\n\nOne of the underrated issues about the application process is that it can be one of the root causes of senioritis. Staying engaged can be difficult, but you want to keep your eyes on the prize! If you have any questions about how I went about this process, my DMs are always open :) Good luck, we're all rooting for you!",

It's not simply a \"reply all\" situation.\n\nNumber two is because scholarships--even when done perfectly--are a numbers game. I always encourage students to assume they will NOT win any single scholarship they are applying for. Instead, think of the pool of scholarships and assume you will win a percentage of them (for local scholarships, with great essays, I think that number is as high as 25 percent of them).\n\nThat's it! I help students win scholarships for a living. Let me know what questions you have.",

Additionally, look ahead and see if schools already have their individual essay prompts available to the public. The writing process for the school I currently attend took me about a month of working on. I would write, have my English teacher proof read, rinse, and repeat until it was what I wanted. Good luck!\n\n\\- A rising college sophomore",

I'd recommend to search up \"niche.com best schools for computer science\" as that's what i did for my major. For criteria I guess you'd see the colleges programs and stuff and also whether it's affordable, the size of the college, whether you want to go in state or out of state etc. Ideally you should attend webinars or virtual tours of colleges to find out more and to demonstrate interest. As for categorizing the schools, you should search up the average gpa and sat scores of admitted applicants as well as the overall acceptance rate of the school. Prep scholar is a wonderful resource for this, simply search up \"prep scholar (school name\" and it will tell you very straightforward what are the sat scores and gpa of admitted applicants for the school. \n\nBtw, University of Illinois Urbana Champagne has some interesting computer science majors to check out! I myself am particularly interested in the \"computer science + linguistics\" major.",

The list should be balanced: it\u2019s essential to include schools that you will be a good match for (\u201ctarget\u201d) as well as those you\u2019re very likely to be admitted to (\u201clikely\u201d or \u201csafety\u201d). Some students make the mistake of focusing on \u201creach\u201d schools and don\u2019t get in anywhere!\nOnly include schools you can afford. No point in getting into a \u201cdream\u201d school that\u2019s beyond your means. If you are in the top 25% of admitted students (e.g., based on GPA and test scores), some colleges will award generous merit aid. \nIf you know what you want to study, you can do a deeper dive to find out which schools on your list are strongest in this area.\nThat should be enough to get you started...",
