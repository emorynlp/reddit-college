  "text": "This is a rant, because I can\u2019t keep up with my emotions. If you\u2019re in the us, you\u2019re privileged. If you have a college counselor, you\u2019re privileged. If you\u2019ve friends who are going through the same as you, whom you can talk and relate to, you are privileged. If your parents understand and support the college process, guess what? Yes, you guessed, you are privileged. We are privileged for SO MANY THINGS and fail to acknowledge them. It\u2019s okay for you to not be okay and rant and feel your emotions, but sometimes people sink in the simplest of their troubles and drown in their sorrows, forgetting that some things in their lives, are indeed going good and strong. You\u2019ve a roof over your head, food in the table and access to spaces where you can grow, both as a person and as a friend. This isn\u2019t me as an international saying \u201cfrick you all, you privileged kids\u201d, but me saying \u201cappreciate it. Be grateful. Be mindful\u201d. I see so many posts on here about people tripping over the most trivial things (which they\u2019re allowed to), but sometimes you gotta value the little things in life. I am tired of people ghosting me after saying \u201cyes, let\u2019s\u201d. I am tired of my parents not understanding how draining the college process is that they put all imaginable chores on my lap. I am tired of not being able to tell people why I am so sleep deprived and hurt sometimes, since I gotta keep this a secret, in the chances I don\u2019t get in. I am tired of having to put up an image and behave a certain way, because it\u2019s my senior year. I am tired of being nice to people and getting less than kind words in return. But I get up every day, I am thankful and I remember there are people less than fortunate all over the world. Don\u2019t let the college app process suck your soul.",

I go to one of the worst schools in the country have had almost all of my female friends get raped. Had to lie about my age to ilegaly work to pay the rent that my abusive parents make me pay. Also the stabbing why the fuck are there so many stabbing people talk about gun violence I have had 10 stabbings since the start of this year. I dont have medical care because my parents dont believe in doctors and I cant get insurance yet. Fuck off not everyone is privileged. But I can eat food that I pay for after working 37 hour weeks and a school week.",
