  "text": "So I am an international student who is applying to US colleges and requires significant amounts of financial aid from the colleges. I kinda knew that a lot of the aid for int. students are dedicated in the early rounds, but now that regular rounds are coming up, I have heard only bad news. That regular decision doesn't offer much financial aid for internationals and I have rarely heard internationals who got lucky during regular decisions.\n\nMy eligibility for college admission is entirely dependent on my financial aid, and I am currently extremely worried about the financial aid situation in regular decisions.\n\nIs this true?",
