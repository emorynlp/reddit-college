  "text": "my parents are what you can call the \"typical indian (extra)strict parents\". like any other indian student, i've been preparing for the JEE which is a national level engineering entrance examination, for over two years now. yes, i hate it. yes, i regret choosing to do this. yes, i have the worst anxiety and panic attacks every day. about a week ago i gave my first JEE attempt (we get 4 attempts), and surprise surprise, i basically failed it. the results are gonna be out soon and once my parents find out- they're definitely gonna chuck me out of the house. and no i'm not being dramatic. as a cherry on top- i was deferred from two US universities that i applied early to. i just really want to disappear. everything hurts. i hate this.\n\nedit- i've been crying all day and i finally got myself to open reddit. and i am dumbfounded at the amount of support. my mood has been lifted and i'm so so so BEYOND THANKFUL for everyone who has sent me suggestions, love and awards and who has resonated with me. you guys are amazing.

I'm sure deep down they love you but it's also important to stand up for yourself. Don't let such negativity affect you and stay strong. Just know that an exam result or some score doesn't define what you as a person are capable of doing. And I'm not just saying this for the sake of it. Really, a good college education doesn't predicate or determine any kind of success in today's world. You can always go on to do great things. Also, colleges don't make people great, people make colleges great so don't be stressed about JEE and getting a good college. Make sure you try and figure out what to study and study st you're engaged in from a fun place! Dw it all works out in the end if you're positive and self-motivated!",

Forget what your parents think is a feasible career. EXAMPLE: someone in my family failed at both becoming a doctor and an engineer in India, trained in architecture instead, found out it was what he really liked as someone with math/modelling/sketching/structural interests, graduated and immigrated to the States, started his own architecture/contracting company, and is now *very* wealthy. If you want to study engineering, go for it! You still have three more retakes, which to me sounds like this one doesn't really matter. All it means is you'll have to study for a couple more months, so think of this as a trial run. Your parents won't kick you out, or they would be screwing your next three JEE chances because of a first bad run. I'm sorry you feel like this, OP. I know that Indian exams put a lot of stress and are among the hardest in the world. I believe in you to succeed. Everything might hurt right now, but please pull through it. You've got this!",

Think about it, people are so crazy they consider a 90 percentile bad, I know so many who consider a 98 percentile bad. I fail to understand how being in the top 10% or top 2% of a nation is a failure on YOUR part- it's a failure on the part of our country that we can't support even the top 10% of our population with a top tier education. You apply to the US and you're in the top 10 percent, you'll get into a T20! If you're in the US and in the top 2% you can get into Harvard! It just shows how ultra competitive and downright toxic our competitive mentality is. Please, please don't let some marks you get in a test that's DESIGNED to demean you define your existence; I promise you that you're so much more than that rank. Wishing you great luck in your future runs, and also please be open to exploring other options as well! So many people have been deferred these early rounds- just hope for the best for RD and remember there's some brilliant places in India too that aren't IIT but give you an education at par with them!",

For every 100 farmers they are going to need 1 soil scientist and 1 plant diagnostics person . These weird jobs nobody has really heard about are basically sitting there waiting for someone to apply . I just recently did a job search in Bangladesh, and with just an associates of science  degree in plant management I could move there and make more money than a majority of the people living in Bangladesh. It\u2019s crazy . Best decision I ever made .",

UCSB isn't the \"IIT\" of the US, but it's the place that really cultivated his interested in EECS and set him up to be successful-- unlike the \"prestigious\" IIT he went to for 4 years. my point is, you don't have to do well on the JEE bc IITs are not the end all be all. if you have passion to learn, it doesn't matter where you go. there are many ppl who didn't do well on that test who are now quite successful (ie current ceo of microsoft)",

There won't be a shortage of opportunities to make for yourself. Your parents disappointment will be temporary and they will get over it eventually. You don't owe your sanity to them.

If your parents judges your worth based on your academic performance (or any kind of performance), they are sorely mistaken, and I truly hope that they realize that. Keep your heart and mind guarded, and never sell them for \"success,\" for anything. Your college deferrals mean nothing. Your JEE is just a test, and a single test doesn't shape you. A qualifying AP score doesn't shape you. Your value doesn't lie in those things, it lies in your confidence, in your compassion, in your kindness. Those are the things that shape you. Not some title, not some AP score. They're the things that you choose every day.\n\nAn additional thing that didn't really apply to the other one. If your parents kick you out because you don't measure up to their standards of worth, I'm sorry for them, and I'm sorry for you. It pains me that kids have to go through that experience, and I hope that they would realize that you are so much more than all of those things that I mentioned. After 17/18 years of supporting you and providing for you, to throw all of that away over one test score and a few college decisions seems kind of silly.",

There has to be something you like about it.

But if they could understand 100%, they wouldn't be like that I swear. But you have to understand that due to generation gap or something, they don't think the same way as you do. Everybody's views are built on what they experience all throughout their life ; so now you see the life they have been seeing isnt the same as that you have been seeing. Therefore, they don't think the same way as u.  NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. SO PLS DONT BE RUDE TOWARDS UR PARENTS NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO TO YOU. WITHOUT THEIR HEARTS, YOU CAN NEVER WIN ANYTHING I SWEAR. \n\nNow as for what u might do, you might do some research with a professor, then get a recommendation letter from them, which will help you tons to get into a good US college. Try emailing profs. Maybe you will have to email 60-70 profs before one of them replies. If they reject, don't be rude to them, instead thank them for their time. Respect their busy schedule.  You can't say you never need their help later. Finally, NEVER GIVE UP ON ANYTHING. LIFE MIGHT HAVE SOME SURPRISE READY FOR YOU, BUT FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO REACH THAT POINT OF YOUR LIFE TRYING AND FAILING. SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH U FAIL, NEVER GIVE UP.\nBest of luck!",
