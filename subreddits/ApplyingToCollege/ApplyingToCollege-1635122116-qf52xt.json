  "text": "Yeah... I'm not applying ED to anywhere because my grades last year were bad and I wanted first semester grades of this year to boost my GPA before applying. Even so, my GPA won't be the best by far so I'm looking for any T40 schools that care the least about GPA as opposed to my stronger points, ECs and essays. I know that all schools will consider GPA one of if not the most important factor, more so than ECs or essays, but I'm looking for schools where the ratio is closer, more 3:2 than 5:1 if you will. Preferably with an ED 2 option.\n\nThanks y'all.",

If you\u2019re interested in living in urban/suburban areas I would recommend looking at Swarthmore, Pomona, Reed, Wellesley/Bryn Mawr/Barnard (if you\u2019re a girl). But there are way more good LACs",
