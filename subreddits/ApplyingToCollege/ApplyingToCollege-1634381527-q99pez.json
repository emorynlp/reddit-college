      "text": "Not exactly related, but you should probably ensure that you can pay for both before applying as an international student. UCLA is about 60k per year and USC is 80k. That excludes one-time costs and travel costs (which will be higher for international students). Both do not offer any fin aid for internationals, with UCLA not offering scholarships either. USC offers very, very limited and competitive scholarships that about 1% of applicants receive.",
