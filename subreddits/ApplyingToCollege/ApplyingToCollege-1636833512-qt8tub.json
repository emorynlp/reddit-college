      "text": "The college will certainly know, as application fee payment is a requirement for a complete application. So either payment receipt or waiver receipt would need to be noted.\n\nAO\u2019s who actually evaluate your application may not know/see it, as it shouldn\u2019t factor into an admission decision. (Even at need-aware schools, the \u201cwill you require financial aid\u201d question means a lot more than the application fee).",
