Getting the acceptance means a great deal to me, but I don't feel like I got the chance to underscore that enough in my application, as none of the essay questions were on the topic of why I want to go. Would it be beneficial to write the Office of Undergraduate Admissions directly and reaffirm my desire to transfer? I typed up a short letter (<250 words) about why the school means a lot to me (the academics, the culture, the school spirit, etc). There are about 3 more weeks until decisions come out, but it's all I can think about. Transfer is quite competitive, and I was waitlisted/rejected when I applied for freshman year.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR: Would it benefit/hurt me to send the Admissions Office a love letter post-applying?", "author": "Gamecock_", "created": 1585106492, "retrieved": 1632960589, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
