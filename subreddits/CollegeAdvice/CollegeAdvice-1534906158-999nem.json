Always wanted to make glowing plants and they're the people I would need to work with. But I've been looking around and from what I can see is that maybe biotechnology isn't something that is too financially secure. Should I keep going and eventually work toward a doctorates, in the hopes that I can get to a place I can make enough money to support a family and maybe complete life goals or should I jump ship and get on a different degree before I have to go to university?", "author": "Glowdo", "created": 1534906158, "retrieved": 1632961629, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
