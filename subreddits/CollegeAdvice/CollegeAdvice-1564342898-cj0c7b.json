I just earned my associates in general education and I still yet don't know what major I would to like pursue. I am currently 21 years old and so far the majors I was interested in were radiology and Marine Biology. Two completely different fields. Any pointers or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am also taking an online course on how to teach English around the world. Should be receiving a certificate this August and I still don't know if I should continue my education. I'm really confused and feel hopeless at this point.", "author": "Jpzzzz14", "created": 1564342898, "retrieved": 1632848899, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"evcxzy0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cj0c7b/confuessed/evcxzy0/", "text": "Earning something in radiology could be a great paying career, if your college offers the right certification. Go to a counselor and ask them what their job placement ratio is for that program. If its low or they can\u2019t tell you its a bad idea.\n\nPersonally, I took art as my extra curricular classes in high school, so I pursued art in college. You might be interested in journalistic writing or editing, or Data Analysis. \n\nWhat do you do in your spare time, or what channels do you watch on youtube? There are always jobs for professional video editing.", "author": null, "created": 1564425785, "upvotes": 1}}}
