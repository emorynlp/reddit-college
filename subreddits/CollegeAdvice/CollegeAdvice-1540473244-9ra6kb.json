  "text": "I take a public speaking course and the teacher doesn\u2019t really tell us what to do but I continue to receive low grades and I don\u2019t know why. Her lectures include, \u201cyou can do something like this video, or not, you can make it your own\u201d or teaches the content in the book and ends with \u201cI don\u2019t really agree with any of this\u201d. \n\nWe get graded on our speeches presented the to class but so far I have presented three speeches and I only have the grade from the very first one. It\u2019s hard to improve if I don\u2019t even know what I am doing wrong. \n\nIs there any way I can tell the teacher I don\u2019t agree with her teaching methods, while not being rude and hopefully seeing some sort of change?
