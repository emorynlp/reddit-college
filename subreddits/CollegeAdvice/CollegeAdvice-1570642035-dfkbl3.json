At this point, i am now thinking, is it better to have a bachelor degree in anything than nothing?", "text": "I am 24 years old and going to be finished with my associates in the middle of December. I kind of regret trying to finish my associates degree as fast as i can, because I am now realizing I need more time to think what I really want to do. I applied to some four year schools and applied as an undeclared major and now i am freaking out that i got accepted into some schools, i need to submit a commitment fee within 14 days and i have no idea now if i really want to go to a four year college especially since I am not sure what career I want. I choose psychology at first because I thought I would like to be a counselor but now I don't think I want to be. Not to mention I am not sure if I have the drive or money to go for a master degree, I hear the field is very competitive and does not enough jobs.\n\nIt seems every interest I have in a career involves a master degree and I don't want to get into a lot of debt, and master's degree are very pricey. I wish I was smart enough to study computer science, engineering, or accounting, a career that will leave me financial stable with a just bachelor degree. i thought of accounting since it seems a decent job for an introvert like me and decent pay and a bit more doable than the other two, but I got lost quickly when I tried at some accounting lessons, I am not good with numbers and fear I will mess things up fast,\n\nDo you think its a better to have a bachelor degree in anything vs no bachelor degree? I dont want to waste my time or waste my federal aid on a major that wont return much investment.  But I also feel I need bachelor degree to for that boost on my resume. I have been thinking of putting off some time for my bachelor degree and maybe work a little bit and then go back when I am sure of what I want. But I feel I will never figure it out , I feel I am having a crisis, I have no passion for anything  (depression also comes into play here)  I just want a decent paying and stable job that will leave me feeling ok,  don't we all? especially since I live in a expensive and competitive city. but I feel pressured and so far behind for a 24 year old (soon to be 25 omg), I feel I should have gotten my bachelor's and have a starting job by now :/ \n\nI feel I am in a crisis. I am considering being a counselor, a nutritionist, a teacher, (in my state), etcc. and turns out I need a master's degree for all of that and kinda crossed most of those off my list.", "author": "imaconfusedmess", "created": 1570642035, "retrieved": 1632960524, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f357e85": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dfkbl3/about_to_finish_my_associate_degree_in_psychology/f357e85/", "text": "Teaching and social work don't require graduate degrees.

There\u2019s also a TON of scholarships available. Additionally, you may get lucky enough to find a company to work for that has partnered with some universities, and will help pay for it. For instance, I work for a company in the psychology field, and they\u2019re partnered with some schools and pay a percentage of their employee\u2019s grad program (e.g. masters program in X field).\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m poor and completely understand your money concerns. We\u2019re the same age, and I also have an Associate\u2019s in psychology, but I want to stress to you to KEEP GOING. Time is going to keep on passing, so you might as well get your Bachelor\u2019s, and the debt is debt you\u2019re going to get anyway in the form of bills, mortgage (lol, in this economy?), credit cards, etc. So, if you\u2019re going to get debt, it might as well be for a master\u2019s. You know? \n\n\nI REALLY hope this gains traction and other, far more wiser, people can comment.", "author": "papasoulless", "created": 1570643981, "upvotes": 2}}}
