However, when my 5 college classes went online, I did not adjust well, and I am now trying to keep my grades in the A's, but it is not looking good. By the end of this semester, I am probably going to have the following grades in total: 13 A's, 6 B's, and 1 C. That brings my GPA down from a 3.86 to a 3.6!\n\nMy plan for college is this: attend community college and earn my associate's in general studies, then attend a local university for a bachelor's in micobiology, then attend a larger university for my master's in biotech or genetics.\n\nWith all of that in mind, should I be concerned about all of these B's, and should I retake all of them? If I make a 4.0 at my local university, but I end up with a 3.6 at my community college, will that lower my chances of getting accepted into a school like UCSD or Rice? I would ask my adviser all of these questions, but they have not responded to my email, and I am beginning to panic.", "author": "danfurbiss", "created": 1585849979, "retrieved": 1632848319, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmaohfq": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ftqz1m/should_i_retake_classes_i_have_earned_bs_in/fmaohfq/", "text": "Nope.
