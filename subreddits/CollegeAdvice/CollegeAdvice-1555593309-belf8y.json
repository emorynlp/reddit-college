After high school i didnt know what i wanted to do so I joined the air force and I have been in for 6 years now. Ive dabbled in many different prospective fields such as logistics, safety, contracting, business and medical but the one I loved the most was veterinarian. I absolutely LOVE working with animals and I know I would never have any regrets doing that. The only issue is I have my gi bill (covers about 4 years of school) and that's about it. I dont know whether I should put my dream aside to get some sort of a job after college or go for my dream?", "author": "12bengals12", "created": 1555593309, "retrieved": 1632961514, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"el6q2cx": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/belf8y/choosing_a_major/el6q2cx/", "text": "Have you thought about an animal science major?
