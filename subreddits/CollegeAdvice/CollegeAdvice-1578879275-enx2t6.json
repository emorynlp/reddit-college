What now?", "text": "I\u2019m in the second half of receiving a degree in Early Childhood Education. Specifically, I have three semesters left. The thing is, I chose education as my career path in my sophomore year of high school before beginning my first year of college classes in high school (yes, I was one of those \u201cgifted\u201d children). Looking back, I feel like I just chose education because it was the first thing that popped into my head, and then after that, I just kept saying \u201ceducation\u201d when people asked me what I wanted to do. I was 15 when I chose my career path, and I\u2019ve just been kind of rolling along with it ever since. The thing is, I know what I love. I love writing! I took a lot of english classes back in high school, and I actually only have two semesters of course work left before I can receive a creative writing degree. That\u2019s what I really want, but I\u2019m worried about disappointing my family. Everyone is so \u201cproud\u201d of me for becoming a teacher, and they keep telling me that \u201cit\u2019ll be different once I have my own classroom\u201d. What should I do??", "author": null, "created": 1578879275, "retrieved": 1632960803, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
