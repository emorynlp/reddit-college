I have my AA in general studies and have decided to take a break until I am sure of what I want to major in. Originally, I was an engineering major but I now work at an engineering firm and it\u2019s really not something I\u2019m interested in pursuing anymore. I then thought of accounting and took two accounting classes, but I found those classes boring and even challenging as well. Before I take anymore classes and to avoid wasting time and money, I want to have a solid idea and understanding of my major. I am open to any ideas or suggestions aside from the medical field. I enjoy math, science is okay, and reading/writing I excel at. My latest idea of major was elementary school teacher however, what holds me back is dealing with parents or troubled students, I\u2019m not sure how I would handle that.  So any suggestions or advice about majors I\u2019ve mentioned, or ones I haven\u2019t are welcome. Try to sell me on your major!

Since it seems you are more into math and science, there is a subdivision of marketing called Integrated Marketing Communications which has some strategy and math involved. Maybe see if your school offers something along those lines. Marketing is very versatile and it can go from creating graphics for ads to conducting market research. It's completely ok to try something out and try something else instead.

If so, you should take a look at I.t. Security or some sort of cyber crimes or computer science. It's probably pretty interesting, involved a good amount of math, and job prospects are many.
