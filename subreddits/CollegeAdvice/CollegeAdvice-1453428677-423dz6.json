I also have a $1K scholarship I can redeem, or upgrade to $3K if I challenge the provincial diploma exam for a course I upgraded (and got an A in!). I'm pursuing a degree in computer science and after tuition and textbooks, government loans cover only 1/3 of living expenses. Given that 2-3 hours of work are expected outside of each 1 hour class, full-time studies can consume up to 64 hours each week and I'm not sure I should add 16 hours of part-time work to that mix.\n\nI tried something similar when I was working 40 hours/week and chose to upgrade, which takes about 10-16 hours per week. Needless to say, it did not turn out well and I had to drop out of the upgrading course. While taking 2 courses at the university, I upgraded one of my high school sciences to a 4.0 GPA (an afternoon course at a post secondary institution 30 minutes away from campus).\n\nReddit, what say you? I tried asking student services and my family for advice, and they just kept pointing to other resources, rather than having a discussion with me.\n\nShould I be working as a fulltime student, or should I max out loans so that I can focus on my studies?\nShould I be worrying about loans, or are they a necessary evil?\nAre there compelling reasons *not* to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science?", "author": "SeekingNoLedge", "created": 1453428677, "retrieved": 1632961074, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
