I was looking into colleges for history major, but I was told that the school you go to to become a teacher is the place you get registered (in the United states not sure how it is in other places). I was interested in going to school overseas but eventually teach back in the states but the only issue I face is, I have no clue what schools I should look at. I have a general idea for where i wanna go to school. Preferably the UK as I am interested in their history. Any advice for this would be helpful.

These tests are specific to the state.\n\nSo yes, if you are planning on going out of state, or even another country... it\u2019s a better idea to major in the subject material you actually find interesting- like you said history.\n\nIn Texas, people with a bachelors degree in another field can still become teachers by going through a certification program ( not another degree.)\n\nKeep in mind that if you go out of the country, your evaluation of credits may be a little complex. Typically your transcripts will have to go through a foreign evaluation company and you may or may not need additional credits to meet the criteria for the board of education in your area.
