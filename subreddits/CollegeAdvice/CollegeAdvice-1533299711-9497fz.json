  "title:": "Majors that deal with Electricity - inquiry",
  "text": "Hey all.\n\nI think I want to change my major to something with electricity.  Which major should I look at?  Here's a little context of my experience so far:\n\nI'm a network systems administrator, which I love, and also a ham radio operator, which I love.  I've always been fascinated with science, especially energy and electricity.  I would love a mesh of IT and electrical engineering, but I'm not sure what path to take.  I've been going to school for CS, cause I love computers, but I'm not feeling into coding really, but it doesn't bug me per se.  I'm just way more fascinated with physics and energy and electricity and signal, especially signal transmission and control.\n\nThanks for any input!",
