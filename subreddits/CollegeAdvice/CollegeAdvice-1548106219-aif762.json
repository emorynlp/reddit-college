I took a semester off to make money. Anyways, I recently made contact with my roommate. Seems like a super cool, nice guy. But for some reason he insists that he and his boys on the floor can \"thrash\".\n\nNow I aint no fool. I seen a whole lot in my day. But what the hell is thrashing? I know it to be a verb meaning strike or attack. I feel like this is some frat boy talk but I dont want to look like a dweeb and ask him.\n\nAny you college vets know what this dude is on about? I've sought out several people and no one knows what it is.\n\nMy current thought is that its a party slang, but I am merely trying to be in the know, so as not to look like a fool.
