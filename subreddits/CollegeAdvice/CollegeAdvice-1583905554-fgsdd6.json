  "text": "So my daughter is graduating this year from High School and I am making her a book about life/college advice as she heads off to college. The advice is coming from family and friends many of whom have not been in college for many years.  So...I'm reaching out to the Internet for some College / Life Hacks from people that are only a few years ahead of her.  \n\nThis is a fishing expedition and I can't wait to her the wisdom of the internet.    Here are a few thought starters...\n\nAdvice on transition into your freshman year, roommates, going to the library or going out on Thursday nights?..  Dating, Parties, Internships, Classwork, Job interviews, negotiating a job offer, Finance, money management, credit cards, self care, grocery shopping, social media, taking risks, ... \n\nWhat is the best college advice you ever got that you want to pay it forward?\n\nOr advice you wish you would have gotten and had to learn the hard way?\n\nSerious or Funny... I'll take it all.  I'll buy the really good ones a Starbucks.",

      "text": "- keep peppermint tea in your apartment/dorm. Its heavenly on a sore throat and really soothing before bed \n- Beans. And. Rice. Those big bags of dehydrated beans you see at the grocery store? Holy shit, buy one. It's a whole weeks worth of meals during finals. \n- diseases spread like wildfire on college campuses. Keep Clorox wipes in your dorm or apartment and wash your hands WITH SOAP \n\n-if you menstruate, try a menstrual cup. It's worth every penny. \n\n-Get a plastic seat cover for your bike. OOh my God. Nothing is worse than sitting in class with wet pants because it was raining and your bike got wet. \n\n-on that note, consider investing in some good rain boots. Doc Martins are my go to because I can lace them tight to my ankle.\n\n- if you choose to drink, there is this company called undercover colors that makes a test you can use to see if your drink has been spiked. \n\n- if you need furniture for an apartment, go to estate sales. They have high quality stuff for really cheap. \n\n-forget walmart, shop at the dollar tree if you really need to save money. They have a surprising amount of food.\n\n-(especially if you're in the U.S) some doctors offices will still work with you if you dont have insurance. Some places will do a sliding scale based on your income so you only pay what you can afford. Some places have charity programs. Some doctors are just good people who dont want you to suffer.\n\n-check for scholarships every year. You never know when you might qualify for a new one. \n\n- do volunteer work thats relevant to your major. It looks good on a resume. \n\n-Get tested for STDs and wear condoms. \n\n- eat some broccoli once in a while. -You need to eat vegetables or you're going to feel like shit. \n\n- figure out studying methods that work for you. The way you study might be completely different from your friends. If it feels dumb but it works then it's not dumb.\n\n-some schools offer free tutoring. If you're struggling, take them up on it.\n\n- prerequisite classes are mindnumbingly easy. When you get into your major is when you get into the harder stuff.\n\n- caffeine will not fix your lack of sleep. You'll still be tired, just faster. \n\n- try to take at least one class you'll actually enjoy each semester.\n\n-dont get a credit card as a freshmen. DONT GET A CREDIT CARD AS A FRESHMAN. I've seen too many people go into debt from freshman credit cards.\n\n- apparently, you're supposed to write a thank you note to your interviewer after you interview for a job. I think that's stupid and outdated but make sure you do it anyway.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry the formatting is weird and I'm sorry this is kind of long lol",

      "text": "My husband is a professor.  One advice I have is to go to office hours and introduce yourself.   Just do it.  It may feel awkward, but you are paying to go to college and that includes direct help from professor or teaching assistant.   Also, later you may want a letter of rec from a prof.  It\u2019s easier to ask someone you have talked to before. Never be afraid to ask for help or a letter of rec etc.   It is part of their job description. They are just regular people.",
