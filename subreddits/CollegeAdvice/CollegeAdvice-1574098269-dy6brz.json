I was originally interested in veterinary studies. I lost interest and was talked to by a friend about engineering, I grew up working on cars with my dad so he recommended Mechanical Engineering. \n\nI applied to ASU and was accepted into the systems program for mechanical engineering because my GPA wasn\u2019t good enough for the bachelors program. I had a 2.89 and needed a 3.0. My advisor recommended retaking classes to better my grade while also taking some of the classes that were locked for the degree. \n\nThat was working ok for me but my GPA wasn\u2019t moving, I made it to 2.91 then I got to this semester and I have hit a wall. I have no motivation I\u2019ve been in college for almost 7 years and I have an associates degree to show for it. I don\u2019t even know if Mechanical interests me anymore. I want to look for something more hands on. Something that still gets me close to automotive. \n\nI could use some advice. I\u2019m lost, I don\u2019t know what to do. The friends and loved ones around me understand my frustration but don\u2019t understand my lack of motivation and I\u2019m just seeking other people\u2019s thoughts, an outside source.", "author": "Hunter21609", "created": 1574098269, "retrieved": 1632848760, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f7yv9td": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dy6brz/college_student_looking_for_advice/f7yv9td/", "text": "I am in a similar situation myself. My best advice would be to do the best you can and finish the program you are in now. After you get your certificate or degree you can choose where you work. A diploma mostly just shows you can learn and understand abstract concepts, and you have a fair amount of flexibility as to what kind of jobs you can apply for once you\u2019re out of college. Something hands on is definitely not out of the question you just have to apply for those positions.", "author": "ElevenMeow", "created": 1574101237, "upvotes": 1}}}
