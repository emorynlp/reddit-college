I'm kind of kicking myself 3 years later after graduating for not doing a game design degree in the first place because I don't have any useful skills now for actually making games (I don't have any coding/programming knowledge and my art is just okay). I currently work at a game company doing customer support and it's fine, but I definitely can't do it forever. \n\nI'm now considering if I should go back to school and get a second bachelor's in Computer Science/Game design so that I can actually be capable of making games lol. I don't think I could jump in and just start doing a Masters in CS since due to my gap in knowledge. I also know there are lots of free resources online to learn pretty much anything but being held accountable to an actual course makes it easier for me to stay on schedule and learn quicker. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice I receive!", "author": "Whatever21ism", "created": 1581624790, "retrieved": 1632961139, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fhm9qii": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f3g23n/should_i_get_a_second_bachelors_in_computer/fhm9qii/", "text": "Maybe try some free courses first and see how you catch onto them? Maybe you\u2019ll surprise yourself and be able to go for the masters. I just decided to go back to school too because I was thinking, would I be pissed at myself in four years that I didn\u2019t do it? In the scheme of life four years isn\u2019t a lot if you do end up going back for the bachelors. The years will go by anyway might as well reach the goal you know you want.", "author": "swansonlj", "created": 1581710090, "upvotes": 1}}}
