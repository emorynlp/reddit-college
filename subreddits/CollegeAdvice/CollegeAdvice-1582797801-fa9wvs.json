  "text": "Does anyone have any experience finding an artistic or BA that pays fairly well? I\u2019m more of an artistic person but have a science side and I\u2019m wanting to stick with sciences because job security. (While I do actually enjoy the sciences, not doing it just for job security), I\u2019m still curious if there\u2019s actually an arts that has that security that anyone has found? Also I know what it\u2019s like to really struggle with money so doing something even though it pays crap unfortunately doesn\u2019t appeal to me anymore. I don\u2019t want to struggle my whole life.",
