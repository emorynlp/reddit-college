I don't get why people have to spend twice the amount of time doing homework. I personally only have two subjects I need to study for (astronomy and anthropology) and if I split up the readings I can be able to finish it in less than 3-4 hours. The other classes are Fundamentals of Speech, Calc 2, and Chinese. Chinese is a easy A for me since I don't really have to study for it until the day before the test since I already know a lot of it since I speak Chinese. I usually don't get a lot of homework from that class and the homework that I get can usually be finished within a hour. This is the same with my public speaking class, and I don't really have to study for that class either unless before a test. \n\nThis is another reason why I believe that it's still possible to work full time everyday and still be able to keep up. But I know that alot of people would disagree with this as I realized that some students take around 10 hours or more on homework. I just don't get why so much people require that much time. \n\nWhat do you think, is five - six hours enough?", "author": "chenthehen", "created": 1586474930, "retrieved": 1632960574, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "comments": {"fmyeozv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fy33sy/why_isnt_5_hours_enough_to_finish_your_homework/fmyeozv/", "text": "My last year of college I spent around 30 hours a week studying and doing homework (3 hours a night mon-friday, 8 hours on sat /sun).

I have a pretty difficult (medical field) course and am taking more than 8 subjects, 4 majors subjects, but 5 hours of homework per day is too much. 5 hours of review however, for exams, is too little. I have a friend who does homework for hours on end because her (also difficult) business course has a lot of math in it and she's taking a double degree.

Some people may have minors, certificates, or are pre health or pre law. I myself am pre med and on top of 15 hours of classes and all the homework that comes with it, I also have to study for the MCAT and take extra care to make sure all my classes allow me to get into medical school", "author": "kylieb209", "created": 1586477413, "upvotes": 3}}}
