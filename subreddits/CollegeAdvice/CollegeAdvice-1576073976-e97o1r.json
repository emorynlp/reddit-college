So I recently decided to go back to school and want to go to school for social work. My end goal would be working with social services, or CPS. What major should I focus on, and what steps should I take to meet my goal? I just finished my first semester of community college undecided, so I would love some advice on what degree would be best. \n\nI am taking my classes online, as I work nights, and I am doing all of the registration and planning on my own as the school I attend requires face-to-face meetings and is not close to where I live.

I assume that will be pretty standard. Second, you need to figure out where you are going to transfer and what human service related bachelors they offer. Lastly, work with the school you intend to transfer to and find out what courses transfer from your current school and fulfill degree requirements for that major. Also ask any requirements for transfer admissions into the school/program. If the schools are close to each other, they probably have very good resources for the transfer, if not it might take you more work. It really needs to be driven by the destination schools degree and admissions requirements, not the community colleges interpretation of those requirements.", "author": "drock13", "created": 1576076921, "upvotes": 1}}}
