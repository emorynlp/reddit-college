I'm a hardcore nihilist with no affinity for optimism. Probably one of the laziest people to ever exist. I'm a high school senior with a 2.79 UW 3.246 W GPA. I never do homework or pay attention in class and I sleep in most of them. I want to stop doing this to myself but I can't even try to try. I've taken 4 college classes so far and gotten B's in all of them. I only got into mediocre schools (WVU, Pitt and Penn State) and got waitlisted at Tulane. I only got into those last two even because I have a 1400 SAT and 31 ACT. How can I not make the same mistakes and do well in college so I can get into a good law or grad school? How can I make myself want a good life enough?", "author": "paniniwar", "created": 1585600881, "retrieved": 1632960398, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
