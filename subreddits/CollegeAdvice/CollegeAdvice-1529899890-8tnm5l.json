This past spring semester I had a severe and extended bout of depression and stubbornly kept refusing to face the fact that I was failing. I dropped classes one after another, and ended up withdrawing completely just before final exams when I admitted my grades were unsalvageable. This summer I've been better in terms of health, but unfortunately my math skills haven't improved along with it. I've signed up for a calculus sequence, both of which are the last prerequisites I need to transfer into my desired major and start taking classes needed for that degree. I even re-enrolled for this fall with one of these major-specific classes on my schedule, BUT I need to provide a transcript with passing grades for the prerequisites when the semester begins. As it looks so far, however, I overestimated my ability to learn a semesters worth of calculus in a month (and relearn all the trig and algebra I haven't used for years). It's a very real possibility I might fail a second time and not be able to provide those grades. At this point, I would have 6 credits hours for this upcoming fall semester should I fail to pass my summer coursework. I'm trying desperately to find a solution that doesn't waste my time. Would it be a waste of time and money to take only 6 hours for an entire semester of my junior year? Is there a way to test out of taking 2 calculus courses?", "author": "HandelianKetch", "created": 1529899890, "retrieved": 1632961647, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
