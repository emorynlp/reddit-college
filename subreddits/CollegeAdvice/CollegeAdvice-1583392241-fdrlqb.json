  "title:": "Leave town for college or stay for boyfriend?",
  "text": "Disclaimer: I understand that for this situation everyone's knee jerk reaction is \"go to college, don't make your future life decisions based on your boyfriend\" but there are other factors to consider here.\n\nI (17m) got into some decent schools, CSUs and Portland State, and I want to go, but I'm not fully sure if I'm ready to yet. I crave independence, and I desperately want to move out of my parent's house, but I don't handle change very well and might be too lonely leaving everyone I have ever known behind, plus I'm not super confident that my major, animation, is what I really wanna do/will make a career.\n\nIf I were to stay in town, my school has a very good community college that both of my older sisters went to then transferred, and I'm thinking maybe I could move into a house with my boyfriend and some other students in a type of commune situation. I know another group of students who go there and live in a house together like that now, it's kinda the dream. But I would be delaying the future and kinda living in a limbo/purgatory for two years, which might make me feel stuck in a rut.\n\nSure, I'd be putting off my future, and it would be bad to not do do something based off the fact that I don't want to leave my boyfriend, sure I might feel resentment if we break up and I didn't choose to go somewhere new, but all I know is that it's gonna hurt so much if I have to leave him. I don't think I can handle that. I also don't think I could handle a long distance relationship, it would hurt too much missing him all the time.\n\nWhat do I do?",

I say transfer first, figure out what it is you really want to do, then go from there. I think the idea for the living situation is p great!",

      "text": "OP, in my personal experience I absolutely wish I would\u2019ve left to have this experience. I understand the bond between you and s/o but you will miss out on so much. I myself had so much opportunity to leave and I chose to stay for a better priced institution and my s/o. Being a commuter sucks, it\u2019s basically high school except everyone around you is making lifelong bonds and you\u2019re completely out of the loop and I\u2019ve heard the same from friends that went community that they wish they could\u2019ve had that experience. And personally this stress of trying to convince myself that staying was my best choice causes so much more stress to my relationship to the point that I feel I\u2019m ruining it. I was in your shoes and I chose to stay and I regret it every day. So my opinion is go OP. I know several students at my uni that make their long distances work and several that didn\u2019t. It all depends person to person. Or maybe a fresh start is best. But my opinion is to go on this journey because the opportunity to pick up and move into a whole other life is kind of once in a lifetime. But I\u2019m not you, so do what your heart is telling you. If you want to message about my personal experiences good and bad feel free. Good luck OP, and remember this is about what\u2019s best for you.",

          "text": "If it makea you feel any better, I went to a 4 year college and didnt make any \"life long bonds.\" I havent seen or talked to anyone I went to school with since I graduated. Most of the people I met only met up to study and then would watch netflix or play video games on their time off. Most people didnt seem to have any interest in making friends so I quickly learned to just focus on my studies, hit the gym, and tried to keep up with the friends I already had outside of school. I often ate meals by myself but most of the people there seemed to be doing the same thing. They were just on their phones or studying all the time.",

      "text": "College is an investment in YOU.\n\nI personally think it's best to just get college over with as soon as you can. If your partner is not willing to be faithful to you, then there is a problem. They should be supportive of you and not controlling.\n\nAlso, be kinda wary; relationships at 18 at kinda iffy. Teen relationships may not always last either.\n\nBut most importantly, compare tuition rates and how much is covered. If you go out to dorm, you must keep track of your spending. I personally think community college might be a better choice because it's usually cheaper.",
