You don\u2019t need straight A\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean you should just be barely passing all of your courses. I heavily rely on my academic scholarships so I needed to maintain my GPA to about a 3.0. Not to mention that at most universities, if you have a 2.0 or below, you\u2019ll have an academic probation. If that continues, you could be kicked out. If you have the pell grant, you need to maintain a 2.0 gpa anyway to keep getting it. If you plan to do any research, internship, or try to do certain programs or opportunities at your university, there might be a gpa requirement. \n\nI do want to be clear that I\u2019m not saying that getting a low grade in a course is the end of the world. You shouldn\u2019t be sacrificing your mental and physical health for a grade. College is more than just that. Just don\u2019t cruise around and do the absolute minimum.", "author": "Gahhh2018", "created": 1586316967, "upvotes": 1}}}
