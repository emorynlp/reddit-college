  "text": "Hi I have a B.A. from UCLA in English and my current goal is to get a PHD in physics, astrophysics, or a closely related field. By next spring I will have an Associates in Physical Sciences from a community college. I am pretty sure that this will be nearly impossible without a Bachelor's in Physics or a related field, but from what I have seen online so far there are basically no good schools that even accept applications from students who already have a Bachelor's, even if it's unrelated. Anyone have help or advice for me? (please!) I'm thinking I might have to take all the necessary classes as a \"non-degree seeking\" student then apply to a PHD program?",
