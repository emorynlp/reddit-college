  "text": "Hi! I'm planning on transferring from a smaller college to University of Georgia, which I've heard isn't thaaat difficult. However, I'm taking an online class this semester and currently have a 58. The semester will be over soon and my teacher said he would help a few weeks ago, but I think I may have waited too long. Is it worse to take my chances or should I withdraw and get a WF? How bad does a WF look on a transfer transcript?",
