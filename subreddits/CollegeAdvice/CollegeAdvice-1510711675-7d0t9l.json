What magnitude does dropping two critical classes have in the future?", "text": "I stumbled too hard, for too long, during the transition into college. The damage has been done. I have spent the last month trying to put it all to put it all together, even after I was doing alright for a while before. But I had fucked up way too hard already.\nBottom line....\nI am majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Calculus is completely lost. I HAVE to drop it. I have crunched the numbers, and emailed the teacher. Even if I perform amazingly in the next test and final, its a lost cause. Physics is better, but it's a huge risk if I fail.\nThis is my first semester in college. So these would be the only dropped classes, so far. But my worry is that they are the two most important classes in my schedule. I simply fucked up.\nGenerally speaking, how would this affect me? I was planning on doing an internal transfer. (I am in the \"college of Arts and Science\"; want to change into Engineering.) But I'm certain that the chances of starting Spring in there have closed for me.\nWhat magnitude would these drops hold, over time? If I perform well next semester, and probably take a course or two over summer, would these set me too far back?\nAnybody gone through this?", "author": "Alt454638292", "created": 1510711675, "retrieved": 1632849508, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
