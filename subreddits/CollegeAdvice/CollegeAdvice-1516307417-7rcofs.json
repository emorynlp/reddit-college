I'm currently looking at universities in British Columbia and trying to compare a few of my choices to figure out my best option but I'm having trouble wading through all the information to make any good comparisons.\n\nI'm looking at UBC, UBCO, SFU, and UFV at the moment. I've heard really good things about UBC but SFU is much cheaper. I also noticed that UFV is pretty inexpensive but I think I'd get a bit depressed being in such a small town. If anyone has any personal experience with these universities, especially in Psychology, I'd really appreciate any advice you could give. \n\nAlso as another note, does it really matter that much if it's just for a Bachelor Honors degree right now? Could I end up shooting myself in the foot or is it mostly just personal preference? My parents never went to uni so we're all a bit stuck haha.", "author": "bitmiffed", "created": 1516307417, "retrieved": 1632959966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
