I am only one semester into college but I have found myself having such emotional lows here and I don't know if I can continue at this pace without some sort of gap year. Basically all my life I thought that grades were everything. I graduated high school at the top of my class then went to college in an honors program and on a scholarship. But when I got here I realized how closed off I had been to other things in life and how I honestly wasn't happy even though I had good grades. I obsess over grades but don't make time for family or friends and I am unhappy most of the time. But now that I've had this realization I literally feel like I just opened my eyes to the world and I want to live in it differently than I have been. I feel like I need time to get away from school to find myself now that I am accepting that grades aren't all I am. I don't know what I want to major in anymore, school is very expensive, and I have this motivation to get real world experience not just sit in a classroom like I have for the last four years. I really want to volunteer abroad for a couple months to figure out who I even am and gain a new perspective. Is it crazy to leave school or is it wise to face this crisis head on?", "author": "Emoexistentialist24", "created": 1575328177, "retrieved": 1632848746, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
