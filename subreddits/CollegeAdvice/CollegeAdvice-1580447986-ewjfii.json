  "text": "I want to be a Japanese teacher when I grow up. I live in Washington state and I wanted to find a good not too expensive online college university from WA (so it's not too expensive) that teaches Japanese. It's a bit hard to find one that teaches Japanese. Do any of you guys know a good college universities that teaches Japanese online?",

      "text": "Ay man, I have absolutely no experience with colleges yet but I think you could save a shit ton of money taking cheaper courses online or maybe even self teaching through apps. I'm sure there's private lessons you could take that are gunna be 40,000 USD cheaper than what you're willing to do. I dunno man, personally I think you should go for a cheaper course especially if you would most likely get the same amount of knowledge for both options.",
