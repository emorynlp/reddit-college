I have contacted the Financial aid department multiple times but my financial package is non-negotiable/appealable. My question to you is if there is any other recourses I can contact to help me pay for my dream college!\nThank you and stay safe", "author": "Ernesto_walt", "created": 1585872170, "retrieved": 1632960580, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmidjhe": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ftxmdq/your_my_last_hope/fmidjhe/", "text": "You could try scholarships but that\u2019s probably not going to be doable depending on your gap and you\u2019ll have to apply to many every year for it to be continually affordable.
