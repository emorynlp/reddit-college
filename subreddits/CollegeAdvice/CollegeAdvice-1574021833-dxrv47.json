  "text": "Hello,\n\nI  am 22 years old and I decided that I want to go back to school to complete my degree in biology. I was in college before, but I just couldn't afford it and ended up working as a flight attendant for a year instead. That's when I realized that I wanted to go back to school. \n\nI am now starting at a community college to get my associates in biology which will only take me a year a complete then transfer to get my BA in biology. My plan for after I get my BA in biology would be to complete my master's in Physicians Assistant, but now i'm really contemplating about going to med school. I love studying and becoming a doctor was always my dream.  I am a little concerned because I should've had my BA by now. Do you think it's too late to strive to attend med school?\n\n Also, I am 100% financially responsible for myself. My parents are in no position to help me with anything. I am working as a dental assistant right now, but my hours are going to be cut down once I start school again. I have to pull loans out during my academic years to help with tuition and living expenses. \n\nThoughts and suggestions?",
