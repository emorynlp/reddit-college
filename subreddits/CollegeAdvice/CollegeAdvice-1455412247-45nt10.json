  "text": "I love in 57401, SD, USA and I am considering going to college. I have about a 2.5 GPA and I don't know if I can get student loans? Also missing 4 courses on Transcript from first HS but they don't reply to my emails/phone voicemails.\n\nI am trying to decide between NSU or preferred LATI. I think I want to be either a LEO or Car Mechanic. I am not as familiar with law as I am with Car Maintenance. Is there an online mechanic university that's cheaper?",

      "text": "There might be; however, auto maintenance is a very hands-on path (as is law enforcement), so I wold not recommend considering online education just yet.\n\n2.5 GPA from high school will not bar you from student loans, but when you begin college, you will need to stay on 'Satisfactory Academic Progress', basically, you need to stay above a 2.0 and not dropping many classes.\n\nLATI looks good for either way you want to go, maybe try out a couple classes in both? I don't think NSU is going to be what you are looking for.",
