Any advice would be appreciated :) My main interests are in entrepreneurship and computer science, so I plan on double majoring in Business and CS. I got into the Honors program for Northeastern but not for UNC. The costs would essentially be the same (scholarship for NEU and OOS tuition for UNC). I like the \u201creal-world preparation\u201d idea at NEU and I\u2019m worried I\u2019d have to take a lot of gen-eds at UNC. But everyone\u2019s been telling me UNC is essentially the same but with better weather, campus, etc (I wasn\u2019t able to visit UNC so idrk). Any help would be appreciated!", "author": "evanfen", "created": 1586046082, "retrieved": 1632848318, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmicqkb": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fv4fuv/neu_or_unc_ch/fmicqkb/", "text": "UNC grad here.
