I would really like to pursue my masters and then phD to become a professor. I would need to have a masters as a steppingstone because my grades are not good (due to health reasons). When I graduate I was thinking either a lucrative job in software dev (I am self taught), or pursue math. \n\nI don\u2019t have any money to my name. How would I even get into a masters program? Like I said, I don\u2019t have much money so going and taking post bacc classes I couldn\u2019t do right now. If I go to be a high school math teacher first, I wouldn\u2019t make enough money to save up. \n\nAny advice on making it into math? Or should I just forget it and go tech?", "author": null, "created": 1583816666, "retrieved": 1632848329, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
