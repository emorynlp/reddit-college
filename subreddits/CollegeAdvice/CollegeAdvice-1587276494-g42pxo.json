On the website for the program, there's a schedule of what your classes would be in the years that you attend (my focus is bioscience). This May, I currently am taking 4 AP exams: Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Spanish, & AP Computer Science. I'm not required to take any of these classes (or so I'm assuming; it's not on the schedule). I don't see the point of spending $400 on exams that won't count towards credit, and given the current circumstances with COVID-19, College Board is granting full refunds.\nShould I still take the exams? Is there any reason I should? I'm pretty solid with my choice in career, and even if it did change I don't think I'd deviate from bioscience. Any input helps!
