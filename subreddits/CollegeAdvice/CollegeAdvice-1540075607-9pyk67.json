So until then I planned to continue my degree at my current school while filling some of the requirements at Tech. \n\nI looked into the differences in Tech and  State's degree requirements and of course there are some things that are similar BUT the majority of the Pre-Rec courses I have to take at State won't transfer to Tech.  \n\nFor me to start to take level 3000 and 4000 courses I have to complete the pre-rec courses at State, so I deiced to start to focus on other requirement (you're usual humanities and government courses, but they will transfer as elective credits at Tech) the only problem is that I will most likely fall behind my peers by doing this and I'm not sure what I plan to do in the next few semesters but I guess when we get there is when I'll be back here asking for more help.  I'm considering for the mean time that I might just work on a minor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI fear I'm putting all my eggs into one basket and I just want to have some sort of assurance or someone tell me that I'm making a huge mistake.  What do you think?  Would you do something different?  Any recommendations on how to up my changes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading my wall of text btw!", "author": "AGthedragon", "created": 1540075607, "retrieved": 1632961608, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
