Even if I start doing something, I find myself staring in the window for hours straight.\n\n Any help would be greatly appreciated", "author": "CoffeIsCocain", "created": 1575108255, "retrieved": 1632961158, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"f95f9tw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/e3u4ah/what_should_i_do_if_i_can_hardly_make_myself_do/f95f9tw/", "text": "Have you tried to get professional help?
