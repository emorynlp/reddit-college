I have a C right now but after calculating how much I need to pass with a C- or better, I don't think I'll be able to. I was told last year by my math teacher and counselor to take AP stats because I would've struggled more in precalculus. I've never been a math student. I've always passed with a C- or better and that's usually still with a lot of hard work and effort. I really did try my best in this class used Khan Academy, AP Barron's prep book, my friends and classmates, and even tried to get help from my teacher. I put a lot of effort into it but I just couldn't grasp the concepts. However, this is my best year academically. I have A's in all of my other classes. I'm going in as an English major for college but I'm just really scared I won't get into a college provided that I get a D in AP stats. Is there still hope for me?
