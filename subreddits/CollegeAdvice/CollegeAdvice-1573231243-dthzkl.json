I\u2019ve failed my required chemistry classes and was planning to retake them in the summer. But for now I\u2019m taking anatomy classes which don\u2019t look good either, I\u2019ve just finished anatomy  Test which I don\u2019t feel good about. Even though I\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time studying for it. If I do end up failing that test, I feel that this would be an indication that I\u2019m wasting my time in this major. For the reason that no matter how hard I try I still end up failing the course. I minor in media should I just make that my major if that\u2019s the case?", "author": "Taeoblood", "created": 1573231243, "retrieved": 1632848776, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
