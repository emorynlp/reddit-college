  "text": "So short story, I need to take Trig and Calc 1 over the summer completely online. I\u2019ve looked at a a bunch of colleges and can\u2019t find one that offers both over the summer completely online. If any of you guys could help me out that would be awesome!\n\nLong story: I went to a community college and took all my electives and only got to college algebra before transferring to Missouri S&T. Which was horrible planning on my part. I need to take them over the summer so I can get caught back up and still be full time next semester. I just can\u2019t find a school that offers both over the summer. So I am looking for a college anywhere that is offering both classes completely online (and that will transfer to my school). I found several that offer Trig over the Summer 1 session, but none that offer Calc 1 over the Summer 2 session. Maybe I could take Trig at one like MSU Springfield and then take Calc 1 somewhere else? I\u2019m stressing out a little and any help is much appreciated! Thanks in advance!",
