There is absolutely no way they will allow her to go to said college or pay for it at this point in time. I am willing to pay for the 800$ deposit to save her place at the school but I can\u2019t afford to pay even a small portion of the 60k tuition at this point in time. And I also don\u2019t want to rock the boat with my parents anymore than it already is due to my sisters recent actions. I need some solid advice to convince her to defer for a year. By then I should have some more money saved to help with what I can and she\u2019ll be 18 and able to make the decision on if taking out 100k+ in loans is something she is willing to do just to go to this particular school. Any advice is appreciated!", "author": "merigoround1996", "created": 1556553419, "retrieved": 1632961453, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
