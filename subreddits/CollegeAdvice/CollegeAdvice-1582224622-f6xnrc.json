          "text": "As a computer science major. Can confirm that the workload is dreadful. One class gives several assignments a week. Each with a variation of stress. Multiplied by 3 for 3 cs courses per semester \n\nCS at my uni makes us do mathematics, business, physics, programming(java, web, kotlin, python...), and philosophy to pair with the math. All required at my uni. Might vary per uni\n\nBasically a bundle of death",
