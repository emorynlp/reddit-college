I\u2019m an incoming high school senior and I want to pursue medicine in the future \u2013 specifically, psychiatry. I\u2019m weighing my options for what undergraduate degree I should take for my pre-med.\n\nWould it be better to major in BSc Psychology or BSc Biology? I feel that a degree in Psych would help give me a better foundation for psychiatry, but a Bio degree may help me for Med School. I\u2019m also looking at Biopsychology, but not a lot of universities offer this. \n\nOr do you have any other tips for what pre-med to take.\n\nThank you!", "author": "lpty2001", "created": 1560083028, "retrieved": 1632848941, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"er6vq4w": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/byjous/i_need_advice_on_my_premed_degree_psychiatry/er6vq4w/", "text": "my advisor said that since i had to take premed classes that i would be taking the biology, chemistry, etc classes so i don\u2019t think it would matter", "author": "flaminghotphoenix", "created": 1560558893, "upvotes": 1}, "eqyr8pw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/byjous/i_need_advice_on_my_premed_degree_psychiatry/eqyr8pw/", "text": "i am an incoming college freshman and my friend and i are both wanting to eventually become psychiatrists. we are both going about it different ways, she plans on majoring in public health (she said the classes cover the requirements for even being considered for medical school) and minoring in psychology. my plan is to double major in psychology (because i really love the subject and like you think would be helpful for a career in psychiatry) and public health (because i think it\u2019s interesting and it might cover the prerequisites) and hopefully minoring in sociology and maybe anthropology. i want to stand out as much as possible to better my chances into getting into medical school because it\u2019s so competitive. the psychology program at my university is flexible enough to double major (so says their website) so i have high hopes.\n\nbut there are multiple ways to go about getting the prerequisites for medical school. one persons way won\u2019t exactly be another persons way. \n\ni wish you all the luck on your journey. sorry this is such a long response. \ud83d\ude2c\n\n(i\u2019m going to orientation tomorrow so i can update on what my advisor tells me. )", "author": "flaminghotphoenix", "created": 1560388084, "upvotes": 2}, "eqkq736": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/byjous/i_need_advice_on_my_premed_degree_psychiatry/eqkq736/", "text": "Either psych or bio is fine, you could feasibly do both.
