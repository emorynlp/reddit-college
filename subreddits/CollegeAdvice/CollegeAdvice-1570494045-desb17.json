I took it in the summer 2019 and failed it terribly. I\u2019m now taking it again and I am struggling to comprehend the subject but as well going through financial struggles that\u2019s making me put in more hours of work than studying. I\u2019m debating to withdrawal (again) or continue to push and barely pass. I have a gpa to maintain to keep my scholarships which is also stressing me.
