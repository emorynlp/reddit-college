If you already have them from HS, great, keep doing what you're doing (albeit a little more) and you'll be fine. If you were like me and didn't do shit to get good grades, you're gonna die the first semester trying to figure out how to study. The other biggest difference is in writing. Fluff won't cut it anymore. Turning in 20+ page papers (especially if theyre double spaced or lab reports) isn't that weird in college. There's also the classes that have 50+ people where the Prof probably doesn't take attendance and probably doesn't even know you exist unless you go to office hours. Not a big deal and some actually do amazing with class participation and make sure everyone's on the same page during lecture. Others suck and you'll sit in the back wondering why you ever come and depending on you, you might not even go at all. ", "author": "odactylus", "created": 1501732702, "upvotes": 1}}}
