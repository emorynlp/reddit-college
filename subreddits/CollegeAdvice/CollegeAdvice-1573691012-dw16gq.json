(though even that is going to a bit of a long-shot)\n\nI was told by my advisor yesterday that if my current grades stand, in order to qualify for financial aid I would need to take 15 CH and average a B across them next semester which I have 0 confidence in myself being able to do. (I\u2019m currently in 12 CH with an F average)\n\nI 100% blame myself for this situation but I\u2019m not sure how to move forward; I\u2019ve always had major issues finding the motivation to do my schoolwork but, even when I do sit down and try to work on it, I just get distracted/frustrated at the mound of work that\u2019s awaiting me after I finish whatever I\u2019m currently on and I give up. Then because I keep putting the work off I want to do it even less because I feel like I\u2019ll never get it all done.\n\nI want to try to make next semester work (I\u2019ve signed up for the easiest 15 Credit Hours my school has to offer but there\u2019s no way around having to do a good deal of work regardless) but I really don\u2019t know where to begin with trying to salvage this current semester, and how to avoid the same issues that I\u2019m having this semester next semester.", "author": "Xerox-xoreX", "created": 1573691012, "retrieved": 1632960944, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f7g9ax3": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dw16gq/how_to_recover_from_an_a_bad_first_semester/f7g9ax3/", "text": "Are you in counseling?
