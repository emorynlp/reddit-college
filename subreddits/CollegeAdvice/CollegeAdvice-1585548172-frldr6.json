  "text": "Hi guys! in need of some opinions while picking colleges. my major is chemistry at both schools but i dont know what i wanna do so it will 80% change. \n\nSchool A: School A is close to home, but ill live on campus or in an apartment all four years. It costs about half the amount as school B. when i visited i really liked it because it felt diverse and it felt like id fit in. I also liked the aspect of how helpful the staff were and just the honors college is quite astounding. Its a commuter school however and it doesnt have like \u201cprestige\u201d per say, like anyone can get in but a lot of people flourish and do really well from this school. i feel like if i go here i wont get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d of a football team and all that cool stuff other schools have. most students are commuters. i got a lot of scholarship from here its practically free im just paying for dorm. \n\nSchool B: HA because of corona virus i never got to visit. This school is wayyy bigger and way more well known. its an out of state school but a neighboring dtate, so its only about a two hour drive/bus ride home. this school is packed w the college experience they have football and its a huge school (my hs was tiny and didnt have football) and it seems like it had amazing educational programs all around which is jice bc i dont know my major. while school A has expertise in STEM but that doesnt mean the other feilds lack. Anyways, i feel like if i go hear ill actually be a college student be able to have the exoerince i want ti have and get a good education. howver honestly i dont know much about the educational programs. But i know theyre good because its such a good school, also its huge and they dont have that much diversity its pretty much all white, but they have multicultural groups and minority groups but theyre smaller.",

      "text": "Hello, fellow future (possible) chemistry major! \n\nI've recently had a similar hassle (i.e. do I go to a school where I've got a full-ride scholarship but where I'll be forced to conform to ideas I don't believe in, or do I go to a school where I'll get a good education, be able to grow as a person, but will likely go into some debt over it). \n\nIf you're still undecided, it sounds like school B would be better, as (going by what you said) it offers strong programs in both STEM and humanities/liberal arts. The college experience is important, too. On the other hand, if you haven't had a chance to visit school B, you probably won't be able to gauge as well whether it's a good fit for you. You had said you'd feel like you fit in better at school A, and that the staff seemed very helpful (a huge plus!).\n\nI don't want to say you should pick one school over the other. Both of them sound awesome! :) Maybe start looking for negatives for both (besides distance), or look at former students' reviews of the schools (be careful with this, because some people are only writing reviews to vent). \n\nWishing you the best of luck! :)",
