Not outlandish, but sort of unlikely in some ways. Anyone have insight?", "text": "So I am F21 and I graduated hs in 2015. I went to csulb from 2015-16 but dropped out the next two semesters (16-17) due to depression.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of becoming a web developer and I\u2019m trying to decide whether I should be self taught or just muster up the courage to go to school. I am autistic and still struggle with depression and have major anxiety. So I really don\u2019t do well in a school setting. But I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019m good enough to be self taught. I mean I\u2019m still a beginner so I can\u2019t really tell yet but I just don\u2019t think I have the talent/skill to do this on my own. \n\nIf I go back to school, I will have to go to community college to make up the units I missed the last two semesters I had dropped out. Which is fine because it saves money.\n\nWhat I want to do really badly though, is apply to usc fall 2020, when I have completed enough classes to transfer. There\u2019s a bit of a problem with this.\n\nI come from a fairly poor family. We have never really had money. Not impoverished, but still just barely trying to survive sometimes. I really see myself being able to get good grades and getting in, but we just wouldn\u2019t have the money to pay for a school so expensive. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering what happened to all of you usc alumni after graduating. How hard is it to pay off your loans? My mom and sister, who I live with, don\u2019t think I should go. But I don\u2019t want their opinions of money and the future to stop me from doing what I want.\n\nWouldnt a cs degree from usc be much more worth it than a cs degree from cal state Dominguez hills? Which would be my other option considering transfer units. My guess is that I\u2019d make enough money from a usc degree to at least handle paying off loans.\n\nDoes it really matter what school you go to? Should I apply to usc even though I don\u2019t have the money? Or should I just forget about it?", "author": "MO-life-MO-problems", "created": 1550637947, "retrieved": 1632960559, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
