I didn't really think I was going to pass my audition since I'm going in for music. It's very close to the start of the semester and I feel like I made the wrong decision now.\n\nI don't want to be a music teacher so getting a degree in music is pretty much useless in my eyes. I don't even know what else I'm interested in though, so I'm not sure what major I would switch to. I also can't really switch until at least the end of the first semester because I have 5 music classes.\n\nI also feel like I should've looked into colleges sooner because there is one a couple hours from where I live that I feel I would like more. Is it normal to feel like I'm making all the wrong decisions right now? Everyone else seems super excited about where they're going and what theyre doing and I just feel like I'm making a very expensive wrong decision.\n\nI don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for right now but I would appreciate anything anyone has to say.", "author": "weedwhore69", "created": 1565544235, "retrieved": 1632960380, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"f3olio1": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cozis7/i_regret_what_i_decided_to_major_in_and_also_the/f3olio1/", "text": "What happened with this?", "author": "Madcityman75", "created": 1571021158, "upvotes": 1}, "ewqjaaw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cozis7/i_regret_what_i_decided_to_major_in_and_also_the/ewqjaaw/", "text": "I have a friend who was in a similar situation.

I'm a freshman headed to college in like a week, and I still worry about what I'm doing there. The main reason I'm going to my college is because both my grandparents and both of my parents went there, so if I ended up at a different university it'd be pretty frowned upon at my house.\n\nI have no freaking clue what I'm studying/majoring in, so all of my classes are either generals, or just random ones that sounded interesting, so I kind of relate to your situation. \n\nBut it's all good! It's just one semester; if you don't love/thrive in your music classes, it's ok. Schools these days have so many different intro classes so that you can try them and see if they interest you. It's nice to just branch out and explore what your options are. And if your school is anything like mine, it's pretty easy to switch your major (I think you just have to meet with your advisor and they'll change it for you). I know several people who have switched their major like 8 times, and honestly, I'll probably end up doing the same thing. And if you decide you don't want to major in music, you can always just play music on the side in the school band, community band, etc., so you're not \"wasting your musical talents.\" (I was a band kid in high school, and I've definitely gotten that discussion from my band teacher lol). \n\nAnd since you're living at home, you'll save a lot of money, while still being able to attend college, so I think that since it's your first semester, that's a good decision. And if this college doesn't feel like a good fit for you, you can always transfer to a different school after this semester. It'll all work out!!", "author": "puzzlingly_anxious", "created": 1565557697, "upvotes": 1}}}
