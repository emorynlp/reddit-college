[Serious]", "text": "Bottom for TLDR.\n\nI am from a poverty line family and am first gen. college. I have attended a private college in my state for two years. Sept. 2019 I had a suicide attempt that set me back a semester (medical withdraw). I came back this January 2020 with the impression of doing summer school and graduating on time. Through time and therapy, however, I have come to realize that I was abused as a kid (and to this day) by my Narcissistic mom and have decided to finally cut her off. This changes things or put a wrench in the works as I currently owe my school $6K after having a relative already take out an $8K loan from my withdraw. My mother promised said relative she would pay for this semester but hasn't and cutting her off puts that money on my head. There is no way I can afford to keep going to school unless I either:\n\nA) Gap Year and make money to pay off debts AND save money to go back to school\n\nB) Convince my mother to pay for schooling by not cutting her off and kissing ass\n\nC) ???\n\nAnyone with Gap Year experience, How hard was it to go back to school? How hard financially? How hard if it was a private school? I have until the end of Spring Break to figure this out before I end up without school AND without money. If there are any other suggestions I am open to them. I'm stuck in my shitty stressed out perspective so any suggestions or advice would be great.\n\nTLDR: Broke and Abused college kid wants to know if it is worth taking a Gap Year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: (Update) As it has come to the end of my Spring Break, I made my decision and cut off my mom. It was a little upsetting at first because anxiety, It went over the best you could hope i guess. I wasn't prepared for my family to flip sides to save face or \"that's just how it is\" from victims themselves, but I made my decision. I'm sticking to it and completing this semester to the best of my ability before returning to work for a year and a half. \n\nI decided to take the gap year because at the end of the day, I want my degree and the ability to succeed in life. I'm putting my self through school even if it means working for a year. I'm saving for my future. \n\nIn the process, I finally went through with cutting my mom off. I know family stuff will be rough but I know everything will be worth it in the end.\n\nThanks.", "author": "Trisleepy", "created": 1583160251, "retrieved": 1632960153, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fjbp7dq": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fcd11f/gap_year_or_no_serious/fjbp7dq/", "text": "Hi, I've worked with students trying to escape abusive situations, in both personal and professional capacities. I'm so sorry you're going through this, but keep your mom cut off.  I have never once seen a case of an abusive parent changing their ways, keeping ties only prolongs suffering. Your mental health should be your utmost priority, and if the ramifications of abuse have hurt your mental health to the degree that you had a suicide attempt, money from her won't be worth it. You can't do anything with a degree if you're dead, and pursuing your degree won't be worth it if you're so miserable you want to kill yourself. Here's a couple different options, and some steps you should probably take regardless of what you choose to do.\u000b\u000b1) Appeal to become an independent for financial aid purposes.\u000bThe appeals process to do this on the FAFSA is a giant pain, but abusive situations are considered extenuating circumstances and you may be granted independent status, which will give you control over your loans and may mean you get some additional grant money.[https://withfrank.org/how-to-pay-for-college/how-do-i-apply/dependency-status/can-i-appeal-my-fafsa-dependency-status/](https://withfrank.org/how-to-pay-for-college/how-do-i-apply/dependency-status/can-i-appeal-my-fafsa-dependency-status/) Your school's financial aid office has the final say. You'll need to collect testimony to vouch that you are appealing because of an abusive situation, and your therapist can provide that. As could professors, or even officials in your house of worship, if you're a religious person.\u000bWhen you say you owe your school $6K, do you mean you need to pay them that now in order to stay enrolled, or do you mean that you overall have taken out $6K in loans (that you won't need to start repaying until 6 months after graduating). You are most likely going to need to take out some loans, but it's really not as scary as everyone makes it out to be. It would be nice to avoid it, but you're in between a rock and a hard place. I know someone who  also didn't receive any financial support from their family due to an abusive situation, graduated with $24K in loans and paid it off within 2 years.\n\n\u000b2) Get into your school's Disabled Students Program.\u000bExact titles vary, but the premise is the same. Lots of students think that these are only for learning disabilities, but mental health issues are almost always covered under the program's criteria. You're already seeing a therapist and had a medical withdrawal, so the documentation should be easier to collect. After getting into DSP, they can potentially grant you certain accommodations that could make working while in school easier, such as a reduced course load (depending on how your school calculates tuition, this could also potentially reduce your upfront costs) or extensions on assignments. Your teacher can't refuse a DSP accommodation and they don't have to know what your conditions is, only that your DSP officer has approved certain accommodations.\u000b\u000bGap Year Considerations\u000bThink about what kind of job options you have open to you and what kind of health insurance situation you'd be in once you leave university. Even if you have health insurance through your work, you likely won't be able to use it until 3 months after you start. Your employer may not care about you seeing therapy. They're supposed to accommodate your work schedule to allow you to have appointments, but in practice they may not as you only have a finite amount of sick time and if you get physically sick for even one day, that basically means you won't be able to have an appointment for a month. I know someone who wasn't able to see therapy for 8 months after pursuing a gap year because her insurance (Kaiser) only offered therapy appointments on weekdays during work hours and she wasn't able to get time off work to see one.\u000b\u000bIf you have good job options and good health insurance options, then it is possible to save up and pay off debts while taking a gap year to work. Grad schools even like to see that you've had at least a year or two of work experience in your field, so again, as long as it's work relevant to your field, you won't be at a competitive disadvantage. One thing I have heard students reflect on is that they didn't feel like they were able to work on coping mechanisms for school-related stressors/anxieties. So that made adjusting once they got back harder than it would have been if they'd dropped down to part-time student status.\u000b\u000bIt's definitely possible to pursue either option while keeping ties cut with your mom. Pick the one that you think you'd have the best mental health under. Sometimes when students take a gap year they have a little bit of an identity crisis because school has been such a huge part of their life, others say that they needed the work experience to finally decide on what they wanted to do after college.\u000bI wish you the best of luck, and I applaud you for not giving up and making the best out of an awful situation. It takes a lot of moxy to hang in there after all you've been through!", "author": "Empowerly-Admissions", "created": 1583198385, "upvotes": 1}}}
