  "text": "Hi everyone, if you with draw from a class after the drop date I know I will get a \"W\" on my transcript. This is the only class I've ever had to withdrawl from and have good grades. I'm currently online enrolled in one other class besides this. Will I have to pay back the money fasfa gave me for the course? I'm concerned I'll have to pay back. Just looking to see what I should expect after withdrawing.",

      "text": "Withdrawing from a class really only has an impact if it drops you into a different status (e.g. full-time to part-time) or if it makes you fall behind SAP ( you are not on track to complete your degree)  with this being the first, and you have good grades otherwise, if your credit hours keep you full time, you likely have nothing to worry about",
