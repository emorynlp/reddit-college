  "text": "I'm a community college freshman (18F) and I'm majoring in computer science, hoping to transfer to CalPoly Pomona in three years. I've gone through my educational plan with my counselor, so I am set with what classes I need to take. CPP requires over a 2.0 and I'm not worried about my grades. I really want to go to this school, but I'm afraid I may not get in because it is very competitive (computer science is impacted) and my counselor said I should also think about applying to other schools just in case. I'm in almost every support program at my community college which should increase my chances of acceptance, but I think I'm not doing enough. I don't know what CPP is specifically looking for. Clubs? Leadership? Extracurricular activities? I already am a full-time student and I work part-time as well, so I didn't think I had enough time for clubs. I am willing to quit my job though if doing activities outside of school would help. I was also thinking of taking a music class  (I play violin) at my college because if you looked at my schedule for the next three years, it's just math, computer science, and physics. What else can I do to put on my application? sorry if I sound dumb/clueless/ignorant btw",

      "text": "Given that the admission process is essentially unknown - we can give you advice (get A's, keep working if you need to (the reason can be explained in your application), start your own extracurricular ventures on the side - this is leadership, creativity, and ingenuity on its own)) - but your counselor is definitely right! Looking at other schools to apply to is *smart.* Sometimes, even when everything looks perfect on paper for getting into a school, it doesn't happen. Check out other schools you'd be happy with, and keep your mind open to the possibility of not going to CPP so it doesn't crush you if that doesn't happen. I'm sure your counselors will help you as MUCH as they can, but they're also giving you pragmatic, realistic advice based on what they've seen before.",
