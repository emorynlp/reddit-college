  "text": "so there\u2019s a pretty good chance my best friend and i are going to the same college next year. we aren\u2019t going with each other or just because the other one is going, but because we both love the school. almost everyone i\u2019ve talked to says it\u2019s a bad idea to room with your best friend and has explained why. it makes complete sense to me, but i just feel like with my best friend we would be perfectly fine. we don\u2019t go to high school together and we have spent lots of time together traveling and just doing life together to the point where she\u2019s more like a sister. we aren\u2019t planning on clinging to each other the entire time and are going to join different clubs and activities. to both of us we believe it will be fine and we will still have an amazing experience. does anyone have any advice or scenarios we may need to think of? or know if any success stories with people rooming w their best friend?",
