I'm the head of my household and need to be able to work in order for us to pay rent. I'm an older, returning college student heading into my senior year at university. I want to eventually teach at the university level and know that I want to be able to research as well, so a PhD program seems a good fit for me. However, everything I'm reading suggests that being a working head of household doesn't work for a post-grad program. I can't afford to just stop working to pursue this. \n\nDoes anyone know whether this is something I can achieve or am I screwed because I didn't have rich parents who sent me through this in my twenties? Is this simply one of those things that older students just don't get to do?", "author": "BattleCounselor", "created": 1496546102, "retrieved": 1632961061, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
