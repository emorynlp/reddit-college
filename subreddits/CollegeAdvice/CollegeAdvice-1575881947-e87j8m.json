Well now I took two classes after bc I needed to be a student to get health benefits. I\u2019m doing really bad in them, I haven\u2019t been motivated mostly bc they are online and I\u2019ve been focusing on getting into grad school and applications and all that Jazz, they just haven\u2019t been a priority and I\u2019m certain I might fail one of them. Now my question is, how bad will this affect my gpa? Will grad schools care, since I\u2019ve got my 3.0 at graduation and the program I\u2019m going into is a masters in what my bachelors was in? The classes now have nothing to do with my degree path. In confused and still gonna go to the school tomorrow and ask, but has anyone else dealt with this before?", "author": "oddestballinthehall", "created": 1575881947, "retrieved": 1632960929, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
