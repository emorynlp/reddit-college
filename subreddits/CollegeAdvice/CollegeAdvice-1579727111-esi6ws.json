Due to my college choice, I\u2019m pretty worried about how I look to colleges. I started an FBLA team at my school this year and I\u2019m the president of the club. That\u2019s great and has been a commitment since September, the problem comes with competitions. My team didn\u2019t register early enough in the year to qualify for the regional or state competition. We have a good team and I have leadership, but does not being able to get an award heavily hurt me chances?", "author": "highschool-student", "created": 1579727111, "retrieved": 1632848361, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
