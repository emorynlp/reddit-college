They want me to live at home and commute wherever I go. I really tried to uphold their wishes so half of the colleges on my list are close enough to commute easily, and half of them are a ways away. The farthest college I have is about a 2 hour drive. I told them that if I go away I will be back every weekend that I can be, and that I really am passionate about becoming my own person and finding myself. My mom and dad have been very overprotective of me and my brother our whole lives, and don\u2019t get me wrong I appreciate it very much. They say that going away is too expensive (even though we already agreed that I would be paying for my own tuition with my own job) and they also won\u2019t stop talking about how I will need someone to pay my 1) phone bill 2) food 3) laundry 4) textbooks. I understand their point, but I truly believe that I can do it. Although they make good points, I still think that they just don\u2019t want me to \u201cgrow up.\u201d Whenever I even mention going away they immediately change the subject or argue about it. Just for perspective, I visited a college that was 2 hours away from where I live (with a car, not public transportation) and when we got there my dad says \u201cisn\u2019t this school a little far for you to drive every morning?\u201d LOL. Does anyone have any advice to help me sway them to my point of view?", "author": "Yasmin_mimidin", "created": 1573095906, "retrieved": 1632960948, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f6rlo2e": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dsrdjz/overprotective_parents_and_going_away/f6rlo2e/", "text": "As a person that lived with really strict  parents I totally understand the feeling. I moved out when I was 17. My best advice for you is to try and dorm your first year in school, it usually covers food so you don\u2019t have to worry about making food everyday and it\u2019s one more step to being independent. I thought it would be easy to move out too but it\u2019s harder that what it actually seems like but it is possible. Tell your parents to help you with bills cause it\u2019s bull that parents pull that whole \u201cpay ur phone bills \u201c and all that. Tell them you want to be independent and that they can\u2019t really do much but help you and support. Trust me this was the most uncomfortable conversations I had with my parents but after our relationship got better. Another thing is that dorming is very very expensive and I took out loans for it but it is soooo worth it if you can. I graduate next year, going on to my 5th year in college, and now I live in an apartment with one of my closets friends and all my parents care is that I\u2019m getting good grades, working to pay my rent and some bills, and just generally happy. This first few steps will be the hardest but once you get the hang of things it will get better! And if you can\u2019t dorm go on Facebook and you can find roommate pages for schools, for example I go to csuf and we have a csuf roommate page  on Facebook and people just post open rooms, just make sure you have good credit cause that\u2019s a bitch and a half \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05.", "author": "JuniorSparks5", "created": 1573108918, "upvotes": 2}}}
