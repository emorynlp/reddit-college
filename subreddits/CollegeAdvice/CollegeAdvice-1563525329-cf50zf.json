I've researched a bit online and have noticed some very negative views on them, while also noticing a lot of positives. My question, I suppose, is when looking to hire someone does this degree help or hurt a candidate? \n\nIf it matters, I've got 18 years experience in IT ranging from help desk to web development and programming to broke fix it. \n\nThankful for all viewpoints, good and bad honestly especially from those who do the hiring.", "author": "Thebillsfan80", "created": 1563525329, "retrieved": 1632960988, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"eugvw5q": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cf50zf/is_a_degree_from_strayer_worth_anything_in_the/eugvw5q/", "text": "Not sure if you're going to get your answer here so I'd consider reaching out to recruiters over Linkedin or Google.
