So no problems there, until I sent my transcript which I thought only contained my dual credit grades. Wrong, the community college had my audited classes down as 2 Fs instead of the \u201cAU\u201d for audits. \n\nUT\u2019s engineering college admissions policy requires 24 credit hours, which I cannot get due to the military\u2019s deadlines. They did inform me that if the classes were audited I\u2019d be able to enter as a freshman. I began calling the college and they informed me they didn\u2019t see anything but they\u2019d look in the records. Now I know I signed the audit request form. It was part of the initial papers I had to fill out. So I\u2019m not sure if they didn\u2019t give me everything or it was lost in transit from the business office. The whole time I was under the belief that I audited the class. So my question is who else in the school system should I talk to? If anyone there isn\u2019t any evidence so I\u2019m probably screwed but I thought I\u2019d try here just in case.
