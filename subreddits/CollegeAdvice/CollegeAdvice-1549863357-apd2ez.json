The catch is, I\u2019m currently a \u201cjunior\u201d at 82 or so credit hours. I\u2019m wondering I should stick it through here or if I should transfer there\nThe draws are if I transfer I might lose my pellgrabt, it will cost me more money, I will have to pass calculus and applied calculus along with precalc... (I suck at math)\nI\u2019m currently 24, depressed af, honestly losing my mind, and really just bleak about the next 2 years here. I know I hate the area, I hate the people(they\u2019re so damn \u201cuppidy\u201d and not quite sure about the quality to my education here. \nOn the plus side, currently, if I continue here I will have only 25-30k in debt. It is super affordable, the books are included in the tuition, and it\u2019s gorgeous scenic wise. ISU is kind of more suburban and bleak imo. I\u2019m so lost, idk if I want to transfer....\nHas anyone transferred as a junior on here? Anyone transfer from one 4 year uni to another? Any advice?\nShould I suck it up and finish schooling here then move to Chicago?(I want to live there no matter what after school)\nI\u2019m so lost and lonely. I have tried to go to therapy provided at my university, but they said they \u201cdon\u2019t have the resources to help me....\nPlease help me out...someone ", "author": "Nazzo222", "created": 1549863357, "retrieved": 1632849304, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"ehqxkfu": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/apd2ez/really_hating_the_college_i_choose_should_i/ehqxkfu/", "text": "I would contact admissions and or financial aid at the school you want to get into and see what is possible and what deadlines are.
