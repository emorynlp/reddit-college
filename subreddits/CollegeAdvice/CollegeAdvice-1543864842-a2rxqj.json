Earlier this semester I joined a team of my classmates for a 2 semester long research project in my field. I have also gotten an opportunity for a 1 year internship (part time during school, full time summer) that doesn\u2019t perfectly pertain to my degree, starting next semester. If I accept everything, I\u2019ll have to handle a research project, internship, and classes. If I accept the internship, I will be pushing a few classes back to make time in my schedule. Should I accept the internship, get paid and get a year of experience in industry, even though it\u2019s not directly related to my degree? Or should I deny it and focus on my classes and research? Thank you for your help ahead of time ", "author": "Afetterley", "created": 1543864842, "retrieved": 1632849386, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
