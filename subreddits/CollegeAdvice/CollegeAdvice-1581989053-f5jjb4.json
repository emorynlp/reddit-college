Before getting the surgery, I had been told by my doctor that the recovery period from PRK is about 5 days. It\u2019s not. The actual recovery takes 2 weeks to a full month before vision is functionally restored. \nI had planned to do PRK and recover over the long weekend, heading back to classes on Tuesday. However, I can hardly see text on my phone, and I\u2019m definitely not ready to be driving yet. I didn\u2019t make plans to be out of commission academically for up to a month, and I\u2019m not sure what I can do to help the situation.", "author": "924ths", "created": 1581989053, "retrieved": 1632848334, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fi097ht": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f5jjb4/20m_and_recovering_from_prk_laser_eye_surgery/fi097ht/", "text": "Talk to your professors, show them documentation and see if they will work with you.
