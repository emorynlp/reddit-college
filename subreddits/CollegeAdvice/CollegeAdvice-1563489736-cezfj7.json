It gives you greater privacy, more space, etc.\n\nThat being said, you should consider a few things. \n\nDo you know the other 3 girls and if the single rooms are relatively quiet (i.e. not thin partitions but actual thick walls)? If the rooms are close to each other and/or they are loud you might actually encounter more noise/disruptions even though you are in a private room. Especially if they each bring at least 1 friend over at times or are always around (that could be like having 6 people in a shared space). If you shared a room with only one other then it may be easier to set a schedule/limit disruptions with only one.", "author": "Chris_NYU", "created": 1563535713, "upvotes": 2}, "eu6a7yh": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cezfj7/dorm_rooms/eu6a7yh/", "text": "hell yes 100%", "author": "kanyemeow", "created": 1563495646, "upvotes": 2}}}
