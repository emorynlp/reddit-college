Well, more university world. \n\nHere's how it happened. So I was explaining to my mom about my housing application, and we both realized there were some changes that I needed to make. My application wouldn't let me make those changes for some reason so I saw the cancel application button and thought \"huh, I can just start a new one if i cancel it right?\" \n\nBIG FUCKIN MISTAKE\nIM A BAFFOON \nAN UTTER DUMBASS \nA INGRATE LACKING BRAINCELLS\nA PERSON WITH A PANCAKE FOR A BRAIN\n\nApparently, when you click that, it basically DELETES THE TERM YOU WERE GONNA APPLY FOR. I've called the housing office and everything to try and get it back, so hopefully I get it back. They said they'd get back to me in a few business days. I'm so NERVOUS and ANGRY with myself that I let this fuckin happen!! And CSUMB is my dream school! This all happened today by the way. (3/6/20) \n\nThis is for CSU Monterey Bay housing apps, btw. I need HELP. Has anyone else done this, and if so, how'd you get your housing app back!?? I need help!!
