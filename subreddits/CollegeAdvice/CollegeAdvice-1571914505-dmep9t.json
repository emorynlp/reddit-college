She seemed pretty into it in the texts up until I told her the dates. She said she might not be able to make the first two days because of class but I really want her to come (and I'm willing to go late to the event, even pick her up!). She has no idea that I'm covering all costs too and she still hasn't responded... so did I lose this chance? Should I ask her to grab lunch sometime in the future (in the case that she doesn't want to come?)\n\nI'm really not good with girls...this would be my first date, so any help would be greatly appreciated!", "author": "VirginJr", "created": 1571914505, "retrieved": 1632848804, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
