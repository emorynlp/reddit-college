I actually just found this sub while looking for some insight. I graduated High school in 2013. I got horrible grades and didnt show up for most of it. I was convinced I would just join the military and didnt even bother trying to do anything else. Well turns out I have a heart murmur and the military wouldnt take me. So for the last 7 years I've been trying to work my way up and teach myself trades without going to school. I've been an auto mechanic for about 7 years, an airplane mechanic for 2, and just started into the world of prototyping and mechanical engineering. \n\nI never really knew what I was going to do with my life, I have a love for working with my hands but I certainly dont want to  be a mechanic forever, it has already taken a serious toll on my body and I feel as if my mind has been left to rot over the last few years just fixing cars all day long. Aviation gave me some excitement, but after the novelty wore off It felt like the same thing as working on cars. \n\nLast year I was offered a great job prototyping at an aerospace startup working on an experimental aircraft, and I fell in love with the engineering and design aspect of things. Unfortunately the company is now defunct and I was laid off. I've been unemployed for over a month and struggling really hard to find another job in the field without a degree. So I've decided I want to go and finally get one in Mechanical Engineering. \n\nI'm mostly looking for advice on what I should do to start? I never learned any of the college admission process, and I know virtually nothing. I know about the FAFSA and that is the extent of it. I submitted mine not even 10 minutes ago. I'm not even 100% sure what school to go to yet. I applied to my local community college for some basic STEM programs but that's it. I really would love to become a full time student, but I'm broke. My family is broke and I have trash credit. So the only way school will be possible for me is through loans and financial aid, but I'm nervous about that. I turn 25 in 3 days and really want to start doing something with my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr- I was garbage in high school because I just didnt care, now 7 years later I've found love in mechanical engineering and want to get a degree, but I dont even know where to start.", "author": "corsaireverything", "created": 1582758419, "retrieved": 1632848332, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fjzuey8": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fa26wh/college_7_years_after_high_school_graduation/fjzuey8/", "text": "Community college is an excellent deal and a great road to a four year university with way less $$ and stress.

Many people do college late. Your first step of going to junior college was on target.  See if your jc has any advising.  Take the math classes you need and see if you are up to applying yourself and doing well. If you can do well, then you may be able to transfer to a college to do an engineering program.  It will be hard. Engineering is one of the most challenging courses of study.  But it may be possible.  If you are low income you may qualify for both grants and loans. A junior college is much less expensive so get the basics done there.  Also, you will have to prove yourself at a jc in order to be accepted at a 4-year college.  Getting into college, especially in engineering program, is competitive.  If you find you need help with the jc classes, see if the jc offers any tutoring. State colleges are generally more affordable than private.  Some colleges have programs and resources designed specifically to help older transfer students.  So work hard at the jc, and while doing that research colleges to transfer to. Do try to work part time.  You may qualify for work-study job on campus.  They don\u2019t pay great, but sometimes you can score a job that allows you to study in downtime.  Or get another part time gig, maybe one that gets tips like waiting tables.  Once you are at the jc, take advantage of any advising and resources they have. They may be able to advise you on different possible career options. Keep in touch with the people you worked with.  They may be good resources later on. Good luck.", "author": "mollymarie123", "created": 1582770363, "upvotes": 1}}}
