For the past year I've  been working full time and going to school full time. It's been hard and  I was struggling with school to begin with. I'm trying to get into my  schools business program but I need a 2.5 and I only have a 2.1 My  school offers 4 grade replacements and I've used 2 already which means  but I've had to retake math and will have to retake econ since I got a C  instead of a C+.  \n I don't really know if there's still a way for me to get into the  business school if I can't get the grades I need to count for my degree.  The other thing is I'm planning to study abroad through my home  university (if I can manage to save) which to me would be good because  if I was abroad I wouldn't be working and my focuses would be on the  culture and my academic studies. My question is, should I try to stick  it out at my current university? If everything goes well this semester  I'll have 74 credits with 46 left.", "author": "nikimarie442", "created": 1580933034, "retrieved": 1632960753, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
