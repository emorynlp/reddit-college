Or drop out?", "text": "I go to an out of state school where I have to fly back home. I'm a sophomore in a sorority where I love my friends dearly and love the social aspect of college. The problem is, I hate the school part. \nI'm an undecided major with no set goals in the future or any plans on what this major will be. I'm literally taking gen eds right now and I'll be finished with them by the end of the semester. I've gotten into a funk and my depression has kicked back in where I don't like going to class not knowing where I'm going with life. Because of that, I am failing a bunch of classes for not completing assignments and for not going.\nI have met with my academic advisor and even on-campus help for choosing my major, but I feel they are just wasting my time and don't actually know me and are going to have me do these tests which I don't want to do or repeat doing since I've done them before. \nLast semester I got mono and had to drop out of 3 of my 5 classes to finish the year. I'm down so many credits, I'm basically a year behind. \nI'm back on campus from Thanksgiving break and I already want to be back home and not finish the semester. My heart is pulling me in two directions: Stay and finish college because of my friends and sorority though I am miserable or drop out of college but miss my friends dearly. Since I go to an out of state school they don't live in my state so I feel I'll never see them again if I drop. \nI don't know what to do and I really need some clarity.
