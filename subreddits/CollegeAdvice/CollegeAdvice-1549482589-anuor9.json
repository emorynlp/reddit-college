I don't make much money, and never will regarding my current career and the state I live in (I'm a manager with 6+ years of experience and I make less than a construction flagger). I want desperately to get my Engineering degree and move into doing Astronautical Engineering later on. I've dreamed of building spacecraft since I was a child, but life and poor decisions put me in a spot where I couldn't go to school. I can't quit and go to school full time, and with my hours I think all I can manage until I find a better job is online courses. I'm at a stable place now, and I'm ready to move on and follow my dreams, I just don't know the best path to get started on.
