I am going for biochemistry pre med track at both schools. \n\nNow I am a Texas Resident so I would benefit from the in-state tuition, but the difference between the price tags right now are about 30K a year. Do you think UCLA is worth that extra money? \n\nI am also looking to eventually get a stable job and have a family in california in the future. I don\u2019t know if starting my college career there would help, but I\u2019m looking to also go to Medical school in California, too. \n\nAny advice helps! Thank you in advance!

I\u2019m not sure how UCLA works but at UT we have a ton of opportunities to research as an undergrad. I think it might be easier to get involved at UT. From what I\u2019ve heard and I don\u2019t know if this is true because I\u2019m a sophomore but your undergraduate school doesn\u2019t matter as much as the medical school you attend and UT is really well known for medical studies. It\u2019s also really nice to be closer to my parents. I don\u2019t really get along with my family that great but I like being able to visit them now and be able to go home for doctors appointments, to go shopping at cheaper places, etc", "author": "kylieb209", "created": 1585250513, "upvotes": 2}}}
