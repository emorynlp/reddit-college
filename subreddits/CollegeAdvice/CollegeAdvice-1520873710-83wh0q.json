  "text": "Hello, I am currently going through that time in life where one decides when, where, and if they are going to college.  I already know that I want to attend college and get a Bachelors in Computer Science (I also plan to transfer to GA Tech and if they don't accept me UGA after a semester at college).   \n\nCurrently, I am going through the process of picking what college I want to go to and I am in a tough battle between two good universities.  \n\nOne (GA State University) is closer to tech so I will be more comfortable with the drive and they say they often transfer many students to tech.  They have the minor that I want to go into (Japanese language) and they seem to be a fairly good school.\n\nThe second school is Clayton State and they are a lot cheaper and they have my major but not my wanted minor.  Granted, I could hold off on the minor and learn Japanese at Tech, but I do want to study abroad one year if given the chance.  I could always go for a different minor (like math or even a different language) as well.\n\nA few things that can change this fact is that I should qualify for Zell Miller (something that pays for full tuition) and if I don't qualify for Zell Miller I would get the Hope Scholarship (helps with tuition).  \n\nBoth schools seem really good but I am caught between wanting to get the minor that I want and saving a few thousand dollars.\n\nI wanted to see what others thought and recommend what I should do in this case.",
