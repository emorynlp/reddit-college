Anyways, do you think it's possible for me, a kid with a 3.4 (89) GPA, 1510 SAT score, and quite a bit of Dual Credit classes to be accepted? I want to major in Music, with a specialization in Recording Tech, and I've been playing guitar since I was a wee lad, but I've never taken formal lessons, and I don't know if they'll accept some normal small town American guitar boy. Any advice would be great. :D ", "author": "DyJoGu", "created": 1409285806, "retrieved": 1632961076, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
