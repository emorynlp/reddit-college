  "text": "In the beginning of my junior year in high school I was going through a lot of things including being the hospital twice in the same week one a suicide attempt and the other food poisoning. Due to all of this going on I started to no longer care about anything including school, so my grades the first two quarters were in bad shape. Is there anyway I can get a college to understand that?",

      "text": "i think being transparent with schools is the best. it might be a good idea to frame your admissions essay around your struggles, what you've learned from them, and how you hope to use your past for a stronger future. in addition, if any teachers/school faculty know about your issues and you are close to them i'd ask them for the letter of recommendation. they probably will reference this in a positive perspective. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ndepending on your GPA/test scores, you can always start at a community college to get your grades up (also its less pressure and easier to adjust to) and you can transfer to a better school you might not have gotten into with your current grades.",

      "text": "Yes just make excellent grades from now on and have your advisor write a letter and send it with one written by you. Prove that you can bounce back - your perseverance and strength as a student. Junior year was the worst year of my life and I still got into my university. Thing\u2019s will get better slowly but surely. Good luck \ud83d\udc93",
