I wanna drop the Biology program because A) I\u2019m bored with it and B) the math requirements would be much easier if I only did Psych Science. Trouble is, I have a strict mom who has a fiery grudge against anything remotely related to the Humanities, has threatened to make me go to a community college and derail what little of an academic career I\u2019ve developed if I change my major to something she doesn\u2019t like, and is both my sole monetary provider and the sole arbiter of a small trust fund I got when one of my grandparents died.

If not you could change your major without her knowing that you did so. Some colleges allow you to change the access type that parents have to your records such as only being able to see financial information. Otherwise you may just need to have an open and honest conversation (should probably do this regardless) and explain how Psych is still related to the heavier sciences. That's a tough situation, you may also want to get to the root of why she is so against this major. ", "author": "snacksandcomebacks", "created": 1553612303, "upvotes": 2}}}
