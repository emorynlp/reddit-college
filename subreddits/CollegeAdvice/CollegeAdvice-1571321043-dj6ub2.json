Currently a freshman, I don't know if I should've jumped into college yet. I seem to avoid all kinds of social situations and I know consistent absenteeism is some serious shit since about only 4-5 absences result in a failing grade unless supported by documentation or very good reason. Im not an antisocial person by any means, but I just don't know what's going on with me. Any advice would be extremely appreciated.", "author": "Thawingfirr", "created": 1571321043, "retrieved": 1632960963, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f41y4om": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dj6ub2/ive_missed_5_weeks_of_classes_and_i_dont_know/f41y4om/", "text": "See if you can defer a year if you can't do it and wait till you are older and more ready.\n\nIf not, turn up and get on with it. College isn't like school where people wait on you. At the end of the day you are the one who has got to do the work and the professor likely doesn't care if you turn up or not they already have their degree.\n\nAsk if there is anyway to catchup/ do extra work. Catching up is going to be hard but not impossible just depends on your attitude.", "author": "Blue_Boy97", "created": 1571325225, "upvotes": 3}}}
