  "text": "So I went in college with that high school mind set, thinking I can do good putting in minimum effort but that turned out to be a shit show. So, is there a chance that if I develop good studying habits and not fuck around, I can raise my GPA above 3? And please, any advice  on what are good studying habits FOR COLLEGE are welcome.",

      "text": "Also join a club that pertains to your major!! Academic related clubs usually have study sessions, and students among all different grade years to help out with classes. Having friends inside and outside your major is really important as well, as it builds a support system that of people who you can work with (Homework, tests, etc) and people to hang with outside the classroom. I always recommend a good support system + Active Academic Club Activity + Refining Study Habits = Better College Outcome.",

      "text": "For started, look up Ali Abdaal on YouTube. He has quite a good track record of videos on studying methods, how to put in more effort, and generally helpful study videos. But yeah, you need to find some method to make it a habit for yourself. There is a ton of information regarding that, and the best advice i can give is go wild with it, and see what works for you :). Hope you develop some better study habits.",
