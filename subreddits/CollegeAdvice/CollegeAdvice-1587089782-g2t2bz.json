  "text": "Background, I\u2019m majoring in chemical engineering but I\u2019m not against changing if I get to school and discover I hate it. I\u2019m a great student who works hard and will succeed no matter which option I choose. I live with my family right now and to keep it short, the farther away I can get the better. Now that i can\u2019t visit campuses (thank you ms rona) I have no idea what to do. I\u2019ve managed to narrow it down to these two \n \nThe first is the University of Texas \nPros: \n20k in loans for all four years (main reason) \nKnown for their chemical engineering program \nBig school = more major options \n\nCons: \nOnly two hours away from my family \nLess research/internship opportunities \nBig school = bigger classes and less connection to professors \npublic school in Texas = mostly Texans and I want to be surrounded by a wider net of different people with different views of the world \n\nSeconds we have Drexel university\nPros: \nIn Philadelphia = farther away \nThey have a summer program I got accepted into where they pay for room, board, +3k and you intern with a research project = I don\u2019t have to go back home over summers, + research experience is huge when looking for jobs + connections to people will help me network \nAround 15,000 students = median class size of 19 \n98% co-op employment of which 80% are paid \n\nCons:\nNever been to Philadelphia, what\u2019s it like? \n80k for all 4 years (main reason) \n  \n\nBoth of these are great schools that I\u2019m sure I would do well in, but is research experience, connections, and mental health worth paying 4x the price? Those of you who\u2019ve made this choice which did you choose and why? Do you regret it? Am I correct in thinking that internships mean a lot to jobs? I have a limited amount of people I can ask as school is closed so please help me out and feel free to ask me anything. Thank you :)",
