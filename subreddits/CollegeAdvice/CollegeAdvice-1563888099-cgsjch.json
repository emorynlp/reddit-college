Currently, I am a High School Senior researching majors and career paths. I know that my main interests lie within healthcare(nursing being my probable major). Despite knowing what I want to pursue, I don\u2019t want to declare a major my first two years of college...for the sole purpose of giving myself time to really explore and see other possible options. That being said, if I don\u2019t want to declare a major outright, am i still able to take nursing pre-requisites? Even if I\u2019m not technically on the nursing path? Another question I would like to ask: If I go to a 4-year university could I transfer to a nursing school elsewhere after 2-years? For example, say I am interested in Florida State University and take my pre-reqs for the first 2 years, will I then be able to attend say, University of Miami, for the next two years at their nursing school? Would transferring even be a good idea? Please give me some insight, my mind is just filled with so many questions regarding my future, I don\u2019t want to make the wrong decisions...", "author": "Qtitanium5", "created": 1563888099, "retrieved": 1632848907, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
