  "text": "so i basically am a party girl, im in my junior year of college (i\u2019m 18 btw), and totally slacked off for this class. for me it\u2019s easy to skip class a lot and still ace the class. i don\u2019t intend on bragging but i consider myself smart. it\u2019s not hard for me to excel in classes i barely go to. although this statistics class i got cocky with and thought i could skip it all the time and still pass, as i do with all my other classes. news flash, i can\u2019t. i\u2019m failing  and i\u2019m not sure how to email my prof on my failing grade. i rly am willing to do ANYTHING to pass this class. can someone give me advice on what to say/do? thanks \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd7a",
