The classes that do transfer are either full or I can't go at the time it's taken place at. I need one more class to get my financial aid (that I desperately need) and I have no idea what to take. I already have my core classes done (besides those that I have to take a prerequisite, which is the 3 classes I am signed up for) and there aren't any transferable classes to go towards my degree. I know I could take a random elective but it seems like a waste.
