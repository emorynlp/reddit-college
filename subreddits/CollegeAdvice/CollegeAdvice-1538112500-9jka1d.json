  "text": "I am pursuing a B.S in Technology and Information Management. My parents want me to finish a minor in C.S since some of the requirements between C.S and TIM overlap. However, I want to drop the C.S Minor because the coursework is too rigorous and I can also take easier classes to boost my gpa. I am planning on going to graduate school so would a higher gpa be more significant than an additional minor.",
