  "text": "I did college after I graduated and a semester every now and then. But, life always seems to get in the way because of my family, finances or work and I want to stay committed, I know I need to do it but, I don't know how to get there. \n\nI've been stressed out in the past going to school with so much going on I've screwed up my classes by being put in academic probation. I really want to do better. I get so impatient not making any progress, please help.",
