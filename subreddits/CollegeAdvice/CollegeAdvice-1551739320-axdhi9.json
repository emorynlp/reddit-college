For example I already have 15 credits and I don\u2019t even have any for this semester yet and our flagship freshmen class is two years of engineering and one of physics in one class in one year. But my GPA isn\u2019t great I have a 3.2 and some of my grades stand out as pretty bad. Because of the rigor of my courses I don\u2019t have much time to do anything else. What can u do to set myself apart? Two internships are required for my school so I already know that I\u2019m doing that but what else can I do? Any personal experience/ advice or anything else will be gladly appreciated! Thank you!
