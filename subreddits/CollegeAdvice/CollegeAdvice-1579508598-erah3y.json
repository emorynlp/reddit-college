It started off as a horrible adjustment and I struggled socially and academically. I finally made friends by the end of the first year but my grades were already shit. I\u2019ve been getting by with a crappy GPA for a while and am now in my Junior year. Up until this year I had someone to co-sign my loans but now I\u2019m truly dead in the water. I don\u2019t have anybody that can co-sign that is credit worthy and I can\u2019t get enough loans on my own to cover it all. Ive been working 24+ hours a week on night shift to help with living expenses and also to get patient care experience (planning to graduate and go into an accelerated BSN program) and now I am going to have to work close to full time just so I don\u2019t get kicked out of my apartment.  I\u2019m going to a bigger state university and feel that the only thing I can afford will be much smaller, and as stupid as it sounds I\u2019ve even wondered if I could go into a community college. Just not sure what to do at this point... I feel like I know what my end goal is but I have no clue how or if I will be able to get there. Should I transfer to a smaller school so I can afford it, and possibly try to get into a nursing program? My thought is that if I am going to take the extra time to finish the nursing curriculum anyway, I might as well get two degrees for the fuck ton of money I\u2019m spending. Just not sure how it will all work out if I have to transfer and all that. I don\u2019t even know if this all makes sense but I honestly just need to get it out, because I don\u2019t feel like anybody understands or knows what direction to point me in. Getting desperate and honestly pretty terrified at this point.", "author": "bvtmountain", "created": 1579508598, "retrieved": 1632848364, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ff89qqm": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/erah3y/cant_afford_my_college_anymore/ff89qqm/", "text": "I\u2019m sorry that you are experiencing financial problems. From personal experience, I know that college is expensive. I am trying to graduate early to cut costs and jump start my life. I suggest looking into taking some classes at a local community college that will transfer to your university. Typically those classes are a lot cheaper and if they transfer to your university then you will still be able to graduate with a degree from the university you are attending but not at such a high cost. Also I would look into scholarships and online classes through your school. I thought that scholarships were only for incoming freshman but sometimes programs will have niche scholarships to further fund education and allow you to study abroad and other things. My last suggestion is looking into working full time for a company that will pick up your loans or cover your tuition to further your education. This might not be true of all professions but I know that some companies will pay for you to get a masters degree or other things if you work for them as a part of making sure that their employees are educated. I hope that some of this helps and you have good luck in your future!", "author": "throwaway2253647", "created": 1579670200, "upvotes": 1}}}
