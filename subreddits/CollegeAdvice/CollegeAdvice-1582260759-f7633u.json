In doing so I tore all my major ligaments and require two surgeries to start the long road to recovery to even walk properly again.\n\nWith this first surgery coming up I'm becoming concerned with my ability to even attend class and even more nervous as I'll be on painkillers again and I simply can't study while on those so I'll have to chose between studying or being in pain.\n\nI've been able to maintain A's in all my classes but the odd one out currently being an F as I bombed the first exam (the whole class did too lol) and due to the leg I also missed multiple pop quizzes already and I'll miss more because the surgerys, and the quizzes are roughly 20 to 30% of the grade. \n\n(I talked to the professor he said don't worry I drop the two lowest scores, I've already missed two...)\n\nMostly what's keeping me hobbling along is the fact the GI Bill is my primary source of income and to withdraw from school I'd lose that. I wouldn't starve, just wouldn't be as cozy... I'm good with savings.\n\nMaybe im just letting the leg get to me, any thoughts would be great, probably just need to sound board off some people ha.", "author": "KurtB2", "created": 1582260759, "retrieved": 1632960407, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fibfilk": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f7633u/should_i_consider_a_medical_withdrawal/fibfilk/", "text": "Also please do look for the disability office.

Each school has one.  The office is supposed to help you come up with an accommodation plan.   Try to come up with accommodation plan.  If it seems unfeasible, then consider withdrawal.  But try that first.  My daughter hurt her knee in college.  She had to have two surgeries.  It was hard, but she did it.  Her accommodations included extra time for assignments because she had to be on painkillers.  She also has to use crutches and a scooter to get around.  The office also paid for a note taker in one class.  She then took summer school at a jc to make up one class.  That school was tough as the professor was a bitch.  And would not give any slack.  Again, she went to disability office at school and that office forced professor to give her accommodation. In this case it was that instead of a zero for a test she missed, the professor doubled the school of the next test.  You need the documentation of the disability office to protect your rights.
