I have a final year project going on currently and i feel that the rest of my teammates are not being proactive enough, be it in collaborative report writing or coming up with solutions for our project.\n\nDuring group consultations with our professor, I end up being the only one talking most of the time. Any advice to motivate group members to be more proactive in leading the conversation or being more proactive in general?", "author": "shinyhero07", "created": 1586917571, "retrieved": 1632961079, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
