Is this the normal amount people end up owing? Im panicking. I dont think I should go to college at all. Maybe i'll be better working a job that doesn't require a degree, and not even owing money? I mean with the amount I already owe, I intended to going to a four year college for a wildlife conservation and biology degree. I'm not even sure if I can get a job with that! Let alone a well paying one??? Am I fucked? I need advice from someone who went to college without a bunch of scolarships and had to take out loans. Is it hard to pay off loans and live comfortably? Do you have intense anxiety about your loans? BTW im already at one of the cheapest colleges in my area so going to a cheaper college isn't an option.", "author": null, "created": 1531491972, "retrieved": 1632961642, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"e2bv4wk": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/8ykepd/panicking_about_loans/e2bv4wk/", "text": "I took out a ton of loans 2 years ago right after high school like a dumbass. I joined the navy 9 months ago and paying them off has been a breeze. I have no financial obligations besides wifi and the loans. Soon to have a car. And I just got a raise. The military is definitely something you shouldn't write off. They can give you opportunities if you're up to serve.\n\nAlso I can have another shot at college with military tuition assistance and they'll pay for my degree outright. After the training I've had I understand that my failure in college was due to a lack of effort and just blatant immaturity and disregard for the future. I can get a degree easy now. I've already been to college and the last 6 months were way harder. The military gave me the tools and the mentorship I needed to succeed.\n\nOther than that, my sister is still paying off her loans with a masters in business administration and she cant find the 6 figure job she thought she would.\n\nIf you're not sure what you should do, open your perspective because college is expensive and not something you should go into with a lot of uncertainty.", "author": "noah_ahernandez", "created": 1531502632, "upvotes": 1}}}
