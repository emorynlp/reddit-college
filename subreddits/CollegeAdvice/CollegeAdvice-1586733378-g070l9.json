  "text": "Hi. I'm an Indian in the 12th grade right now. I'm currently suffering from celiac disease (gluten allergy). \n\nSince childhood, ny dream has been to study Physics. I want to pursue a career in research. \n\nHowever, there are only a limited institutes in India that offer a good undergraduate program in Physics. \n\nI need to give an exam to get admission in one of the premier research institutes in India. I'm a good student. I know I can crack the exam. \n\nThe problem is, that institute is in a different state. I'm not that independent. Thus, it becomes very difficult for me to survive there, because of my diet. Should I still pursue it?",

      "text": "Hi Op,\nCeliac sucks, my brother has lived with since he was 3 (he\u2019s 16 now) so I can empathize with your concerns regarding your diet. Fortunately for the both of you, Gluten free diets have become somewhat of a fad as of late (which makes my brother quite upset lol) and Gluten Free options have come a long way in being more accessible.\n\nIn all honesty tho I am a little unfamiliar with how post-secondary schooling works in India regarding food, as I go to school in Canada, but I am sure that they will be able to accommodate you regarding your allergy. If you truly want to pursue this school and have no other serious concerns regarding the school outside of your diet, I wholeheartedly recommend you at least attempt the entrance exam. It will give you time to both plan for being a little more independent and if you end up deciding not to go to the school (for your allergies or otherwise), you can say you got in but decided not to go.\n\nIf your allergy is quite severe then I can understand your hesitation, but you can also try doing some research (assuming you haven\u2019t done that already) into the food access in your state of access. It may take a bit of detective work but you\u2019ll be surprised what stores offer when you\u2019re far from home. \n\nBest of luck OP.",
