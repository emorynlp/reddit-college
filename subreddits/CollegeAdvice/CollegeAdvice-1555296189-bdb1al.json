I think I love them both and plan on attending both accepted student days. As a student, I value a small class size and close relationships with professors. But as the socially inclined person I am, I also value seeing and meeting new people as much as possible. So I am completely torn between a large institution that will afford me limitless opportunities and a smaller liberal arts school that will give me the intimate education I would love to have. Any guidance or insight you can give me is greatly appreciated!!!", "author": "chronicquestioner42", "created": 1555296189, "retrieved": 1632961523, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ekxkhb2": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bdb1al/help_me_choose/ekxkhb2/", "text": "Cornell. You will have so many opportunities to have small classes there (especially as you take higher level courses during your Juinor and Senior years). The town of Ithaca is amazing (I was just there visiting Ithaca College). By living in a college town, you will meet tons of new students from Ithaca and Cornell. I think you will feel just at home.", "author": "lashmo29", "created": 1555325943, "upvotes": 2}}}
