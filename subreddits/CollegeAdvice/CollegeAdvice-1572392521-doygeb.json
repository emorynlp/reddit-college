Im mainly looking at colleges in georgia, like KSU, which has about a 3.28 average GPA, while also still being a good college. Im also looking into going to australia for college", "author": "karmapringle", "created": 1572392521, "retrieved": 1632961172, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
