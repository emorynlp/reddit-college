I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. I (F20) am about to graduate from undergrad, and with the help of an amazing family and several scholarships, I have managed to finish in 3 years, debt free. I\u2019m studying to be a Speech-Language Pathologist(SLP), and in order to work/be certified, it is necessary that I attend graduate school. I applied to several schools, and I got into my school of choice (University of Pittsburgh), which has a high ranking SLP program, and has more medical based classes (which is the setting I prefer), rather than school based classes. I also got into the grad program at my undergraduate university, which is a small liberal arts school less that 30 minutes from my home. This school has a good program too, but it has a much lower ranking, and is much more school based. The catch is, my undergraduate university offered me a $4,500 graduate assistantship (total tuition is $8,500 per academic year), and Pitt ( $32,000 per academic year) has so far not offered any money. I want to leave my hometown and go to a high ranking university that has classes I\u2019m interested in, but would I be absolutely stupid to go into debt to do so?", "author": "studentindistressSLP", "created": 1583873531, "retrieved": 1632960122, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fk6hjvn": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fgkung/are_student_loans_worth_it/fk6hjvn/", "text": "That\u2019s too expensive imo, don\u2019t do it", "author": "SutherlandPhys", "created": 1583902360, "upvotes": 1}, "fk5yur7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fgkung/are_student_loans_worth_it/fk5yur7/", "text": "I\u2019d say go cheaper option, but also I don\u2019t know a lot about your field.
