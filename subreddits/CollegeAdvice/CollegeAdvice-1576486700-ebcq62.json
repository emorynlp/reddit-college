I am not sure if I should transfer into Binghamton because I am worried about the change in lifestyle and social life and that if I ever wanted to transfer back into NYC, NYU will no longer be an option.\nHowever, there are many reasons why I dislike NYU Tandon, mainly social aspects. I dislike how isolated it is from the main campus and not having my own community to talk to. Also I did not plan on majoring in engineering, but went to Tandon just for the NYU name. \nShould I transfer to Binghamton\u2019s SOM? I do feel that I would do better majoring in business and that I will be happier doing business instead of engineering but, again, I am not 100% sure.", "author": "cli551265", "created": 1576486700, "retrieved": 1632848674, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {}}
