Right now, I am in three programs: journalism, vocal performance, and music education. I went in thinking it would be best to start out in these and drop the one I don't want later since they are all limited enrollment. \n\nI can see myself doing a job in pretty much any of these fields, but I do have that \"dream job\" that is just a little unrealistic but I will never know if I don't try. I know it sounds stupid and \"everyone wants to be a star\" but I really miss being involved with musical theatre and something about it calls to me. I am worried now that if I don't put myself 100% into it, then it will be impossible for me to ever get there.\n\nNow I am stuck between choosing the two majors that are \"safe,\" journalism and music ed., and giving up on ever achieving my dreams, or I can take the risk and do vocal performance and theatre (we don't have a musical theatre program specifically) and losing half my scholarships from journalism. The scholarship money (although only $5k/year) is a factor since I am from out-of-state and the tuition is ridiculous. But if I'm going to be in debt for the rest of my life anyway maybe I should be doing the job I love?\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to minor in the programs besides vocal performance, but if I do that I want to major in it. \n\nTldr: Do I go all in for my dream career and risk losing some scholarship, or do I play it safe and give up on my dreams?", "author": "musicalconfusion", "created": 1549039407, "retrieved": 1632961565, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"efxdmfy": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/am3y04/choosing_the_right_majorcareer_path/efxdmfy/", "text": "I\u2019m not too familiar with these majors and their career prospects, but I hate to say this, you need to look at the money.
