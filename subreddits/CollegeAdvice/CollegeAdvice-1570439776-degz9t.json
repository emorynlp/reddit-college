Living here was fine in high school, but throughout the years this house has changed. I live with a few family members including my baby cousins who have now grown up a little and are more active & talkative. As much as I love my family, the lack of space and boundaries in this house has really been stressing me out to the point where I\u2019m getting frustrated and even resentful towards them. It\u2019s so hard to even have a basic routine here because you never know when someone\u2019s gonna use the bathroom/kitchen/or just be loud. Also, a lot of the times I just find myself sucked into something with my family members, even when I try to avoid them. I just feel like there\u2019s so much disruption in my life that I\u2019m not even fully focusing on school and being a college student. Tbh, sometimes I\u2019d cry at night over how much I hate my living situation. I know I have to change something but it feels like every change I try to make doesn\u2019t last. So the only thing I can think of is moving out, but I feel like that\u2019s such a big decision, and one that I\u2019d definitely get judged or criticized for because they\u2019d view it as unnecessary. But right now that\u2019s the only thing I can think of that would help my sanity/happiness.", "author": "beachy8910", "created": 1570439776, "retrieved": 1632848833, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f2vtja3": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/degz9t/should_i_move_out_my_house/f2vtja3/", "text": "If you can afford it and it helps your sanity then from what I see its 100% worth it just be prepared for paying more.", "author": "Bash_and_Dash", "created": 1570457207, "upvotes": 3}, "f2vis16": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/degz9t/should_i_move_out_my_house/f2vis16/", "text": "If I could afford to live on my own I would, I am miserable in my home.
