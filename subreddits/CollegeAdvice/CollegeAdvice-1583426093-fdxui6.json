  "title:": "Is it better to go to a prestigious school or have a higher GPA?",
  "text": "I am looking into a college to get my undergrads. I have about a 3.9 GPA and I got a 29 on the ACT, but I will retake it. I want to be a doctor but know I need about a 3.5 GPA to get into medical school. I\u2019m pretty sure I could be accepted to a higher ranking school but I\u2019m not sure how well I would do at a prestigious university. Are medical schools easier on you in the acceptance process if you took harder classes?\n\nIs it better to have a higher GPA than difficult classes?\n\nI\u2019m sure I can learn the material; however, my grades tend to slip when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure.",

      "text": "First, your scores are impressive. I\u2019m curious if you have contacted schools that you might attend to determine if you can see yourself excelling at those schools. I don\u2019t know if you may not do well if you\u2019re not challenged enough scholastically, but it\u2019s a possibility. Consider talking to admissions, alumni, and visit different schools to find where you are comfortable and can see yourself thriving. Perhaps transferring after some time is an option too? I wish you all the best!",

          "text": "Thank you! Half of my classes this year are at a college-level and will be taking all college-level classes next year. However, I don't think that this is very impressive. My classes look good on paper, but they aren't much more difficult than standard classes. My mom said they are easy because I'm smart, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's just because I go to a standard public high school. I'm concerned if I make the change into a prestigious university, where many people came from prestigious high schools, I won't do well. I'll have to talk with the universities. Thank you for your response.",
