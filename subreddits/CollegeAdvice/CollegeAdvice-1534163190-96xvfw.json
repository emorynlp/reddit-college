This is my first time posting on reddit and I thought I may get some insight on what is going on in my college education right now. I\u2019m sorry if this is very long for some to read, and I I\u2019ll try my best to summarize. \n\nTo give you some background, I am about to start my senior year of college and I can honestly say a lot has changed since my freshman year. After the first semester of my freshman year, I declared my major in Exercise Science with the intent I was going into Physical Therapy. After three years I admit I bit off more than I can chew, and completely underestimated my ability to do well in my math classes. I could make B+ or higher in the classes that focused on exercise science and physical education, but the math classes were the things I struggled in the most (barely passing). \n\nFast forward to my junior year, I had to take an Special Populations in P.E. course which taught me how to modify physical activity for people who may be disabled. One part of the class grade was to take what we learned in class and use it to create a P.E. class with children who have disabilities. A class of elementary school children would visit our gym every Friday and we would have to prepare a lesson plan. All the children had a wide array of different disabilities like autism, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy. The entire class was such a rewarding experience and I was actually sad to see the kids for the last time at the end of the semester. I enjoyed working with the kids and I loved using my creativity to modify exercise for kids who may not have the ability to play the same games their classmates were doing. And overall I loved to see kids who did not have to strength to run or play around get up and finally have fun with their friends. I never knew I would get so much out of that class but it made me rethink everything about my career path. \n\nAfter taking this class and looking at the odds of making into physical therapy, I\u2019m just not sure about my graduation plan anymore. My advisor offered the idea of changing my major to physical education with a teachers licensure. At my college the exercise science and physical education major take the same classes. The only difference is that exercise science majors take more science classes, while physical education take more child development classes.  If I do change I will still be set for graduation, I just don\u2019t know that much about the physical education field to make my final choice. Am I going the right direction?
