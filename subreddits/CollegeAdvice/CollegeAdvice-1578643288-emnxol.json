In the first semester, I fell short by 7% and I wasn't allowed to give my exams. I'll be giving them this summer along with my second semester exams, if at all I don't botch up my attendance this semester as well. \nWe're in the second week of college and I don't think I've attended more than 3 days of college. Despite knowing the repercussions, I just cannot bring myself to. \n\nSince it's just the second week, I can make it up by the end of January. \nAny tips, ANYTHING would help right now. But it's such a horrible place I don't ever feel like attending. I don't want to repeat a year here, I want to be able to give my exams and just leave.", "author": "serra97", "created": 1578643288, "retrieved": 1632960498, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
