I just got admitted to Emerson College's Media Arts Production program and University of Texas at Austin's Radio-Television-Film program, and I'm still deciding where I should go.

You\u2018d also have plenty of opportunities to collaborate with people not just inside but also outside of Emerson as well (not to mention you would be a train ride away from NYC for more filmmaking and internship opportunities, and Emerson has a lot of international film partnerships as well). \n\nI would personally choose Emerson when it comes to down to comparing programs alone, but at the end of the day its all about what excites you the most and best aligns with your future goals!", "author": "PassionPit101", "created": 1586230933, "upvotes": 1}, "fmlqomh": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fvxviu/emerson_college_vs_ut_austin/fmlqomh/", "text": "I\u2019m doing the same thing trying to decide.
