I have been offered a $25,000 scholarship at UConn within the STEM scholar program, making UConn a total of 26-28k a year depending on expenses (I am an out of state student). The only reason I am considering SUNY Stony Brook is because I am a pre-med student and I know they prepare students well there. I also received a full tution scholarship at Stony brook, making the total there from 16-20k. But I have not received any honor program at Stony Brook. As a pre-med student I know that SUNY Stony Brook has excellent opportunties at a great cost, but my fear is that the Honors STEM Scholar at UConn will be better in terms of rigour and recongition. Is there anyone who has advice on what school woul be better fit for me (disregarding finanace as bith schools are relatively afforable for me)?", "author": "confusedcollegegurl", "created": 1585933767, "retrieved": 1632960334, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
