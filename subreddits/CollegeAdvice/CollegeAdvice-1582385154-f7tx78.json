Prior to that semester, I felt that my first university\u2019s \u201cGame and Simulation Art\u201d program wasn\u2019t a good option for me so I decided to look into different options. I transferred to OSU primarily because it is a commutable distance from my home, which would make it a more affordable option.\n\nThe \u201cArt and Technology\u201d major I\u2019m currently in involves some animation and virtual reality classes, along with some digital art classes like digital art and holography. Studio art classes also are a very significant part of my program.\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been regretting transferring to this program OSU... I think I should\u2019ve just transferred to somewhere with an actual 4 year animation degree program or just finished with an associates degree from my community college and work from there, but now if I  transfer to another 4 year college it seems like it won\u2019t be worth it due to the loss of credits, and an associates degree in animation or game development probably won\u2019t be worth anything to employers, so right now I\u2019m considering just going to the community college for a degree in something useful. \n\nHonestly if I could go back in time, I probably would\u2019ve picked a major like nursing or marketing.\n\nMy father suggested a medical imaging/x-ray program, but after hearing more about the job from his friend, I\u2019m not sure I would enjoy it. Still, I want to get a job that pays, so it isn\u2019t off the table yet.\n\nWhat do you all think I should do? Should I abandon the BFA I\u2019ve so far put about two and a half years into and just get a degree in something useful like the medical imaging program my father suggested, or should I just begrudgingly finish my BFA and try and find a grad school program in a different field?", "author": "Saul104", "created": 1582385154, "retrieved": 1632848333, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fiocm0l": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f7tx78/should_i_abandon_my_bfa_program_to_get_a/fiocm0l/", "text": "1) You won't be able to go to grad school in a substantially different field, they will require you to have taken certain courses in undergrad relevant to your intended field of study and to have had relevant extracurricular or work experience.  \n2) A lot of what you're mentioning sounds like marketable skills though! If you know how to animate and some of the other design-oriented CS skills, you can do something similar to marketing with that, you'd just also be able to follow something you're interested in. Look up what a \"UX designer\" they design the interface for all sorts of websites. You still have options.  \n\n\nIn short, I'd stick it out with the degree. You are correct that an associates alone will not get you very far. You could be useful for a myriad of companies trying to figure out how they want to advertise themselves. If you have the option to take any more CS-type courses on the side, I'd strongly advise doing that.", "author": "Empowerly-Admissions", "created": 1582580634, "upvotes": 2}}}
