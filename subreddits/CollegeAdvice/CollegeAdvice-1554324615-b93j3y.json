So after getting rejected by first two choices :( MIT, Columbia I was accepted into NYU with a small scholarship compared to the expense. I also got into all my choices for CUNY with a full scholarship for the colleges I applied to, such as city college, hunter, queens and some others.  I also got into most of my SUNY\u2019s such suny poly, suny Plattsburgh, buffalo state, alfred state, I got whitelisted by Binghamton though. My major is computer science and to be quite frank I\u2019m more interested in staying in the city over going upstate. I\u2019m unsure if getting a loan and going into NYU is worth the money and I\u2019m also looking into doing undergrad school for a CUNY or suny and transferring into a more prestigious school. Any advice on what the best options money wise and considering my preference to stay in the city.", "author": "xjay0", "created": 1554324615, "retrieved": 1632848989, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
