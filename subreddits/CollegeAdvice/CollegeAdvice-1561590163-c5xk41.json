  "text": "So I got my final exam grade back from this years Chemistry exam which I got a 56 and my overall average is a 58 but all my other grades are in the high 80s low 90s, I was wondering how much does failing high school chemistry matter in getting into college.\nPS I am not thinking about going to any Ivy League and other \"good\" schools. Also this was my sophomore year and I am not taking summer school.",

              "text": "If you want a little hope here:\nI personally did not care for high school, I didn\u2019t study for test or quizzes, and dreaded going there. I had a 3.00 gpa and my SAT was a 1200, my act was a 28. I was in the fourth quarter of my class (1000 students). Even with my 0 extracurricular besides scouts I wouldn\u2019t be the most potential pick for colleges. However I got accepted to all the colleges I applied to. (University of Houston, University of Texas at Dallas, and Texas Tech.) So if you\u2019re not the best  you can succeed.",
