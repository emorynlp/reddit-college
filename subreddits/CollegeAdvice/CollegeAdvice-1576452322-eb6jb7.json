  "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but here we go.\n\n I've been wanting to go back to school for some time now. But I can never justify the decision because I dont really have any drive or direction in what I want to do. All of my interests back in high school were theater, english and art related but I know that any career in those fields would be kind of hit or miss in terms of a solid paycheck, at least for awhile. Plus I feel like I'd almost be wasting my time and money going for something that isnt stem related.\n\n Right now I'm making decent money, at least enough to survive on, and I have a whole career ahead of me. But I feel trapped in it. \n\nI want to go back to college mostly so my daughter doesnt have to have a college dropout for a father but it's just so hard when I'm not really sure what job I would like to do. It's all just so overwhelming and I dont think I can do it.\n\nEven if I did find something I wanted to study towards. I kind of got kicked out of my previous college for lack of attendance (that's a whole other story) and I just dont know if I'll even be able to be accepted anywhere else. Student loans fucking scare me. And I'm just so uncertain of what to do. Has anyone else had this feeling and pushed through it? And would be willing to offer some advice or guidance?",
