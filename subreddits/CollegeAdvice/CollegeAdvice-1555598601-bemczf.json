If anyone has any other subs they recommend i cross post to that would be much appreciated.\n\nBasically, i am looking to attend a masters program in either architecture or fashion design. To keep this somewhat concise, i'll avoid explaining why I am interested in these fields. I graduated (debt free thankfully) from college in spring 2018 with a bachelors in liberal studies, and a GPA of 2.72 with a less than impressive transcript to boot. To be honest, I was very lost in college, dealt with pretty severe depression, and wasn't excited to do or study anything. I only graduated by kind of floating through a multitude of menial classes.\n\nAfter working odd jobs for the last year and doing a lot of reflecting, I finally feel as though I have lifted myself out of the depression and am ready to point my life in a new direction. I am interested in pursuing a masters degree in one of these two fields I have interest in (architecture/fashion design). Unfortunately, both fields require portfolios, which i do not have (despite taking art classes in college/high school- lost everything to a broken laptop and frequent moves). I am considering attending a community college to familiarize myself with programs and techniques used in one of these fields as well as create a portfolio, and then applying to a masters program. I am also considering trying to learn the important programs and techniques on my own, and then craft my portfolio from home.\n\nThough I am debt free now, i only have about 1500 dollars to my name and am currently working as a substitute teacher not really making enough money to pay for school. I am also moving soon with my lovely girlfriend as she will be moving for her career (landscape architecture). Luckily i have a wonderful support system and will not have to worry about rent for the next two years. I also have quite a bit of high end bartending experience and am considering going back to that when my girlfriend and I move, as we are moving to a major city and bartending would be far more lucrative than my current position.\n\nSo I was hoping for advice on: what the benefits are for architecture/ fashion design as a career, what steps I should take to develop a portfolio/ what could be beneficial to include in my portfolio, what steps I can take to make up for my poor GPA and transcript, what steps I can take to look in to an affordable loan/ an affordable university to attend a masters program, and what steps I can take to be more financially secure throughout this process. I am also curious as to whether it would be wise to obtain my associates in one of the fields and then apply to graduate school, or if that would be a waste of my time and money (as a result of being forced to take unnecessary classes).\n\nI want to include that though I am not in a rush to make this happen for myself, I would hope to be able to finish a masters program before I am 30. If what I'm hoping for is unrealistic, please let me know that too. \n\nThanks everyone!\n\nTLDR: 23 years old with a bad GPA looking to try and get myself into either an architecture or fashion design graduate program.", "author": "spacecasesam", "created": 1555598601, "retrieved": 1632848982, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
