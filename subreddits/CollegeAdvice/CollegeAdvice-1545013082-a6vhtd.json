  "text": "Hello, \n\nI am a junior in college and I am getting my finals results back now, in one of my classes I got a 0 on a project I spent weeks on. The teacher responded to my assignment saying it was not done well enough, and you did not get an 80 which is the minimum you can get to pass this assignment. So I got a 0 on it which dropped my grade a full point in the class. Can teachers require you to get a good grade on an assignment?",
