I am majoring in biology on the Pre-Med track. I am paying a little over $22,000 in tuition. My girlfriend and I are from a town in Iowa about 4 hours away. She goes to South Dakota State University on a full ride for athletics. SDSU is about 6 hours away from home.\nI am considering transferring to there to save money and to see her more often. Before any scholarships from SDSU, it would cost around $10,000 per year for me. We have been dating for over two years now so I am not super worried about us lasting. I was a little disappointed in Creighton because I learned firsthand that there is a pretty big party scene which is not really my thing. So that made me think that maybe I should go somewhere else and at least save some money in the process. \nCreighton has a good medical school so the plan was to just continue on through there after my undergrad. However, if I transfer to SDSU I would have to go to a different medical school. How much should that factor into my decision?\nI definitely think I would be happier at SDSU although I am not particularly unhappy here. \nHelp me make the best decision; give me things to consider or just tell me straight up what you would do.
