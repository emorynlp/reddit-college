  "text": "Hey guys so I got accepted to both colleges for Electircal Engineering and was wondering which is better. Currently I'm in the process of changing to Biology major since I want to become a surgeon but neither school offers premed and instead has something called \"prehealth.\" Any recommendations for one college over the other? Thanks! \n\nAlso wtf is the difference between premed and prehealth? ",
