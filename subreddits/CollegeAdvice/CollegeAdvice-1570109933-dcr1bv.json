I work a full time job that requires 40 hours a week. I took a year off school due to having twins. With that said, I am limited on time to do school work.\n\nI have completed about 30 units of general ed/prerequisites and am currently looking to try and fit in courses at my local community college @ Palomar in california. My major is computer science.\n\nAfter researching online, Monterey Bay has an online degree for a bachelors that presumably accepts transfer credits from palomar college. I know there are other community colleges near San Diego such as Mira Costa college and Mira Mar college which could help my busy life.\n\n[Questions]\n\nCould I look for online and in class courses at these other community colleges and will these all work as transferable credits interchangeably to an online university like Monterey Bay?\n\nIs it important to do an online college in California? I've seen some far away in states such as Florida, but could see it raise an eyebrow when applying for jobs in the future.\n\nIs there any good links or resources that are available that I could research? Information on how to select the right college for myself? To be honest, Google can be an overwhelming amount of information.\n\nAny recommendations for someone in my shoes?\n\nThank you in advance!", "author": "emmicKs", "created": 1570109933, "retrieved": 1632961183, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f2abybe": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dcr1bv/picking_a_college_path_online_california_resident/f2abybe/", "text": "Wow that\u2019s amazing!
