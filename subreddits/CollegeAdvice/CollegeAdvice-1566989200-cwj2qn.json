  "title:": "Should I take a gap year even though im half way done with university?",
  "text": "So, im 21, currently living in Spain, studying animation. In september I would be starting my third year, but last year was really rough on me and I failed a few subjects. Not only that, but I was very depressed and wasnt enjoying any of my clases or the people there- Which is also a factor on why im thinking of taking a gap year. \n\nI have been going to this university for two years (My degree lasts 4 years in total) and have not made any friends there and like I said, the second year there I didnt enjoy at all, but it also has to do with lots of things that went wrong last year. I also havent goten really good yet, since its animation, you're supposed to be good at art or at least heading in that direction and Im honestly pretty much still a beginner even though im moving on to my third year. (Oh btw I would have to repeat the subjects that I failed and pair it with a few of the new ones from my third year). Dont get me wrong, I love animation and would love to dedicate myself to it, but something about my second year, the classes, the teachers and the people there really just exhausted me and threw me off.\n\nSo my question is, should I take a gap year? Especially since its in the middle of my studies? I was thinking of getting a job during this time If I do take the gap year, and I would probably try to go to art classes or try to learn a language...Something useful to not waste my year. So plaese, if anybody has experiences in this kind of situation, or pros and cons to it, I would love to hear them. Thank you!",
