I do not have that diverse of extracurriculars as I have only done cross country and track but, I received varsity letters in both.\n\n I live in NJ but I have no idea of where I would like to go to college. I have looked at places like Rutgers and Penn State but I have no idea if I could even get in or what would be a good school for me to apply to. I'm interested in business but I  don't really know what I want to pursue. \n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
