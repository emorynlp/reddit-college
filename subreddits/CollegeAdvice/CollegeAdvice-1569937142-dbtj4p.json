Because of that I planned on doing berklee school of music online to study music production and use that to help record and write music with my band. The thing is, I\u2019ve heard that music production degrees are not worth it. The other option is that I attend a real school in Denver and study something more useful. But I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have the flexibility or the time I need for the band since we travel a lot if I go to a real school. What do I do.
