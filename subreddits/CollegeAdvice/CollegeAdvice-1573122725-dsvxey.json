I am really insecure about my future and need some advice regarding my major.\n\nI am currently attending university as a Biological Science major. When I first applied to universities, I was really interested in Biology and wanted to work in the medical field. I still have passion in the medical field, however recently I have been thinking about majoring in CS or Math. It is not because I am trying to make more money but rather I started to take interest in these topics. I always genuinely enjoyed math as a general and interned at an IT department at a company over the summer. I don't want to change my major as I want to pursue my future in the medical field, however I want to explore more into math or CS so I can determine what is for me.\n\nThank you for reading this post.", "author": "classof20never", "created": 1573122725, "retrieved": 1632960947, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f6tsth4": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dsvxey/should_i_double_major/f6tsth4/", "text": "Hey! \n\nFirst off, genuinely happy for you that you're passionate and excited about learning. Really, that - above all else - is what will make the work enjoyable and easy (well, eas*ier*). I'm going to second what someone else said, which is to take a class or two from those majors and see if they catch your attention. But realistically, that's a lot of time (especially in college where units and time are valuable). \n\nTo get a better idea in less time, I'd go talk to a counselor (they likely have drop-in advising hours) and ask them all your questions! You'll get a good idea of the major and what is required to complete it. They'll be able to give you realistic and clear information about switching or adding another major. You didn't mention what year you are - but I'd prepare yourself to hear that it will likely take you more time to graduate. If that sounds or feels overwhelming, just think through your personal drive and reasoning for wanting to learn, and your purpose of being at school. \n\nFollow what makes you excited and happy.

Also if you took an interest in to IT then you should also look in to the fact that CS is just programing/coding and computer systems are two different fields in the IT industry.
