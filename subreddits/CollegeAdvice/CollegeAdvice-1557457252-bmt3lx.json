So is it worth going the distance when I live nearby to another cc. Also math classes are filled up at SMC only night classes are available and I don't want to commute at night by bus or train.", "author": null, "created": 1557457252, "retrieved": 1632848959, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
