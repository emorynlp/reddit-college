Build up a good record with activities and such like NJHS, volunteering, sports, other extracurriculars. An 1140 isn\u2019t bad thats literally what I got and it got me into every school I wanted. I would use the SATs official study book I think it\u2019s maybe around 50 bucks. I had a 4.18 GPA sophomore year and then took college classes at a community college and it brought my GPA down slightly. They will look at your classes so as long as you are taking challenging courses I think that\u2019s more important than a GPA.", "author": "20kaisera", "created": 1578353476, "upvotes": 2}}}
