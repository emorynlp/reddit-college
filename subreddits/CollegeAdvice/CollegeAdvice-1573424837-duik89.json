      "text": "Right there with you, I'm in a math class that's literally going to cause me to not graduate by one credit hour. Talked to the dean, talked to counselors, and even have been through tutoring and they all just look at me like I'm stupid. No one seems to understand that I can't just stop working to go to school because living on your own is expensive, plus paying for school on your own. Add a 40+ hour work schedule Monday-Saturday on top of four classes in the semester and it is just an insanely difficult task. All I can say is keep your head up, talk to anyone you can, and be willing to reach out for any help possible. No shame in getting help.",
