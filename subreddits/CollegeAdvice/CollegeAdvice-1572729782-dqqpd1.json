  "text": "I would love any advice at all. For a little backstory, I was \"home schooled\" all my life and have found navigating school on my own incredibly hard. Community college seemed like my best choice but I've felt lost and I'm running low on money. I don't have a job and with my intense anxiety I don't know if it's possible for me right now. I also don't think I could handle both school and working anyway. I don't think I can afford to even take more than one class this next semester and I've been feeling unmotivated because of that. I just want to go to school and learn, have an education. I'm really interested in studio arts and film, also a bit in english. I'm not sure what I should do from here. Should I drop out and hope someday I'll have enough to get a degree? Should I just take out a bunch of loans and get a real experience? Should I look into other states prices? I want to learn and I'd love to work as an illustrator or in movies, especially doing background art for animations or working in movies like Coraline. I just am finding everything so overwhelming that I'm barely motivated to even finish my one class for this semester. I have a hard time having the motivation when there's no clear goal or plan for what to do.",

      "text": "Hi there!   \nHave you looked into financial aid or filed your FASFA by chance? It's possible you are eligible for the federal pell grant (you don't have to repay this!). Before you take out any loans, definitely go and talk to the financial aid department at your CC to see what options you have - they will likely know of some grants or scholarships you could apply for. \n\nFor next semester, if it does work out that you can only afford one class - maybe that would be a good time to try getting a job so you could save up while your workload is low! I completely understand the anxiety around having both a job and school - so maybe you could try a job that is more on your own schedule and allows more flexibility. I'm thinking things like babysitting, dog walking, maybe driving for a food delivery service. There are also likely opportunities to work *on* your school campus - and these jobs often require few hours and are super flexible because they know everyone is a student and has lots to do!  \n\nAgain, the best thing to do right now is to go talk to a counselor and the financial aid department. They will help you - they do not want education to be limited by financial inability, especially when students are as motivated as you.",
