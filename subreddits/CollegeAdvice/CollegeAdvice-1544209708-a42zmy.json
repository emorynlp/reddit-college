F21 here and I will soon be a computer science major at snhu online. I was wondering if it would mean anything to add a business administration degree into it? I\u2019m thinking maybe if I could like have my own sort of \u201cboys and girls club\u201d type thing strictly for computer science/coding (yes I know that\u2019s already a thing) then it would be a helpful add on. But other than that, what could I do with this double major?", "author": "MO-life-MO-problems", "created": 1544209708, "retrieved": 1632849383, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ebqq6lj": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/a42zmy/has_anyone_had_this_dual_major_is_it_meaningful/ebqq6lj/", "text": "With computer science and business administration, you will definitely have a few options open to you post-graduation. If you're looking to utilize both, your work may be more centered around business information systems or as a software developer for the finance industry. \n\nWill adding business administration help with starting up your own coding camp for youth? It could definitely give you a leg up, but it's not required to start up your own small business. At the end of the day, I think it all comes down to whether you personally enjoy learning about business administration and don't mind taking on the extra work.
