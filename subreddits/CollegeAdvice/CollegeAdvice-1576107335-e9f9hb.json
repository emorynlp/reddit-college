  "text": "I'm applying for my local community college, I have registered classes.. completed my fafsa..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like doing this is a dream.. I'm waiting for this wall to hit me..\n\nI'm gonna be working part time and taking classes full time.. I was hoping student loans would help cover some living expenses while I'm in school.. I don't think I can afford living expenses with a part time job, I would do a full time job, but it has to work with my school schedule..which is kinda hard for me to find..\n\nI'm going for accountant bachelors degree. The average salary for an entry level job is about 40k.. with that I could pay between 10k-20k per year on the loans..\n\nIt appears that only 3500 in loans can be subsidized.. so I need to make payments while I'm in school.. Do I use the loan for that?\n\nWhat are the chances that I can make this work.. I have bad credit, so that puts some limits on loans.. My family is poor\n\nI need references for the loans as well.. which I have social anxiety so not many connections.. I need to reach out to someone..hopefully that'll work..\n\nThis dream is slipping.. I need to hold it.. I can't be poor anymore.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI going back tomorrow to talk to the financial aid office again..",
