  "text": "Hello all, any input on this would be great as I am simply stuck. I am certain that I will be studying finance next year. I will explain my top 3 options with the pros and cons.\n\n\nIndiana- Direct Admit to business school and honors college, most affordable at the end of the day, Big 10 atmosphere, good placement to Wall Street for those at top of class/ not great location, easily least prestigious (80+ percent) acceptance rate. \n\nMiami (FL)- great location and overall atmosphere, Direct Admit to business school and honors college. Pretty selective. Offered special program to work on campus/ more expensive, less highly ranked business\n school\n\nOxford College (Emory)- Great business program, great location (Atlanta), most prestigious and respected. Good ties to Wall Street/ most expensive, was waitlisted at main campus, have to apply to business program after 2 years.  No sports, not very social environment at Oxford.",
