I am instead heading to Colorado State for Fisheries Bio(think marine bio but freshwater). Assuming I stay interested in Marine Bio, I very may well try to transfer to University of Miami after a year or so. My question is, what do I have to do to help ensure I could be able to transfer? Obviously, I know I need to get good grades, but what else might they be looking for? Any advice appreciated!", "author": "stefanfolk", "created": 1547003512, "retrieved": 1632961578, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
