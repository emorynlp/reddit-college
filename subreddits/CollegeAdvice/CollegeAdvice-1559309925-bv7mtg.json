Personally I\u2019m not too worried about getting in or should I? I attend a very small school (class with 27 students) and I feel as if I\u2019m surrounded by idiots. Maybe my grades aren\u2019t so great but compared to my class mates it\u2019s a different story. My overall GPA is 3.9 and I haven\u2019t taken my SATs yet. I also already have 24 credits from my classes.
