  "text": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nFirst off, I do not want to mention the name of the school or any names of the people involved. But anyways here is what has been going on. I am new to this college but have taken plenty of college courses in the past. My college career got put on hold for a few personal reasons. In the past I have not had any conflicts with professors, and I have gone more or less unnoticed in most of my college classes. However, this professor is different. In the beginning of the semester she told the class that she had mental health issues and was in the process of changing her medication, so she could be more tired than usual. This seemed kind of inappropriate for a professor to mention, as it seems like private information. She also constantly complains about how hard her job is and how many papers she has to grade. And about how she doesn\u2019t know how to use the colleges Blackboard software. This is an issue because blackboard is an essential for completing quizzes and other assignments. Also, complaining about it to the class during a lecture seems inappropriate as well. So fast forward to this past week we were in a normal lecture and she was discussing some unwritten specifications for our homework assignment. I had raised my hand and asked her if she could post these requirements in the assignment description where it outlines all of the other requirements for the assignment. And she broke down. She almost started crying while yelling at the whole class, saying how easy the assignment was, and if we couldn\u2019t figure it out we would have no chance at getting a job, and so on. This went on about 5 minutes. And the class was dead silent for another 5 minutes. And I didn\u2019t dare say another word. I felt so embarrassed I could hardly breath. I asked my friend next to me if what I had said seemed disrespectful or out of place. He told me that he was about to ask the same question. The next day (my off day) I get an email from her saying I need to come to her office to have a chat. I didn\u2019t know what the chat is going to be about. And I was almost certain she wasn\u2019t going to bring up what happened earlier in the week. During our chat, she basically told me how disrespectful I was and if I ask another question in class she would report me to the dean of students. At this point I am very confused and scared. I am confused about what I have done wrong, and scared that she will grade me harder because she clearly doesn\u2019t fancy me.\n\nI just need some advice. I don\u2019t want this to escalate, I just want to be a normal student and somehow get on her good side. Are there counselors at university\u2019s for this type of thing? Or who can I go to to talk about my situation?",

      "text": "Is it too late to drop this course? I am also a college student but maybe this can help. I would say to drop this course and take it next semester with another professor if possible. Even if there is not another professor she might forget it by next semester. Here is the thing, if u really thing she hates you so bad to fail you or make it a big deal then just drop it before it gets worse. \n\nIt is unlikely that she will leave if she has the power, but at least you will leave her before you get in real trouble. When I was a freshman I was scared to drop because of the money wasted, but I will have to take the course again anyways so my GPA is not compromised",
