They want my permanent and local address. The local can be the same as the permanent, but doesn't have to be. I've seen on some online forums that the local address is that of your dorm...but a dorm is what I'm trying to apply for right now. What do I put?\n\nFor reference, I currently live in the Southern part of Florida; UF is about 4-5 hours away.", "author": "Colonel_Gator", "created": 1584313094, "retrieved": 1632960475, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
