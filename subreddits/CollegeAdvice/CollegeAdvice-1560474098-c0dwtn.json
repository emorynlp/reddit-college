I decided I want to get into a career instead of working stressful, dead end jobs. So I went and got my GED. However, beyond that, I have no idea what to do next. The best I could come up with is that the CC near me doesn't offer courses in the field I want to get into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly terrified. My husband is being super supportive and has been pushing me along as best he can, but he knows I have to be the one to take that next step. Change is scary, especially when you have no idea what you're doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of this helps, I want to get into Zoology and I am in the Dayton, Ohio area\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice. I greatly appreciate it. I've filled out my FAFSA and began the enrollment process.

One you finish, your advisor will talk to you about your intended class load and suggest courses. \n\nUsually at this point, you will search the classes online and develop your own schedule for school. It's important though that you have all.your finances ready by the time you register, just in case your school requires you to pay at that time. \nRemember you can always fill out the FAFSA at www.fafsa.gov for 2019-2020 to see if you are eligible for grants (or loans.) \n\nIn all honesty, walk into your local community college and ask questions!", "author": "mayg09", "created": 1560604423, "upvotes": 1}, "er3x9hg": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/c0dwtn/advice_to_someone_perusing_college_with_no_idea/er3x9hg/", "text": "Miami university Oxford is about an hour from Dayton and offers a great zoology program. \n\nEven if the local community college doesn't offer zoology you can still save money by taking your core classes there like chemistry, English, math etc.", "author": "Delilah-is-done", "created": 1560475271, "upvotes": 1}}}
