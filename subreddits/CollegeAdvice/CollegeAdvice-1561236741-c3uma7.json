I would like to be a food and beverage director with the goal of being in consulting one day, preferably in luxury hospitality. I am currently the event coordinator for a small cafe in Portland and things don't seem to be going anywhere and I can't seem to grow in my industry. \n\nI would like to obtain a bachelors in Germany but I dont really know where to begin. I will need to take out a loan for living expenses and school fees if I want to start this year. I also have some personal debt that I am currently trying to work down.\n\nBasically any advice on this path that I am considering would be greatly appreciated!", "author": "klhendrie", "created": 1561236741, "retrieved": 1632848934, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"erwxs49": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/c3uma7/studying_hospitality_in_germany/erwxs49/", "text": "What is pulling you to a German program?
