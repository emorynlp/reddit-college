  "text": "It all started with an Instagram crush, I borderline fell in love to the point of obsession. But I've now slowly moved away from that but in the process I discovered the college she attends through said Instagram account. Know before this gets all stalkery here I would just like to say that independent of this situation I have been researching colleges to attend that offer a degree in character animation. And to my surprise after Google searching the college it offers that and its the closest school that offers said degree. I just need advice on weather i not I should go to this university, because I really like it. I just discovered it in a odd way.\n\nI'm hoping for some advice on weather or not the maner at which I discovered this college is healthy or not and if I should attend. I really like the school not to mention its cheaper and closer to other options.",
