Would you want to become a doctor? Or a nurse? Years of education for each would differ, as well as costs. I would recommend starting by researching careers online to get a better idea of your options. Check out the Bureau of Labor Statistics ([bls.gov](https://bls.gov)) and search some jobs, and do a basic google search too. Ask yourself what kind of life you would like to have too - what you would want in terms of free time, time to spend with family, what type of work you would want to be doing, etc. Good luck!", "author": "writingoreos", "created": 1557024006, "upvotes": 1}, "elzhyr7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bi34k8/i_recently_dropped_out_of_highschool_and_got_my/elzhyr7/", "text": "Check out local community colleges near you. They get a bad rap, but as long as they are accredited they\u2019re honestly a great starting point. Open admissions, low cost, and transferable credits. Today is actually my 1 year anniversary of graduating with my bachelors and I started out at my local community college. I work in higher ed now, and I would not consider myself the sharpest tool in the shed. College isn\u2019t a measure of intelligence- it\u2019s a measure of hard work. Finding the niche you fit in and thriving in your classes/line of work  is totally possible.", "author": "alifabulousi", "created": 1556464149, "upvotes": 1}}}
