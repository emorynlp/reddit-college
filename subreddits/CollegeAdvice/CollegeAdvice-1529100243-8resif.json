I was given 37,000 dollars in financial aid but my cost of attendance for the year is 67,000. So I'll need another 30,000 that I don't have to meet the cost. I'm applying to as many scholarships as I can but I don't know if it's going to be enough. Is there anything else I could do? I'm very overwhelmed and scared.
