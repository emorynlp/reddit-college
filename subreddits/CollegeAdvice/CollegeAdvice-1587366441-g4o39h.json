Ideally I would just do music but I feel like if my dreams for music fall through then it would be kind of a useless major. \n\nI sing brazilian songs so I'd possibly interested in language/foreign business or something else, I don't know. I'm in my 2nd year of college and pretty much finished my GEs and have done some of the coursework for both computer science and music. At most I could do 4 more years and possibly do some summer classes.
