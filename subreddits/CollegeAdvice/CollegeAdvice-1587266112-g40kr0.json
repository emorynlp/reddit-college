I\u2019m aware that many people change their majors in college, but I would like to have an idea because I\u2019ve found it helps me focus and set goals. Does anybody have advice for picking one? It doesn\u2019t have to be specific, it can be anything. What\u2019s the best way to see what each major offers? What are good ways to explore new topics?", "author": "SunglassCatHaha", "created": 1587266112, "retrieved": 1632960390, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fo1u2xv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g40kr0/advice_for_picking_a_major/fo1u2xv/", "text": "Hmmm . . . Hi, it really depends on a few things. One of the first things to come to mind is what year are you in? If you're a senior, my answer would be different than if you are a sophomore simply because of the amount of time you have to devote to preparing for your major. The other thing that comes to mind is whether or not there are particular subjects that excite you or a broad career area. Are you interested in helping fields like health or counseling? Or would you prefer to work in a more industrial or technical field like engineering? I'm sorry to ask more questions but I'd like to help if I can.", "author": "ouidapowe", "created": 1587441532, "upvotes": 2}}}
