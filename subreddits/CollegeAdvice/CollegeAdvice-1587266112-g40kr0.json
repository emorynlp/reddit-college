  "text": "I\u2019m currently in HS but i want to try and determine what major i want to go into. I\u2019m aware that many people change their majors in college, but I would like to have an idea because I\u2019ve found it helps me focus and set goals. Does anybody have advice for picking one? It doesn\u2019t have to be specific, it can be anything. What\u2019s the best way to see what each major offers? What are good ways to explore new topics?",

      "text": "Hmmm . . . Hi, it really depends on a few things. One of the first things to come to mind is what year are you in? If you're a senior, my answer would be different than if you are a sophomore simply because of the amount of time you have to devote to preparing for your major. The other thing that comes to mind is whether or not there are particular subjects that excite you or a broad career area. Are you interested in helping fields like health or counseling? Or would you prefer to work in a more industrial or technical field like engineering? I'm sorry to ask more questions but I'd like to help if I can.",

          "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore. I have some general subjects I enjoy, but nothing very specific or in depth. I tend to gravitate towards sciences like ecology, genetics, horticulture and general biology but I also enjoy subjects relating to business. I\u2019ve thought about studying genetic disorders and having a career in that area. I\u2019m very much all over the place.",

              "text": "You\u2019re in a really good spot! Your areas are related and you\u2019re asking early enough to explore and fine tune so you marry your interests into something you\u2019ll truly enjoy. Even business isn\u2019t random considering how many schools offer dual degree programs. Wharton at UPenn offers both and MBA/MES (Master if Business Admin/Master of Environmental Sci) and an MBA/MD (MBA/Doctor of Medicine). UVA has comparable programs. That\u2019s off the top of my head but they aren\u2019t hard to research if you go that route. \n\nI know the lockdown makes it a little more difficult to explore with your feet on the ground. So, you may want to spend a little time researching Biotechnology, Medical Research with an emphasis in either Horticultural Science or Biological Sciences. Now I\u2019m assuming that you want to be at the top of the income ladder and I shouldn\u2019t because your interests may be otherwise. So, let\u2019s say for example you may want to start a business selling plants in your own nursery. That career would use the areas you\u2019ve mentioned but would be uncertain as far as your initial earnings.\n\nWhen the lockdown eases up, you should consider shadowing/volunteering/interning in an area related to your interests. If it\u2019s plant nursery, apply for a job at a local nursery and learn all you can. If it\u2019s medical research, talk to a science teacher at your school and ask them for a local connection. \n\nI hope that makes sense and I hope it helps.",
