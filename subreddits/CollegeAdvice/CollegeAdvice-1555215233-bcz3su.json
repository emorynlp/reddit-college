I would really like to ride my bike, however my landlord doesn't allow bikes in the apartment.  Instead, I'm supposed to keep it on a rack, outside with no roof.  I'm worried about it rusting.  I could get a tarp, but they're usually pretty hard to lock the bike frame and tires, while keeping the tarp completely over the bike.  Should I get a fold-able bike and store it in my trunk?  Or maybe even get a kick scooter (they're super portable, the only downside is I might look ridiculous and I haven't used one since I was a kid)?", "author": "mostlyimagined", "created": 1555215233, "retrieved": 1632848985, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
