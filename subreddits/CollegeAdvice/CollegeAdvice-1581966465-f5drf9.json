I don't actually want to be in college, I didn't even go to high school, but I desperately need a fast path to a steady FT job with a living wage, and I don't know how else to obtain that. I already paid a bunch of money for trade schools in the '90s but it never led to anything sustainable, and I have not been able to get stable work in almost 10 years. This is my 3rd recent attempt at community college, and it looks like this semester I am finally in classes I will be capable of passing, so I guess I have to look forward to a next semester.\n\nSo far I haven't found much that college offers that I am interested in, so I haven't been able to pick a major, and I'm just taking a bunch of random classes. The counselors aren't really much help, the one lady is trying to push me into a CAD program next semester but I know nothing about it and it seems super random. \n\nShould I just let this ride and keep taking random classes hoping that something interesting eventually presents itself? I live in an expensive city, have almost no income at all, and my savings is running out, so I need to figure out something fast or I will be living in my car. I haven't had much exposure to college educated folks, and I don't really have a support system, so I don't know where to turn for advice. Untreated ADHD and other mental illness isn't helping. I have basically no confidence.\n\nAre there any other subs I should be checking out, relevant to my dilemma?\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, though honestly I only expect to be ridiculed since this is reddit.

I'm guessing the counselor thinks you would be good at the CAD program so maybe try that.. not everyone gets their dream job, but don't settle for a job you hate", "author": "DJC1289", "created": 1582165376, "upvotes": 1}}}
