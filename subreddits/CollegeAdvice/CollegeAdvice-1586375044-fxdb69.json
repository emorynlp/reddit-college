Im gonna start university during fall and I was checking out the curriculum and im going to have 6 months of physics classes during my first year. Im quite nervous because my knowledge in physics is pretty darn limited and I dont know how difficult its gonna be for me to pass that class.\n\nIll post the curriculum here... can someone tell me if the topics included would be viable for someone with almost no knowledge?

I think you should start with the first unit... it\u2019s fairly straightforward content and will give you an intro to \u201cthinking like a physicist\u201d. If you have a textbook, read it and take notes, then watch videos on the same topics (khan academy or honestly any old physics lecture on YouTube will do). Try to find videos with lots of visuals. Then, do some practice problems with your notes, then trying doing some more without notes. \n\nThen from there, I would say waves is pretty accessible, if you have a good understanding of trig functions.", "author": "lovely-capybara", "created": 1586377935, "upvotes": 2}}}
