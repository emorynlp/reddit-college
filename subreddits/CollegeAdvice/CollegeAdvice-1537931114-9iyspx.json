I'm too tired and sore for school already, but after the first couple of weeks I'll have to do the mandatory overtime. I didn't think that would be much of a problem, but it sounds like I might be working 10 hours a day, at least 5 days a week. How do I manage school when I work that much? I don't want to go back to a minimum wage job, but it seems like that's the only option aside from dropping out of school?", "author": "TheGrimKing24", "created": 1537931114, "retrieved": 1632961045, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
