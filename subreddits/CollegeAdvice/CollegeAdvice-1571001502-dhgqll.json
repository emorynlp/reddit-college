  "title:": "Applying to new college after four academic suspensions?",
  "text": "Sorry if this is long winded/not formatted properly etc... \n\nI've been in and out of school for the past six years. I have been placed on academic suspension four times due to low gpa(currently 1.8 I believe) or low completion rate. Many factors contributed to my failings; depression, laziness, an advisor assigned to me who wasn't in my field of study, hatred of the courses I was taking. \n\nI was an animation major, and am passionate about this, but the entire time in school I never got to take any courses in my area of study. Just general after general. I hated it and started doing poorly. There are a few course I've retaken three times, only to do worse each time. I simply can't get myself to care or put forth effort in these classes that I see no point in. I feel like I've wasted the last six years of my life.\n\nI want to go back to school, but not the same one, I'd like to get into one of the specialized Art colleges that are near me. However they are pretty difficult to get in, I'm not sure what I should do. Return to the same university to try and raise my GPA? (I've lost almost all confidence that I'd be able to)\n\nApply to a community college then transfer? I'm so lost. I wish I could start fresh and not have to struggle to dig my way out of this hole. I'm not sure what my best option is, or even what all my options are. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks",

      "text": "Would you change your habits if you went back to the same university to try and raise your grades? If the answer is no, then it sounds like it would be a waste of time and money. A community college might be something you want to look at, but you\u2019ll most likely be stuck in the same, if not similar, general education courses. I would look at both and decide which is the better route to better your portfolio whilst increasing your GPA.",

      "text": "How's your portfolio? That's going to land you more work than your degree usually. With all the freelance work available online, I'd argue you can do animation without a degree. I've hired several freelance artists for varying jobs, never once did I care if they went to college or not. \n\nIf you are deadset on college, find a local community college that has an Animation program. Do that then decide if you want to continue to a 4 year program.",
