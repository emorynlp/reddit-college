Ill be deploying next week and have been thinking very hard about what I want to do afterwards. Ill have 8 months left after deployment. A little info about myself, Though I always knew the military was never for me, I joined because of the schooming benefits I'd get afterwards and to get out of Hawaii. Im a very artistically inclined person, also very introverted. I love making music and its my passion. I spent my whole life being told that I need to have stability in my life and thats what matters. To be honest, looking for such a thing has made me unhappy. Ive had jobs before the military where its a 9-5 and am miserable. Also in The military being artistic isnt something they look for or even care about. \n\nIm ready to use my talents and skills in a creative manner as I feel its the only way Ill enjoy making a living. Ive been thinking of going to graphic design school or something in the creative field. Ill be using my gi bill to pay for my housing. I also dont spend much. \n\nTl;DR im leaving the military and want a job in the arts/creative field. I dont care about becoming filthy rich as I learned from the army, money doesnt buy you happinness just convenience. What kind of school should I go to?", "author": "richieinfj96", "created": 1582393448, "retrieved": 1632960652, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
