I am a HS jr.  and I go to a vocational school where I major in Environmental Science. When I graduate next year, I will have also earned my Associates Degree in Environmental Science as I\u2019ve been take duel degree classes since freshman year but Im not sure what it is I want to actually do. I know that one thing I loge to do is explain things to others and sharing my ideas.  I almost want to be a teacher ( which is what I\u2019ve said since I was little) but realistically I want to do something to make more money. Additionally I\u2019m always analyzing things (Psych and sociology were very interesting to me), Im interested in zodiac signs and am always asking myself why people do the things that they do or why they feel the way that they feel. I also want to do something relating to environmental science being I would already be halfway there to a degree ( and anything else would be a waste of my time and money being I\u2019ve invested so much into this degree). Any advice or ideas of majors I could look into ??", "author": "rslashhelpp", "created": 1581374907, "retrieved": 1632961143, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fh9i4u2": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f1yi0l/major_advice/fh9i4u2/", "text": "i think you should figure what job or at least the field you want to go into before you choose a major. btw if you want to be a teacher, if you teach AP/DC you can earn $75,000 ish which is definitely a lot better than what normal teacher get", "author": null, "created": 1581381867, "upvotes": 1}}}
