My major is in Biomedical Engineering with an electrical focus. I'm unsure if I should get a minor or if I should take extra engineering courses. My potential options are:\n\n1. Minor in Industrial System Engineering\n2. Minor in Business Administration/Economics\n3. Use this time to take extra engineering courses of interest\n\nAny thoughts would be well welcomed. :)\n\nedits: Grammar ", "author": "nhmopolis", "created": 1585237669, "retrieved": 1632961116, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
