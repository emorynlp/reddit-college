  "title:": "How do I tell my dad I want to go to a university rather than a community college?",
  "text": "My dad says community college is \u201cthe same\u201d and that millions of people do it so it\u2019s fine. He\u2019s never been through the education system in the USA because he\u2019s an immigrant. He thinks college is way too expensive and that we can\u2019t afford it. My mom says we can. And I also said I would be paying half of it and then pay them back eventually. Some lady at his work told him that that\u2019s what her daughter did so ever since he\u2019s been telling me that I should do the same. I love to learn and I\u2019m very passionate about it. I\u2019m also pretty knowledgeable and my grades have always been good. I want to have a career in the medical field. I\u2019ve always dreamed of going to a really good university but now I feel like my dreams are being crushed and it\u2019s just too much. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get into a good school and now he says no. What should I do? (I am not a senior yet).",

I want to go into programs that they don\u2019t offer at the community colleges near me. And I was thinking about doing a 4 year college while also going to community college for summer or winter classes to get my degree faster.",

              "text": "Ahhh I see. That's difficult - but really even with a scholarship (unless its a BIG one), it likely won't compare to the nearly (nonexistent) cost of a CC. \n\nI was originally set on a 4-year as well, but ended up in community college so I could transfer to a school I was more interested in - and I kid you not, with financial aid, I did not pay a DIME for community college (outside of books/housing/food!). \n\nWhat are the programs you're interested in? Often you can transfer to a school with the program you're looking to be in - and still be prepared with the prereqs and what not! I suppose unless its something specifically vocational like a nursing program or a physical therapy assistant, it would likely be okay?",

      "text": "Research, research, research. Take time to build a case why a 4 year university will be a better option for you. Look at your grades/scores and show a chart of what you are likely to receive in scholarships from the school you want to go to. Talk to him with solid evidence of why it will be better for you and reasons why you want to go there. Propose an agreement, if you don't perform up to a certain level after one year you will transfer to a community college. \n\nI could argue either way for most circumstances, so it's probably going to take some convincing and maybe help from your mom.",

Right now I should really focus on my grades but I will eventually get more advice from my school counselor and do more research and then I\u2019ll talk to him. Right now I\u2019m just not going to think about it. If I start thinking about it right now my grades will decrease due to anxiety and stress but I will eventually. Thank you for your advice, I will definitely use it and present a good case to my dad.",
