He\u2019s never been through the education system in the USA because he\u2019s an immigrant. He thinks college is way too expensive and that we can\u2019t afford it. My mom says we can. And I also said I would be paying half of it and then pay them back eventually. Some lady at his work told him that that\u2019s what her daughter did so ever since he\u2019s been telling me that I should do the same. I love to learn and I\u2019m very passionate about it. I\u2019m also pretty knowledgeable and my grades have always been good. I want to have a career in the medical field. I\u2019ve always dreamed of going to a really good university but now I feel like my dreams are being crushed and it\u2019s just too much. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get into a good school and now he says no. What should I do? (I am not a senior yet).", "author": "itsyagorl2019", "created": 1571276843, "retrieved": 1632848821, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f48jvkl": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dizfwi/how_do_i_tell_my_dad_i_want_to_go_to_a_university/f48jvkl/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1571440812, "upvotes": 2}, "f43q7hv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dizfwi/how_do_i_tell_my_dad_i_want_to_go_to_a_university/f43q7hv/", "text": "While I understand your drive to want to go to a 4 year right away, his argument about cost is BIG.

Take time to build a case why a 4 year university will be a better option for you. Look at your grades/scores and show a chart of what you are likely to receive in scholarships from the school you want to go to. Talk to him with solid evidence of why it will be better for you and reasons why you want to go there. Propose an agreement, if you don't perform up to a certain level after one year you will transfer to a community college. \n\nI could argue either way for most circumstances, so it's probably going to take some convincing and maybe help from your mom.", "author": "drock13", "created": 1571310186, "upvotes": 1}}}
