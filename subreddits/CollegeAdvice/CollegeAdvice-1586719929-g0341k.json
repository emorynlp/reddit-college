Back when I was deciding where I wanted to go, I used a handwritten matrix similar to this one to figure out which school was best for me. I felt like putting everything down made the choice clear for me, so I replicated the matrix onto a google doc to share.\n\nHere's the link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU-tO3rHhwEM-XLx1vOl5KP8Lt2Jvgkrwbh54rVCE-U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU-tO3rHhwEM-XLx1vOl5KP8Lt2Jvgkrwbh54rVCE-U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nMake sure you make a copy to edit on your personal drive\n\nQuick instructions:\n\nPut all of the factors you feel are significant in your decision on the left (I left space for 13)\n\nUnder importance multiplier, determine how important that factor is on a 1-10 scale\n\nInsert each school into the top row (Currently 5 spaces, School 1, School 2, etc)\n\nUnder School rating, give each school a rating on a 1-5 scale based on whichever factor lines up with that row\n\nDo this for all of your factors\n\nYou can see the totals for each school at the bottom, and the winning school along with its score on the bottom left.\n\nNOTE: There currently isn't a filter for ties, so you might wanna double check for that\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "ajay1225", "created": 1586719929, "retrieved": 1632848315, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
