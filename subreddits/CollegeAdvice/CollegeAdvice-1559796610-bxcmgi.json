I will be doing the honors business program  and I\u2019m signed up for the business classes and math for my fall semester. I am just not sure business is right for me. I\u2019m considering biology, more specifically pathology but I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I consider a double major, take some science classes either fall or spring semester? Right now I\u2019m leaning to sticking with my fall semester schedule and adding a biology class my spring semester. However, with my current schedule I can add a class fall semester. Sorry if this is a lot or doesn\u2019t come out right.\nThanks everyone!", "author": "nk10101", "created": 1559796610, "retrieved": 1632848942, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eq637cs": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bxcmgi/need_help_with_deciding_a_major/eq637cs/", "text": "If you're planning on graduate school right now, as we speak, for something in biology and you're willing to aim extremely high in that field (do undergraduate research, summer research, basically breathe biology) then do biology. If you're just interested and think you can cut two majors, then double major. Maybe that bio major will be sorta useful, but at that point you're doing biology just for you and your enjoyment.\n\nDon't get me wrong, dedicating onself to science is wonderful for some people, but not everyone has what it takes to make it in that field, especially with a masters being basically required before landing a job in that field and the necessity to out perform consistently (does not mean you must get all A's). It'd be hard but totally worth it if you're really fascinated and push yourself to learn all you can about that subject! \n\nA business bachelors degree is far more marketable, but you have the struggles of focusing on job related skills and internships in order to get future employment. You might be able to attend more parties and more easily maintain a high GPA in business disciplines while building career prospects. College is all about time management and it's much easier to do when you're in non-STEM majors. Think about the kind of life you want in the future and that may help you decide. \n\nAlso, something to keep in mind: I personally went from STEM to international economics, and while I do somewhat regret not staying in STEM, it would've been far harder to go from international economics to STEM than vice versa. \n\nI hope I helped a little bit!", "author": "kokomarro", "created": 1559820926, "upvotes": 2}}}
