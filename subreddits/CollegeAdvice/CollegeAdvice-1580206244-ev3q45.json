Anything worth noting?", "text": "As of this post I\u2019m starting my second semester as a freshman in CSULA, with a current degree towards what we call \u201cTelevision, Film, and Media Studies\u201d, basically all the theoretical things about media and all that. And while my first semester was a lot of fun, I started thinking that this might not be where I want to go with my life, primarily because it\u2019s highly competitive and probably not as practical to live a \u201cregular\u201d life (ie. stable job, good income, etc.) I\u2019m currently looking into the Science department since that piked my interest, and I\u2019m a bit interested in something towards Forensics, so I\u2019m searching for degrees and majors that relate to that department. I have yet to talk to any counselors about this, but I\u2019d be interested to hear anything that I should consider first.
