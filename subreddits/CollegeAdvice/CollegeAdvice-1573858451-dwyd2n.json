I'll be working while I do this so I'll be fine money wise but I just don't know for sure what would be best as I'm a first time college student. Let me know if you can recommend any ideas on this or at the least what to ask about getting a laptop from then. I have a friend (at this time my best friend) who is majoring/minoring in the same Fields as me who has a laptop but he got it through financial aide which I might not be getting bc I have a job so yeah. Thank you and sorry if this is confusing + any typos I'm at work right now and also very confused myself lol.", "author": "babyreythehordedk", "created": 1573858451, "retrieved": 1632848769, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f7me7rq": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dwyd2n/im_starting_college_soon_and_need_some_help/f7me7rq/", "text": "If money is an issue a basic laptop will work fine. I am a computer science major as well and I have friends who have ancient laptops who can complete the assignments just fine. The programs you type may just take longer to load, but until further down the line, most of the assignment aren\u2019t super intense to run. If you do have the money, I\u2019d say a good laptop is a good investment, as you will definitely get your money\u2019s worth. Even buy something fairly cheap or even used can last you through college. Hope this helps man! Don\u2019t stress, even will be fine", "author": "Pimpsonian", "created": 1573860923, "upvotes": 2}}}
