She's cool, sort of quirky in a mature way (As in if I try to talk to her about something happening in the Disney Parks, something I'm excited about, she'll blatantly show disinterest. On the other hand, she'll go on and on about the new Star Wars movie and make me watch the ones I haven't seen because \"they're good\". I pretend to be excited but in reality, I just want to watch YouTube in peace.) Recently, I came home from lunch to her huddled at her computer with the quilt I had hanging on my bed that my grandmother made me. When I stated, \"that's my quilt\" she responded that she was cold. When I asked her why she didn't just put on her jacket, or maybe use the blanket from her bed, she said: \"well you weren't here and the quilt was just there\". I don't know if being with her has just made me highly irritable, or the fact the I repeated twice \"that's my grandmother's quilt\" in a way to show I was uncomfortable with her using it, and she still ignored me just left me thinking to myself I was about to explode. I don't mind people using my things, I just make it very clear that you have to ask me first. Am I just being a baby? I mean, yeah the room is cold, but it's not like she couldn't turn up the temperature, or drape something over her shoulder that wasn't mine. It has been bothering for the past hour, I'm not sure if I can last the rest of the year.", "author": "sillyserpentine", "created": 1568224493, "retrieved": 1632848858, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"ezzvlnp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/d2u50q/am_i_being_sensitive/ezzvlnp/", "text": "You should put this on r/AITA\n\nBut yeah she sounds like a dick who was the spoilt brat of the family and got everything. Next time you see her do something like that pull her up on it directly but respectfully. I'm sensing you don't like conflict (much like myself), which is fine but it can lead to people walking over you.\n\nWhether she is doing things like that because she doesn't respect you or just is selfish, either way she is relying on you not not bite and avoid conflict. \n\nIt can be great to avoid conflict but in this case you need to pull her up on her actions as in the 'real world' you are going to have to deal with mutiple people like that. (Although she needs to learn that you can't just be a dick to people and think you can get away with it).\n\nIn that situation with Grandmas quilt you should start by pointing out its your grandmas (which you did) where she should take the hint. If it doesn't work you gotta be direct \"Can you give that back now please.\" Should work 90% time. Finally if all else fails just pull her aside and say \"Look about the quilt thing, it may mean nothing to you but it's a big deal to me. I don't want us to not get along but i don't want you using my stuff without asking for it, alright?\" \n\nShe may shrug it off but she will learn that you arr going to pull her up on stuff and next time she's cold she will put on her coat to save herself a confrontation.\n\nP.S shitting on people's interest just because you don't like them is immature and you should just say \"well I like it, so that's all that matters.\"\n\nFinally there are some good Youtube videos out there that teach Charisma/dealing with people in the right way that helped me be more assertive.\n\nDon't worry about it, that's life sometimes. Enjoy College!\n\nEdit: Ok I missed the part where you have been friends for 8 years! So maybe you don't need to be too direct and set boundaries that harshly as I've said. But talking about these things go a long way", "author": "Blue_Boy97", "created": 1568293570, "upvotes": 1}, "ezwysxk": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/d2u50q/am_i_being_sensitive/ezwysxk/", "text": "You need to talk to her. You guys have been friends for so long, she should know and be more understanding but at the same time she might be too comfortable thinking you and her are so close she can just use and do whatever she pleases. Communication goes a long way and I had to find it out the hard way, ugh. Your first year will be hell if you don\u2019t confront her about your discomfort. You will begin to ignore her and she will to you and the situation will only get awkward from there. Good luck and be courageous.
