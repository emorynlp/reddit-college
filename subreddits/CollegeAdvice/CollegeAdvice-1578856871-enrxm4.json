I am completing my internship and so far I do not like it. I really do not think I am meant to be a teacher anymore. I already got into grad school for next Fall to study higher education leadership, because I really would like to work in the university/college atmosphere. I have been considering withdrawing from my internship and changing my major to English. Yes, it would push back my graduation but at this point, I'm getting too old to care about graduating on \"time.\" I don't know if I should take the risk and do that or if I should try to make it through my pass/fail internship. It's just that I feel miserable going to it every day. I don't know if 15 weeks of overwhelming and miserable work is worth a piece of paper.\n\nAny advice would be helpful! :)", "author": "sunshinealways37", "created": 1578856871, "retrieved": 1632960813, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fe4bkr4": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/enrxm4/should_i_take_the_risk/fe4bkr4/", "text": "Just graduate, then continue on to graduate school. Why spend more time and money just because your not enjoying your internship. Use it to learn how to give your best effort despite it not being the career you want. It help you develop some resilience, work ethic and appreciation for your future jobs. 15 weeks may seem like a long time but it\u2019s not relatively speaking.", "author": "drock13", "created": 1578857621, "upvotes": 1}}}
