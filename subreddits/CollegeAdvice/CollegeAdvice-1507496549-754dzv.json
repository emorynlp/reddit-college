When I started school I worked part time, maybe 20 hours/week at most, and mainly focused on my classes. In 2009 both of my parents lost their jobs and my focus began to shift. I started working a second job full time on top of my part time job and my focus began to slip, as did my grades. I'm a stubborn person and believed I could handle the work load, but I couldn't, and my grades began to slip. Finally, they got pretty bad so I swallowed my pride and made the decision to leave until I was in a position to return and focus primarily on school. I'm finally in that position and I'm looking at my options to return.\n\nWhat I need advice on from the wise people of Reddit, is in regard to online colleges. Any suggestions? I'm looking to take about a half-time course load per semester. Anything that I need to specifically keep an eye out for as I'm researching programs and schools? Any of you have experience completing an online Bachelors Degree? Any experience relating to the value of degrees from certain online institutions?\n\nMore info: I began my college career studying Architecture. Returning to complete this degree does not seem realistic as it requires more time than I can afford to give. I understand I'll be losing a lot of credit hours, but this seems the best route for me (unless somebody knows of an online program that I don't). I'm looking at a degree in business, supply chain mgmt, marketing, entrepreneurship, or similar related fields.\n\nThank you all in advance!", "author": "TxAg8810", "created": 1507496549, "retrieved": 1632961054, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
