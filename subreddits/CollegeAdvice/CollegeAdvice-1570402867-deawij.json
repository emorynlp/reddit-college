  "text": "Im currently a first year student enrolled at a community college pursuing a economics degree at the university of florida. After getting my econ degree i plan to save up and earn enough capital to fund my passion for a education in archeology. At that time i expect to be in mid 20s. Now i\u2019ve done some research and noticed all the best archaeology programs are abroad in european countries. Specifically the united kingdom. How would i go about into getting the right qualifications/ meeting requirements for the universities over there as being a abroad candidate so i could be on the right path. I was an average high school student, passed my ap exam in computer science and that was about it, decent grades nothing too bad but also nothing exceptional. I would like to be on that right path towards pursuing my passion for archaeology. Im very motivated to make such a goal a reality. Open to any comments.",
