  "text": "Hey guys! I more or less have a decision already, but I wanted to hear from you guys what y\u2019all thought about either schools. I know Fresno State is much, much cheaper then CSUMB. I\u2019m talking more or less about student experiences for both. What are you\u2019re guys\u2019 opinions on both schools? Don\u2019t hold back, I wanna hear the good AND the bad, no matter how bad it is. Especially CSUMB, I\u2019ve only ever heard good things (which one could argue is good, but I wanna set my expectations)",
