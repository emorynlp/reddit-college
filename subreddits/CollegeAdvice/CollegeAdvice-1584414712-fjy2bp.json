I more or less have a decision already, but I wanted to hear from you guys what y\u2019all thought about either schools. I know Fresno State is much, much cheaper then CSUMB.

Don\u2019t hold back, I wanna hear the good AND the bad, no matter how bad it is. Especially CSUMB, I\u2019ve only ever heard good things (which one could argue is good, but I wanna set my expectations)", "author": "SeparateKey0", "created": 1584414712, "retrieved": 1632848327, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"fl3o386": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fjy2bp/csumb_vs_fresno_state/fl3o386/", "text": "My girlfriend actually just transferred from csumb to Fresno State this semester.
