  "text": "Hi,\n\nI graduated high school in 2018. I know I want to sing opera and possibly teach at a university level one day. I decided to attend a state school music program that basically took anyone with an interest. After spending a year there I ended up being accepted to one of the top music conservatories in the country. It literally felt like heaven to be considered good enough to be taught by world renowned teachers. The only hitch was they considered me a freshman and they did not take any of my credits from my last college. I decided to attend even though I wasted a years worth of tuition money.  About a month into the next school year, I was over the moon because I was learning so much, but I had zero friends because the freshman saw me as weird and the sophomores didn't think of me as their equal. Eventually I contracted a kidney infection and I ended up having to pass 2 kidney stones. Because of the medical bills and the the amount of pain I had to withdraw from school. \n\nPresent day\nI am healthy as ever. The conservatory is making me pay 10,000 dollars for the semester I did not finish. I wanted to know if it's possible to get into a great grad school if I was to go to my local college and get an Interdisciplinary Arts degree in music and theatre. I wouldn't have as many opportunities because they don't have an opera production, musical, or chorus, but I wouldn't pay as much and I would be close to home in case of another medical issue. \n\nShould I just suck it up and take out huge loans \nOr try to get into a great grade school with a \"worse degree\"\n\nAnyone's advice is greatly appreciated\n\nThank you",
