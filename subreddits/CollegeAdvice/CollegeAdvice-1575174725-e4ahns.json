  "text": "I've always had a talent for art, it's always been my thing, yadda yadda, I've always known that's what I wanted to do. Now that I'm actually pursuing that dream, it's seeming less like a dream and more like a nightmare. This makes me sound like an asshole but, I can't stand other people in the art community. They all seem to have this closed minded idea about what art is supposed to be, and (at my college at least) they all share the same social and political views. Even though I'm surrounded by fellow artists, I feel constantly alone. I don't want to work with people I hate all the time, and I want to be able to do my own thing. \nThe best thing I could think of is doing art on the side/running my own small business online, but I can't think of any other way to make income but still enjoy myself. I just want to make something useful out of my life, and sometimes art feels like a selfish thing to do for a living. For me at least. I'm stuck.\n\nTldr, art has always been my thing, but I'm afraid it's too late to start exploring other options that would make me happy while also allowing me to live comfortably.",

      "text": "Once people start doing what they love for a living they often start to hate it because it becomes stressful instead of spontaneous. The best advice I can give is to decide on a stable career you can stand and that will bring in enough money that you can do art in your free time.",
