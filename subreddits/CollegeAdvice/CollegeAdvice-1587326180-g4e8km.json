Someone suggested you contact the schools because they have different requirements. That's really good advice. I would simply add that loading up on knowledge is actually easier than loading up on connections and real world experience. The student who takes an extra writing course is probably not going to stand out more than a student who wrote a book (unless the book was just pure garbage). \n\nI know it's a bit harder now that so many people are on lockdown but its not impossible.  If you are interested in business and aren't in a position to work/intern/shadow in your field of interest, start something. If business is your thing, start one and chronicle how you used the principles of business, economics, and/or accounting. Create a portfolio that is relevant and that makes you stand out as an entrepreneur/researcher. Everyone who applies to college (particularly Ivy League schools) is full of knowledge, so that alone isn't going to make you stand out. You'll just be another big smart fish in a big pond of big small fish. \n\nI'm not sure how the Modern History class is relevant to what you want to study but the last thing I'll offer is that you shoot for depth and not breadth UNLESS the two areas are tied together. During your school years, you are building a platform. Everything you do should be a building block toward that final platform. When you graduate, imagine that you've climbed your \"building\" and you emerge on the platform you created to a crowd of people who want to hear what you have to say. Does the ladder re: Modern History lead to that platform or is it tangential?  If it's tangential, you're taking time away from contributing to your platform. \n\nI'm new to Reddit so please forgive me if my post was too long.
