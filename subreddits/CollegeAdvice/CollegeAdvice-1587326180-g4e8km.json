Currently I'm doing research on MOOCs experiences so if you have ever taken a massive open online course, please spend 10 minutes and help me defend my thesis \ud83d\udde1\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1 Here's the link: [https://www.survio.com/survey/d/T6Y0O1D0A2Q4I5I8N](https://www.survio.com/survey/d/T6Y0O1D0A2Q4I5I8N?fbclid=IwAR2NaATL9jUWZy9EiazJcqiWqY6KpoLk1FRmxVWW9VVfk2UfdrehNHQh5EI)   \nI'd be forever grateful if you could help.

      "text": "Hi, knowing how to do something and actually doing it are two very different things. Someone suggested you contact the schools because they have different requirements. That's really good advice. I would simply add that loading up on knowledge is actually easier than loading up on connections and real world experience. The student who takes an extra writing course is probably not going to stand out more than a student who wrote a book (unless the book was just pure garbage). \n\nI know it's a bit harder now that so many people are on lockdown but its not impossible.  If you are interested in business and aren't in a position to work/intern/shadow in your field of interest, start something. If business is your thing, start one and chronicle how you used the principles of business, economics, and/or accounting. Create a portfolio that is relevant and that makes you stand out as an entrepreneur/researcher. Everyone who applies to college (particularly Ivy League schools) is full of knowledge, so that alone isn't going to make you stand out. You'll just be another big smart fish in a big pond of big small fish. \n\nI'm not sure how the Modern History class is relevant to what you want to study but the last thing I'll offer is that you shoot for depth and not breadth UNLESS the two areas are tied together. During your school years, you are building a platform. Everything you do should be a building block toward that final platform. When you graduate, imagine that you've climbed your \"building\" and you emerge on the platform you created to a crowd of people who want to hear what you have to say. Does the ladder re: Modern History lead to that platform or is it tangential?  If it's tangential, you're taking time away from contributing to your platform. \n\nI'm new to Reddit so please forgive me if my post was too long. I hope it was helpful and I hope everything works out for you.",

          "text": "I was handed the position to the financial investment club in my school, which is pretty impressive considering there were only juniors or seniors, and he chose a freshman lol. But I was thinking we make a little hedge fund with all the money we can pool in, considering I go to a low-income school, and build up that fund over-time. That was the most significant thing I could think of, so far. \n\nI also had an idea for a startup during this break, and I am planning to put my thoughts on a piece of paper, lay out the blueprints, and start emailing as soon as possible. I hope to develop more of these throughout the next 3.5 years.\n\nI just love learning tbh. Especially history. I'm a Jew and a Zionist, and it is very dear to my heart. And I want to learn about my country's recent history. And later, other countries' history. \n\nI am going to start learning coding Python and algorithms for my own day trading (which I do), and I hope I can execute everything by the end of this break. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaha np, you helped a ton, thank you very much.",

If you have time with all you\u2019ve mentioned, take a course or two (esp the MH course because it\u2019s near to your heart) because you may creat a niche that incorporates areas that you haven\u2019t considered yet. \n\nI would encourage you to solicit a mentor in your field of study as you fine tune your skill set and interests. Either a practitioner or a researcher will do. You just want someone with connections and a desire to invest in you as a young professional. \n\nI sincerely hope you see all you\u2019ve imagined come to full fruition with a serious BANG!
