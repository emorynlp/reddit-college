  "text": "I want to, ultimately major in social work, I was planning on completing liberal arts/general education courses in community college because my grades in high school weren\u2019t promising. Would I be able to transfer to a four year to pursue a degree in social work at a four year college if I complete the liberal arts program at a community college? Or do I need to pursue the social work degree starting at the two year? Thanks!",

      "text": "I would look at specifically which university program you would like to eventually be in and work with them to make sure that you are taking the pre-reqs at a community college correctly. A lot of times 4 year universities do not take into account that fact that you have an associates just as long as you have the correct pre-reqs to shorten your time at a 4 year. What I see that typically happens is students take an associates that won't apply towards the degree they actually want. Also, transferring isn't always a clean two years here, two years there process. As long as you take the correct courses especially your general education credits (which are typically cheaper at a cc) you should be set up to complete your social work degree sooner. ",

      "text": "Typically you would go to community college to complete prerequisites for whatever 4 year degree you want to pursue. However I\u2019m sure this varies by type of institution (public vs private) as well as the state you\u2019re in so I would do more research on the specific colleges you want to apply to. ",
