Very much looking for suggestions and experience.\n\nI work full time, but on a swing schedule: 2 on, 2 off, 3 on ,2 off, 2 on, 3 off.  (2 weeks days/2 weeks nights)\n\nThe amount of time weekly I could put into a class is limited but i have more than a job with typical day hours.\n\nIdeally a Bachelors in software development is what I'm looking for. Accreditations, time investment weekly, rough cost estimate per year. Anything is appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is also my first reddit post ever.", "author": "MurkaClause", "created": 1569522559, "retrieved": 1632848844, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
