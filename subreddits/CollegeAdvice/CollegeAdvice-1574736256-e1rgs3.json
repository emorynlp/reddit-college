My professor is complete trash and even though it's basically the end of the term, I have him next semester as well. I kind of want to report him but have no idea where to start reporting a professor who's just total garbage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackstory; I am a first year student studying at a school ranked #1 in the nation for my major, and has been for 10+ years. The class I am talking about is Chem 1000, my class is about 25 students and there are multiple sections taught mostly by my professor, but 2 others are with a different professor.\n\nI\u2019ve really been having a hard time with chemistry this year, and I equate it all to the professor. I\u2019ve taken chemistry, biology, and environmental science before. I passed all of them with flying colors and never ever struggled with them. Granted, they were on a high school level but all of them were upper level classes and were certainly not easy. I am not a bad student. I\u2019ve never missed an assignment or failed a class. Not even in middle school.\n\nThis year, my chemistry professor just sucks. There\u2019s really no other way to put it. Let me paint a picture for everyone\n\nHe\u2019s super old and frail, walks with a cane, and just sits down every class. I have no problem with people with disabilities whatsoever- but, he just comes in, sits, and never stands back up. He hardly ever writes on the board, doesn\u2019t hand out notes or anything like that, never shows us any videos or powerpoints or anything. Just sits, talks, and quite often goes off topic. He\u2019s also usually wearing a NRA hat, or one of his many Air Force, Army, or Sig Sauer hats. He was never in the military but his hats also proudly display his political views. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is directly related, but he spent 30 minutes talking about his EDC one time. He carries, among other things, a pocket constitution, a flashlight, tape measure, keys for literally ever lock he owns (like he\u2019s a janitor or something), and a safety whistle. Yes, I did say pocket constitution. \n\nThe first 5-10 minutes of class he really cannot even talk because he is so out of breath from walking in that he can\u2019t address the class. We just come in sit down and fool around for the first 10 minutes every day. Then usually he blows another 10-15 minutes talking about random, completely unrelated topics to the students in the front row. This week he talked for 15 minutes about a car accident he witnessed on his way in.\n\nHis teaching in class basically consists of telling us what chapters to read in HIS textbook (a whole other topic), talking about maybe 1 tiny portion of the chapter, and then going off on some high level tangent. Hardly ever does he actually refer to a specific page, specific topic, or anything about what will be on the test. He refuses to tell us what is going to be on the test, rather just stating Chapters 1, 2, and 3. He constantly brings in higher level knowledge and experience which can and do confuse the class.\n\nAs I said before, he\u2019s also the author of all 3 textbooks we need for class. One is our lab notebook which is $25. This notebook is aimed 100% towards our school, he does not publish it anywhere else. There is really no reason we couldn\u2019t use our own notebooks for this. He does not grade them. Other chemistry class sections are not required to purchase any kind of lab notebook.\n\nWe are also required to buy 1 lab textbook, also $25. In this textbook, it basically shows all of the equipment we use in the lab. It is completely useless though because most of it we never use and there are also 3 lab assistants for our lab of 25 plus him, so they show us how to do everything.\n\nLastly, is the big class textbook. This costs $40 and is written by himself along with his wife. The textbook has the definitions inside of each chapter, so there is no glossary. No way to look up what a certain word means without digging through the chapters to find it. It is also FULL of grammatical and format errors. In quite a few areas the pictures cover the text behind them making it impossible to read. The way he wrote it is incredibly wordy and has a lot of fat. If you just cut to the chase it would be half the size that it is (about 150 pages). If you do the math he easily has $15,000 coming his way after all students buy his books. He loves to talk and this book is written more like he\u2019s talking to you in person rather than writing it in a textbook. It\u2019s full of some of his most famous phrases, such as \n\n\u201cOn a more practical basis\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your professional career\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a professional in the field\u201d\n\nHave any of you ever reported a professor for just downright being a complete failure? This guy absolutely sucks. He has a 1.0 on rate my professor, and everyone in my class hates him. He is notorious at my school for being a terrible teacher, but at the same time he teaches 90% of the sections of the Chem and Physics. Recently we had course evaluations (surveys), where I completely reamed him out, but I am worried this won\u2019t be taken seriously. I kind of want to go to the head of the department but I have no idea who that even is or how I would approach them. Has anyone else reported a professor who is just absolute trash?", "author": "JuniorOption3", "created": 1574736256, "retrieved": 1632848753, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f8t2frd": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/e1rgs3/advice_on_how_to_report_professor_who_just/f8t2frd/", "text": "My French teacher was like that and then the sophomores got her fired", "author": "melkjooce", "created": 1574794338, "upvotes": 1}, "f8rc5h9": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/e1rgs3/advice_on_how_to_report_professor_who_just/f8rc5h9/", "text": "Course evaluation is the correct place to do this.
