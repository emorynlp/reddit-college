My teacher only takes test grades into account.  I've usually gotten all the multiple choice right, but end up not doing well on the technical math portion.\n\nI've been studying so much for this class, and want your opinions on whether it's impossible to get a B, and should just aim for a c.

The second exam average is in the 40s and most quiz averages are D's or lower.\n\nJust try to survive, then decide whether retaking the class next quarter is worth the tuition.
