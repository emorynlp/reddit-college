  "text": "Hi guys, I need some advice on the future of my education as a Computer Science Major. Some background on me is I have suffered from GAD since the age of 4, and I have missed a lot of opportunities in my life because of it. I currently live in a county where there is no option for a Computer Science or anything in that category unless you take it all online, which I need that face to face interaction. I recently got my Associates in Arts in which I commuted to my local Community College and took our State's university classes. Tuition was waved with this program, so college was nearly free for me. I struggled with the first year of college as I was working and taking too many courses at the same time, so my GPA is not as high as I would like. \n\nI wanted to be able to go to my State's University, but because of my anxiety, I chose to go to an open enrollment commuter college in my State. However, this college's Computer Science program is not even close to being as strong as my State's college. I know if I finish the degree here at my commuter college, I would have to go straight to my Master's Degree to get the skills needed to be a Software Engineer as they do not offer any of these classes. I have debated transferring back to my State's university as I would get the skills needed to be a Software Engineer; however, this school is much harder and would take longer to get my degree. \n\nBoth of these cases, I would have to live at the other county two hours away in the next year or so and live with my boyfriend who lives there. My parents prefer me to finish my last 2 (or so) years at the commuter college. However, they don't want me to get my Masters right away. They don't understand that you need to specialize in Computer Science an,d there aren't just jobs that say \"Computer Science.\" So I have a choice between an easy college or a harder one, which I would need to work very hard on and take longer. Our family is well off, so money is not important in this situation.",
