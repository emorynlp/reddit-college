I ended up getting admitted to a bunch of great schools but I\u2019ve narrowed it down to USC and UMich. I still don\u2019t know for sure what I want to study. I\u2019m interested in politics/philosophy/pre-law as well as architecture so I applied to UMich as undeclared and to USC for the philosophy, politics&law major. I\u2019ve made a pros/cons list for the two schools but I\u2019m honestly still very undecided so if anyone has any insight into which would be the better choice please let me know!\n\nUSC\npros: private (more resources), not as huge, location, weather, top design/architecture program, good law\ncons: slightly more expensive, very far from home (I live in the midwest)\n\nUMich\npros: slightly better reputation (I think), very flexible with majors, close to home, top law program\ncons: very similar to the college town I grew up in, huge", "author": "xenlow_", "created": 1585661067, "retrieved": 1632961104, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmcfx0z": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fscuie/usc_vs_umich/fmcfx0z/", "text": "Usc all the way", "author": null, "created": 1585944899, "upvotes": 1}}}
