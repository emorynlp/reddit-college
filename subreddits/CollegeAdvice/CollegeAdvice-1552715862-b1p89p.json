I found a residence close to uni that I can afford, but my parents pointed out that I should be saving money at this age. \n\nI live about 45km from both uni and work with my parents, the drive time in the mornings can be past an hour depending on traffic. I usually take the train, which usually adds up to 1 hour 30 min.\n\nOn the other hand, I make 35k annually and the place I found costs 430 a week (AUD), inclusive of all utilities, wifi, and meals (breakfast and dinner). This is enough to live comfortably but is it worth it I should I stay home and save?", "author": "not-a-real-banana", "created": 1552715862, "retrieved": 1632849112, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
