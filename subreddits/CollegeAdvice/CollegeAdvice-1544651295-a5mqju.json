I like FGCU quite a lot more (more rural, environmentally focused) but I really would like to get a fellowship or assistantship out of state for my master's degree (I'm an English major with the goal of becoming a professor), and I know that Florida State is an older school with a lot more prestige compared to the 20-year-old FGCU. If this gives some context, so far I've maintained by 4.0 GPA and plan to be involved in my major's community regardless of what school I attend.  \n\n\nAre my chances of getting a fellowship in an out of state English program still strong even if I go to Florida Gulf Coast? Or should I stick with a more prestigious school like Florida State?  \n\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!", "author": null, "created": 1544651295, "retrieved": 1632849379, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
