I\u2019ve been accepted into four colleges this winter. They are the local state school, the flagship state school about two hours away, a big school two states away, and a private school way north. The local school is kind of out but the other in-state option is well in play. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of them forever, got a great scholarship, and would be close enough to home but not in my parents\u2019 backyard. The other two are about equal in my book. Way more expensive but with great facilities for my major and my interests.\n\nI don\u2019t so much need the help deciding which school to go to, but I would like to know what goes into everyone\u2019s minds when you decide where to go? How did you really know?", "author": "will98765432", "created": 1585173733, "retrieved": 1632848325, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
