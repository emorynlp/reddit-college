My school requires 65 credits, and I should have had that but I only have 22. My biggest problem is attendance as I only struggled in one class grade wise. I keep dropping classes and basically taking my dad's offer for granted and I feel bad about it. He has been paying out of pocket for it. It is a community college and while it's cheaper I'm not using that as an excuse.

You just have to take one step at a time.Take classes that you might enjoy,find people to talk to so u can get help if needed and study when possible.
