  "text": "I'm 4 semesters in and I'm not really struggling I'm just not motivated. My school requires 65 credits, and I should have had that but I only have 22. My biggest problem is attendance as I only struggled in one class grade wise. I keep dropping classes and basically taking my dad's offer for granted and I feel bad about it. He has been paying out of pocket for it. It is a community college and while it's cheaper I'm not using that as an excuse. I don't know what I should be doing.",

I\u2019d say go out and work for a while, and ask your dad to just save the money. Working will give you time to mature and a better sense of resppnsibility \u2014 and what life could be like if you don\u2019t get an education. Basically, a reality check.",

The majority of the time when I miss it is because I would late and i have a reall hard time showing up to something if I'm going to be late for whatever reason. I always intended to show up, I just don't. I also struggle to maintain anything resembling a decent sleeping schedule which gives me barely anytime to get ready for classes. The amount of classes usually doesn't bother as last semester I took 5 and finished all of them.",

You just have to take one step at a time.Take classes that you might enjoy,find people to talk to so u can get help if needed and study when possible. Missing class might make it a little harder to understand what\u2019s going on unless you read the chapters thoroughly so it might be best to attend.",

I'm interested in psychology but I really enjoy computers so I am looking at computer engineering. My biggest is the after the first time I miss I really don't want to go back. I know attending is important doing it is the hard part though. My and a good friend started the same semester and he just graduated the biggest difference other than him attending, is that the school scheduled for him and I've been doing it myself. I do still think that is the right thing for me. I think I've just got to start with actually going",

They basically plan every class you should be taking for what you want to do.When you miss a class you shouldn\u2019t think of it as well I missed one so let\u2019s just miss another...and the next and so on.You should see it as ok I missed one but let\u2019s just try to go to the next one.I know it sounds easier than it sounds but you just gotta try.Participating and talking with other might allow you to be interested in the classes more.",
