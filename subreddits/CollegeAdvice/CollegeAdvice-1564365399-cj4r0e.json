  "text": "I\u2019m working out financial stuff for this upcoming semester on a new site my college implemented. As I\u2019m working, I realize that the cost of attendance they\u2019ve set is much higher than last year. I cross reference with my girlfriend and my fees total up to ~$4000 more than hers. I looked it up but I can\u2019t find anything on Google. I plan to call the financial aid office as soon as I can, but any advice in the meantime?",

          "text": "My college was just really slow with implementing their aid and applying fees. The higher total had my housing fee tacked on. They still haven\u2019t given my scholarships to me yet but that\u2019s because they need my tax forms (which they didn\u2019t tell me about until recently)",
