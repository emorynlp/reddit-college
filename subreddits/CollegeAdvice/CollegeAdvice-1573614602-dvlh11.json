I love it here (at least I think I do... it's only been one semester) and I have made good friends. However I was kind of an idiot when picking schools and never gave the cost much thought.\n\nI was lucky enough to receive an excellent scholarship but at the end of the day the cost of attending this school is nearly 40k still... I have great opportunities here: I am in the honors program and the engineering school is well respected. But at the end of the day I don't think I can justify being over 100k dollars in debt for an undergrad degree.\n\nI looked into transferring to a school back in-state where I live but the cost isn't much different unless I get a scholarship. The only issue is that they only offer scholarships to transfer students coming from community colleges, which is understandable. \n\nI just feel like I am absolutely screwed now and I don't know what to do. Thinking about being stuck paying off a huge amount of debt if I stay at this school is giving me so much anxiety. I can't determine whether or not it would actually be worth it regardless of how much I like it here. I am kicking myself right now for being so naive when picking schools and not giving student loans serious consideration - I just thought that an excellent school would set me up for success and it would never be an issue.\n\nShould I just transfer to a community college at home for a year and try to figure things out. I could potentially attend the CC for free - and since I am unsure about my major I am even more worried that if I change my mind down the line at my current school I will not graduate on time and be in even more debt.\n\nAny advice? Has anyone transferred out of a 4-year university to a different one? Do you think it's reasonable to stay? It sounds cocky but the only justification I can think of is that my engineering degree could earn me a nice salary which could *potentially* ease the burden of massive loans just a little bit. \n\nI feel almost ashamed at how naive I was in deciding to come to a school I knew I could never afford. I feel like I am totally screwed now. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.", "author": "ian550161", "created": 1573614602, "retrieved": 1632848772, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f7fi8iu": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dvlh11/first_year_student_thinking_of_transferring/f7fi8iu/", "text": "I'm not the most experienced with this, but it seems like you should try the cheaper route.

Often I regret not having transferred the first year. My advice would be to start working on transfer applications for next semester or for sophomore year and compare the prices once you hear back from various schools. If the prices aren\u2019t significantly lower to justify transferring, you don\u2019t have to, so you can make a more informed decision.", "author": "OptimisticGardener", "created": 1573624631, "upvotes": 1}}}
