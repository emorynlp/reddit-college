I live in a expensive area (cost of living) and I\u2019m going to school for environmental science. Or I should say I want to. I have a general associates in arts or sciences I completed a few years back. I took a year off of school as I tried to do electrical work, didn\u2019t work so summer of 2019 I decided to go back to school and I took CALC and some other classes I needed and got B+ in both no problem(difficulty isn\u2019t part of it)\nSo now I find out that because of the community colleges around here and how I\u2019ve never taken a chem class it\u2019s going to take me essentially 14-15 months to have my pre-reqs done for environmental science and two years at uni after that and while that\u2019s cool I feel annoyed that Im not using the degree I already have (I know it\u2019s not in STEM and I get that) my question is does anybody know what I can major in using my general transfer degree at university? Thanks and I\u2019m not set on environmental science and I don\u2019t need it to be something I\u2019m going to make a ton of money in, I just need it to be worth going to school for.", "author": "acidicship", "created": 1582166585, "retrieved": 1632961135, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
