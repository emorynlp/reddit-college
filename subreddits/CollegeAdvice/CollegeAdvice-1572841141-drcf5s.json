I want to do a double minor in political science and creative writing, but it would require stacking up on credits this semester. These are the classes I am planning on taking (total of 19 credits):\n\n* physics for the environmental sciences (4) // and this one comes with a 3 hour lab once a week \n* technical writing and communications (3)\n* global atmospheric change (3)\n* ecosystem ecology and global environment (3)\n* global issues of the u.n (3)\n* introduction to creative writing (3)\n\nthe final two classes would both be for my minor. I've never taken physics before and this class is infamously hard so im worried that I won't be able to maintain my gpa at the level I want it with 19 credits. help !!!!!!!! is taking this many credits worth it ?? \n\n\\-sam", "author": "sottsam", "created": 1572841141, "retrieved": 1632848784, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
