I'm planning to go to a different college for freshman year and then transfer in, and need to know if there will be any unseen complications/will I be less likely to be accepted as a transfer based on my first year college. The choices are\n\nA) University of North Texas\n\nPros\n\n* Great music school. While I'm not planning to major in it because $, I am an aspiring composer, and being in an institution with such an acclaimed music school would be great for a number of reasons(connections, shared interests, etc).\n* Like the culture better.\n\nCons\n\n* Kind of a garbage tier school otherwise. I'm planning to transfer so degree wise this doesn't matter as much, but I'm wondering if A&M will think less of my transfer application knowing it's from UNT.\n\nB)Texas tech\n\nPros\n\n* almost definitely better for my major (compsci?) than UNT\n* Gave me a bunch of money which is nice even if I'd probably only use 1 year of the four\n\nCons\n\n* Lubbock seems like the most unholy grass gulag on this green earth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally wish I could go visit either of them to better get an idea, but we're kind of in the middle of a plague so that all got cancelled.
