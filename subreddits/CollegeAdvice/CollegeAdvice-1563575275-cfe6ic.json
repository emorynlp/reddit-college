Choose one major & finish faster, or continue with both?", "text": "Hi, so I've never actually tried this reddit thing before, but here goes nothing!\n\nI've been a game design student for two years now, and for 3 whole semesters, I felt like I needed way more knowledge than I was learning in university, I felt like everything I was learning in class, I could learn on my own at home, and whenever I asked my professors to teach me more, they would tell me that \"we can't because the class wouldn't keep up and we're teaching at the class's pace\". \n\nSince game design was a new major in the university (or in the country in general), there was lack of teachers and material. \nI was literally going to university for 2-3 hours max and coming back home, with two or one day off per week. \n \nI realized that I had an intense passion for programming, so I thought \"hmm, lets just double major in computer science, maybe that'd fix the void.\"\n\nSo in the fourth semester, I applied for a double major in computer engineering (because my university didnt have computer science). \nThe void was quite full. I was going to university for 8 hours instead of 3. Everyday. \n\nI actually felt like a college student, which was bad I guess? I even lost the creativity I had in the first 3 semesters to make games. \nYet, I managed, I got A's on all my Game Design classes, but not on all the Engineering classes, they were quite tough compared to what I got used to from Game Design. (We don't even take any sorts of Mathematics in Game Design) \nNow, without my double major, i need 4 years to finish (minus 2 that I already finished)\nWith my double major, I need around 6 years. \nThe problems here?\n-I'm a full scholarship student and my scholarship ends at the fourth year\n-I'm not even sure having a second degree is worth it (2 extra years?) \n-I could just finish my Game Design Bachelors Degree and go for a Masters degree in those 2 extra years.\n\nYou see, the reason I applied for Computer Engineering was because I have dreams of getting into artificial intelligence in games (or well, in anything). My dreams don't exactly reside in the game industry, and although I quite love it, I dream of something bigger (no offense to games, I don't mean to say that games are not big, they are, but they're just not my thing)\n\nI'm afraid that with my Game Design degree, I wouldn't be able to get into a Masters program related to artificial intelligence, since Game Design is from the Communication Faculty. Or maybe that I wouldn't have enough background knowledge to be the developer I hope to be. \n\nI don't know what to do, I don't know whether to drop my double major or go through it. I don't know whether it's worth it or not, and I hope any of you can help.. \n\nI wrote way too much, I apologize about that, but anyway, thank you a lot!", "author": "justGuni", "created": 1563575275, "retrieved": 1632960987, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eugvo9f": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cfe6ic/double_major_advice_game_design_and_computer/eugvo9f/", "text": "You have to get clear on what direction you want to go in.
