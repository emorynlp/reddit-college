I got accepted to northridge State and committed to them but I just got accepted off the waitlist for Fullerton state and I have till Monday to decide what I want. I\u2019ve visited northridge State and took a liking to it but when I was first applying to colleges I thought I would commit to Fullerton before northridge. I haven\u2019t visited Fullerton state and I don\u2019t know much about it but I also don\u2019t know too much about northridge State. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on which one is better and has a better biology program? And to share any experience that you think might be helpful to me. Thank you!
