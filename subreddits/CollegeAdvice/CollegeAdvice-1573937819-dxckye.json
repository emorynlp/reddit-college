The course curriculum is mainly YouTube videos from things like PBS, and other content creators that are part of the field that make educational videos.

There have been classes where you strictly read from a textbook and self teach the whole class. There have been classes where you are just taking online modules the whole time. And there have been classes where you don't really feel like much gets done in general. It really just depends and of course my uni is probably much different from yours. \n\nLook at it this way, it might not be the best education and you might not get as much out of it as you do in class but you will get the credits. If that is all that matters to you online is a great path but if you want to discuss and learn traditionally you should probably take in person classes.\n\nI got into the whole online education thing awhile ago and it seems to be overall a good option, but not the same as classroom learning. It doesn't really feel very impactful or present in my life, hard to explain.
