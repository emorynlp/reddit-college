I failed most of my engineering classes to the point that I cannot return to FSU even if I chose another career. Instead of pursuing engineering further I have decided to go for Electronics Engineering technician at FAMU the only problem is they have denied me due to my GPA being to low. Would it be a good idea to go back to a community college get my A.S degree in Engineering technology and then try to transfer back to FAMU?
