His teaching isn't fantastic(it's guided learning for upper level chemistry), but he gives off the nice-old-guy vibes. \n\nLast fall my roommate and I had a stalker. We finally confronted him and it got bad so we had to involve housing.\n\nI talked to the Dr. about it, the day before the final. He offered to move my final (which was nice, but I didn't do it),  told me about the on-campus religious organization that had things that could help (stalker worked in our cafeteria) and asked if I would like prayer. I said yes. ( i was grateful he asked, and didn't just say \"OH I\"LL PRAY!\"). I used to be practicing protestant.\n\n  \nI later had small break down in lab, this semester and explained I got fired unexpectedly, after losing sleep over a fight with a friend.  He again offered prayer and I thanked him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then sent an email saying that he had given my email to a friend who could talk with me about things. She emailed today, and is part of the catholic center. I am PISSED he gave my school email to an acquaintance, without my permission. He  hasn't given off any red flags in other areas, but I am very upset. As a student from an abusive home, professors giving information without consent is a terrifying reminder they could ruin my life without knowing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdvice? I don't want him punished for this (even though I hate his teaching). But I believe he over-stepped his bounds, even though he (seemed) to have good intent.
