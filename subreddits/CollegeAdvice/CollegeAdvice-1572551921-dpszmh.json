I am a junior transfer student from a community college to a four year college. My future goal is to get a Phd in Industrial Organizational Psychology or Psychobiology. They told me it was nearly impossible to do biology as a minor in the time frame so I pick english because I figured it will help me regardless of which way I went. However, I am struggling and failing my english courses so I am thinking of switching my minor to business but not sure on what type (accounting, business administration, business systems & analytics, marketing etc.) Any advice helps!

I'm also a transfer student this year and have been encountering similar challenges in trying to add a minor! For me, it's going to be possible with some extra units loaded on and summer classes. \n\nIn regards to picking which business minor to add, I suggest doing some research into what each subsection focuses on (there is likely a description for each on your college's website) and see which is the most interesting to you! You could also look up jobs that are related to that type of study and imagine if you'd enjoy learning some of those skills. Lastly, go and talk to the minor advisors or find people who have already added these minors. You can get some direct insight to how it's taught at your college and ask your questions in person!\n\nGooood luck! Go transfers!", "author": "eleniray", "created": 1572658684, "upvotes": 2}}}
