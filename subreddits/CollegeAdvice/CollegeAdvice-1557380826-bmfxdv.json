Recently, I screwed the pooch on a Calculus course that I will eventually need as a prerequisite for my degree. I thought that I would give an online course over the summer a try, but I've never taken one before and could use any advice on how to succeed in an online class, and what they usually entail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor background on why I did poorly in my regular class, I have ADHD pretty bad, even paying attention for a one hour course is a challenge for me, though hopefully, new medication should help sort that out. I figured that with an online class, I would have an easier time of it since I could come back the information, and the times would be set in stone. Thank you, and I appreciate any and all advice and knowledge about online classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you for your information and help, and I know that this is a very late edit and thank you, after talking it over with my advisor and family, I decided that the best thing I could do to stay on track would be to study this summer and take the class during the regular school year when I am better prepared ahead of time. Again though, thank you for your advice, I'll definitely try using it even during my normal classes and seeing if that helps me improve.", "author": "TheCharlatanChemist", "created": 1557380826, "retrieved": 1632848960, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"es0zsl3": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bmfxdv/screwed_up_an_inperson_class_how_do_i_do_well_in/es0zsl3/", "text": "My ADHD/autism coping technique for classes where my attention drifts?\n\nTake extensive handwritten notes.

Depending on the class, you may need to attend video lectures at a certain time, or the whole class may be asynchronous (meaning that there are deadlines but you do work at your own pace and on your own time). This means that you will need to set your own schedule and stick to it in order to get all of the readings and assignments finished.\n\nI recommend that you check your online course platform often at the start of the term. Professors can put things up at the last minute (and without notice, depending on the platform and if its notifications are connected to your email or not), and you will want to look at the syllabus as soon as it is up. As soon as you get the syllabus, print it out and note important deadlines and test dates. If you don't use a planner or calendar already, you may want to use one for this course because you won't be attending a physical class to remind you of the schedule. I also recommend looking over the syllabus to get a general idea of the class schedule - are there weekly homework assignments? When and how are they due (do you post to a place on the course platform, or do you submit them by email?) Are there other assignments? How do you access the book? How is the professor available, and where can you ask questions if you need help?\n\nGood luck!", "author": "writingoreos", "created": 1557456043, "upvotes": 1}, "emy34nc": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bmfxdv/screwed_up_an_inperson_class_how_do_i_do_well_in/emy34nc/", "text": "I\u2019ve always found that online math courses are the hardest.
