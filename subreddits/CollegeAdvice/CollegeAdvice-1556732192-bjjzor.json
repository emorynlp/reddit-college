I still showed up to take the final, but my head wasn\u2019t all the way there. How do I let my professor know this without it coming across as a sympathy ploy?", "author": "3mthreat", "created": 1556732192, "retrieved": 1632848969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"emq0gqs": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bjjzor/how_to_let_my_professor_know_about_family_death/emq0gqs/", "text": "Hey sorry to hear about what happened. You can always email or go in person depending how you feel comfortable on handling the situation. I would suggest you say to your professor \u201cI wanted to let you know before I went to take the test I found out about a family member\u2019s death and it really made me lose focus while taking the test. I don\u2019t want to make any excuses on my performance on the test, but this really affected me. I understand there may not be a make up test (especially if it states in their syllabus no make ups) I just wanted to clarify with you what just had happened\u201d. If your professor says yes or no to make it up just tell them \u201cI greatly appreciate that you listen to what I had to say, thank you.\u201d If anything you can always go to admissions and they should be able to do something if you need help. Hopes this helps!", "author": "ryn9220", "created": 1557218431, "upvotes": 1}}}
