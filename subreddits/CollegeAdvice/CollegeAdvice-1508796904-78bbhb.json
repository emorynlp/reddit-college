I just wanted to know why engineering majors (of course not all of them) seem to have a belief that they are intellectually dominant to other majors. I mean, I understand that engineering isn't easy but I also realize that everyone had the same option to choose majors. While some couldn't be engineers due to being unable to grasp the concepts, others just didn't like it or for whatever reason didn't like that route. Anyone have any input about this?", "author": "JohnnyQuick229", "created": 1508796904, "retrieved": 1632960385, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"dot2yqo": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/78bbhb/why_do_engineering_majors_seem_to_behave_as/dot2yqo/", "text": "I think it\u2019s a couple of things. \n\n\nFirst, society kinda builds up the egos of engineers. People always say how revolutionary and smart engineers are so degree seeking students (not even real engineers yet) start to feel high and mighty. \n\n\nSecond, Calculus. Seriously it\u2019s pretty brutal and I guess the people you\u2019re referring to feel like their difficult classes automatically means they\u2019re smarter than others. \n\n\nI\u2019m seeking an engineering degree myself and I definitely know what you mean. You even see engineers being that way to other engineers. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m an engineer\u201d \u201cshut up asshole I\u2019m an engineer too\u201d \n\n\nMainly I think it\u2019s just because there are rude and arrogant people in all facets of life but for the most part, engineers are gentle creatures. Just avoid the entitled ones. ", "author": null, "created": 1508825308, "upvotes": 4}}}
