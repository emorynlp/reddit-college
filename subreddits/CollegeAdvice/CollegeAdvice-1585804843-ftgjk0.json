I plan to major in either bio or biomed and follow a pre med track. After looking at each of the schools, all seemed to have different strengths and weaknesses. Tufts IMO academically would be the best choice however it is also the most expensive by a fair bit, which I know isn\u2019t the best for students planning on med school. Northeastern and UNC have pretty much no difference in price since I am out of state for UNC-CH, so I am having trouble deciding if UNC is worth it. After touring I loved both Northeastern and UNC, but I didn\u2019t feel anything special at Tufts\n\nANY ADVICE WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED :)\n\nSide note: I was admitted into Northeastern Honors so I have some required honors classes to take.", "author": "jacobc2070", "created": 1585804843, "retrieved": 1632961102, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fm7xlm9": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ftgjk0/decided_on_college_for_premed_tufts_northeastern/fm7xlm9/", "text": "All of these schools are fantastic!!!! Whatever choice you make will lead you to a great path (also congrats on getting  accepted to all of them!!!). Now to make a decision, all of them have wonderful academic programs and pre-med tracks so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much in that sense. I know it\u2019s silly but it is SO important to feel at home and like you fit it at the university you choose to go to. After all you are going to spend the next 4 years of your life there. What are you expecting from college? A small community? Small classes? If so tufts seems to be a better match as both UNC and Northeastern have almost 20,000 undergrads and their classroom size is going to be in the 150-200 range (mostly for your intro courses). \n\nNow I would have to agree that you should try to limit how much debt you will go in if med school is the ultimate plan cause that is going to be expensive. I would say look at your financial aid packages, compare them and do a loan re-payment projection to see what it would be like in the future. \n\nNow, don\u2019t just choose a University with the best pre-med track because what happens if in your sophomore year you decide mes school is not what you want? What if you like idk anthropology better or maybe even just public health. My point is go to a school that will give you options (which most do) and don\u2019t limit yourself to only the pre med track because at the end of the day over 50% of students will change their mind on what they thought they would study. \n\nLastly, as a UNC grad I am completely biased and would recommend UNC with all my power, it is a FANTASTIC school and I looooved going there (in fact I am hoping to go back for med school) I had so many internship, shadowing and research opportunities that have really built my resume. Professors (most of them) where always super helpful and open to help. Please let me know if you have any questions I am happy to answer :)", "author": "medicalentusiast", "created": 1585838832, "upvotes": 1}}}
