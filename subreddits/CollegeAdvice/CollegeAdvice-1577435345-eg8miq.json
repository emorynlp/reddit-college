I transferred to a 4 year after going to a cc for 2 years, so I am already having to go an extra year to fit all of my credits in. I just finished up my 3rd semester, and I didn't meet my gpa requirement for the continuation of courses related to my major. It's really embarrassing, and I may even have to go an extra semester on top of the extra year to get my degree. I definitely didn't study enough, and I really let my grades go. I know what I did wrong, and I know what I need to do next semester. Any advice/motivation anyone could give me would be great.", "author": "jonburke21", "created": 1577435345, "retrieved": 1632960367, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
