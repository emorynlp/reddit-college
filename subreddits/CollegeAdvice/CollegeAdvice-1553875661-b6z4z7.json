Transfer to Public Uni $$$, or 3. Stay in CC $ to raise GPA and reduce transfer costs", "text": "**1. Private Uni $$$$**\nOriginally planned to go to a local school ($55,000 for 2 years) at the end of this semester once I had an AA. That cost would have been more than halved ($20,000) had I had a 3.5 gpa due to certain automatic scholarships the college gives. This is the school my parents are pushing me for, and I see it as a great option for the faculty and professors and specialty in my area. It wouldn\u2019t be more than an hour commute.\n\nRight now I have a 2.64 GPA, and unfortunately I failed a class this semester even after that. Hopefully even with the failed grade, my GPA will still be closer to a 3.0 due to retaking a separate failed course and other creds. \n\n**2. Public School $$$**\nBecause of this, I\u2019ve been looking at a public school about 2.5 hrs away that would only be ~$20,000 for two years. But that might double with paying for room and board and other expenses that I\u2019m currently receiving for practically free living with my parents. This college seems to have many good aspects as well, is in my favorite part of the state, and added bonus of not living with parents anymore. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve missed the scholarship deadlines for this public school, and now it\u2019s seeming like **3. I may just do better if I do another semester or two at the community college** I currently attend. I could \n\n1. Retake the lower-grades fall semester \n2. Get a higher GPA (3.5) by spring sem that would qualify me for honors and PTK organizations + scholarships, and \n3. Save money for finishing my BA at whatever college I desire \n\nFrom this it seems that the smartest choice would be community college. However, as much as I want a higher GPA, I worry that my problems in the past with these tedious basics/101 classes that I have no true interest in would persist, and I would find it hard to devote myself to an entire semester or two of courses that I have no interest in. I wonder if it would be better to just transfer and start doing the courses actually pertaining to my major and deal with loans/figuring out a higher paying job/taking on more jobs. \n\nThanks for any help!!\n", "author": "take_this_kiss", "created": 1553875661, "retrieved": 1632848998, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ejospum": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b6z4z7/should_i_1_transfer_to_private_uni_2_transfer_to/ejospum/", "text": "Definitely stick with community college for at least a semester or two. Get your general education courses out of the way at a reduced cost and work hard to set yourself up in a better position to receive scholarships/honors/etc. The introductory courses are definitely going to suck, but they're not going to suck less at a public university (or the private university for that matter). \n\nWhen you do transfer, you can then focus entirely on your major/interests without worries of having to take care of other classes.
