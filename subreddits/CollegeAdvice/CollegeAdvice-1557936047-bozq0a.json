RISD reached out to me after may 1st to ask if i was still interested. i said yes, but i feel like it\u2019s still too late to go back on my decision which i\u2019m starting to regret. \n\nhow do i learn to love my college choice? should i look into ditching emerson for RISD? i hope i don\u2019t sound entitled or bratty - i truly am grateful for getting into the schools i did and for the ppl who got me there. this process has been such a drain on my life for the past few months and i am not satisfied with the ending\n\ni appreciate any comments and advice!", "author": null, "created": 1557936047, "retrieved": 1632848952, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"es0yiu7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bozq0a/did_i_make_the_wrong_choice_how_to_cope_with/es0yiu7/", "text": "RISD is an amazing school.

Definitely go with what you're happier with, but if you get invested into the community then you'll be happy with the place. The fact that you got accepted to RISD is really incredible and would be great to pursue, but it seems almost like you want help from others to convince you that Emerson is the right choice. So that's my suggestion is to go with Emerson. Give it a year, a whole school year and your dedication. If after a year you are still questioning, then come back and consider again", "author": "raven-wraith", "created": 1558925013, "upvotes": 1}, "enq1447": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bozq0a/did_i_make_the_wrong_choice_how_to_cope_with/enq1447/", "text": "Wait, can\u2019t you still wait for NYU? I mean sure you paid the deposit fee but you can still switch decisions to NYU if they take you in.
