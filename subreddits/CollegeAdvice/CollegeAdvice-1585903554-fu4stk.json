I have plans on going to New York for my masters, and I'm trying to think ahead so I make the right moves and guarantee acceptance to this school.\n\nI've been wanting to go to the other school in my state where it's much bigger, older (and dorms are  offered) since I was still in high school but my parents didn't want me to move away. I brought up the idea of transfering and they've gotten around to it now. The problem is though it's much more expensive and knowing that I could be spending an extra year if my credits don't transfer over..\n\nShould I stay where I currently am (+: save money, closer to parents, -: not happy) or transfer (+: happy, independence, -: paying more). Please help! I need advice and guidance", "author": "qeaches", "created": 1585903554, "retrieved": 1632961100, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmcpuht": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fu4stk/stay_or_transfer/fmcpuht/", "text": "I would say transfer. In 20 years you won\u2019t be worried about the loan or the credits but look back on the experiences, memories you made, and how happy you are. Plus you will be more motivated to do well academically if you are in an environment you love. I just transferred schools and was nervous that my credits wouldn\u2019t transfer because I went from a small private college to a large state one. More transfers than you think, and if the class isn\u2019t a direct 1 for 1 transfer then they will usually just award you elective credit that everyone needs anyway to graduate. Also if you think about it you got a lot of credits done for cheaper! Hope this helps, good luck!", "author": "throwaway2253647", "created": 1585950431, "upvotes": 2}}}
