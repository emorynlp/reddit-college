I'm taking the time in quarantine to put together my list of colleges to apply to. I don't have a college advisor so I don't really have anyone to ask.\n\nThings I'm looking for -\n\n\\- Good programs in either Digital media , Journalism , Creative media or Entertainment/Sports management.\n\n\\- Decent sized school (I'm willing to go down to 8,000 but no less then that)\n\n\\- Lots of clubs and activities to join\n\n\\- Great student media programs\n\n\\- Greek life\n\n\\- Ideally in the south but I'm open to the midwest or southwest. I don't want to be in a super expensive state like Massachusetts or New York or California though.\n\n\\- Not super hard to get into or at least a free application so it's not wasting my money.\n\n\\- School spirit and a community (I know this seems petty to some but the New Zealand universities don't have that at all)\n\nList currently (I'm open to other suggestions) -\n\n1. University of Alabama\n2. University of Arizona\n3. Arizona State\n4. University of Arkansas\n5. Baylor\n6. University of Central Florida \n7. University of Cincinnati\n8. Clemson\n9. University of East Carolina\n10. University of Florida \n11. Florida State\n12. University of Houston\n13. University of Indiana\n14. University of Kentucky\n15. Louisiana State\n16. University of Miami (FL)\n17. North Carolina State\n18. University of Oklahoma\n19. Oklahoma State\n20. University of South Carolina\n21. University of South Florida\n22. Southern Methodist\n23. University of Tennessee\n24. Texas A&M\n25. Texas Christian\n26. Tulane\n27. Utah\n\nWhich schools would you recommend?", "author": "Notapplicable90210", "created": 1587453539, "retrieved": 1632848308, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"g1fd728": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g5ao58/international_student_2025_list/g1fd728/", "text": "UTDallas accepts a lot of international and is one of the more competitive schools in Texas. but theres no football team (american) if thats a turn off.
