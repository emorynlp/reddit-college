Check your top school\u2019s ap credit and community college credit guidelines. This will give you an idea of what you should choose. Most schools don\u2019t take dual-credit classes, but it\u2019s more likely they will if you took the class in the same state as your college. Overall, dual-credit classes are less easily transferred for credit. \nThat being said, if for some reason you can\u2019t take an ap history class, don\u2019t worry. Dual credit still looks really good! \nFor the science classes, taking ap bio this year and environmental science next is probably your best choice. \nYou have a good, busy schedule and colleges will like to see that.

Even though your schedule for next year will be rough, it\u2019ll show that you and grit and didn\u2019t take the easy way out- something very important to colleges. They get a list of the classes your school offers and will see if you decided to take harder or easier classes, and their relevance to your major. If you take AP bio it\u2019ll show that you worked harder and took classes relevant to your major. Just make sure to do well on the test!
