This year I am living on campus and it\u2019s not really my thing. Also, it\u2019s $11k to live on campus so next year I\u2019m considering commuting. The issue is that I am at a full course load. I am guaranteed to have a T/R 8am and M/W night class until 6:30 and a T night class until 7:30. I also live 55 minutes away without traffic. Is it worth it for me to commute? Or should I live on campus and take out private loans?", "author": null, "created": 1553379425, "retrieved": 1632849062, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ekqjzqy": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b4oyqf/should_i_commute_next_year/ekqjzqy/", "text": "It depends on your work ethic and ability to spend 10 hours in a car a week.
