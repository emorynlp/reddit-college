  "text": "So failed statistics and got a low C in bio. I passed my my English with a 89.5.%. All together my GPA is 1.818, and because of this I have been put academic probation. I am off for the summer and going back in the fall. \n\nIs the only way for me to get out of this is raise my GPA to the appropriate level? What will I not be receiving from my school because of this? I know I will not receive any financial aid. This blows.",

      "text": "You need to identify why your GPA is what it is. Others have told you your only option is to raise it, and thats true, but if you don\u2019t identify the problem that isnt going to happen.\n\nAre you attending class? Taking good notes? Doing the reading?\nHow much time are you spending studying? How do you study?\nWhen you lose points, are they mostly on HW or tests?\nAre you making use of office hours, free tutoring, paid tutoring, study sessions with people who get the material better than you?\nAre you too depressed or anxious to do well? Are you too preoccupied with girls or family issues?\n\nIdentify the problems, write them down. For each problem, make a list of ways to address them. Make a daily checklist that ensures you\u2019ve done everything you can. If you do all of this and really stick to it, most people can easily make Bs or As in all their classes at most schools.",

      "text": "It depends on how your school handles probation- always best to speak to a counselor/advisor.\n\nAt our school- the only way you get off probation is raising your GPA to a min. of 2.0. the easiest way to do that is to retake the courses you didn't do well in. \nIn terms of financial aid, being on probation doesn't necessarily mean you can't get aid. You do need to do a SAP (appeal) and let them make that decision.",
