Or just jump in..", "text": "Does anybody have advice for someone  going into culinary school but not sure if i should jump into it this summer of 2020 or wait a whole summer to get a decent amount of money as backup and ease into it? I feel like this summer is too soon but summer 2021 is just too far away.. but I also feel like if I go into it this summer It might be too much all at once but it might be good to just get it over with.. or to just take the year and get some practice with culinary.. im all over the place and would really like some help if anyone has any advice for college.. Ive already taken a year off to just decide what I want to do.. so i feel like taking another year for school would make me feel guilty for some reason..", "author": "Krissypoop", "created": 1581369712, "retrieved": 1632960483, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
