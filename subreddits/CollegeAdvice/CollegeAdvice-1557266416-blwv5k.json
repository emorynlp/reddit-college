I have a 2.3 gpa and after this semester I will probably have a 2.2. Every semester since sophomore year I have been getting mostly Ds and a few Cs. My attendance in class isn\u2019t good and I just never want to go to class. I can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s just me being lazy or if it\u2019s something with my own mind that I am failing to recognize. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me because every time I do bad I beat myself up about it and get really upset so I do care deep down but I never do anything to fix it. I wish I could change my major but I am too far in it to switch. I am just looking for advice. I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to graduate because my major classes gpa has to be a 2.0 or higher and it\u2019s not there. Please help give me some advice on how to get my shit together", "author": "mkj614", "created": 1557266416, "retrieved": 1632960444, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"es10cdp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/blwv5k/im_not_doing_well_in_college/es10cdp/", "text": " \n\nYou need to identify why your GPA is what it is.

How much time are you spending studying? How do you study? When you lose points, are they mostly on HW or tests? Are you making use of office hours, free tutoring, paid tutoring, study sessions with people who get the material better than you? Are you too depressed or anxious to do well? Are you too preoccupied with girls or family issues?\n\nIdentify the problems, write them down. For each problem, make a list of ways to address them.
