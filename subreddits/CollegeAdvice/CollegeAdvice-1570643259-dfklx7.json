This means in you network, your relationships, and can also simply mean going to the library to study since being surrounded by motivated people may make you more motivated.\n\nGood luck, you got this!!", "author": "etherealanqel", "created": 1570673436, "upvotes": 1}, "f33rduo": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dfklx7/im_failing_at_everything_in_college/f33rduo/", "text": "Sounds like you\u2019re depressed.
