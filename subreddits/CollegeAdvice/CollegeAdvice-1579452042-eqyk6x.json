I\u2019m looking for an reputable, accredited vet tech program. The closest school to me with such a program is 2 hours away and I\u2019m not able to relocate. So I\u2019ll have to do it online. I was going to go with Penn Foster but I figured I should ask around to see if there\u2019s better options out there. Does anyone have any ideas? \n\nThanks in advance!", "author": "ljd1990", "created": 1579452042, "retrieved": 1632848366, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ff048bv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/eqyk6x/going_back_to_college_at_29/ff048bv/", "text": "[https://www.avma.org/education/accreditation/programs/distance-education-programs-veterinary-technology-accredited-avma-committee-veterinary-technician](https://www.avma.org/education/accreditation/programs/distance-education-programs-veterinary-technology-accredited-avma-committee-veterinary-technician)", "author": "drock13", "created": 1579465021, "upvotes": 1}}}
