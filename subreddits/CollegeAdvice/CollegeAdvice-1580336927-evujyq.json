I was late on getting my financial aid papers/tax into the school. So I\u2019ve been like 2 weeks without money and I don\u2019t currently have a job but I\u2019m looking. The program that I\u2019m going to school for is automotive technology. So I need tools/ money for car parts which is what financial aid is suppose to cover. Is it wrong for me to start a go fund me to try and get some money so I don\u2019t have to wait so long? I\u2019m just trying to get by at this point and I\u2019ve had interviews but no one wants to hire a full time college student. So I\u2019m kinda stuck and stressed out. I have no money and it makes me worry maybe I\u2019ll fail this term of college. \nBtw this is my first term of college. So I\u2019m kinda struggling on what to do and how to go about it right.", "author": "turnerm19", "created": 1580336927, "retrieved": 1632961146, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
