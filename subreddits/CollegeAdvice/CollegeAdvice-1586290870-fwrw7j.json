Is UCLA a good option? I realize they only have an economics program and I am interested particularly in finance or accounting. Should I be looking into a program specifically with a finance major or accounting major like a CSU? or would UCLA be a good foundation for whatever field I want to pursue. Any advice would be much appreciated.", "author": "armersai", "created": 1586290870, "retrieved": 1632959979, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
