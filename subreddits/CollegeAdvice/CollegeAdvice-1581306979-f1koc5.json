A few months go by and he\u2019ll randomly Snapchat me out of the blue, and vise versa, but will never really hit on me, but will stare and want to be around me kinda vibes,  then one night he came over and we had sex and the next morning was chill, nothing big. A few weeks later I ended up messaging him after a few drinks, asking if he wanted to come over and he said he couldn\u2019t that night but would be definitely be down another night- so months pass and he never makes the next move so I messaged him again, drinking involved again, and he didn\u2019t open it til next morning but we never addressed it, then or ever (thank god lol), anyways a few more weeks later he messaged me when he was in my town and I messaged back and he didn\u2019t reply, and then a few more weeks later he invited me to his NYE party but I couldn\u2019t go. Fast forward a new more weeks, the other night, and I was leaving the bar and I saw him with another girl and he was fine but I could tell me was trying to act like he wasn\u2019t with her, like she tried to grab his hand and he pulled away, and he was saying how he was going to our friends\u2019 making it seems like he wasn\u2019t taking her home but obviously he was, almost like he was not playing into the girl, but now I\u2019m just confused on how he feels, if he likes me, or if I look like a pathetic, obesssed girl\n\nNot in an annoying way it\u2019s almost like he is intimidated to talk to me?? But sometimes he isn\u2019t ? It\u2019s just so weird!!!", "author": "dontdothatbbyy", "created": 1581306979, "retrieved": 1632848339, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fh77ff8": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f1koc5/am_i_crazy_or_should_i_be_more_bold/fh77ff8/", "text": "Uhhhh... r/lostredditors", "author": "stefanfolk", "created": 1581318045, "upvotes": 1}}}
