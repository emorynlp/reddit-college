  "text": "*Please note I'm a highschool junior*\n\nI'm in a situation with my mom where my mom might not let me go to a school outside a 2 hour vacinaty from the house, so I was thinking about faking (to her alone) me accepting a nearby school's admission offer and actually accepting a farther school's offer and sneaking out a couple nights before the day I need to be on campus with a couple friends who'll be staying at a hotel with me before school begins. Is this plan plausible? Now ofc this is all dependent on if I actually get accepted to certain colleges and the aid is well enough.",

It will put you in a shitty situation for financial aid potentially. Hit up those merit-based scholarships now, and take advantage of anything that makes you \"unique\" when it comes to scholarships. They're out there for everything. I know the student needs to put in what school they're going to, but I can't remember what the parent needs to put in/ can see if they fill it out themselves. I know in school you can ask them for the info and put it in without them doing it. Can possibly try to enter it in for them under the guise of you want to get used to doing adulty paperwork. \n\nI don't know your situation, but if you're in an abusive household, don't do anything that puts you at risk. Your safety needs to come first. Not saying that you shouldn't do what you can to get away if this is the case, but be careful. \n\nIf she is the run of the mill helicopter parent, you need to have a talk with her. Get your boundaries set asap and start talking to her now. 2 hours from most places seriously limits your options in most places and won't ruin your future career, but won't be the college experience you wanted. \n\nI will say, in any circumstances, it will be hard keeping what college you're actually going to from them before you go. Acceptance letters, other mail, gossip, etc. Especially considering the amount of control your mom seems to have/ want over your life.",
