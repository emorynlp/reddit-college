He has never submitted the syllabus to the students not in blackboard nor the class registry. He has given me the syllubus 2 weeks before finals and has not followed anything, and has not submitted grades until this past week. We haven't got our assignments back either. He has talked to my head of the department that he has suspected cheating as an excuse for not giving back our assignments.", "author": "herorinz", "created": 1556566608, "retrieved": 1632848974, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
