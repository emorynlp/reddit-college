  "text": "hello, I'm in my last semester of a History Associates and want to also get an Associates in Business (but won't pursue the Business degree any further) and I am wondering if anybody knows whether or not that would leave me over credits, or if it would reset because I would have already graduated the path that I was taking, and would now be starting a new one. I wouldn't be working towards both majors at the same time, but rather begin the Business one after graduating from History.\n\nTIA, and of course I plan on meeting a counsellor to get school specific information, just wanted to ask reddit before getting more deeply involved in it.",
