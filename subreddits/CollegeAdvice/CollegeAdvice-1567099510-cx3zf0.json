I wouldn't be working towards both majors at the same time, but rather begin the Business one after graduating from History.\n\nTIA, and of course I plan on meeting a counsellor to get school specific information, just wanted to ask reddit before getting more deeply involved in it.", "author": "Nevatis", "created": 1567099510, "retrieved": 1632848865, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eyilxt6": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cx3zf0/does_starting_a_new_major_at_the_same_school_add/eyilxt6/", "text": "It depends on if the courses for history are the same requirements for business.
