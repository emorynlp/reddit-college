I'm a liberal arts media major and I utterly suck at math. I attend a community college and have spent the past two and half years working towards an associates degree, and now I have hit a major roadblock. It is my school's General-Ed requirement that I complete one college-level (1100+) math course in order to graduate. I had low ACT and Placement test math scores so I am ineligible to enroll in Math 1100 or 1101 (math modeling or quantitive reasoning) until I pass a Math 0900 remedial class. My school uses the Hawkes Learning online program for remedial math and it's total sh\\*t. There are \"checkpoints\" that you have to pass with a 70 or higher (or a 75 in some cases) in order to advance to the next lesson, and then eventually to the next \"section\" of the class and getting through each section takes an entire semester, so it can cause major delays for someone just trying to get a non-STEM, media arts associates and get out quickly. Well I have taken this remedial class 3 times and have been unable to complete it. I tried everything. I attended hours beyond hours of tutoring, did every lesson and practice review, have had 3 different instructors, nothing has worked. And now I am in the final stretch of my major. I have only 3 degree courses left, which I planned to knock out this Spring 2020 semester. But without an 1100 math class I simply won't be able to graduate, per the school's requirement. I have passed every gen-ed and degree course I've taken, I've been awarded academic honors, and liked by all my professors. I'm not saying this to brag, but just to demonstrate that I am not a poor student.\n\nWhile I understand that having gen-ed requirements is universal in all schools, it feels absolutely asinine to hold my media degree hostage over 1 singular class because I can't pass a course totally irrelevant to my specialization. I will have completed my entire degree program, this is the ***only*** class I have not been able to finish. Furthermore my financial aid will be up soon. There is a limited amount of semesters it will renew for, and it's already being reduced due to changes in my parent's FASFA information, as well as a decreasing number of classes left for me take at the school. I really need to be out of here and graduate by June so I can start applying for jobs and be able to financially support myself and I won't be able to do that if the school continues to make this a problem for me. I would hate to walk away with no degree after two and half years of time, money, and dedication down the drain because I can't pass algebra.\n\nI have tried every loophole I can think of. I can't retake the placement test and I can't register for the 1100 class without an administrative override. They obviously shouldn't expect me to pass by forcing me to retake the class a 4th time. (The definition of insanity is repeating something over and over expecting different results). The only idea I had was to register in a math 900 and 1100 course as co-requisites, and then drop the 900 and hope there are no questions asked. The difference is in a college-level class, it's the same as all the other ones I've taken. If you don't make that 70 on the first test, well just try harder on the next one. There is also homework, quizzes, attendance, lab, etc that all add up as percentages to an overall grade, that is finalized at the end of the semester and will determine if you passed or not. There is none of this \"checkpoint\" nonsense that won't let you advance to the very next lesson and test until you get the right score, ultimately just wasting your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo TLDR; does anyone here know if there's any possible way I can either get this requirement waived, take an alternative course that will still count towards it, or maybe just get a singular exemption that will allow me to bypass these remedial classes and go straight into the 1100 course?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not against talking to the staff or dean of the school, but I definitely have the impression from past experiences that they don't really give a sh\\*t what problem you have and sometimes might even try to spin it back onto you being the problem, and not simply the educational structure of the school. It's just stressing me out like crazy right now because the semester starts in a week and I haven't worked out a solution yet. This will honestly make or break my graduation. And the worst part of it all is that it's completely unrelated to anything I have studied or been trained for in regards to my degree and career.  And even though it's not 100% necessary to have a degree in the media field, it is certainly not a bad thing and it'd also be a personal accomplishment for myself that I worked for and feel proud of. So any help would be appreciated. To put it dramatically, this is my most desperate hour.", "author": "Orion_Report", "created": 1578516421, "retrieved": 1632960864, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fdm1eg3": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/elym4b/unpassable_math_requirement_keeping_me_from/fdm1eg3/", "text": "This is gonna sound me but here is what I would recommend... be the student who sits in the front and asks a TON of questions... if your professor is going to fast say you need them to rewind... if you don\u2019t understand a concept or a step tell them to rewind... GO TO OFFICE HOURS... teachers don\u2019t want to fail you so the more effort they see the more likely at the end of the term they are to give you a higher grade than of what you earned! I know it may see scary to ask questions especially if it\u2019s in a 350 seat class but remember, THEY WORK FOR YOU!
