Should I just take a w grade and retake take.", "text": " I just turned 21 started up college again  because I wanted to improve my life by having an education. I live with my mom in a small apartment.  I wasn't always the smartest kid growing up with ADHD and dyslexia so I had to work hard to get where I am now. Also I work out frequently with the goal to a have a similar physique to Eugen Sandow. I have a high school diploma,so I'm pursuing a degree in cyber security and Networking at a community college as a Associates in Applied Science (A.A.S) degree. I'm afraid to drop a class because it's may affect the time in which I graduate, keep in mind just started my first semester at a new college. I fear that I'll be unable to progressive along  with my high school friends as they graduate. We don't attend the same schools because they worked harder than me, they managed to go to SUNY schools with-full tuition-free paid rides. This happen in 2016 when we graduate HS, while I went to a CUNY school and ended up transferring because of how poorly I  have done so I spent 1 year and 6 months getting two trade degrees in information technology and worked as intern for a corporate company . Even to this day I envy them and we all respect each other, we all had  a somewhat similar upbringing living as poor kids in the big City. I'm doing well in all my other classes but statistics is taking its toll on me. I'm  doing everything I can too pass the class by using youtubing videos and going for tutoring session for help in the class. I'm about to take my middterm and I have a know I'll be screwed on it. So I have the opportunity to drop it by November 5 to get a W grade to retake it sometime later but don't know if I should. And I was afraid that I'll be too old when I graduate. Along with feeling like a failure at starting to make an income late in life.  I also wish to gain a bachelor's degree, which means I'll be most likely getting it at 26 .  I want to improve my living situation, I can't seem to decided on what to do, I don't want to seem like a disappointment. So I'm actively looking for a job part-time.

It might seem counter-intuitive while you have a midterm looming over your head, but seriously go and take an hour or two to yourself. Workout, take a bath, watch a show, whatever helps you relax. Panicking makes it harder to think rationally which will hurt your retention of the class material and possibly push you to make the wrong decision. Trust me, I know this is easier said than done, but if you can convince yourself that a break can help, it will help.\n\nSecond, if your prof grades in a reasonable amount of time, put off thinking about dropping the class until you get your midterm grade back. Go by the syllabus to see what your chances of passing the class are. If there's an online grading program (canvas, angel, etc) that your prof uses there might be a way to plug in what if grades there. If not, you can calculate it yourself with the percentages in the syllabus.\n\nIf it looks like you are going to fail the class after all, it's generally better to drop the class. However, you should also look into if it's a pre req for any major classes down the line and if dropping it will affect any financial aid you're receiving.  If it's a pre req that will set your graduation back and you can't make it up over the summer, figure out how well you need to do on the remaining assignments and decide if it's reasonable. If it's not then may as well take the W so you don't take the hit on your GPA too. \n\nAs for age and your friends, don't let other's accomplishments diminish your own. You're in college despite a lot of disadvantages. You sure as hell sound like you're trying as hard as you can and doing the best as you can which is something to be proud of. Just because someone is doing better than you with less effort doesn't mean you're doing poorly. Age wise, 26 is still young in the workforce. You'll have 30-50 years to use that degree. A longer path with the same end result is still a valid path and still has the same end result. It may suck now, but you're doing it for those future decades.", "author": "odactylus", "created": 1571685458, "upvotes": 1}}}
