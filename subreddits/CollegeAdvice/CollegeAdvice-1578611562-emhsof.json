I\u2019m nervous as hell and my family doesn\u2019t have a lot of money. The college I wanna go to is expensive as hell, it\u2019s gonna cost me at least $70,000 a year and I\u2019m only getting about $22,000 in scholarships. I don\u2019t know if I should take out loans, where to apply for scholarships or anything... if anyone could help a struggling girl out, it\u2019d be great.\n\nEdit: As said, I\u2019ve been offered $22,000 in scholarships/grants, which I\u2019m 100% taking. I\u2019ve been offered a loan that would be enough to help pay for my entire freshman year along with the scholarships/grants. The loan is about $38,000 total. I don\u2019t know if I should take this out, or not, or what to do. Finances aren\u2019t my thing, sadly, so I\u2019m not sure how to go about all this.", "author": "galaxbre", "created": 1578611562, "retrieved": 1632848391, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fdpmzgo": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/emhsof/advice/fdpmzgo/", "text": "Determination is key. \n Think about it logically, especially before taking out such a big loan. You still have to pay $50,000, which is a large amount. Now Idk if your also going to be spending on housing and stuff, and if you\u2019re away from home.\n Also, you have a family, which means you have people older than you, and that means they know what to do. Basically, get your parents to tell you, and do that. You have a family, rely on them to make the decision for you. They are there to help you. And if you\u2019ve ever questioned how the world works, you\u2019ll notice that your parents are always right. Sorry this has turned into a rant I\u2019ll get back on topic.\n\nLoans are not a good thing unless you %100 know you can pay them off, even if emergency arrives. Also, if you take a Liam, try to get one interest free. Interest is one of the biggest things wrong with the economy, but nobody cares to acknowledge that.\n\nYou might also manage to get a job/ part time job in college. You can rack up money that way, at least $15,000 annually. That helps. That\u2019d put you at around $40,000 left to pay. Idk. I\u2019m sorry, I tried to help, but I have ADHD and I\u2019m really bad at writing.
