I\u2019ve had a lot of mental health problems this semester but I\u2019m already on medication. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m at my wits end.

You can retake the class next semester if it's a required class or take some different classes. You can try taking a lighter load that you can handle or just take a break altogether to take care of yourself. Education is important sure but your health is even more important. College isn't quite like high school but you can adapt to it. If you have the desire to finish college, then you can finish it.", "author": "tamashii245", "created": 1576705028, "upvotes": 1}}}
