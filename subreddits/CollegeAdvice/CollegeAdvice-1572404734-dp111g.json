Think about the major (and your course of study) as a whole; what do you like about it? does it interest you? are there things you are excited to learn (and maybe research)? \n\nSometimes individual classes are hard. Maybe it's the coursework, maybe it's the professor, maybe you're not studying enough. \n\nIf you are seriously unattracted to the subject matter, consider a major change. If you are still confident in your major choice, stick it out - there are many more courses to explore different aspects of the topic!", "author": "eleniray", "created": 1572410270, "upvotes": 1}}}
