It was hell but I don't regret it at all. I originally transferred due to shitty roommates stealing my stuff/them sleeping with people in MY bed/too expensive a school (private school), etc. My current institution is a 4 yr state school, but I'm having issues succeeding due to working full time and professors that just don't get it. I'm considering transferring to online school for the same degree in a different institution. I'm in my 4th year of school, but due to transfer credit issues and working, I was not able to graduate \"on time\". I have been at this school for two years now, and academic advisor had been no help at all... My transfer credits still haven't even been finalized due to advisor overload and nobody caring despite me pestering for two years. I have a 3.25 gpa which is a little higher than my previous school, however, I've taken online classes every summer and got a 4.0 gpa. I originally thought it was my previous school that was the issue, but now I'm thinking it's just traditional schooling is the issue as a full time employee working odd shifts. I also have health issues that make attending in class lectures regularly difficult. Am I being irresponsible/stupid/irrational for considering a second transfer given my circumstances? I also worry about if I apply for jobs/graduate school what will admins think? Will I look like I can't honor commitment? Will they take my explanations legitimately? I'm also first generation college so my parents aren't much help/judge me for whatever I tell them. I feel as though I\u2019m not reaching my full potential and I\u2019m stuck/don\u2019t know what to do about it to change it. \n\nUGH, help please I'm desperate.", "author": "gracesilver", "created": 1552189551, "retrieved": 1632849153, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
