I really need scholarships due to my financial situation at home and I've been trying to fill out as many  as I can. As of late, any time I try to fill out any scholarship, whether its online or on paper, I start spiraling into self deprecating thoughts and my throat tightens and I can't breathe and I have to put it away before anything can get accomplished. In my guidance office, you have to sign out every scholarship you take and I see the list of names (there's one in particular that really sends my spiraling but they shall remain unnamed to protect the innocent) and every time I open a scholarship all I see is the list of names and how I can't compare to them and how I'll never win any scholarships. This is really killing my motivation to get them done and I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?", "author": "fiasco-at-the-fiesta", "created": 1583282375, "retrieved": 1632848330, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"fjfp82f": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fd4msu/scholarships_are_the_worst/fjfp82f/", "text": "Scholarships are like lottery tickets, the more lottery tickets you have the better your chances.\n\nSeriously though, a lot of scholarship apps have such random components that half the time merit isn\u2019t even the most significant factor. Don\u2019t worry about who\u2019s applying, just apply. Millions of dollars go UNCLAIMED each year in scholarship money, so go through as many as you can. \n\nSet up a google doc tracking all the scholarship applications you\u2019ve done. Reward yourself for apps completed, not scholarships awarded. It\u2019s important to just keep cranking em out.\n\nAnd go for ones with essays you\u2019ve already written. It\u2019s all about quality over quantity, kindve the opposite of college apps.\n\nGood luck", "author": "ajay1225", "created": 1583296700, "upvotes": 2}}}
