Idk much about how scholarships work so if I could get advice on that, anything, that would be great. \n\nQuestions I have:\n\n1. How do I know which scholarships are worth applying for?\n2. How difficult is it actually to earn a scholarship?\n3. Should I try to accumulate a bunch of smaller scholarships rather than wait for a whole one?\n4. Do you have any resources for me to do more research on or websites to find reasonable scholarships to apply for?\n5. Any tips on process/ how to apply for the scholarships?", "author": "nannale101", "created": 1585942535, "retrieved": 1632848319, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmce1ky": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fuew1r/how_do_i_know_which_scholarships_to_apply_for/fmce1ky/", "text": "1. IMO, it's about quantity over quality. Any scholarship that takes less than ten minutes is worth applying to, regardless of the price. If it's gonna take an hour or more, depends on how much you'll get from the scholarship and your chance of getting it.\n2. It's a lot of luck. I wouldn't say its hard in the sense that you need to put a lot of work, but it is hard in the sense that you can't be certain you'll get it. There's no such thing as \"safety\" scholarships like there are safety schools (unless your state has a blanket scholarship for all students w/ a certain GPA or something like that). It's just important that you crank out as many as you can.\n3. You should do both. Both will give money, don't limit yourself to just one\n4. My personal go to was [unigo.com](https://unigo.com) because I could make an account with my info/stats and it would find scholarships that met the kind of applicant I was. There are plenty of other sites, so I'd also recommend making a google sheet/excel doc and just going at it.\n5. Scholarship and College essays can often be used interchangeably, so if you know what college essays you need to do I'd recommend doing those and finding scholarships that cater to it. Also, work on it a little every day. Set a goal to do 30 min a day, an hour a day, 1 or 2 or 3 scholarships a day, whatever works for you.\n\nBest of luck!", "author": "ajay1225", "created": 1585943873, "upvotes": 3}}}
