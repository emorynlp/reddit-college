Last semester I was super close with my roommates and we just had a great time. However, stuff happened and now the three of them have just stopped including me/totally ignoring me. I\u2019ve always dealt with social anxiety and I didn\u2019t realize how bad it would be living in a dorm/ shared living space until I got here. I made do with it last semester because I loved my roommates so much but now my anxiety is at an all time high. I have panic attacks, ive lost a ton of weight, and i have severe insomnia. I now have an opportunity to move to a new single room (because of my health issues not because of my issues with them) . Now I have to deal with the fact that I have to tell them all I\u2019m moving out and move all of my stuff out in front of them. Any advice on how to deal with this/ how to tell them would be greatly appreciated :)", "author": "natnichole2000", "created": 1581302962, "retrieved": 1632848338, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fh7smmr": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f1jtpt/moving_dorms_mid_semester/fh7smmr/", "text": "This is a legitimate medical reason for being in a single room.
