  "text": "I am a recovering alcoholic who is in college. One of the scariest things about going to college is going college when your in recovery. So when I was looking at schools one of the major deciding factors was if they had a recovery program like a living-learning community. So I decided to go with this one school who had it, needless to say it was a rough start considering my roommate who was also suppose to be in recovery had a party before classes begun. She Jeopardized my recovery, then she got kicked out. I was unfortunately all by myself in the room without any support. Skip through a couple months go by now I am feeling good in my recovery and being in college at the same time. But then I got an email saying how they are going to close the live the recovery live in learning community Next fall Due to lack of student support. I am extremely distraught by this because I am a student who is in recovery I don\u2019t know where I should go from here. Can I fight this or is there anything I can do because I want to go this school under the impression that I would have support in my recovery which I haven\u2019t really had and now they want to there exact words \u201cmove away\u201d from it.",
