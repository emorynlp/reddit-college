(I know that not everyone with mental health issues considers themselves disabled, it's just the umbrella term). If so, I strongly advise that you try to get into it. A lot of students think that DSP accommodations are only for learning disabilities, but they actually cover a wide range of health conditions that negatively impacts a student's academic performance. Don't drop out or take a full leave of absence to work on your mental health. Unless a student is going into a residential program where they'd be in extremely intensive therapy, taking a full leave to work on mental health issues is rarely a good idea. You'll still need something to occupy your time and you won't develop the right skills to cope with the challenges of your life if you put them on hold full-stop while you're trying to seek care. It also usually stresses students out more to put a huge part of their life and identity completely on pause to treat their mental health like a full-time job, their self esteem and self-image usually suffers a lot, and it can be counterproductive to getting better. It's just not a practical approach. What you can do and probably should do is take a reduced course load, potentially even just this one hard class. Mental health issues, if vetted by a therapist or psychiatrist, almost always count under the conditions that would warrant a DSP accommodation, which frequently includes a reduced courseload. It may also include other accommodations that could help you pass this class, like extensions on assignments or extra time on exams. The DSP office has your back, and if they've deemed a certain accommodation appropriate a teacher cannot refuse and they don't need to know what your condition is.  \n\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this incredibly stressful situation and I sincerely hope things get better for you. I know lots of students, including ones going T20 institutions, who have had similar mental-health induced academic struggles and come out the other side of it. It's doable, don't lose hope, you can do this!", "author": "Empowerly-Admissions", "created": 1583122695, "upvotes": 1}, "fj70vt7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fbs0nu/should_i_drop_out/fj70vt7/", "text": "Just take that class only for one semester.", "author": "RandomDataUnknown", "created": 1583084160, "upvotes": 3}}}
