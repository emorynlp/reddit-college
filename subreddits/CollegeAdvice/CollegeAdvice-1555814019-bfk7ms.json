I\u2019m deciding between 2 colleges(yes I\u2019ve gotten into other schools but they r safety), San Jose state and Penn state for computer science/engineering. For Penn state I\u2019ve been given this alternative offer where I study in another of their campuses for 2 years then transfer to the main campus (University park) to finish my studies there. However, Penn state seems to have a decently high engineering ranking (not sure if I should rely on online sources) according to USNEWS and Niche. However SJSU is in Silicon Valley so I\u2019d assume it\u2019s very easy for me to land a job and internship there. I\u2019m reluctant on Penn state because the alternate campus is in the middle of nowhere(probably meaning that it\u2019ll be harder to find an internship). I\u2019m also reluctant on SJSU because their rankings aren\u2019t very bright and I\u2019ve never heard of that school until my parents friends told me how it\u2019s a good choice for stem majors. Both of my intended majors are computer engineering at both Penn state and SJSU\n\nIf you guys need any more context, please let me know, I gotta get my decision out before May 1st.\n\nThank you for your time", "author": "WpandaReddit", "created": 1555814019, "retrieved": 1632961494, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"elgwled": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bfk7ms/sjsu_or_penn_state_22_plan/elgwled/", "text": "Some people look on Linked In to see where people who graduated from those schools got jobs.
