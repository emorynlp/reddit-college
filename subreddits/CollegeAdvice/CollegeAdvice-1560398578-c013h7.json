  "text": "I don't want to tell my family, I don't think they'll take it well, but I'm having doubts about my choices. When I got my letters back I had two choices, one next to home that my mother forced me to apply to and one in Texas with awesome internships and all that. \n\nThe biggest difference is that the one my mom applied me to has Neuroscience. I love Neuroscience but I hate the state. The school does nothing for me, I don't like the campus, and hell my doctor said that if I stay in this state any longer than I'll most likely develop asthma due to the environment's effect on my allergies. \n\nThe other college, the one in Texas, has criminal justice and psychology. I've always loved those two subjects as well, but, I don't know if that's enough, if that makes sense? I like the school. It's fun, it understands that academics isn't their defining trait, it has amazing internships that are just crazy like, I checked them out and they have some awesome exclusive things. The only thing that turned me off to it was that they have no Neuroscience program. They branch out in criminal justice, which is so cool, but that lack of Neuroscience is something that makes me hesitant and I worry that I'll regret picking the college because of that. I know that if I go there, I won't care as much about academics.. not in a bad way, of course, I would still car about grades and try my best, with more eye rolling that I'd like to admit, but I don't know, I know I'll care more about the internships more than academics.\n\nI was thinking, and maybe my problem was I didn't apply to the colleges I should've. My parents put limits on my applications and now that I'm looking at the other places in other states, I'm feeling pretty scared because I feel that I would have so much more confidence if I could major in Neuroscience and minor in psychology, you know? \n\nI just want some advice. I'll take any advice, a story, hell throw an article at me even! Tell me to man up and shut up, I don't care. I just need something.",

      "text": "Hi \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc Just thought I\u2019d respond since no one has. I am currently a senior in high school, but I will try to help you in some way.\nIf I were you, I\u2019d go to the Texas university. Don\u2019t let your mom tell you where to go because you are the one that will be living there for a few years, not her. Be some place where you want to be. As far as the internships vs. academics battle goes: if you consider awesome internships to be better than a strict curriculum, you do you and pursue the school that matches what you consider more important. Also, if you don\u2019t plan on going to graduate school, as long as you pass all your classes and get that diploma, you\u2019re totally fine and set for life.\n\nIf that Texas university doesn\u2019t fulfill your dream major, then just transfer to another school later. Get your basics out of the way and then decide what to do.\n\nBut...maybe go with your gut feeling. Take a gap year and consider applying to other universities. Maybe in that gap year, get some of your basics out of the way at your community college and then talk to the counselor if you\u2019re still lost once the year is up.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s your decision, and only you truly knows what is best for you.\n\nBtw, is the Texas university you are considering Sam Houston University by any chance? I am a Texan and have visited its campus before so just curious.",

          "text": "Yeah, it is Sam Houston. I just got back from their freshman orientation, actually. Learned about the different activities and classes! Cool stuff.\n\nThanks for the advice, it's honestly really calming because for some reason, it keeps skipping my mind that I can just transfer if I want something different. I decided a while ago that I'm going to try my best with the Texas University then if I want something different I would transfer later on. My mom is turning out to be way more supportive after hearing about my doubts so now I have her in my court looking at Neuro/Psych colleges on the down low while also preparing me for SHSU, so everything is working out as well as it could've, you know? I feel like it would be best for me if I went with what personally sounds like would be the best for my growth. Your comment does give me some confidence in that decision though so while I'm kind of beating you to the punch, you are still helping for sure. Again, thank you \u2728",
