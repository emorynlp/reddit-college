I am currently a freshman at Cal State University Fullerton and am seriously considering going back to Community to make up for my poor(to me) beginning GPA(2.8). Should I go back to CC and do the 2 years for a better gpa then transfer or would that be a waste of time and effort. Is it worth to even transfer out at this point as I'm not really sure about college name values at this point. Any advice would be appreciated for this lost soul.", "author": "MeDontLikeSpaghetti", "created": 1556094255, "retrieved": 1632848977, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eln4nsy": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bgs3te/college_advice/eln4nsy/", "text": "You bet friend, anytime.", "author": null, "created": 1556095493, "upvotes": 1}, "eln43t1": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bgs3te/college_advice/eln43t1/", "text": "At the end of the day, only grad school cares about your transcript.
