I will say that I think more information on your living situation would help folks assess the situation. \nDo you share a room? Or is it separate rooms and a shared common area? Can you transfer to a different room? \nIf you share a room you need to let him know that you're not comfortable with having drug related items in your room. If it's separate rooms tell him to keep it in his room because you're not comfortable with having it around. \nIf he refuses to cooperate transfer rooms if you can. I don't think people should be punished for drug usage but, don't be a dick to a non consenting roommate who could potentially get in trouble. \n", "author": "MotherTucker93", "created": 1503389463, "upvotes": 1}}}
