I feel like a prepare adequately but I always fall flat once I actually take them. What really makes me mad is that other people in my class that don't prepare or pay attention always outscore me. I've always had testing anxiety and I feel like that could be a part of why I am doing poor despite thoroughly preparing. Any ideas of something I can do differently to get better results would be greatly appreciated.
