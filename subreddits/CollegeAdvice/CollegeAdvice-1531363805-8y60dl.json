We're moving to Florida, where she's teaching for a third year at a small private school. The school's requirements are changing, however, and come next year she's going to have to have a finished bachelor's to keep working there.\n\nMy question is: how do we find a school that will help her finish her degree in as short a time as possible?", "author": "JeremiahKassin", "created": 1531363805, "retrieved": 1632961643, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
