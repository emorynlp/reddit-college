After my degree, I plan on doing a post-grad degree in occupational therapy, but don't know how the future will be. right now I have the opportunity to simultaneously enroll in an occupational therapy assistant diploma program at a small community college near my school. it can be taken online and extended to five years even though it 2-year program. I want to do this because I want to work with this diploma at grad school and also as a fallback if I cant get in. I don't know if this will also help me get in grad if I have experience in the field. should I do this or is it a waste of time and money?", "author": "kitronins", "created": 1523207899, "retrieved": 1632961050, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
