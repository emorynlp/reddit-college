  "title:": "Can I sustain a lie for a whole semester?",
  "text": "See, I have 3 courses (one of whom I failed under a different prof two semesters ago, which is the relevant one) and I discovered the one I'm currently taking (there are many, this one fit my current schedule) has a MUCH different atmosphere and workload. Like, the prof is an anal hardass who gives 1000 word essays for homework (classes are 2 days apart) and I know my parents will be upset if I'm taking 2 classes. I'm supposed to be graduating, yeah? Can I plausibly uphold the illusion I have 4 classes while only taking two? I'm moving out to my own apartment in about a month btw so maybe not being in contact with them all the time will help?? I'm really freaking out about failing this class for a second time. I just know I'm going to get the ass kicking of a lifetime. Help!!",
