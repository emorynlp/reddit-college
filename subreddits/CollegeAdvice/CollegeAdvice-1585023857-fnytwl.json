But I\u2019m stuck. I have a well paying job, a newer car, an apartment lined up, and more importantly: job security for the next 4 years. I plan to go to college in town to keep costs low and with scholarships that have totaled up to $10,400 I want to keep my education affordable. But it\u2019s not my dream. I want to go to a college in Massachusetts near friends and spread my wings and see new parts of the country. But I worry about jobs, affordability, and how I can keep afloat. So I\u2019m kind of stuck here. Do I stay safe and keep afloat on a safe boat? Or do I take the leap and see where it puts me?", "author": "Sneezer2013", "created": 1585023857, "retrieved": 1632848326, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"flcd6j0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fnytwl/follow_my_dream_or_stay_safe/flcd6j0/", "text": "I would take the leap.
