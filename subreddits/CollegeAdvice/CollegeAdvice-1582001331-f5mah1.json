  "text": "Ok, this is starting to manifest into a big doubt for me for some reason. My best friend and I have known each other since seventh grade, and she's pretty much the only friend I've had who never grinds my gears at all. We really get each other, she's amazing, and though we have our differences we've always respected each other and have never really fought even once. We're both going to the same university and moving away from home and we decided early on that it'd be cool to get a double room together because it's cheaper and we'll have each other at least for freshman year. We're about to submit our residence applications and we already hashed out our top building choices and everything. \n\nThe hopeful idea I have is that since we're in different faculties it's very likely we'll make new friends separately anyway, and we actually talked about not being worried because we're both pretty independent people. \n\nBut now, for some reason, a seed of doubt has been planted. What if I can't make any other friends? What if she makes friends, but I don't? Or what if we make friends together, but I'd prefer to hang out with one of those people by myself? What happens when I want some real, actual alone time? Shouldn't this be my time to become independent? I've always been the kind of person who loves being around people, but I definitely need my reflective time alone at the end of the day. I keep reading threads about friendships ruined by being too close for comfort in university, but I wonder if my fear is just coming from a total wariness toward the newness of the whole situation when it might actually turn out fine. \n\nI'd really appreciate any advice. At this point it's a little bit late to tell her I don't want to room with her, and I think deep down I still do want to room with her, it's just overwhelming.  Anything helps!",

      "text": "You both need to agree that your friendship is important to you and that keeping that friendship intact will require open, honest, direct and constructive nonjudgmental conversations.  Living with each other is a new experience for both of you, it will have its ups and downs but real communication will help keep the friendship together. After the first year really evaluate how living together impacted your friendship and decide if you want to live together again.",

My friend since 8th grade turned out really bad because I let her walk all over me, but my next roommate who I knew since 5th grade was amazing, because I learned to not let her do the same",
