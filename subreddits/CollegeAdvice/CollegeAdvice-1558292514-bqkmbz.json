More competitive schools often have larger endowments and can often offer a better financial aid package. They may also be able to provide better support if you're in a challenging situation regarding legal status or finances. Unfortunately, first gen students and students of color are often talked out of applying to schools they would be able to get into because the student doesn't fit the counselor's idea of what that sort of student looks like. If you suspect your counselor is doing this, get a second opinion or request a new counselor if possible. \n\nAlso, do not be afraid to ask for fee waivers for applications - that is what they're there for.  If you're applying to several schools, it adds up quickly, especially given all the other expenses of being a senior (graduation, SAT, etc.). If you politely explain that you're excited about the school and would be a great fit for x reasons, but the fee presents an obstacle for your family given your financial situation, they should help you.", "author": "mimosastclair", "created": 1559416525, "upvotes": 1}, "eo5rgnp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bqkmbz/latinos_on_the_college_path/eo5rgnp/", "text": "That there are tons of scholarships that you automatically qualify for simply because you aren't white.", "author": "agent-doge", "created": 1558302300, "upvotes": 1}}}
