I\u2019m kind of desperate too.\n\nI\u2019m having trouble focusing in classes and in self studying and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m losing motivation, constantly.\n\nMy dad managed to get me into a top-ish engineering university abroad, and from the first week I told myself I was going to concentrate in lectures, study and practice everyday and never fall behind. I was gonna join societies and have tons of fun. I made like two friends the first day too, acting like someone I wasn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t want it to be like high-school again. But now I\u2019m a month in and I can\u2019t even motivate myself to go to classes anymore. To even get up.\n\nI might as well try to describe it; I get into the first lecture and try to listen to what the guy\u2019s saying, but then like 5 minutes later I\u2019ve realized that none of it is actually going into my head, I was just listening to sounds, not words. I\u2019m trying to read the board but I feel like I\u2019m looking at pictures, not numbers. I can\u2019t follow along quickly enough with the math examples at all, which makes studying later a nightmare. It\u2019s always been like this but this time, I had no excuses as to why it was happening. It\u2019s like someone turned my memory into an old film reel and just cut out a long piece from the center. It just disappears. And if I lose one piece I can\u2019t figure out the rest. At the end of the day it feels like I just wasted my time.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I tried. I tried not to take notes, but I still zone out. And if I try to take notes I still manage to zone out and copy whatever\u2019s on the board. I don\u2019t read them later either. It\u2019s just my first year and I got no intentions of dropping out but, I\u2019m kinda lost. I already feel like I know what\u2019s gonna happen. Everyday I think I\u2019ve got the answer; \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just read the PowerPoint notes before the lecture, maybe that\u2019ll help with memory retention.\u201d or \u201cHey maybe I\u2019ll just forget about background info, sit and practice some of the problems and maybe learn better that way.\u201d But I can\u2019t even read a textbook anymore without feeling heavy and thinking of my other problems. \nMan in university they don\u2019t give you any specific instructions on what to do and how to do it.\n\nUsually, I love learning math, I love physics, I\u2019m hella interested in engineering and on my own, I get it. Looking into different engines and systems and robots online, it\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s always been different in academics. I can never study nowadays? It\u2019s so hard to describe, I always try to sit down and work on a problem and like 2 seconds later I\u2019m feeling bored and I can\u2019t focus. This straight up sounds like the shittiest thing to complain about but guys, it\u2019s been 4 weeks of this. Nothing is fun anymore.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve got no one to talk to, it\u2019s a class of 200+ kids, I practically don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not like I could explain it anyway, I suck at speaking my mind. Took a while to write this, it might be kinda long. Sorry.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I suck it up and talk to someone? Suck it up and study? Any tips on how? \nMy parents have always been counting on me to be the reliable one since my other siblings have ADHD and can\u2019t even fold their socks.\n\nThey\u2019re counting on me but I just want to disappear now.", "author": "highschoolshthead", "created": 1572547657, "retrieved": 1632960429, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f62eukh": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dpryjm/cant_focus_in_college_and_i_have_no_one/f62eukh/", "text": "Hey, this sounds really hard. Genuinely, I'm super sorry you're struggling. Transitioning to college is difficult in many ways, and some people have a harder time than others. I'm going to second what some other people have said in here - go and talk to a counselor (I would go to an academic and a health counselor) and tell them all this. Read this exact post if you think you might have trouble articulating yourself in the moment! But the important part of going and talking is to get advice and *support*. No one will be able to help you if they don't know what's happening - so if you have to \"suck it up\" to share this, I highly encourage you to do so. \n\nIn the times where I've struggled (for a minute, a day, a month), getting support (from either my family or my academic counselor) is one of the only things that has helped me get through it. Often I need a different perspective and outside commentary. There is *no shame* in seeking help (for anything!!). Life can be really damn hard. There is *no* reason to do it all alone.", "author": "eleniray", "created": 1572658225, "upvotes": 1}, "f5yijyd": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dpryjm/cant_focus_in_college_and_i_have_no_one/f5yijyd/", "text": "Go to school counselor or health clinic and explain so you can get directed to where you can be diagnosed. It sounds like some form of attention deficit disorder or something similar and there might be medication or advice for how to deal with it.   Also, see if you can join or start some study groups.   Another thing might be to see if you can talk to an academic advisor.   Usually students are assigned one. That person might give you advice on school resources.
