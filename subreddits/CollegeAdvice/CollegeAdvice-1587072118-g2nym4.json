  "text": "I had chosen MSU as my school, but they didn\u2019t give me any scholarships or enough financial aid to cover the costs. And coming from a large family, it\u2019s too expensive to take care of so I will no longer be able to go to that school.\n\nSo now it\u2019s between LSU (Louisiana) and University of Bridgeport (Connecticut)\nLSU is one of many large, elite and prestigious schools in the US and offer a wide range of diverse English and film programs (my major). I also like the dorms, campus, and food options \nI plan to do gymnastics, so I\u2019m currently contacting coaches from the team (D1) and I am waiting for a response \n\nBridgeport is much smaller and closer to home and relatives, and I was given a big scholarship to cover most of tuition. They have a D2 team and I\u2019ve been given a spot on the team. I like the atmosphere and classes, however programs aren\u2019t as diverse \n\nBoth schools are very nice to me, but which should I choose?",
