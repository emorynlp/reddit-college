I'm not even taking much away from my classes, once I pass them I just forget everything about them and I frankly am just doing enough work to get by with a passing mark. I have the money and ability to go to school and that is why I thought I would be a good path, but over the last year or two I've learned that is not the case. I don't really know what I want to do but I have a decent job so maybe pick up a few extra shifts and start trying new things. Anyone else in this situation I would love to hear your thoughts and how you handled it. \n\nI'm open to vocational schooling but honestly I don't think traditional school is my thing. I do actually love work and I have held a full time job for 5~ years. I just don't know what to do!", "author": null, "created": 1574006051, "retrieved": 1632848765, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f7ub8df": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dxo5ug/mostly_a_rant_but_advice_appreciated/f7ub8df/", "text": "Same here, I'm a senior in high school and I really feel like college is overrated.
