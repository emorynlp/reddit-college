The school I'm going to is five and a half to six hours away from my home so it's not like I can run home easily and grab something if I need it. What are the main things I should plan to bring with me when I move in to make the process easier and help me feel less stressed. Any advice is helpful, thanks!", "author": "cgm725", "created": 1586933417, "retrieved": 1632960391, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"fngpezv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g1ms6h/college_essentials/fngpezv/", "text": "I'm in the same boat!! I've asked around and what I've got are pretty essential and MUST HAVES.\n\nDrugs (jk jk, i mean Tylenol, Picot, Alkazelter, Peptobismol, Midol, the general over-the-counter, feel better remedies you can get at Walmart) \n\nPads/tampons (if you have a period; if not, duh, skip this) \n\nTissues\nThermometer\nPassport ( just in case) \nExtra money \nInsurance card\nEmergency Contacts \nSafe (to put important docs in) \n\nThese are some of the absolute, no-doubt-about-it necessities. Some stuff I have now+will get later include:\n\nTowels\nBed set (usually Twin XL)\nBath caddy (ones with multiple pockets) \nFoldable laundry basket with lid\nReading pillow (just cuz) \n\nDefinitely bring pictures of your family at home, cuz you'll miss them. Bring any other important documents that you think you'll need. \n\nTheres a ton more, but those are some I could come ip with. There's a ton of sites online that say way more stuff!! I suggest going hunting for those haha", "author": "SeparateKey0", "created": 1586940063, "upvotes": 3}}}
