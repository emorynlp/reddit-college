  "text": "I missed my college algebra exam. I am devastated at the fact that I just stayed up all night studying for my exam only to figure out my final was two days ago. The only silver lining is that, according to my calculations, I passed the class with a C. However I am still balling my eyes out at the fact that I was so dumb to miss it. Any advice?",

      "text": "Number one thing when you miss a final is go there as fast as you can, dont just lay back in bed and say oh well cause then hell just think your a slacker who missed the final. Showing up late is better than not at all and he might be able to offer you a make up in his office for the next hour. Its harder for teachers to make up a test that passed than one that's just finished.",

      "text": "Try talking to your professor. They might let you make it up, they might not. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.  If not, maybe ask them to lower your grade so you can be eligible to retake the course and get the grade you know you can earn and just learn from this experience. It sucks, i know but you just gotta move on and become more organized. ",
