Are there any majors that you guys wished you studied? if it helps, I'm planning on going to ucla.

I decided to go down this route because one of my passions in life is soccer and I wanted to coach. However, I took my first science class in college and realized it wasn\u2019t for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I hated it, but it wasn\u2019t my strongest subject. If I felt that way with general Biology, imagine what I would feel when the science classes became more complicated.\n\nI took a step back and analyzed my strengths and passions. I continue to be passionate about soccer, science (even though it\u2019s a weakness for me), philosophy, teaching, and much more. Yet, I also looked at my academic strengths. One of those strengths is English. I pick it up quite easily and I also enjoy writing. As of now, my major is English and I\u2019m debating whether I\u2019ll be a college professor or a soccer journalist. ", "author": "MonkeYoda", "created": 1548080895, "upvotes": 1}}}
