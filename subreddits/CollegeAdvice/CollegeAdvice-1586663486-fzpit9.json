So I originally applied to go into their selective Cosmetic and Fragrance marketing major, as it is a bachelor\u2019s program I dreamed of going into. I\u2019m currently in their broad business/buying/operations bachelor\u2019s program called Fashion Business Management. I got into the Cos program but I guess I\u2019m afraid of job prospects for the most part. I want to be able to go into either fashion or beauty fluidly if I so choose. I\u2019m conflicted because I wanted to be in the Cos program for so long, like I said before it was my dream. But as I have matured over the years I\u2019ve been rethinking it. I guess I just need reassurance or someone\u2019s outside advice before I register for classes? Sorry if this is all over the place, just a nervous wreck lol.", "author": "Callmedewberry", "created": 1586663486, "retrieved": 1632848316, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
