I'm entering my first year of community college but with low math.. Like mediocre math.  I was the type of student in high school that didn't care and took math but didn't pass due to me being a typical rebel till my junior year I took financial math which is sort of useless, on to my senior year I didn't do math.  Now I took my placement test and scored low.  And I'm a smart kid just made bad choices,  and I know my major(software engineer). I know the requirements, but just the fact I scored low just makes me feel disappointed. If I do everything correct these two years I'll be transferring with calculas to the University I want. But just need advice how do I cope with this issue.", "author": null, "created": 1437790963, "retrieved": 1632849528, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"cvckxzx": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/3eipdn/need_some_advice_and_please_be_harsh/cvckxzx/", "text": "Messing up is part of life and I wouldn't be so down on it. You've acknowledged that you made a mistake so you can now work towards the goal of transferring. I have a family friend who was in a similar situation and their parents found a website called schoolinks.com where they were able to talk to a college consultant and get advice on how to transfer as soon as possible and in good academic standings. just know you're not alone and many people go through this!", "author": "peter_stevenson", "created": 1443105646, "upvotes": 0}, "ctfgdgz": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/3eipdn/need_some_advice_and_please_be_harsh/ctfgdgz/", "text": "How do you cope with having to take math?  You were an idiot but you're not going to be an idiot anymore.  You're going to take the math classes, study super hard including extra help after class and you're going to pass.  \n\nIt's going to take time and effort and you're probably going to miss out on some cool stuff but that's OK because you're trying to reach a long term goal.
