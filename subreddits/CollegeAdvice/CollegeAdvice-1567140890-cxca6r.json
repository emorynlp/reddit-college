Now I have a 2.78 GPA, but want to get a master's degree in Public Health. I have contemplated taking additional courses to raise my GPA, but, financially speaking, it makes much more sense to take on a 2nd degree. In order to get the 2nd degree, I would need about another 30hrs, give or take, given I choose epidemiology or public health. I am currently applying for public health internships and looking to set a date to take the GRE with enough prep time. I guess my question is, should I take my chances and apply for an MPH that has lower GPA standards or raise my GPA just for the security of it? The thing to me is the time and money. Or, maybe, would just using my degree and working upwards from an internship a better idea? Any other suggestions?\n\nedit: If you're wondering why the GPA is so low, I have one word: sciences", "author": "TheRowdiest", "created": 1567140890, "retrieved": 1632848864, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
