  "text": "So, here's the situation:\n\nI'm a senior in high school. I did not do terrible but I also did not do that great on my SATs. I have applied to one college so far, a college I don't really want to attend. You see, my school has dual credit courses with a small community college an hour away from town. I have taken so many of those courses and done pretty well. I am only three classes away from getting an Associates of Arts degree, BUT my counselors are pushing universities on me. My original plan was to take one year at the community college to finish my Associates and then go to a university in a big city. I can't imagine just running straight to a huge university coming from a small town. Would my original plan work? \n\nAdditional info:\nI was never involved in any clubs, this year I'm joining a business program and theatre\nI will need financial aid\nI'm planning on pursuing a Marketing degree at (hopefully) an A&M uni ",
