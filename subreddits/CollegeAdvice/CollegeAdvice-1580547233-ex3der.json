The games are fun in general, but I really am not benefitting too much from being in pep band. For me, the biggest problem is that there is essentially no social community. People just show up to games and rehearsals and leave. No organized events, socials, etc. This makes getting to know anyone outside your section impossible, and even within my section none of us are really close at all. Also, a lot of people are in marching band, so a lot of people know each other from there which makes it even more difficult to make friends.\n\nThis is a class you have to sign up for, so you have to go to each rehearsal and game that you have been assigned to, or your grade will really suffer. This is another problem. The first year I did it, it was alright to deal with, but this wasn't the case recently. This past semester, I had to REALLY drag myself to go to the games I was assigned to, and this felt like a big red flag. Now, I was in severe depression last semester due to a lot of things going on in my life, so I am sure that was a contributing factor. Usually, there are about 2-3 games a week and the band rehearses once a week, so it is a fair time commitment.\n\nEssentially, the pros are that I really enjoy playing my instrument and the games can be a fun atmosphere to be at. The cons are the lack of social life/community, and that you are forced to go to everything you have been assigned to. These two cons are a great problem because it really impedes on my ability to meet new people. Since it is my last semester, I have been really wanting to join some orgs, but pep band conflicts with most of the meeting times. Since band does not provide me with any social benefit and is preventing me from attending other events where I can make friends, this could potentially be a huge problem.\n\nI am very conflicted. Since it is my last semester, this will be my last opportunity to be in pep band. If I leave, I fear that I will really regret leaving since I will never have the opportunity to experience it again. At the same time though, I mentioned many concerns where leaving could be the best option.\n\nThanks for reading!", "author": "tacotaco87", "created": 1580547233, "retrieved": 1632848348, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fg6ibiy": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ex3der/not_sure_if_i_want_to_keep_participating_in_pep/fg6ibiy/", "text": "In your case, I\u2019d lean towards quitting. You can sill play instruments on your own (I don\u2019t do band or any of that so I could be saying something misleading). I had a friend who was in band but was just getting depressed from it and when she quit she didn\u2019t regret it. I think you should take your last HS semester to wind down and spend that band time doing something else. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t play in a college band. \n\nSorry I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in a band so my suggestion may not be the most reliable\n\nGood luck bro", "author": "WpandaReddit", "created": 1580568745, "upvotes": 2}}}
