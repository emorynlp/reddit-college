The only reason she didn\u2019t go to my school was because there isn\u2019t any apartments around and she refuses to live in dorms even though there is private ones. So her boyfriend who is not in school is moving to whatever city she chooses to go to school in and they are getting an apartment. I think it\u2019s a bad idea because not living on campus your freshman year , especially if your from out of state probably will make it harder to make friends on campus and you will probably barely have campus life. I talked to her mom and her mom told me that if she live in dorms that was willing to pay for the remaining amount of tuition but she\u2019s not paying rent for an apartment and bills if a guy is living in there. I also agreed with her on that because that means my friend would have to be a full time student and work part time and if that\u2019s not enough full time. Working and doing a bunch of homework and living with your significant other all in one year? Your first year of college! That\u2019s too much stress ? unnecessary stress when your mom was willing to pay for your schooling. What can I tell her? I haven\u2019t talked to her about the living situation because I honestly just don\u2019t know what to say. I like the boyfriend but all that  going on while she is in school seems like a lot ", "author": "asimon1730", "created": 1530206823, "retrieved": 1632849456, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
