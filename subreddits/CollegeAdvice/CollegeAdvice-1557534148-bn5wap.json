First time in my life.", "text": "I've seen a lot of posts about failing a semester, but thats usually your freshman one.\n\nJust some things to know about me:\n\nAttendance is never a problem. I always show up when I can. If I'm sick or having life problems happened to me day, I take one day off. Max 2 per class. Unless I windup in the hospital kinda thing. Either way, I email my profs.\n\nI always participate. Sometimes I hold it in because I'm in the only one in class participating. It's just natural for me to answer a question or say something. I'm not scared.\n\nI only work weekends and I made sure doesn't interfere. Understanding boss who lets me take a day off for exams.\n\nI'm afraid. I signed up to be an English major. And up to this point I did well. A's and B's.\n\nMy last semster was nothing but lit classes. Should be heaven. The lectures were.\nExcept for the grades on my papers. In two of my classes my professor's failed me. Bad grammar, terrible logic, etc. So I took their written comments, went to the writing center. And got a mix of tutors. Some were helpful but high demand, so I rarely got to see them. Others would bitch about the professor or assignment when I mentioned and basically wasted my 25 min.\nSo I decided to just not even bother with the writing center unless I needed it.\nWrote more papers. Failed again. Went to office hours.\nMy first professor tried to push me in the right direction. Asked me what I was doing, to give myself more time etc. He also admitted to our class, his class was hard and he rarely gives out A's. And I wasn't thw only sturggling, 50% of us had low grades in his class.\nMy second professor said she couldn't be bothered to comment on my paper because it didn't meet the exact page count. I asked kindly if she could at least critique my thought process, ideas, whatever. She gave me a flat out no. And to do better next time.\n\nNow I'm so caught up with these two classes that I miss the deadline for the one lit course I'm excelling at. And I had to talk to that professor about writing advice, since the first two were just not beimg straight with me.\nShe was the only one who gave me something helpful and I felt terrible because I didnt write the paper for her class.\n\nSo now my hands are tied, my confidence is crippled, I have failed a semester fighting to catch up... And a D is the what I get it the end.\nAnd I'm paralyzed now. I'm scared because I'm wondering wtf am I doing? How is it that now I'm bad at what I thought was my strength?  This semster just.... Was not a fun learning experience. It was bitter. My first retakes.\nBut my bigger problem is... If this isnt my strength, my major... What am I good at?\n\nI need advice, especially from Eng. Majors/minors on how to confront my failure? Was there more that I could do?\nI know next time I need to stay on top of my deadlines.\nBut... The writing is just killing me. I'm afraid I don't know how to write college essays or how to start.", "author": "SammyDroid", "created": 1557534148, "retrieved": 1632960443, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"en2txj7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bn5wap/failed_a_senior_semester_first_time_in_my_life/en2txj7/", "text": "Don't let your experiences of this past semester get you down. As you noticed, people in academia all have very different opinions on how to write the same thing, which is cause for confusion. \n\nMaybe over the summer, to get back into the rhythm of writing, you could try giving yourself some mini writing assignments for practice. If you want to practice literature writing, read something you enjoy and then write about your thoughts on it. This could be a short story, if you want to start on the smaller side, or you could read a news article and write current events on it. The important thing is to keep writing. \n\nIf you want to adjust your writing method for the next year, I would go back and look at your professors' comments on your essays again and try to categorize them. Were their comments mostly about grammar/spelling/mechanics, sentence structure or wording choice, organization of points, or your analysis of the literature? Tally them up to get an idea of what areas they felt you most needed to improve upon. I would then go back to some of your papers from previous semesters and compare the categories of these comments against those of the previous papers. It may be that your professors just had very different expectations for the content and the approach of your papers this past semester, and that you had a difficult time figuring out what they were looking for.\n\nI can't say much more without reading your essays specifically, but I agree that using time management to work with your deadlines will help in the future. Anxiety can quickly set in the closer to your deadline that you start writing, which can lead to less editing time and therefore more grammatical/spelling errors and difficulties in organization and analysis. For getting started early, one thing I recommend from my fiction writing classes is to just write the first draft down, as early as possible. It doesn't have to be good, or anything at all. It just needs to exist. Take a little time away from that draft, allow your thoughts and perspective to shift, and then come back to it. Don't set any expectations for your first draft, other than that you wrote it and that you wrote it early. Then use what you wrote as a springboard to edit much before you need to turn in the final essay. I'm not sure how this may fit into your already-existing method of writing, but switching up your methods may spark some inspiration as well.", "author": "writingoreos", "created": 1557540575, "upvotes": 1}, "en2pgl4": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bn5wap/failed_a_senior_semester_first_time_in_my_life/en2pgl4/", "text": "English major here!\n\nI've had some nightmare professors who made office hours a total waste of time, but I've also had some wonderful professors. So, don't feel like your experience going to the professor was unique to you or that other students don't also have frustrating professors. And, for the professor that you're excelling with-- honestly, do not sweat it. Try to talk to them to explain the situation and get help from them if they seem supportive, but do not feel guilty missing one paper for them. I'm going into my last semester and have had to ask for way more extensions/a lot more help this semester than ever before. \n\nTry to connect with students in your classes. That's the best advice I can give if office hours and the writing center aren't working for you. I know I've been in a class where the professor failed every single one of us on the first paper of the semester. The kicker was that this was a class exclusively for English + creative writing majors, so you can imagine how high the anxiety was after we all got handed that F. After that, we all banded together to help each other out. I remember getting my first good grade from that professor, and letting people take pictures of my work so they could see what kind of formatting actually worked for him. If you sense that someone in your classes 'gets it', try to connect with them. \n\nWith the humanities, always keep in mind that there is no objective 'right' answer. Sometimes, you're just trying to figure out your professor's personal preferences. Hell, ask them for a sample paper of what they want if they seem down.\n\nOf course, continue making it a priority to talk to your professors and go to the writing center (esp. the professors, because sometimes they are more generous with help when they see a student is working hard/they know who you are because you've actually spoken to them).", "author": "thoreaulymodern", "created": 1557537880, "upvotes": 1}}}
