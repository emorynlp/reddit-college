And I hate it. My classes are difficult even with tutoring. My intro classes for Econ was basically theory with simple math, but these intermediate and advanced classes are basically Calculus level courses. And while I can do math, I'm not the biggest fan of it. I managed to pass with a c- in one of the major classes and a D in the other major class I'm taking, but I do not enjoy this. Plus, my GPA and my scholarship that's the reason I'm at this school is on dangerous ground after this semester. I might lose it if bad grades in Econ continue to happen.\n\nI am an Econ major due to seeing the potential job and career opportunities in the field but I don't really want to do this as a life job and potentially losing my scholarship. I was thinking of switching to Liberal Arts major like Political Science, International Affairs or History. But I don't know if a stable job can come from that. Honestly, I'm just confused at this point. If anyone could advice or give some insight on the career opportunities on the three majors I mentioned, that would be great. I want to graduate as soon as possible, but my difficulties in major and switching has me stumped.", "author": "RestInZyzz", "created": 1578085847, "retrieved": 1632848472, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fd6w7pp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ejltle/should_i_switch_my_major_to_political_science_or/fd6w7pp/", "text": "Hello! I double majored in Political Science and Global Studies when I was in undergraduate school and am currently a semester away from a Master's degree in Political Science with a focus on International Relations. \n\nPolitical Science can have a lot of math and calculations, depending on whether or not your school is a research based institute. If it is not, then I say go for Political Science. If you like reading a lot, International Affairs and History can be exciting! \n\nIf you would like some further advice, my sister and I recently started a YouTube channel. Our first video is on picking which college to go to, but we will shortly cover the topics of choosing majors, scholarships, and I will talk about jobs in the field (plus we'll have some other short fun videos on completely unrelated topics). \n\nFor jobs in these three fields, it depends. Many people continue their education by obtaining a Masters, Ph.D. or going to law school. I currently have two part time jobs (but remember, I'm a full time graduate student) working at a law firm AND I work in an archive. The archive job is my favorite and is a LOT of fun. If you like old things and mysteries (we have some homicide records) it is literally the coolest job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope it works out for you!  and here is a link to our channel if you are interested in getting more advice [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqLiEIaUPy-RCSQPM2AEUQg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqLiEIaUPy-RCSQPM2AEUQg)", "author": "annabananafeefifoefa", "created": 1578196505, "upvotes": 1}}}
