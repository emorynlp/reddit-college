I graduated high school this past August however basically did no preparation for college, no applications but did take the SAT scored like a 1300 and had straight A\u2019s and B\u2019s across the board in high school.  I know it\u2019s January now and most colleges have their registration deadlines early to mid January, should I just submit my applications now and what should I do about scholarships (got no guidance whatsoever from school guidance counselors lol).  Any input or advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
