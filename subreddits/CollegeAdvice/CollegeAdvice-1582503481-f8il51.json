  "text": "Hello, I'm (21M) so stressed over it. Any suggestion would help! I'm a college student studying architecture and I have already applied for Fall 2020 transfer to several universities. As right now, I'm still waiting on the acceptance, but I'm not sure what to choose.For some more context, I'm an international student studying in California and I've been in college since 2018. I want to spend max 7 yrs in school and graduate with a bachelor (B.S) in architecture. I have applied to 4 state colleges including UCLA, UCB, Cal Poly Pomona, and other private schools like Cooper Union, Sci-Arc, Woodbury.\n\nSO the situation right now is I got accepted to Cal poly Pomona, which is my safe school. But I'm not very keen about it. SO if I didnt get in anywhere else reasonable, should I Transfer to Cal Poly or apply again next year? It's killing me mad and dragging me down. Should I risk or just go with it?",

      "text": "One advantage of Cal Poly is that it is a pretty good school at a very good price.  I\u2019m not sure what your expected family contribution is, but the Cal State schools are generally a good deal.    If a school you like better accepts you later, you could choose that instead.  But Cal Poly is respectable.",

          "text": "Thanks for your time ! I do think cal poly is a very good school. I have been on campus and spent time on campus cuz I have friends in Cal Poly, but I'm just not a very big fan of their approach in architecture major. So, I'm debating is the difference between other schools like UCs worth reapplying?",

              "text": "Hmmm.  Im not that familiar w the programs, but i am sure they are competitive to get in.   If you get into a school you like better, then obviously go there.  If you don\u2019t, then assess whether you can realistically improve your application.  If so, then maybe risk it.  If not, then go w Cal Poly.  It is a well respected school.",
