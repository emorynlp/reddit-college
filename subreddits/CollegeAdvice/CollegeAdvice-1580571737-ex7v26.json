The only problem is that I did not do well second quarter this year. Like really bad. My weighted GPA for this quarter is an 85.5- I got a 67 in my bio class.

      "text": "From what I know, colleges know and expect senior year to be harder. There is no reason for them to accept someone and then go back on their word because you had harder classes.  It looks better to them if you challenged yourself than if you took fluff classes like half of all seniors do just for an easier year.",

          "text": "Exactly this. Ask for extra credit, extensions for assignments, if there are assignments you can redo\u2014anything you can think of\u2014and explain why. You\u2019ll be doing this in college, too, my friend. I don\u2019t know if a single person who has attended college who hasn\u2019t had to ask for such things. Life happens. It\u2019s ok. Put yourself out there now and you won\u2019t feel as awkward the next time you may have to do it.",
