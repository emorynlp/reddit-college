If I miss a question, usually I can think it through and figure out what my mistake was, but for this course it seems like they just love to put inconsequential details that will ever so slightly change the meaning of answers. One question had answer choices that were all the same, but one answer choice said, \"...do well in academics\" and the other said \"...do well in the educational system.\" I asked what the difference was and never got a clear reply. This is a psych class, btw. \n\nFor that matter, I have never gotten a clear reply on ANY question I have sent the prof. The response is always \"read the book.\" I sent a question that started something like, \"After reviewing this section in the book I still have a question about .....\" and her reply was \"You will learn it better if you read the book.\" Is she just sending out form letters?  I asked about our upcoming midterm and if the test questions would be about the same difficulty level as the quiz questions have been, was told that she couldn't answer because the \"test bank has over 500 questions in it .\" To say the least, I am GD frustrated. During the first week of the class I started a word document to write down all of these things like this so that I can include it in the eval at the end. (Other info, I already have a master's degree and am only taking this low-level class because a program that I'm thinking of applying to requires the credit. I teach as well and ALWAYS answer student questions. ) \n\nI've been considering filing a complaint, but think that might be a bad idea before the course is over.
