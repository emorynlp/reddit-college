  "text": "When I started school, I admit i jumped the gun and got involved in too many things, one of them is some workers' association. They invited me to a Sunday orientation and I initially said yes because I didnt want to make them mad or whatever.\n\nBut today I called them and told them life happened and I can't make it (I'm working on more important things in college. To me at least. I'm barely keeping it together with what I'm already doing). They tried so hard to keep me in, but I just kept saying I couldn't. \n\nThey got all pissy and said \"bye have a nice day\" in this really passive aggressive tone.\n\nIs this normal experience in college?",
