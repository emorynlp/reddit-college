  "text": "I am a 19 year old sophomore in University, and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with myself.\nI'm currently a Geology major, but I'm considering either changing to Geography, taking a break from college, or dropping out altogether. I have absolutely no idea as to what I want to do with my life. However I do know that I do not what to be stuck at a desk in an office every day. Such a job would kill me as a person.\nThat's one of the reasons why I have majored in Geology: I won't be stuck at a desk all the time, I'd get to travel, and I do find certain areas of Geology interesting. However after taking the Gen Chem course at my uni I've basically been weeded out. I'm no longer sure that Geology is the route I want to take anymore but I can't really see myself being happy with anything else as far as careers are concerned.\nI'm considering Geography because I really like cultures and people and society as well as basically all sciences and seeing how everything relates to one another, and while I'm not super crazy about maps I know they are highly useful tools and I can see myself more or less enjoying making them. I do know there is much more to Geography though. However I'm incredibly worried about careers. I know that if I get a GIS cert I would be fairly employable, especially if I learn how to program. But I'm worried I'd get stuck at a desk with pretty much any career Geography would lead me to.\nCurrently I could take a break from school for a while and work, get some practical experience with the real world under my belt, and then go back once I know what I want to do.\nOr I could just quit uni and go to trade school. I've lightly researched this and nothing has piqued my interest quite yet, but I can see myself enjoying a trade career.\nBeing at this crossroads has me absolutely paralyzed with anxiety. Going to school gives me anxiety, changing my major gives me anxiety, and leaving (temporarily or permanently) gives me anxiety. I just don't know what to do and any advice would be helpful.",

      "text": "I hated my arts course in Australia and took a break for a semester. Best decision I ever made. Found a full time job I enjoy, decided to travel a little bit, saved up some money too. The freedom is astounding. \n\nMore importantly though it made it clear to me that my course wasn\u2019t right- and I\u2019m now enrolled at law school. There\u2019s no rush to get your degree, especially if you aren\u2019t 100% about it.",
