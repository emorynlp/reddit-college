The deal is pretty decent. \n\nI\u2019m a little apprehensive though, because I\u2019ll be 24 at the time and I\u2019ve heard a majority of those living on campus are fairly young. \n\nShould I look for accomodation off campus instead? Or is 24 not \u2018too old\u2019?\n\nResponses would be so so so appreciated :)) thank you", "author": "vnovakovic000", "created": 1586899887, "retrieved": 1632960460, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fnf5488": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g1ec5q/college_at_24/fnf5488/", "text": "Eh sure college kids are generally a bit younger but I wouldn\u2019t let it deter you it\u2019ll be fine.", "author": "stefanfolk", "created": 1586901572, "upvotes": 3}}}
