I'm at a dilemna. I dont know if I should major in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation (or something similar) or in Managerial Economics (basically Davis' business major for undergrad). I want to have my own education learning program specializing in the sciences. I don't want to double major but I'm also afraid of taking a minor in one won't be enough. So which would be better to self study while I'm still in high school? Science? Or business?", "author": "krecile", "created": 1550997400, "retrieved": 1632849223, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eh6okbl": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/au63v4/which_is_better_to_selfstudy/eh6okbl/", "text": "I\u2019m no professional but science is pretty easy to study on your own with stuff like Kahn academy and all that.
