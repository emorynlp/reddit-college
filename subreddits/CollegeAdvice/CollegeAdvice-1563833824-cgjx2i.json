The plan is for me to go to community college, join ROTC, and preferably seek a career with the FBI/CIA/Department of State using my foreign language major upon completing service in the Air Force. If that doesn't work, I plan on seeking work as an interpreter or something (to be honest I dont have much of a plan B, I just want to work overseas).\n\nHowever, I don't know what language I want to choose. Arabic is an extremely sought-after language, from what I've heard, and being able to speak it would be very useful for any kind of government job. However, I'm personally more interested in Chinese-- I've always wanted to learn it, and I'm learning Japanese right now so I know I have the dedication to do so. Should I just stick to one, or is there a way I can do both without bogging myself down in debt for classes? Any suggestions would be appreciated!", "author": null, "created": 1563833824, "retrieved": 1632848908, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eui67cd": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cgjx2i/major_in_arabic_or_chinese_or_can_i_do_both/eui67cd/", "text": "Those are two different languages on the language tree. My advice is pick one, but head over to r/languagelearning and get their advice before you do. College is not very good at teaching languages, you'll need outside resources to supplement the grammar the college system focuses on. Both of these languages are in demand, China more so for economic reasons, so I think you would be fine either way.\n\nAlso if you want to try them both out, I recommend your state's electronic library system, some of them have free language learning programs.", "author": "roguepen", "created": 1563841219, "upvotes": 1}}}
