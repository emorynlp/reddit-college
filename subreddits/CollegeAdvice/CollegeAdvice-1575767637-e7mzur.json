      "text": "It seems like you\u2019re looking at different pieces of data. Schools post their tuition and estimated cost of attendance (tuition + room & board) on their website. Now, these numbers can be very different from the average cost paid by students which accounts for scholarships and financial aid. To get an accurate idea of what you\u2019ll pay, you\u2019d have to go through the process of applying for financial aid at any given school.",
