This year I received enough financial aid (grants/scholarships not loans) to cover my full tuition which was around 13k, I did not have to accept any loans due to living with my parents but keep in mind that I filed on fafsa as living with my parents. This upcoming year my cost of attendance is estimated at 27k, I filed my fafsa forms listed as \"off-campus\" instead of \"living with parents\" and received grants/scholarships at around 16k, which will cover my tuition. Housing is estimated at 10k and I also received 10k in loans I could accept. So my question is, if I filed under living with my parents would I receive less grants? I am trying to figure out my best option. In my point of view, it could potentially be better if I lived off-campus if I got a full time job in the summer and saved up money for housing so I could accept all of my grants for tuition and only have to accept little to no loans for housing. I just want as little student debt as possible but I also want to move closer to campus because I definitely feel living at home and an hour away from campus is somewhat hindering my involvement to school. I am a first gen college student and would love any input from more experienced or knowledgeable students/graduates. If you have any questions in order to help answer mine please feel free to ask. \n\nThanks again for your time!", "author": "drake_nguyen", "created": 1580608832, "retrieved": 1632960353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
