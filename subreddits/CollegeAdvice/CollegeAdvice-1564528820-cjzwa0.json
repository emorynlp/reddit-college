I dropped out before finishing my first year, I wanted to make sure I had a clearer bath before barreling into school (what I actually mean is I got lost in Amazon\u2019s turbines & forgot about my own life for 4 years). After much thought I believe I want to get my Masters in Social Work, Bachelors in Business & minor in Psychology or Counseling. The ideas of Social Worker- my high school plan was Social Worker for CPS- High School Counselor, General Counselor or Accountant Manager sound appealing.\n\nAll that being said, I have no idea what that means. If I was to look for Community Colleges, what should I be looking for or what would my aims be? Just get general associates degree in....?? I\u2019m a lost cookie and it has been a long long road to even come to these conclusions. I am working on getting my transcript already to see what classes I am missing but I can\u2019t talk to a school counselor if I don\u2019t know what school to proceed to.
