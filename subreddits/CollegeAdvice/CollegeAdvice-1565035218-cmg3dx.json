The junior college suggests an AA degree for someone intent on pursuing geology at a university. This feels off.

An AAS is specific to workforce. If you're planning on getting a bachelors- it's either an AA or AS.\nThe two are almost identical though, they both have the same core courses. The only difference is that with an AA, you can take any 18 hours electives vs an AS where it's 8 hours of electives, but more math and science.\n\nWe only put students in an AS if they are going into math heavy majors, meaning more than three maths needed. However, all of those math-heavy majors can still be included in the AA since electives can be made up of anything.\n\nDon't worry too much about whether it's an AA or AS. I have yet to find a university who cares which ones you have. All they care about are your grades, and for some- whether you've completed an associate's.", "author": "mayg09", "created": 1565049973, "upvotes": 1}}}
