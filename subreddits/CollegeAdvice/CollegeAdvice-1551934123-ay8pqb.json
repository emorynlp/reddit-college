I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s senioritis, being over committed, the interesting \u201cside effects\u201d of dyslexia, a poor mental state or what? But I just can not find the motivation to do my school work, to do what I gotta to do to finish strong! This is so unlike me as well. Sure we all get into funks where we don\u2019t want to do our work or are distracted by other aspects of life but this has been going on for like a month and I don\u2019t know how to shake it. So any advice from any one in a similar situation would be soooo helpful!!
