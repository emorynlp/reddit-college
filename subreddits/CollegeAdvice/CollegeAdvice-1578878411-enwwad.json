  "title:": "Need advice on a scholarship essay",
  "text": "So I am applying for a Dean's scholarship at Marquette university. The essay prompt for the application reads, \"In the tradition of our catholic and Jesuit identity, we expect our graduating students to be transformed; students will be prepared, as St. Ignatius said, '\"to set the world on fire.\"' Tell us what type of Marquette alumni you aspire to be.\" (250 words or less). I am somewhat at a loss trying to write this as I'm not really sure what exactly they are looking for. To me this prompt is very vague but I know they must be looking for some certain elements right? If it helps I'm looking at a 5 year pa program and want to eventually work in a community that faces a healthcare shortage. Like do I basically just say this or... Any advice would be much appreciated! Thanks!",

      "text": "Typically when I have heard the phrase \"set the world on fire\" in a religious context, they are talking about evangelism or spreading their faith. Since it is a Catholicism based school, they probably want to know how you will apply Catholicism to your career after college.",
