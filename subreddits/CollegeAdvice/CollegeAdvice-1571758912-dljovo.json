I just transferred to the top public school in the country after two very successful years in community college - and the transition has been a little jarring. SO many people - around on campus and in my classes - WAY more reading then I have ever had at once - and huge assignments with due dates that always seem to stack on one another. The energy here is intimidating and intense to begin with (already broke down in front of a professor, welcome to my life), and while I am thoroughly enjoying being here, my chest constantly feels tight with the number of things I have on my to-do list (that never seems to end).\n\nI'm okay with hard work. I have done it and CAN do it - but between the environment of the school and the workload - I seriously need to find some ways to deal with the constant feeling of anxiety. I can't *imagine* everyone is getting every reading done *and* the papers *and* partying every weekend (but it looks like they are?). I'm trying to find a balance between academics and social life - but I need some advice or a damn reality check to put this in perspective and be stressed every day for the next 2 years.\n\nHELP A GIRL OUT", "author": "eleniray", "created": 1571758912, "retrieved": 1632848808, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f4rzdhm": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dljovo/how_to_deal_with_the_overwhelming_feeling_of_not/f4rzdhm/", "text": "I am no expert, but my story is similar to yours. I transferred from a community college to a very prestigious 4-year university, and the transition damn near killed me. At my community college, I was taking 19 credits, and working 2 jobs with no problem. My first semester here, I could barely keep my head above water with 15 credits and nothing else. \n\nHere is the only advice I can give you, because this is what worked for me, maybe you can find some use from it. You are going to be stressed a lot, unfortunately thats just the nature of higher education, however, there are a lot of ways to deal with this. First, I would highly recommend making an appointment with your schools mental health resource department. Even if you don't struggle with clinical depression and/or anxiety, seeing a therapist can be a great way to relieve some stress, and they can often help you come up with coping mechanisms to deal with it on your own. \n\nIn terms of workload, I will be brutally honest with you: I am a double major in History and Political Science. I am in upper level courses, and usually have well over 100+ pages of reading every night of the week, in addition to discussion responses for those readings, writing papers for every class, and studying for exams. *No one* with that kind of reading workload can realistically do all of that reading the entire semester, without burning out or breaking down. What helped me overcome the enormous amounts of reading was prioritizing them, going through them and finding key quotes, main ideas, and anything else that might relate to a future exam or essay. Its still going to take time, but its manageable if you put your mind to the task. \n\nAdditionally, you should prioritize sleep whenever you can. Sometimes you might have to work or study late and thats okay, but you can't do that consistently and expect to succeed. Pulling an all nighter might get that paper done, but you're going to be useless for the whole rest of the day because you're so tired. Plan for projects, papers, and tests accordingly. Study in blocks, tackle whatever daily tasks you have, and then allocate a certain amount of time every day towards studying for an upcoming test, or writing parts of an upcoming paper. \n\nI will conclude with this: Anxiety is inevitable in College, and there are a lot of ways to deal with it, but maintaining a high level of anxiety all day, every day is not only unsustainable, its downright dangerous. When I was still transitioning during my first year, I worked myself to the point of breaking down. I lost 15 pounds in 2 months because I skipped so many meals to study. I didn't join any clubs, and made few friends, and I isolated myself to the point of near-madness. Getting good grades is great, and definitely something you should work towards, but if you don't take care of your mental health, you will not make it. Sometimes, you need to tell yourself that its okay to not do a reading assignment, because you've been working for hours on other homework and you need to get some sleep in order to be able to take on tomorrow's classes. Missing a few minor assignments won't hurt you in the long run, neglecting your mental health ABSOLUTELY will. If you ever need any more advice or support on this or anything else, don't hesitate to DM me, you're not alone in this dude.", "author": null, "created": 1571773040, "upvotes": 1}}}
