I need advice on a couple topics.  \nThe first is being I currently work and go to school full time.  I know alot of people do it and succeed.   But I'm struggling.    My hours would cut down from  40 hours to 30 hours.  Most likely be working from 11am-6pm Tuesday-Saturday.  \nI could also do split days off and alternate between classes.   I'm not sure what the best option is for that.  \nMy other concern is loosing my fasfa. I have dome medical debt that's I'm trying to pay off and I'm not sure if me working full time would affect it. And if it does, and I work less would that be better/more beneficial in the long run? I'm really stuck with all this.  \nThanks in advance.", "author": "Nikimarie44", "created": 1571877902, "retrieved": 1632961175, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
