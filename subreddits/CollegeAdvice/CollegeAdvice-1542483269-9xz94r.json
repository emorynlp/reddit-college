  "text": "I though I had my adhd and depression under control, but this first semester of college is killing me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sitting somewhere around a low D in my Chem class. I'm studying more, and I think I'll do better on the remaining couple of tests, but I don't know if it's enough to turn it around. How do I talk to my professor about this? I hate using my mental illness as an excuse, but it really is hurting me.",

They can help you if you need tutoring or have a hard time taking notes. Asking for help isnt using your disability as an excuse.",
