I\u2019ve managed to fail two classes in my first year of college.", "text": "I\u2019ve had 8 classes total and two of which have completely bombed due to illness. I am in a community college program that allows me transfer directly after two years as long as I maintain a 2.0 GPA. Right now I am at a 1.75 which is about to go down because of my new founded F. To get into my major I need a 3.0 as well. It feels like the end of the world and I feel like I\u2019ve ruined all of my chances of getting into my dream university. What do I do??", "author": "pizzapizza13_", "created": 1583412853, "retrieved": 1632960479, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
