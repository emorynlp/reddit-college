Took the F for this first semester and I doubt things will go much better if I continue next semester. I already have 4 years of math due to a summer school class I took a few summers ago. How would colleges react if I were to drop the class in terms of accepting me? Or should I just regroup for next semester and try again for a better grade?", "author": "TheNDboy", "created": 1545200859, "retrieved": 1632849368, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
