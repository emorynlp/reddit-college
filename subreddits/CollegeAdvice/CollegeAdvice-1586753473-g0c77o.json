I'm undecided major wise but am interested in exploring virtual reality programming, 3-D animation, premed and maybe business. Since I'm pretty unsure about what I want to do in the future, I want to be in an area with a lot of available internship opportunities. The weather in Cali sounds great but I'm worried about getting to med school(if I choose that option. I know I'll have to give something up tho) from UCSD since it sounds way more competitive than UW-Madison for premed students. At the same time, Cali houses a lot more opportunities for all of the other things that I'm interested(Hollywood, Disney studios for animation, start-ups nearby). UCSD had a ton of research and internship opportunities as well. As for costs, UW-Madison costs around 5k less than UCSD. Please help meee :) and thanks for your input!!!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/g0c77o)", "author": "shua20", "created": 1586753473, "retrieved": 1632961081, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
