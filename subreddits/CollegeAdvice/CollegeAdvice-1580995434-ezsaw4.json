  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in high school and beginning to feel pressured about deciding what I want to do with my life. I\u2019ve more or less decided that I want to go into screenwriting, even if it isn\u2019t a very stable career. I know that a screenwriting degree isn\u2019t needed, and in some cases not even recommended, but I want to get a different degree that will provide a backup plan for me and also help me get some experience/practice to begin preparing for my ideal career. Any idea what sort of majors would suit that?",

      "text": "I wanted to do screenwriting too, so I entered a program in LatAm where you can study Cinematography + Journalism + Advertising for a year, then switch which path you wanted to follow. Then I went to Journalism since we could get more writing skills and also had a better chance to find a stable job. I really recommend this. \n\nThen I started taking Literature classes in the same college and learned more stuff about fiction writing. I will end up graduating as a B.A.s in Letters and also a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Journalism. This will take me 7+ years, which I know it is a lot, but that's what it takes to graduate with two B.A.s in my country.\n\nThat being said, I think you should definitely study something related to Film studies or production, so you can get to know how the industry works. Also, if you have the chance, take literature classes so you can have more background in the fiction field. An english degree can do well, but you will have to study something more specific later.",

      "text": "I would probably go for something regarding English degrees for the writing aspect or grab a media production degree for a good starting job where you aren't limited to just working on movies.  But keep in mind, this is ultimately your choice and no matter how odd it feels, you do in fact still have time to decide.",
