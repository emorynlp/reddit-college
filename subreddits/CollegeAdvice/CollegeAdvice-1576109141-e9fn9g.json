Then I lost it in 11th grade when all my private school friends  moved away or went to boarding schools, forcing me to transfer back to public. Senior year\u2014which is supposed to be the most fun\u2014is now my worst nightmare. Everyone has established their own cliques, the immaturity is unreal, and even though I\u2019m generally an open minded person, some of the kids you see at my school literally have the mentality of third graders. I\u2019m also anxious about finding a job I like as an adult, because the real working world is very different than a McDonald\u2019s or Walmart  environment that teens might have. It seems like it\u2019s hard to find people my age with a strong personality. In most of high school I was goth and there weren\u2019t any others. I now started dressing like a regular person but I still haven\u2019t made any more friends at my small school. I just have 2-4 people that I talk to now, and most of them I don\u2019t even see a lot. Except for one, my sophomore friend who transferred with me. I\u2019ve talked to therapists and they reassure me, but I still have my doubts. I just want a dependable, supportive group of friends who share my interests and I want to find that. Not to be that \u201cI was born in the wrong generation!\u201d Kid, but most students are now staring at their  phones 24/7, which various psychological and psychiatric studies have linked to poor mental health, including mine. I just wanna meet cool people in this day and age to have fun with and I\u2019m anxious I won\u2019t get that.", "author": "Dayzeroxx", "created": 1576109141, "retrieved": 1632848723, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"faiyqew": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/e9fn9g/scared_i_wont_make_friends_in_college/faiyqew/", "text": "As some one who returned to college for the first time in a few years I can tell you, College is an extremely different world from high-school, your best bet is just Remember to be yourself, trust me you\u2019ll attract the right people.

Good luck!!\n\nEdit: realized you\u2019re still in high-school ... same thing still but additionally I\u2019d find clubs or activities you like and talk to like minded people.", "author": "bogoblin-", "created": 1576119851, "upvotes": 5}}}
