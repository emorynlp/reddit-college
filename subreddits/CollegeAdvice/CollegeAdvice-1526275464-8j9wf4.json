I am aiming to land in the Environmental Science sector after college. I have the advantage of using the GI Bill with enough funding available to complete my Bachelors and likely a Masters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe question is do I continue on a Biology path or pick up on a Geography path? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyone familiar with WWU knows that they take their environmental courses seriously so I am assuming both of these paths are equally qualifying in the job market. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am very interested in both and see myself greatly enjoying either path which is why I am reaching out to see what others have to say. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks all!", "author": "earthzonealex1", "created": 1526275464, "retrieved": 1632959943, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
