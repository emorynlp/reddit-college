I want to go away for college and I found one cheapest and best option. But it's an hour away from my home, and I'm pretty sure my parents will make me drive everyday since it will be cheaper to stay home and that they will want to be protective and all. But I want to stay on my own, I figured it all out, the dorm and meal plans, but it add up to around $4000. I'm sure they will make me drive rather than paying $4000. Living at home is cheap and all but it's kind of frustrating, I'm sure you guys can understand if you had to live with your parents. But I am thinking that it will be rude to say that to my parents. \nAny advice, on how I can convince my parents for letting me live on campus.", "author": "usenthrow1", "created": 1563648315, "retrieved": 1632960545, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"euesakt": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cfpa8q/how_to_convince_my_parents_to_let_me_go_away_for/euesakt/", "text": "Hey there!! The best advice i can give you is to try and bring them to the area, and show them how it\u2019s a great place for you to be. Maybe harp on some opportunities you\u2019d miss being an hour away. Also, add up the cost of gas. I can promise it would be well above $4000 per semester for an hour drive", "author": "sweetteasnake", "created": 1563752550, "upvotes": 1}}}
