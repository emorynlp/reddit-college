  "text": "This is a long ways from now. But I\u2019m planning ahead because I want to get into usc when I finish cc. Due to the transfer agreements between my community college (Los Angeles Harbor College) and usc, I won\u2019t be finishing my requirements until fall 2021. However, the Viterbi school of Engineering (specifically computer science) only accepts fall admits, so ill have to either: take a semester off, which I know will be bad for me considering I\u2019ll fall off of a schedule that I would have from now til then, or: take an extra semester for spring full of random classes.\n\nI have igetc classes planned ahead in case I don\u2019t get into usc. So I have a back up to get into CSU or UC.\n\nSo aside from classes that count specifically for major requirements or igetc, what general classes should I take for my very last semester (which won\u2019t be till spring 2022, but I like to plan ahead because I have ocd and I need to have everything ready for when I get there)?\n\nI\u2019m looking specifically for fun classes that are enjoyable and give a good time. Perhaps still giving you knowledge out of it but that\u2019s not completely necessary.\n\nI\u2019m interested in art, however I suck at it so only basic art class suggestions would be preferred. I want to be a game programmer and/or a creative writer, so maybe that will help with your suggestions. Again, I go to Los Angeles harbor college. So if you know their classes, perfect, if you don\u2019t, just give me examples of general classes offered anywhere! Thank you!\n\nTLDR; I am at Los Angeles harbor college. I\u2019m planning ahead for my education, and it turns out I need to take an extra semester after I finish all of my transfer requirements because I\u2019d finish in fall otherwise- and Usc- and most schools for that matter- doesn\u2019t accept fall admits. What are some super cool classes I can take during my last semester to have fun and to sort of get to bs the hell out of school for 5 months? Any class suggestions appreciated. Mostly Interested in writing and creativity (even though I can\u2019t draw).",

      "text": "Talk to an advisor at your transfer school. See if you could take some upper level electives online or transfer in early.\n\nNow for fun elective classes. I recommend wine appreciation, I got to drink in the classroom, on campus and learn how to buy cheap booze. Gotta be 21, but you'll have a more developed palette.\n\nPerhaps an English class, stretch the other side of your brain a bit. An upper division Gen. Ed course perhaps.\n\nThough underwater basket weaving is always an option.\n\nLastly, perhaps an internship program to fill that 6 month gap? Like teaching English or working at a camp for young engineers?",
