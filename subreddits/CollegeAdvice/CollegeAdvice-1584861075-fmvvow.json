  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI was wondering with everything going on and many schools being shut down, is this going to affect the admissions process? \n \nI applied to both UCLA AND UCI as a transfer student from a cal state and recently heard that the UC admissions are going to be more lenient with accepting in state students because less international students are going to be accepted. I don\u2019t know if this is true and I am also skeptical of this actually happening, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if anyone else has heard about this.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just another rumor.",
