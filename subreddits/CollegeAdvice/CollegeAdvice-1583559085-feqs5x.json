It was bearable up until recently however there is online course material that I now can't access and on residence our wifi routers are locked in boxes. I went to the Residence support services and they said that ethernet was not an option, is there anything I can do to get the router to prioritize my desktop computer? I would really rather not walk 20 minutes across campus to the library to use THEIR terrible internet either.", "author": "thiccmcnick", "created": 1583559085, "retrieved": 1632960599, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
