  "text": "I am currently majoring computer science. I chose this because i really love computers. I like to know how they work and put build them. But in my intro to c i find it so hard to pay attention and enjoy the learning experience. I also picked this major because i know there is some money in it. I just dont know what i should do.",

      "text": "I was in very similar shoes my first year.  What I'd suggest, if you want to stick with computers and technology, is to try out information technology.  They are a bit better to keeping your attention, plus you will still gain the knowledge that will allow you to get into a computer oriented field that still makes pretty good money.  If you are wanting to learn computer code as well, that can be self taught outside of the classroom on your own time and still apply to most any job you may look for in the future.  \n\nIn the end though, pursue whatever makes you happy.  I know that's a cliche thrown around a lot, but it really is true.  No matter what kind of job you get the time, effort, and money you put in during college will never be worth another 40ish years of dreading your career choice.  Good luck and I hope everything works out for you.",
