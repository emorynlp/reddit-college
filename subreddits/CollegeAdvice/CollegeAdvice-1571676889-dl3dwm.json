Generally you should have a 1360 SAT or a 30 ACT, or a combination, and some extra curricular. However if you\u2019ve had many disciplinary actions or you don\u2019t have any extra curricular you may not get it with even the best of grades. We are known for giving out many many full rides to people who would otherwise not qualify for one. BUT that\u2019s not a hard and fast rule! Don\u2019t lose hope!\n\nIn general with your scores, I\u2019d say **no you PROBABLY won\u2019t get any ONE scholarship that is a full ride to any four year university**. But, I\u2019d say your scores are decent enough to get several partial scholarships! **Apply for both anyways, you literally never know.** Side note: I have no idea how community colleges operate here and they may be a better bet. Don\u2019t be ashamed to go to one to get your basics, it\u2019s perfectly normal. \n\nBeing well rounded is important- if you have any sports try for that. If you are a woman in stem, while it might be harder for you to get _in_ the school if you do there exist privately funded woman only stem scholarships (which most are sadly transphobic to note). If you know your ethnicity try to get some ethnic scholarships (this includes White people but there exists fewer bc of supply and demand). If you are apart of any clubs or organizations try for those. Basically **any scholarship you qualify for and can stomach the terms of, apply for it**. \n\nAll together it might be enough to cover the cost of tuition and fees and maybe rent, which is what most full rides offer. Add a part time job and you\u2019re in the gold for college. You can also work as a lab monkey once you\u2019re a college student, as in let random people do random tests on you and then pay you for it. \n\nTLDR: no, not any one scholarship but you have a bet for getting several small scholarships that might cover it all.", "author": "crayonberryjooce", "created": 1571679309, "upvotes": 3}}}
