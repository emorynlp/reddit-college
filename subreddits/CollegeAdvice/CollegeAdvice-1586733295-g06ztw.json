  "text": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m a high school senior trying to pick where the hell to go to college. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to UMD (College Park) and UNC (Chapel Hill), so here\u2019s my pro/cons list. Just some background on me -- I applied to both of these schools as a bio major, but I\u2019m probably going to go into social sciences or something related. That being said, it\u2019s most likely that I will have to go to grad school afterwards, so that\u2019s definitely something I\u2019m keeping in mind. Both of these are already good academic programs, so I didn\u2019t really mention that. Also, really weird but music is a big hobby of mine, so if that has any bearing on these two colleges, please lmk! \n\nUMD \n\n\\+: \n\n* Close to home (I tend to get stressed easily, so it would be a nice safety net to have family close by) \n* Around 12k cheaper \n* Got into the honors program! \n* A lot of friends also attending/more familiar territory \n\n\\-: \n\n* More difficult to switch out of majors (Biology there is a Limited Enrollment Major, and so is Psych, the other option I would be interested in. I\u2019m not really sure how difficult switching in/out of these would be, but I\u2019m assuming more difficult) \n* Feel more restricted (\\^\\^)\n* Don\u2019t like the campus that much \n* A little less prestigious, which means less opportunities and alumni network for grad school \n\nUNC\n\n\\+: \n\n* More prestigious = more opportunities and better alumni network \n* More flexibility (especially as everyone comes in undecided, so it\u2019s less pressure) \n* LOVED the campus and the environment \n* New experiences and independence \n\n\\-: \n\n\\- didn\u2019t get into the honors program, so I don\u2019t know how much that would hurt me \n\n\\- more expensive by 12k \n\n\\- unfamiliar territory\n\n\\- further away, so I can\u2019t visit family or be helped by them as much \n\nThank you so much! And if any of you actually attend either one of these colleges it would be super helpful, but obviously any advice is great and very very much appreciated!!",

      "text": "If you are pretty sure about grad school, I\u2019d definitely choose UMD. That way you can save some money for grad school, and if you end up at a more prestigious grad school it won\u2019t really matter if your undergrad is slightly less prestigious.",
