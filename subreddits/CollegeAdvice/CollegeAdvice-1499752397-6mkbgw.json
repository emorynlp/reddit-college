From what I've seen of the floor plans all 3 beds will be in the same room (a very spacious room it seems). I don't want to be that asshole roommate that kicks and sexiles my roommies every weekend or every night etc. I am tight on money so spending a couple hundred for a night at a hotel is dumb. I've looked at other options like hostels, airbnb, zipcar, and motels but I think there might be a better solution. My girlfriend is shy and doesn't want to do anything public and I don't want to either. I just want privacy and at a decent price.
