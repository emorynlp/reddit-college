  "text": " \n\n\\[This is my first post on Reddit, so sorry if this is the wrong place to post I just really would like some advice and am new to Reddit. Thank you\\]\n\nOk, so to start lets begin with how this only my second semester of college. This American Government professor is a very recent and was newly appointed (Might I add, this is only her **SECOND** year teaching) She has a habit of not actually teaching the class and the material. What I mean by this is just going over basic high school stuff, nothing more advanced and just stuff we all learned in, like. 5th grade. Well, we had our first test recently (not midterm.) Keep in mind that this was a \"practice\" test and was **ONLY** worth 10% (Yeah **PRACTICE was worth 10%**.) To make a long story short, only about 0.3% of all of her classes got higher than a B- (and even those were few) . The reasoning? \"The prompt could be interpreted differently by different people.\" The prompt? \"Define and explain the First, Second, and Fourth Amendment\". That was all that was stated and she even emailed us the prompts a week early (there were three prompts but most people chose that prompt.) She had a hidden grading criteria and took points away for not having the same interpretation as her's of the **AMENDMENTS**. You know? Those things that have been set in stone and defined many years before? She had said she wanted certain case studies and law suit cases within the essay **AFTER** the test was graded (she also didn't mention this in her classes, just two fellow students who had asked to speak one on one, so majority of the students just believe that they sucked at defining the three amendments.) I am very concerned with my grades, this is college after all. How can I go about this? She refused to explain and go more in depth with future prompts and refused to listen to how students believed it to be unfair. Those with prior knowledge of case studies and other material **NOT** taught within the course had gotten an advantage and basically made studying pointless as you could've just gone onto Wikipedia and gotten the cases. They would have gotten a better grade than those who actually studied the material. Should I report this to the dean? Is there anything I can do really? Am I being a big baby? I am just very concerned with the future of the semester and so is **EVERYONE** one else within her class.",

      "text": "Don't escalate above the professor unless you have in writing, that she will no longer review your grade on the assignment. Then gather all your material, the syllabus, the prompt and your communication with the professor and setup an appointment with the head of the department.  On my campus, it's rare for a higher up to step in to require a grade change but more likely they will talk to the professor and hopefully prevent future assignments from being so ambiguous.",
