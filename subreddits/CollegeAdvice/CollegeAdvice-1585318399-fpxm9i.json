I want to work in AI during/after college and I know San Diego has some pretty sweet connections to the greater San Diego area and Silicon Valley. However, UMD is hella cheaper than UCSD and I was admitted to the scholars program (SDU).\n\nI'm having trouble deciding what I should pick. I'm not a huge fan of big schools and I like to party but I definitely not a party person.

The big name will bring big opportunities.  Even though college costs are astronomical, over a long life they will not be so painful.  A big name sure paid off for me.  I don't even know who/what UMD is.  Without a big name, you will be left with what other don't want.  Still how hard you work and you college achievements can be compelling too.  It would be just  harder to get the job you want.", "author": "EpiphanyWorkFlow", "created": 1585357704, "upvotes": 1}}}
