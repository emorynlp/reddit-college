  "text": "Hello, so I have a question that\u2019s been on my mind and I thought you all would be the best bet for an answer. Basically, I got into Cornell University regular decision (which is amazing) with mediocre stats. In the digital acceptance letter, it said that my official letter of admission will note that my acceptance is conditional on certain requirements needed before I matriculate. Does anyone know what those requirements may entail? Thanks again.",
