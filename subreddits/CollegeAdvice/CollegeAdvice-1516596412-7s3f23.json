I'm currently debating between getting my BS in Nursing and going back to school to become a Nurse Practitioner versus obtaining a BS in biology and going to medical school to hopefully become a physician. Could any of you share your opinion on my situation along with any advice or experience you may have from your profession? This is my first reddit post so sorry if I didn't do this quite right but I feel like there's many knowledgeable and passionate people on reddit and maybe some of you could give me an insight on what I should do.", "author": "copaceticbilly", "created": 1516596412, "retrieved": 1632959965, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"dt1ulr6": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/7s3f23/advice_for_a_prospective_medical_student/dt1ulr6/", "text": "I'm in the same boat. If I were giving advice, I'd say talk to a counselor or guide if you've got one assigned to you. Someone from the department you want to graduate from/go to can help if you don't have anyone, though make sure they're willing to discuss with you. I'm not really qualified to give much advice beyond that. What I personally am doing instead of graduating early, since I've got college pretty cheap, is I'm beefing up my resum\u00e9 with research, more classes, and possibly another major, so I can have better chances of getting into med school. Have you considered that?", "author": "awesomehippie12", "created": 1516604308, "upvotes": 2}}}
