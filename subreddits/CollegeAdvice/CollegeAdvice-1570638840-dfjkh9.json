I love the school itself and I could never have pictured myself elsewhere, however I had no clue that it was going to be so hard. \n\nAcademics are not the problem. Since I went to a French school and got a French diploma, which granted me a lot of credits towards my major, I actually entered college as a second year student and not a first. My classes are honestly quite interesting and I love what I'm studying. I manage to keep up and deliver quality work for my assignments so that's not where I'm struggling.\n\nHowever, I had to choose to live off-campus in an apartment due to my severe life threatening allergies that the residences could not, and would not, accommodate for. For the same reasons, I couldn't have a roommate because there's a high chance they wouldn't get it. Because of that, I feel like I'm missing out on meeting people, and had to find another way to do so. I attended almost every social event my school offered (including Frosh even though I am not a partier and hated every moment of it), I've been to networking events, I've tried socializing with my classmates... I even applied to be the first year representative for my major's association, which sadly didn't work out. Around me I see so many first years having the time of their lives. They already have an established group of friends, they're hanging out constantly and loudly giggling while walking down the crowded hallways. Even my friends from high school seem to have moved on. They all have new friends and don't even bother to acknowledge me when I message them to ask how everything is going. Everyone seems to be having the time of their lives! And then, there's me. Living alone, no friends, nobody to talk to, who is sadly desperate to meet someone who would want to spend time with me. \n\nI also miss home. I had a good family situation, so it was difficult for me to leave them. Being so far away and having little to no time off from college, I'll get to see them in person once every two or three months if I'm lucky. I've thought about going back so many times, and just give up on my degree, but there must be another solution. \n\nI've moved around and changed schools a lot in the past, so I am familiar with being the new kid, but this isn't the same. I always made friends almost instantly at my new schools. Here it has been over a month and I am still alone. And it doesn't help that most people in my classes are in their twenties and are in their second or third year, while I'm just a lost 18-year-old first year fresh put of high school.\n\nAll of this has taken such a toll in my mental health. I feel sad all the time. I feel so lonely and don't know what to do. My biggest fear has always been loneliness and here I am, living my worst nightmare. No matter how hard I try to put myself out there and meet new people, I doesn't seem to work. I feel like I'm out of energy and don't even want to leave my apartment anymore. I can't sleep at night, can't wake up in the morning and am exhausted all day long. I can only put on a friendly smile for so long before inevitably feeling the urge to cry or scream creep upon me. \n\nI am honestly desperate for advice. If anyone has any, please feel free to share it with me. I don't want to give up on my degree, but at this rate I feel like it would be the only solution for my mental well-being. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post, and thank you to anyone who has any advice for this.", "author": "Aryallie_18", "created": 1570638840, "retrieved": 1632848829, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f33tokg": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dfjkh9/im_a_college_freshman_and_it_is_not_even_close_to/f33tokg/", "text": "Hey man. It really sounds like you're having a hard time there. Try not to be too hard on yourself. I've moved to a different country for school also, and I've had a similar experience too. Fortunately though, its gotten better and I have a few friends I can talk to and hang out with. Some of them are from my classes, others from different programs I'm apart of. \n\nThis is my advice to you. First, try to deal with your current mood. It'll be hard to move on to the other steps if you're never in the mood. Easiest way to do this is to get enough sleep, eat properly and do a bit of exercise everyday. Also, if you live in a basement apartment, **go outside!** I can't stress this enough. Even if its just for ten minutes, go outside everyday and get some fresh air. Try to appreciate the little things around you. Listen to your favorite music and relax. Go to a park and walk around and just observe the nature around you. Breathe deeply and calmly. \n\nNow when you find yourself feeling a little better, check your campus for clubs or activities that are similar to your hobbies or interests. If you don't exactly have any hobbies, that's fine. Look at the list of clubs, pick the ones that look remotely interesting to you, put them into a raffle and pick one. Whichever one you pick, you must go to the club and try it for at least a month to see if you like it. If you do, awesome, keep going. If you don't, rinse and repeat. Pick another one from the raffle. \n\nWhen you go to the club/activity, don't wait for people to come to you. You're not going there primarily to make friends. You're going to have fun doing something you love first; making friends is a byproduct of that. So when you go there, find someone, anyone and say hi. Find out about the club, how to get started, etc. If you're stuck, ask for help. Introduce yourself and get their names. If whatever you're talking about reminds you of something else, (and you're comfortable talking about it) mention it. If the conversation dies down. That's fine too. Don't panic. Close the conversation (\"alright, have fun\", \"alright, I'll go check in with everyone else\", etc), find someone else (maybe whoever makes eye contact with you), go up to them and repeat. Say hi, ask about what they do, etc.\n\nWhen you find a hobby you enjoy, then you'll meet people that you'll see on a consistent basis. Not all of them will be your friend and that's okay. Just go out and have fun. Remember, you're trying to stay in a good mood too.\n\nIts the same thing with classes. If you sit next to someone, ask them about the class. If you're doing a problem, ask them what their answer is. Ask them about their experience with the last homework and share your experience. Ask them about their major and what other classes they're taking. Ask them who their favorite professor is. All of these are good conversation materials for classroom situations. Once again, not everyone is going to reciprocate or want to converse. Once again, **thats okay.** Don't make it personal. It has nothing to do with you. If they don't, try sitting with someone else next time. Come early to the classroom and chat with people. If you want to make friends, you need to make the effort. \n\nIf you get exhausted, **thats okay.** Don't be hard on yourself. However you feel is a valid feeling. Acknowledge it, and then manage it. Work on your mood first, then go out and have fun. When you're having fun, people will want to have fun with you.", "author": "Ajpennster", "created": 1570644926, "upvotes": 2}}}
