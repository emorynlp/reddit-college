And is in 5 days...5... I haven't been keeping up with the lectures, because I was waiting for my last mark and was hoping it would bring me up to an A+, unfortunately it didnt, so now I am about 7 lectures behind. There is 23 chapters total.\n\nSo I have a dilemma, I have to let my professor know by 5 p.m TOMORROW, whether or not I will write this exam.\n\nI feel like I am settling for an A when I am 2% away from an A+, but I also want to be realistic. Open book does not equate to easy (every open book I have never even referred to my notes due to the time limit and everything being short answer), I also would have another exam 1 day after, I have an A+ in that course currently, but if I do not do good that drops, so if i take out study time to study for this other course (which will be necessary seeing as I am so limited on time and am 7 lectures behind in that course)\n\nThe exam for this course is mandatory, so I have to take it and it would suck to do bad and and ruin one A+ I know I have in the hopes of raising to an A+ in another course.\n\nso its just a really tricky situation for me.\n\nAdvice would be appreciated!", "author": "belakiethat", "created": 1586363205, "retrieved": 1632960329, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmsz5a1": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fx9kjn/take_exam_or_not/fmsz5a1/", "text": "Academic adviser here: focus on your other test, if you have not been preparing this week to take the exam, save yourself and your mental capacity.
