  "text": "Hi! First post here, I'll keep it brief.\n\nI live in America but have a German and American citizenship. Was thinking of getting undergrad in Germany and then going to grad school in America to save a ton of money.\n\nI'm looking into dual majoring in engineering and business. Is there anything I should look into/know? Do you international guys/gals think the extra stress is worth the saved money?",

      "text": "Germany in general is one of the top countries in engineering, and the fact that college cost so much in America... go to Germany my friend. You never know.. it could be where you\u2019re meant to be! You will be in debt if you stay here.. for a long time. You are likely to get a better education in Germany anyway.",
