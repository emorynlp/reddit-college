I'm currently teaching and have a BS in Psychology. This means that I have to go back and get a second degree in speech and language disorders to take the required courses needed for grad school. \nHowever the big issue here is that for a plethora of reasons I fumbled a few too many classes and graduated with a 2.3 GPA. \nI just applied as a transfer student to a speech undergrad program and was rejected. The school is ranked higher and competitive however I really thought I would be able to get in as someone who already has a degree. \n\nWhere should I go from here? Should I just keep applying to other schools in the area? I feel kind of hopeless like I won't be able to pursue this field.", "author": "totesobvibro", "created": 1574212184, "retrieved": 1632961162, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
