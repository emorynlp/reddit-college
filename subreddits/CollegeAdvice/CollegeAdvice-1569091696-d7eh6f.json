I\u2019m definitely more interested in Finance careers such as Financial Planning or being an Analyst but I\u2019ve heard that many entry level jobs in Finance just consist of essentially selling insurance.  Not sure if this is true.  I go to Montclair State University and have heard that Finance degrees are only really useful from Target Schools or if you have connections.  I attended a Finance/Accounting career fair at my school this week and most companies were looking for Accounting majors planning on getting their CPA.  I don\u2019t particularly want to go that route, but I have heard that accounting can be a good way to get into the field and from there I would be able to find a position more related to Finance.  I\u2019ve also heard that you can do anything with an Accounting degree that you can do with a Finance degree, but not vice versa.  I jut want to make sure I set myself up to get a job straight out of college so I can get my student loans paid off and set myself up for a good career.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.", "author": null, "created": 1569091696, "retrieved": 1632961186, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
