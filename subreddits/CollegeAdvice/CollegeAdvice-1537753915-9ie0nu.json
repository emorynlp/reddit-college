My name is Isaac and I am currently chest-deep in college applications. I am an aspiring pre-medicine/biology major and I want to be a pediatrician. My real question is: How much should my personal statement/college essay tie in to my major? I may want to go into medicine but I have a lot of other interests, like aviation (I have my student pilot's license), photography (I run a DSLR/drone photography and videography business), leadership (I am on my state's student council board), and volunteering with mentally and physically disabled students in my school. How would I go about integrating these into my application and should I leave some out? Thanks in advance.", "author": "ericsonisaac", "created": 1537753915, "retrieved": 1632959895, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {}}
