My moms a helicopter mom, so I expected this, but my dad is now popping in to the conversation being used as a threat to me. I\u2019ve been doing my work and have gotten good grades so far, but that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m doing everything either. I haven\u2019t been looking at future course selections and they are royally pissed about it. I said I would check them out when I have time, but since midterms are coming up, I had to study for most of the day today. After being asked if I had checked the courses, I told them no. They called me and said that they\u2019d put me into the work force if I didn\u2019t get my priorities straight. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point, but I\u2019m seriously considering blocking them until thanksgiving. What do I do here? Has anyone had a similar issue?", "author": "Blck-Wheels-Red-Wagn", "created": 1571187116, "retrieved": 1632848822, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f3wo0s8": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dihig5/im_a_college_freshman_and_my_parents_are_only/f3wo0s8/", "text": "That sounds like a tough situation.
