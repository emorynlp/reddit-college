AP I would think still holds a lot of weight for college applications.  I myself took 7 AP classes and am on track to graduate a semester early, meaning I can either take my time and still graduate within 4 years or leave early.  My college doesn't accept IB at all.  If they don't it's not worth the added headache and time it would be to basically re-take classes.", "author": "mostlyimagined", "created": 1555219682, "upvotes": 1}, "ejs8pbu": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b74lk1/ib_diploma_worth_it/ejs8pbu/", "text": "Hi! My sister and I are both doing the IB Diploma. I'm still a junior, but my sister got into both UCLA and Berkeley easily. She ended up going to Berkeley, and she told me that she's planning to go into pre-med or something? Overall, if you are confident you can do well in IB, it looks great on College Apps. But if you aren't confident you can do well, it would be better to just stick with AP or Regular Classes and get exceptional grades.

I\u2019ll be starting college as a sophomore and will be set to get a dual degree in 2 years. Beyond that, my GPA is a predicted 4.4 (was 4.7 for most of high school) because of IB so there you go.
