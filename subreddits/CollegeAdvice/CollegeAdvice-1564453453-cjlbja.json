I have a good community of about 30 kids who are urging to play as well. I have a lot of paperwork completed for my school, with the only thing left to fill out being the budget sheet. I have no idea how to come up with this. Any tips with helping create one? Or is it even possible that there\u2019s an example someone created i can go off of? That would be great.", "author": "FS_Fred", "created": 1564453453, "retrieved": 1632961193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
