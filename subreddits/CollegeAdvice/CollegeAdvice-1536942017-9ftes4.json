I dont have much experience in the work force other than a server at a restaurant which is the job I would keep if i stayed with comm until i graduate. The night business program is meant for working adults so I would be able to get a full time job or two part time jobs while going to school and I would be able to get more experience which I am noticing to be very important when applying to more prestigious careers. Im not sure what I would do with either degree at this moment, possibly teaching or sales but I know I need to get a degree to have any chance.\n\n\u200b\n\nHas anyone gotten a degree in communication and is doing something else that they enjoy?\n\n\u200b\n\nAny advice?", "author": "jtm89", "created": 1536942017, "retrieved": 1632849422, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
