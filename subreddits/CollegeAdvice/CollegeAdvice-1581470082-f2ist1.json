I am new to Reddit, so I apologize if something in my post is not as it should be. Anyways, in my state they recently introduced a grant that will pay for 2 years of community/technical college at certain schools and for certain programs under a small set of requirements/regulations. No tuition whatsoever and I would be able to complete a certificate program or study to get an associates degree. I believe I want to study software development, as it seems to be one of the top options based on career earning and potential for progress in the field. So, i guess what I am asking is if there is anyone who has an associates in software development in this subreddit and would like to shed some light on the career options, schooling, pay, etc. it would be much appreciated. I've also included the list of programs available under this grant and if anybody would like to share personal experiences and/or knowledge regarding any of the fields whether it be professionally or academically, I am not set on software development and am open to suggestion. Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxm8ihk19eg41.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=4adf0512306b948bbd4560822bb295c6b35bbbce", "author": "304hitman", "created": 1581470082, "retrieved": 1632960482, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
