  "title:": "Dropping out and getting a GED in order to pursue a better education?",
  "text": "I\u2019m going into my Jr year of high school and have just moved from a large city to a small town. In the city I went to an advanced school which put me ahead educationally. Now, the local school I\u2019m going to wants me to retake classes, or take freshman/sophomore courses because the next classes that would make sense for me to take are considered senior classes there, and they say I cannot take those courses without skipping a grade (AP Gov, and AP Lang/Lit). I\u2019ve already explored skipping a grade as an option, but my counselor blocked me from becoming a senior due to a misunderstanding of the number of credits I would need to do so.  Now, I\u2019m considering dropping out of high school and getting a GED so that I can take community college classes for two years before applying to college on time. Obviously this is not ideal, but does anyone know how this would look to colleges? I don\u2019t want to sacrifice my chances at my dream school just so I can take the classes I want now. \n\nAny help is appreciated",

      "text": "Have you looked into online school/homeschool? I think dropping out is drastic and with enough pressure they should let you take whatever you want. Have your parents talked to them? What do your parents think? Could you look into a private or charter school? There\u2019s just so many other options I\u2019m confused as to why your first instinct is to drop out.",

          "text": "homeschooling isn\u2019t really an option for me. I\u2019m looking into online school, but i\u2019d rather it not come to that because i\u2019m very extroverted and tend to get depressed when i don\u2019t have many chances to socialize. my parents have reached out to the school and are trying to appeal to the principal, and eventually the superintendent, but both my counselor and the principal are bad at communicating. i\u2019m still looking into skipping a grade, and if i don\u2019t do that then i\u2019m going to be taking extra classes after school at a community college to make up for AP Gov and AP Lit, but that only covers for two of the courses that I\u2019m missing out on. \n\nmy parents were both teachers so my mother also taught at multiple private schools, and she says that the quality of work there is worse, and while our family is well off enough that we don\u2019t qualify for scholarships, we can\u2019t really afford a private school, even if there are any in the area. The town also doesn\u2019t have any charter schools from what I can tell. \n\nWe\u2019ve been putting a lot of pressure on the school, but this whole thing has gone on for close to 4 months, and we\u2019ve still not reached an agreement. dropping out is beginning to look better and better as an option.",

There\u2019s lots of meetups/ study groups and you\u2019d still be able to hang out with friends once they get out of school.",

I\u2019d rather avoid online classes as much as possible, and seeing as i have no friends in the town, it\u2019s not as though i\u2019d have a place to meet them",
