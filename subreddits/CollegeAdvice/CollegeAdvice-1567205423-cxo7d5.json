In the city I went to an advanced school which put me ahead educationally. Now, the local school I\u2019m going to wants me to retake classes, or take freshman/sophomore courses because the next classes that would make sense for me to take are considered senior classes there, and they say I cannot take those courses without skipping a grade (AP Gov, and AP Lang/Lit). I\u2019ve already explored skipping a grade as an option, but my counselor blocked me from becoming a senior due to a misunderstanding of the number of credits I would need to do so.  Now, I\u2019m considering dropping out of high school and getting a GED so that I can take community college classes for two years before applying to college on time. Obviously this is not ideal, but does anyone know how this would look to colleges? I don\u2019t want to sacrifice my chances at my dream school just so I can take the classes I want now. \n\nAny help is appreciated", "author": "sarcasize", "created": 1567205423, "retrieved": 1632960438, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"eyo254r": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cxo7d5/dropping_out_and_getting_a_ged_in_order_to_pursue/eyo254r/", "text": "Have you looked into online school/homeschool?
