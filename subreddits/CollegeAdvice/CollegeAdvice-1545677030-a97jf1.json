  "text": "Short background. I\u2019m about to enter spring semester of my third year at college. I\u2019ve basically only had two \u201cgood\u201d semesters where I passed all of my classes. Other than that, I either spend way too much time socializing or working and never complete much homework, and end up failing classes. \n\nI\u2019m incredibly smart, so college work isn\u2019t a problem for me, it\u2019s not letting other things get in way so I can\u2019t complete the work that I am running into problems with. \n\nHow would you guys recommend I handle this? When I do homework I do it exceptionally well, I would just rather do other things with my time and then never have time to complete it. Anybody else go through a similar thing while in school?",
