She didn't really *learn* anything.    \nSo I get it that you can't possibly retain everything crammed down your throat in college. I certainly didn't. I did, however, retain most of it because I actually studied and actually learned.    \nSo why don't people actually take the time to learn while they're in college? I mean, you're spending all that money and taking the time to show up and be there and get an education. So why just cram at the last minute for everything?    \nOk, some of you are going to say that you're taking so much at once that you have so much homework that you literally don't have time to study. Well I worked a full-time job where I had to be gone at least 2 weeks out of the year and still managed to keep passing grades. I don't want to hear excuses. Excuses are just like @ssholes: everybody's got one and they all stink. What I do want to hear is actual facts, creating a strong argument against taking the time to learn the material presented you, that you paid for, and took the time out of your *busy schedule* to show up for. I honestly can't fathom cramming for the test so you don't actually learn anything.\n\nEdit: Formatting", "author": "ziris_", "created": 1500908545, "retrieved": 1632961059, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"dknhqz5": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/6p8xfh/honest_question_why_dont_people_learn_in_college/dknhqz5/", "text": "A lot of people in my classes would study last minute, they didn't want to study beforehand and instead wanted to hang out, party etc and just have fun. It would be hard to remember those facts long term since they just crammed. So I guess it might be related with what their priorities are\n", "author": "madejanae", "created": 1500910754, "upvotes": 3}}}
