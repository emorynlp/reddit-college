I have six classes and enough work to last me an entire year. The problem lies here, all of my work is due is less than a month from now. I am working on homework any time I am not at work (essential worker, yay) and I still manage to get nothing done. I'm burning out terribly and I don't know what to do. Every time I try to work my brain completely shuts down. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you! :)", "author": "bcooke3", "created": 1587055034, "retrieved": 1632848311, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
