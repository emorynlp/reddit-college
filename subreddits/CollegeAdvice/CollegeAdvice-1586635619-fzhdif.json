Even so, I decided to go to community college to better my academic portfolio. THEN, I had an extremely hard year; my grandparents who had offered help paying for school found out that they couldn\u2019t anymore, after that my grandpa passed away suddenly and he was a very big influence in my life so it hit me hard. I gave up again. After a few months of just turning nothing in and barely showing up for classes, I decided to drop out. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t do it in time for my bad grades to not be put on my transcript. It was my first semester after high school and now it\u2019s the start of the new year. I want to continue my education and go back to school but honestly I have no idea what to do. I didn\u2019t have the grades to get any scholarships and I\u2019m working full time to pay rent and hopefully save some for tuition later on. \n\nDoes anybody know where I can find resources to help me get back on track? Both financially and with picking the right school for me. (I\u2019m going to take school online this year)\n\n(Also please don\u2019t tell me what I should\u2019ve done better, I already know)", "author": "ashurley23", "created": 1586635619, "retrieved": 1632961087, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
