I\u2019ve decided i want to open a Cat Cafe. If you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s basically a place you can go to and buy coffee, tea type things, and you pay by the hour to hang out with the cats in the cafe. I want to have one with all the cats being adoptable, so it\u2019s like a shelter/profitable business hybrid.\n\nNow my question is, where do i start with school? I\u2019m 20 years old, i work in a restaurant, and i still live with my dad so I\u2019d like to move out soon. I\u2019m wondering if i should:\n\n-go to business school with a minor related to animals?\n\n-major in something animal related with a minor in business?\n\n-or go to school to get my vet tech license so i can get paid more to be able to move out(and work with animals), and then go back to school for business once I\u2019m settled in my adult life", "author": "Ghostiie18", "created": 1557789790, "retrieved": 1632961001, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"es0z4n8": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/boawp8/where_to_start/es0z4n8/", "text": "Honestly, this doesn\u2019t require any specific degree. It requires money and hard work. I would get a degree in something like vet tech, start making connections with rescues, and learn as much as you can about running a business from restaurants. Keep your credit perfect and save like a madman so you can eventually get a business loan. Utilize those connections in rescue and restaurants to maybe find some business partners to help shoulder startup costs. Unless your family is wealthy this is likely to be a 10+ year process.\n\nBe realistic about your market. Talk to local cafe owners. What are their expenses like? Look into zoning rules regarding animals.\n\nAlso, small businesses often fail. Be ready for that.
