Particularly, they want me to go into engineering. The only problem is, I\u2019m awful at Math, and it always frustrates me and makes me unhappy with myself for not being able to do as well as I should be able to. I don\u2019t have anywhere to go if I\u2019m not in College, though I\u2019m sure my parents won\u2019t kick me out for at least a month if I stop going. College is probably my best opportunity right now, but I\u2019m so unhappy with what my major has to be, and in particular how heavy it is in math. I\u2019ve always struggled with mental health, and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in any personal danger over this current math class, I don\u2019t think I can go through years of challenging math classes and survive. Is there any way I can make it through an EE degree with minimal math credits?", "author": "924ths", "created": 1574074145, "retrieved": 1632848762, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f95fv6h": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dy1mw3/i_have_no_choice_but_to_get_a_stem_degree_but_im/f95fv6h/", "text": "Why don't you try studying biology or neurobiology?
