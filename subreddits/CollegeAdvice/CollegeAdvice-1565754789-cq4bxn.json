Which is smarter online classes or being physically in class?", "text": "I\u2019m 18 and it\u2019s my first year of college, I\u2019m currently trying to STILL figure out my life and need some advice. \n\nI\u2019m also a youtuber, kinda important.\n\nSo many a month or so before graduated I changed my mind that I wanted to go to college and I took it upon myself to really be serious about it. Tell my parents who basically said okay whatever. ALSO my parents are both marines meaning HAZELWOOD ACT (benefits for a child entering college free basically and only paying for books).\n\nI had my orientation and everything, currently gonna enroll into Lonestar and transfer to UOH (hopefully)\n\nBut my dumbass doesnt have a drivers license and the campus I applied to is probs 30 mins away from me. we don\u2019t really have a spare car & I know what a lot of you are going to tell me. WHY DIDNT YOU GET ONE THIS WHOLE SUMMER? Well let me tell you, I did practice drive and really just need to learn parallel parking & bingo I\u2019m set. \n\nBut the point is I\u2019m debating wether I should wait and actually get my licenses first. Then go to school instead of doing online classes knowing myself. Procrastination is killer. I am a visual learner, and like to see things be worked out or here a professor speak to usually the topics and lessons etc. \n\n\nSo COLLEGE STUDENTS which is better or what should I do!!", "author": "laurensrevenge", "created": 1565754789, "retrieved": 1632960379, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ewx3p3w": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cq4bxn/need_advice_school_starts_the_27th_and_im_having/ewx3p3w/", "text": "I would recommend to go to classes at least during your first year.
