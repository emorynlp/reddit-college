  "text": "So I've been going to community college for almost 2 years, as a biology major, and i feel like I've just been going with the flow. Im 19 and I feel totally lost in my career, my whole life I dreamed of being a doctor and I felt like my life would be perfect if I accomplished that. Little did I know it would be the hardest and most draining task Ive set up for myself. My dad has held onto my words as a kid promising I'll be a doctor when I grow up, and my mom was happy about it too but not as strict as my father. My struggle with this is eating me alive, I go to my chemistry classes and I lack the motivation because all i think about is how the information I am forced to absorb doesn't benefit me in my life, learning about elements and things at an atomic level wont help me in my day to day practice in my job. I talk amongst my peers and realize they are all robots going to school then going home studying and i dont want to just follow blindly, I study for hours at school and every time I am on the drive home i realize how useless the information is and on top of all of this the competition for medical degrees are crazy. It's not that I dont think I'm smart enough I just think I'm not passionate enough to continue and to commit to the many more years of intensive schooling. I've tried looking into other majors but none have really caught my attention. I just feel like I am stuck in a rut. I feel like my life right now shouldn't be stressing over my major and how rigorous my classes are, I want to look back and actually ENJOY my life rather than sitting down with a book in my face for the next decade. I want to drop out but I know realistically my parents might kick me out and my minimum wage job wont support me. I also dont want to get a useless degree that will only set me up for thousands of dollars in debt and a low paying job. I'm probably going to continue dragging myself to my useless classes for the time being because I have no alternative for the time being. Thanks for reading, please comment any advice because I am actually stuck, .",
