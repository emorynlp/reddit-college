Turns out that I got a C- in the 1 credit program review class which I thought I had passed and didn\u2019t actually graduate. I enrolled in the class for this spring semester, but can\u2019t receive my degree until April. I\u2019ve been applying and interviewing for jobs thinking I had graduated. What can I do during the 4 months to not waste my time, but still work on my career? \n\nAdditionally I took the CHES(certified health education specialist) exam and passed in October. You can take it before graduating as long as you send in your transcript within 90 days. Since I didn\u2019t actually graduate. I\u2019ll have to take it again which costs quite a bit. Any advice on this would be helpful as well. ", "author": "rhughes694", "created": 1546980278, "retrieved": 1632849353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
