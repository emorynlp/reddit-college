I\u2019m an incoming freshman at a really good music college. My gpa is a 3.4 and my SAT is 1100. I\u2019ve applied for a bunch of scholarships and I have received some help on my aid but it\u2019s still not enough. I need to come up with 10k (which includes all the resources FASFA has offered me) to be able to attend school in the fall. I can\u2019t work right now because i\u2019m 17 and because of the corona virus. My parents refuse to help me pay for college because \u201csince i had to pay for it myself, you need to pay for it yourself.\u201d What are my options to be able to attend this school? (if i instead go to community college, i\u2019ll loose my opportunity to be in this really good music school). I turn 18 this november and I can\u2019t find anyone to co-sign a student loan with me.", "author": "musiclovererererer", "created": 1586743045, "retrieved": 1632959985, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"fsdb7ko": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g09ixf/incoming_college_freshman_tuition_help_please/fsdb7ko/", "text": "Try an only fans acc.
