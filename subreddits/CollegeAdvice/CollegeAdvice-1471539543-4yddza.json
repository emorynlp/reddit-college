  "text": "Hey guys, so my friend applied to a college, got accepted and requested financial aid. All went well until she noticed she hasn't gotten a call or any updates regarding the aid. Calling in, she was told that her request wasn't even valid due to no paperwork. When she asked the college, revealed to her that all of her information, which kept in a database, was lost and that all her classes are dropped.\n\nWhat can she do in this situation?",
