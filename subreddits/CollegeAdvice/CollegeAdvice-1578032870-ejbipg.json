  "title:": "How do I recover from a Bad First Semester?",
  "text": "I finished my first semester of college and managed to get below a 2.0 GPA. I got a B+, 2 C's, a D, and 3 F's. I know most of you will probably ask how could I mess up so bad, and I know I did, I've heard it from my family enough. I will be going back for the Spring Semester at the same university, but how screwed am I? Will I be able to recover from a horrible semester. To give a little context, I went in as a Biology Major, but I'm pretty sure bio isn't for me, and I will be switching to either Business or Econ at the end of Spring Semester. I realized mid-semester that my depression was getting in the way of doing work and going to class, and by the time i got an appointment with a therapist at school, it was far too late to dramatically bring up my grades. While I know it isn't an excuse to get such horrible grades, I was wondering if I can bounce back from this, and what I should do in order to still graduate on time. I do have 24 credits from AP, so I am not completely behind, and I am determined to succeed next semester, but I am seeking advice on how to fix this situation I have created. Thanks in advance for any responses.",
