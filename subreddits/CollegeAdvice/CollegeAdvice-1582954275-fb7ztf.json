But I\u2019m having trouble on deciding... of course I will not be basing off my decisions on the replies down below. I\u2019m just considering what others would do. \nIt\u2019s really based off finances.... \nBerry college is EXPENSIVE. 50k a year but I managed to knock it down to 15k a year \nUga is much cheaper and will be even cheaper with the Hope scholarship (will pay 70% of the cost)\nI\u2019m planning to go to Vanderbilt for graduate school which is EXPENSIVE too. \nShould I go to UGA and not worry about too much debt and go to Vanderbilt \nOr \nGo to berry which could leave me in debt and have the possibility not be able to go to Vanderbilt for grad school cause I\u2019ll already be in debt from berry\ud83d\ude05\n\nHow did you guys decide on which college to go to? Did you base it off of personal ideals or based off on money?", "author": null, "created": 1582954275, "retrieved": 1632848332, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fj5i0bk": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fb7ztf/berry_college_or_university_of_georgia/fj5i0bk/", "text": "MOOOONNNNEEEYYYYY", "author": "TheBloomingBabe", "created": 1583033163, "upvotes": 1}}}
