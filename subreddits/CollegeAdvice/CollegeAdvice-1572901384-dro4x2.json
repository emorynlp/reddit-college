  "text": "So I\u2019m really stressed out at the moment...I\u2019m an 18 year old girl about to graduate from High School and have already been accepted into the college I love.I have money in a college tuition account that LITERALLY will pay for everything (anything else I have scholarships for) and I want to move into the dorms.My parents however don\u2019t want me to go saying I can just move out after college (as well as getting extremely angry and refusing to listen to me when I explain it\u2019s for logical reasons)but I REALLY want the full college experience and it\u2019s a full two hour commute .Since I\u2019m already an adult I figured I can just take the money and go but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do that considering they are the account owners...is there anyway they can cut me off from the tuition money??because they have already said they will take the money away if I try anything.or should I just grin and bear it and stay home??or take out a loan???\nP.s. Any advice is appreciated!!!!!!",

Genuinely curious about your point of view - it might help her (and the rest of us, who I imagine are predominately college-aged students) understand the parental perspective on not wanting a child to leave for school. \n\nThank you in advance!",

              "text": "I believe everyone should have the \u201ccollege experience\u201d if they are ready for it.  \n\nWith that being said. I have two children,one in jr college and living at home and the other one a senior in high school getting ready for college. Both are excellent students. \n\nThe older one is at a junior college by choice. He was not ready to join a major institution and live away from home. He does fantastic at school and work but needs to work on being responsible in other ways. He does not clean or cook by any means and does not handle his money well. \n\nWhile the younger child is paying bills (car payment and insurance) helps with dinners and does laundry. If she wanted to go to a four year right off the bat I would not blink an eye at it but she is choosing to go to the local junior college to save money and then transfer to a bigger 4 year college later. \n\nKnow that both of them made a choice on what they felt they were able to do. It was a frank conservation with each of them about goals, abilities, desires, and money. \n\nI wondered why the parents of this young adult are balking from her moving out. Things we might not know from their point of view. Is it lack maturity? Lack of Responsibility? Is it selfishness? (My own mother pulled the purse strings and I went to a college of her choice because she could not handle the distance (which is an entirely different story and subreddit)) sounds like there is more back story we need.",

                  "text": "So, before I moved out I had a job but no school and spent DAYS on YouTube or sleeping all day and couldn\u2019t save a penny (I made like $15000 that year and it\u2019s gone). I also have bad ADHD and would live in a mess (I couldn\u2019t keep anything clean). I literally didn\u2019t know how to boil an egg when I moved out with a guy I had just met who is now my fianc\u00e9. When I moved out, I quickly learned to adapt to the real world and I learned how to do laundry, cook, clean, and have been making our bed everyday and am pretty tidy. I am still chronically late to college (I enrolled) and have a hard time with self motivation and saving money\u2014BUT I learned because I was put in a situation where no one would do anything for me and if I didn\u2019t cook I\u2019d starve. \nLet your kids learn for themselves. Sometimes we\u2019re stubborn. Let\u2019s us fall and pick ourselves up.",

Perhaps a past reason the might not have confidence in you leaving home? \n\nDepending on where YOU stand in your relationship with them... doing college on your own is (technically) an option. I imagine it would be breaking off your relationship with them, which could be ugly and painful. I don't suggest it. Generally, even when they are making decisions that are seemingly completely counterintuitive to what we'd like, parents have our best interests at heart. I don't suggest doing this. (Then again, I don't know the nuances of your relationship with them or your history - I have been relatively fortunate with my parental relationships and they are of great value to me now - but I understand this is not everyone's reality).\n\nMaybe you could try your first semester of college from home. Not ideal, I understand. But it would give you an opportunity to build a case for yourself, not only on your ability to be responsible and accountable, but for why commuting two hours and being unable to build a community at school is NOT a good thing for you.",
