I feel stuck and completely unhappy. I\u2019m in school because it\u2019s what was safe and what would keep my parents help in supporting me. My dad pays for my rent, bills, everything. I attend a community college currently, and it\u2019s expected of me to transfer to the bigger university in my area after this semester. \n\nI recently figured out that i really enjoy event planning. I have an internship with an event planning company right now and absolutely love it. However, i just came across a job that starts in April for an entry level wedding planning associate at a ski resort that i really feel like i can\u2019t pass up. However, applying for this position and getting it would mean i withdraw from my classes and take a gap year. The position offers housing, meals, etc. \n\nIs this something i should pursue? I want to come back to school when i feel ready for it but I\u2019m worried i won\u2019t have the support from my parents and that terrifies me. I\u2019m sorry if this post is scatter brained, I just don\u2019t know if this position is something worth jeopardizing my parents relationship with me, their support, and withdrawing from class.\n\nedit: sorry i put that i was 19 and not 20 for some reason it doesn\u2019t really matter but anyway", "author": "randomlygenerated100", "created": 1581953086, "retrieved": 1632960350, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"fhziisv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f5a8yb/i_want_to_dropout/fhziisv/", "text": "Do what\u2019s right for YOU. No one else. I\u2019m currently in a similar situation of doing what\u2019s right for me vs my family. I\u2019m wanting to move away for college and because of how close we all are it\u2019s really hard on them. And me. But if I don\u2019t go I won\u2019t get to pursue what I\u2019m passionate about. So why would you do the same? The only thing it causes is resentment. On the other point of a gap year, I took two years off when that wasn\u2019t the norm in my family at all. But it let me grow more before going back to school and choosing a major that I don\u2019t regret.

They're two different things and motivated by different parts of your life.\n\nSpeaking to taking up this job opportunity, I have had many friends who have taken a year or two leave of absence from college for various reasons. One for medical leave, a couple for military service requirements by their home country, etc etc. Speak with an academic advisor at your institution and learn the process for taking a leave of absence, and note down everything you need to do to make sure you can smoothly return to school after a year or so.\n\nBut definitely plan to return to school after a year or so! Having a degree generally opens up more opportunities for you, especially in terms of mid career advancement. And it is much, much harder to return to finish an associate's or bachelor's when you're in your 30s and caring for a family and all that. And if you do have plans to return to college, talk with your father and explain that you've loved and appreciated all his support for you, but you want to get a foot in the door of this job opportunity and that doesn't mean you don't value your education or his commitment to your education.\n\nI'd take the job opportunity as a time to connect with people in the industry--get their opinions on the value of a bachelor's, it might help clarify your feelings about transferring from a comm. college to university.", "author": "CapriciousCupofTea", "created": 1581957908, "upvotes": 4}}}
