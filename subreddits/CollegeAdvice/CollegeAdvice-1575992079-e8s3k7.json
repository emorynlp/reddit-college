I have less than a week before finals and I'm struggling thinking that I can come back. Does anyone have any advice for me? To clarify, I have calculated my grades for the end of the semester...no matter how good I do on finals, I will inevitably fail my classes.\n\nMore info on situation: I've gone through some issues (roommates, depression) and never went to counseling or did anything about it. I know I've fucked up big time and my parents have no idea. Not a day goes by where this doesn't eat at me. I was on a really good track freshman year and I feel like I threw everything away...", "author": "VirginJr", "created": 1575992079, "retrieved": 1632960422, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"faf6vcw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/e8s3k7/failing_all_my_classes_this_semester_am_i_screwed/faf6vcw/", "text": "You're not screwed- Plenty of college students have rough semesters.  I myself was on academic probation for two semesters before getting my life back in order, and am going to be graduating on the Dean's List this semester. It's very possible to get things back on track!\n\nI would meet with an advisor and see if there are options like a GRO (Grade Replacement Opportunity, where you retake a class to replace your first grade in it) or if you can apply for a medical (or regular)  withdrawal on the courses you're failing (though this will require you to see a health professional). If not, check if there are requirements for academic probation, etc., if you're going to end up on that status.
