Obviously both are great schools for many reasons and I don\u2019t think I can make a wrong choice here. Just curious for anyone\u2019s input and/or specific stories and personal experiences w either school. \nI\u2019ll be an athlete at both whatever I decide and think I\u2019d prefer D3 at MIT, and I\u2019m fairly confident I want to go into engineering but have enough interests outside of that to tempt me into the more liberal arts school just for want of choice.\nThanks so much for any help!!!!", "author": "steamedcantaloupe", "created": 1585525437, "retrieved": 1632848322, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "comments": {}}
