I don't know what to do tbh it was my first day back Tuesday but I didn't go. I've missed so many days of college. I struggle so hard with the subjects. They told I might need to take a class that prepares me for the one I'm taking now but Idk. I want to go to Uni this year but it looks like I can't. I don't want to apend two years in college, I have no interest in any of the subjects I'm takkng. I'm so behind on everything please help me.
