Pros to the Med lab route would be pretty much 100% job guarantee, I\u2019ll know my salary fairly well. Cons are I\u2019ve NEVER wanted to work 9-5, I\u2019ve wanted my own business working freelance since I was little.\nPros to interpreter/ translator route are I could do freelance and hopefully have a business someday, working the hours I want for the most part. Cons are my salary and job status aren\u2019t guaranteed..I\u2019m very stuck on this one. Any advice would help.

Those jobs can pay pretty well, and there is a HUGE need for them, depending on what language(s) you would focus on through your program. Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Hmong, Mam, and ASL  translators are always in high demand.  \nIt is a little bit more uncertain at least in the immediate term, but if it's a lifestyle you'd prefer, it is definitely a career than can be quite profitable and one that makes a very important impact in peoples lives. There's also the upfront cost to think about - I don't know which program is more expensive, but I'm going to guess that it's the Medical Lab one. I always advise students I work with to think about the kind of life they want to live, and the structure of your job will effect every decision you make and if you're unhappy with your hours and commute, it can negatively impact your job performance.  \nIt looks like whichever route you choose you're going to be making important contributions to the world while earning a good wage, so I think it would be best for you to choose the job that allows you to live the lifestyle you'd be most happy in.
