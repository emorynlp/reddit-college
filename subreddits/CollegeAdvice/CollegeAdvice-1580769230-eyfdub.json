I have studied IT primarily but since I made the stupid decision to switch schools I\u2019m only half way through my program.\n\nI can\u2019t keep sinking money into this degree and I need to graduate as soon as possible.  I contacted Evergreen in Olympia wa and they said I can only transfer in 135 credits and would need to complete 45 credits at Evergreen in order to graduate there.\n\nAre there any other options?", "author": "tawzer", "created": 1580769230, "retrieved": 1632960410, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"fghi97d": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/eyfdub/i_have_230_credits_and_need_to_graduate_asap_for/fghi97d/", "text": "What subject do you have the most credits accumulated?", "author": "drock13", "created": 1580785420, "upvotes": 1}, "fgh0zhl": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/eyfdub/i_have_230_credits_and_need_to_graduate_asap_for/fgh0zhl/", "text": "Are you sure your current school doesn't have any general studies or interdisciplinary studies degrees? \n\nIt's better to stay at your current school and see if there any degrees that fit your credits rather than try to look for another school to transfer to. Most schools have residency requirements that require you to take a certain number of credits there in order for them to grant you a degree.", "author": "mayg09", "created": 1580774111, "upvotes": 2}}}
