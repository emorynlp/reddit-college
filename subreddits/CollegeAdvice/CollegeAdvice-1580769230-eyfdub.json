  "text": "What do I do? My employer just told me that I won\u2019t get promoted until I have my bachelors and I need that promotion desperately as I\u2019m expecting a baby in July.   I have studied IT primarily but since I made the stupid decision to switch schools I\u2019m only half way through my program.\n\nI can\u2019t keep sinking money into this degree and I need to graduate as soon as possible.  I contacted Evergreen in Olympia wa and they said I can only transfer in 135 credits and would need to complete 45 credits at Evergreen in order to graduate there.\n\nAre there any other options?",

Most schools have residency requirements that require you to take a certain number of credits there in order for them to grant you a degree.",

Don't want to end up in a situation where you end up with a degree from an unacreddited school",
