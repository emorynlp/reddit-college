For the first two years I did the bare minimum, and failed a couple classes. It wasn\u2019t until second semester junior year, and the entirety of senior year that I realized my life wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so I put it into gear and graduated. I never thought about college in high school, but now that I\u2019m out I want to go. The only hiccup is that the school year starts in a month, and I don\u2019t have the money, nor the high school performance to go. I realized that college is an amazing thing, and that if I don\u2019t do it now I probably wont. I\u2019m really looking into Boise State University. My dream job is to be a paramedic, and BSU doesn\u2019t offer anything for that. But as I\u2019ve done more research I\u2019m kinda considering nursing. But my real problem is that I think that starting a semester or a year behind my graduating class makes me look pathetic.

If you need the time to save up a little bit of money then it would probably be best to take a semester off, and then start as soon as you\u2019re able. Don\u2019t worry about what your classmates or other people might think of you, gap years are very common. What\u2019s important is that you do what\u2019s right for you.
