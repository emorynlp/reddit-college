I\u2019m feeling confused and anxious I don\u2019t know who to talk to right now and I would really appreciate any honest advice : \n\nI\u2019m really struggling \n\nI\u2019m about to start my senior year of college after taking time off\u2014 I\u2019ve dropped out twice before ( the first time due to intense anxiety and side effects from medication) and the second time also due to anxiety. I started college at 19 and I\u2019m 25 now so it\u2019s been a really slow and painful process, dropping out completely and starting again, doing part-time, dropping out again and now I\u2019m in my first week of Fall semester after taking summer classes. I was pretty miserable during the summer, I tried to stay positive but I just couldn\u2019t help feeling like sitting in a classroom with 20 year-olds spewing jargon about Robert Mapplethorp and Frank O\u2019Hara in a self congratulatory way is pointless and so privileged when there are people who are literally starving and homeless outside on the street. I might sound bitter and it\u2019s probably because I am... Don\u2019t get me wrong I believe that there is beauty and importance in learning about these things it just seems silly to be paying $23,000 per semester for it. I\u2019m very privileged and lucky that my parents are paying tuition but I feel terrible like I\u2019m wasting their money. \n\nI started college even though I was undecided because where I come from that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do: get into a prestigious college, get a generic well-paying  job, and you\u2019re set. But I feel like as I\u2019m getting older and finding my own inner voice/ interests, that kind of life doesn\u2019t interest me anymore. \n\nI am now considering dropping out and doing an online 3D Animation program instead. I\u2019ve been doing little personal projects here and there but I want to commit to it full time and become a freelance artist or work for a small studio. I researched online and it seems like most forums say you don\u2019t need a degree, you just need a good portfolio. I\u2019ve always been creative and I really like 3D modeling and I would love to make a career out of it. \n\nI was so convinced but now I\u2019m having doubts: am I being naive? Should I start on anti-depressants again and endure another 9 months of school to get a diploma? What if I fail and disappoint my family again? I just feel confused and alone. I like spending time alone but I am very anxious and depressed these days and rarely go out to do anything. It\u2019s really exhausting to be around people and try to socialize these days. I have no self-confidence. I also hate that I\u2019m being so indecisive and whiny...  and I just want to make a decision already... Half of me wants to have a stable job and income and make my family proud... prove my peers wrong that I CAN finish college but at the same time I want to dedicate myself to becoming skilled in 3D arts and start my own business as a freelance artist. \n\nTl:dr \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I should finish my liberal arts degree from my top tier college or drop out and pursue a career in the 3D arts...", "author": "suntorypop", "created": 1567749775, "retrieved": 1632848860, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ezahx7q": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/d0cpe5/i_have_27_credits_left_should_i_finish_college/ezahx7q/", "text": "I feel you so much, in regards to college. I\u2019ve been seeing an in-house \u201ctherapist\u201d because I\u2019ve developed panic attacks (which were a first for me) due to college. Going to college seems like a mantra given to every student out there, regardless of where you are from as it seems, and it\u2019s hars to be confident about this decision and sticking it out when there\u2019s so many more options for you\u2014especially when you don\u2019t HAVE to have a degree as well as stories of people who went and got their degree having no guarantee (or even a good shot) of a \u201cwell-paying\u201d job anyway. Of course, I know some people ARE able  get well-paying jobs, but the very fact that you also wouldn\u2019t be able to is unnerving.\n\nAnyway, since you only have 27 credits left to do, the thing that makes the most sense is to finish college. \n\nHowever, since you mention that you would have to rely on antidepressants to do so is heartbreaking. I wouldn\u2019t want you to make yourself suffer\u2014I know I wouldn\u2019t want to go through my own personal hell for the sake of\u2014what? I don\u2019t know, which is exactly why I\u2019m all for you pursuing your career in 3D arts.\n\nI just hope that you are prepared to weather anything that comes out of that path, good or bad, as well as the time it takes to where you want to be\u2014to really consider your options. Regardless, I feel that you will be able to find more success in that path as you can find contentment in that choice.", "author": "52-hertzwhalien", "created": 1567801799, "upvotes": 1}, "ez8sf71": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/d0cpe5/i_have_27_credits_left_should_i_finish_college/ez8sf71/", "text": "If you can afford to stay in college and finish the degree, do it. You started the program for a reason so you really owe it to yourself not to give up now.  I am finishing college in my 30s so I understand the pain of not fitting in, but that can be a blessing.
