  "text": "I'm a second year studying software engineering.\nMy university is fairly new. But the following still cant be elaborated.\n\nAs I mentioned, i study about computers.\nIt's a new semester so new courses.\n\nWe have 2 communication courses and 1 computer course. I asked the vice president for changing 1 communication course to computer related subject, because we already studied communication in first year.\n\nShort story long, somehow everyone agreed with me and now I'm leading somewhat of a protest. \n\nThe vice president's \"argument\" is that we dont know shit about education systems and that he has more experience in the field. Seriously..that's what he said. Technically, the university doesnt have large funds to get professors for a computer subject. They make it sound like it's my problem. I pay around 5k a year so I deserve a better education. My computer professors think another computer course is also a good idea. \n\nWhat ami doing wrong here? Nobody is attending the classes. I started this. Now what?",

      "text": "You've done nothing wrong. You have a right to comment on curriculum, especially if you think it is undermining the qualifications and skills you would expect to have with your degree. Although is everything still covered, just later in your degree?\n\nIts unfortunate that you've been made leader of a revolt but the college will happily take the money and fail the students so you should probably try to organize a meet and encourage students not to waste their money but resist passively (e.g. ask computer related questions constantly through the communication lectures).",

And we did try passive resistance. It's just that, the vice president acts like we are wrong. We still didnt pay so I think we have a chance. \n\nI was just wondering If anybody got experience with this.",
