How did you feel when move out day came? Is there any way to tell if you're ready to move out or not?", "text": "Context: I'm (F18) about to go to college. I originally thought I'd be able to go to one in my town and stay at home with my parents, but I just learned that I will not be able to do that. I have to move to the main campus that's about 45 minutes away from where I live. I'm not lying when I say that I've genuinely cried most of the day at the idea of leaving my family- specifically my mom and my elderly grandma, and I'd have to leave my old cat at my house as well. I'm super excited to go to this college, and I know I'm gonna love it there, but moving out is gonna be so hard for me. Commuting from my house to the school isn't an option either, as it'd cost way too much in gas to do that.", "author": null, "created": 1580435335, "retrieved": 1632960486, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fg1zn8x": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ewgnrq/how_did_you_handle_moving_out_on_your_own_for_the/fg1zn8x/", "text": "First 2 or 3 days were kind of tough, after that I\u2019ve found it to be really great.
