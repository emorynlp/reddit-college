I'm currently studying \"Tourism Guidance\" in a Turkish university (\"Yes there is a degree for tour guiding and I know its weird\"). The thing is I always loved the idea of traveling and interracting with people but I also just love the spirit of freelancing so I'm thinking about pursuing masters In the field of Interpretation. Unfortunately universities In Turkey mostly unrecognized overseas expect few. How much of a problem is that when pursuing a masters In overseas. I just want to have an accredited masters degree so I can find a job outside of Turkey when I need It In the long run. Could you guys help me out please?. I'm also open for any other tips and guidance on this whole masters thing.", "author": "Ogi-Chan", "created": 1584930924, "retrieved": 1632848326, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
