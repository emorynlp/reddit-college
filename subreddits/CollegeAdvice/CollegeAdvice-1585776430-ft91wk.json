I've had a scholarship these past two years that covers tuition and on campus housing but is a set amount each year. However, my university will lower my scholarship if I live off campus. So my question is: What would the ramifications be if I chose to live in an off campus apartment but chose to reserve the cheapest room type on campus in order to maximize my refund?", "author": "broke-boi-throwaway", "created": 1585776430, "retrieved": 1632848321, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"fm5uwk0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ft91wk/financial_aid_advice/fm5uwk0/", "text": "If they found out they could probably revoke the scholarship and still put you on the hook for the on campus housing. You would need to read both the scholarship and housing contract for stipulations that could trigger a penalty. Trust me you are not the first to consider this as an option and the school has probably had this issue before.", "author": "drock13", "created": 1585780447, "upvotes": 1}}}
