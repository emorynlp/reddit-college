  "text": "Hey all, so I\u2019ve been thinking about, well, college and the fact that U.S college is extremely expensive. I\u2019m pretty sure I can get some financial aid from colleges and potentially my school, but I was wondering if anyone has some obscure way or something to get more aid. This most may just be a shot in the dark but anything is appreciated. Thanks!",
