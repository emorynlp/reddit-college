So, after many years of procrastination and frustration, I\u2019m back in the school game! (Woot) im working on my associates in Computer Science at a community college, and upon transfer to a 4-year school, I\u2019m in a bit of a kerfuffle. I\u2019m trying to get some insight on if going for my bachelors in both CS and Computer Engineering, going for my BS/MS in CS, or a combination of both (double bachelors then MS in CS) would be most beneficial. I\u2019m aware of the taxation on my time, money, and sanity any of these would entail. Let\u2019s just assume it\u2019s a perfect world and money/energy wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Any thoughts? \n\nEdit: \u201cmost beneficial\u201d in the sense of job placement and salary.", "author": "ronfrohnson", "created": 1556818734, "retrieved": 1632961423, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
