(BSN)", "text": "So my issue is a little complication and has a lot of factors so let me give some background information. I am an 18-year-old who graduated highschool last year. Ultimately my goal is to get a bachelor's in nursing. And my two options would be to do a collaborative program between community college and CSUN or go to West Coast University which is a private university. I have been taking prerequisites for the nursing program at community college for a year now. However this semester I had trouble getting into classes as most of them are full before I can even apply. This is the reason I started looking at going to West Coast because there I would graduate faster. To make this simpler I will just list the pros and cons to both.\n\n**Community College**\n\nPros:\n\n* It will cost approximately 30k to get a BSN, if not a little more.\n* It is closer to my house. Probably a 20 min of driving saved both ways.\n* The flexibility of choosing when to do classes. \n* Possibly easier classes.\n* There will be multiple breaks, like spring break and summer break.\n\nCons:\n\n* It will take me a minimum of 4.5 years to graduate, possibly more if I can't get into classes.\n* I would consider it a worse learning experience.\n\n**West Coast University**\n\nPros:\n\n* Cooler Experience. I have visited the campus and it looks so much more interesting.\n* I will graduate in 2.5 years from now guaranteed.\n* I don't need to find classes or do anything, I am guaranteed a schedule. \n* Classes are 10 weeks long so it is accelerated but you have fewer classes in a term. I personally like that. I would rather take one class at a time quickly than multiple classes slowly over time.\n\nCons:\n\n* Cost around 96K for BSN. (It is normally 145K, but I can transfer my prerequisites.)\n* It is a decent drive. Upwards of 40 or 50 minutes in traffic.\n* Almost no breaks and it is an intense program. (I think the only break is winter break).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I want to go to west coast as I basically saving more than 2 years and I can start working faster. The only thing stopping me is I don't want to live with a 100K student loan. Theoretically, It shouldn't be too hard to pay off since I currently have almost no expenses as I live with my parents. Ultimately, my question is: is it worth to take out a loan?\n\nThank you for your help, if you have any questions or want to know more specifics, I will be happy to answer as soon as possible in the comments.", "author": "ivangboss", "created": 1584060195, "retrieved": 1632848328, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
