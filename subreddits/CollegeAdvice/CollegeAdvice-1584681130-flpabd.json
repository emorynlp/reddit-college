My dream job is a criminal psychologist. Lots of personal experience and time has led me to this career so it really would mean the world to me. The thing is, if I go for a PhD- that\u2019s a lot of money! I\u2019m upper middle class, so I have a huge advantage- but i can\u2019t live on this \u201cdaddy\u2019s money\u201d concept forever. Basically i\u2019m stuck at what i should aim for. Money is the top priority but I surely don\u2019t wanna hate what I do if I can avoid that. I get A\u2019s and B\u2019s and consider myself to have a strong work ethic- but is it worth the risk of massive debt? I can\u2019t decide..", "author": "sunnyjeffries", "created": 1584681130, "retrieved": 1632848326, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fl2r15g": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/flpabd/should_i_invest_in_a_phd_in_psychology/fl2r15g/", "text": "My uncle was a criminal psychologist (I think that was his title, a common part of his job was determining if convicts are fine to be released)(he's retired now) from my encounters with him he said he got his masters and then was asked to go back to school (I believe more than once). I believe none of his schooling was paid for, which includes the time he was working and attending school. I think he got a reduced college rate, because he is handicapped so if you have to pay off the college debt a PhD may be a bit much at the start (they may ask you to go back to school a few years after starting work anyway so spacing it may make it easier financially on you; however going back to school has its drawbacks too).", "author": "IICrimson_DaggerII", "created": 1584757725, "upvotes": 1}, "fl22t4c": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/flpabd/should_i_invest_in_a_phd_in_psychology/fl22t4c/", "text": "Im gonna suggest no if you don\u2019t have any or a good amount for financial aid.
