  "text": "So I decided this week I'm changing majors from public admin to Comp Sci. \n\nI have at least two semesters of math and science to take as prereqs in order to get into the program.\n\nDo any comp sci students have any advice for a terrible math student? Drop the resources that most helped you.\n\nI switched not because I didn't like my major, but because I didn't like the job prospects of it. \n\nI'm not sure what I want to do with the comp sci degree yet but I like the flexibility and stability that will come with it.",

It\u2019s almost impossible, especially paid ones, unless you\u2019re in DC. \nI\u2019m between Comp Sci and Finance. Working in the public sector is always an option. But I think having a degree that is more adaptable is best.",
