I want to be a civil engineer once I graduate. I have always been a nerd in the sense that I always did well without studying or picking up a book. I feel gifted in math/sciences, I am so embarassed that my grades don't reflect this.\n\nI got a literal 4.0 in Chemistry I. Top of the class.\n\nIn Chemistry II, I got a professor that yelled at you for answering questions :( (I failed) , then one that never asked questions or cared (I withdrew), then a very great one (I fucked up. Failed), then one that was very smart but had a very hard to understand accent and was hard to engage with (I got a 'D').\nBad professors and a lazy student don't mix.\nIs this fixable? I will do anything and everything from now on!", "author": "marzbarz21", "created": 1565837581, "retrieved": 1632848880, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ewwy9dr": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cqk50k/flunked_chemistry_ii_twice_withdrew_once_and_got/ewwy9dr/", "text": "Are you asking can you continue on in your degree or how to fix the issue of you not being successful?", "author": "drock13", "created": 1565838532, "upvotes": 1}}}
