I don't know if you still need this advice since this was posted 5 months ago, but here it is anyway:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am definitely biased because I graduated from Oberlin last year, but I can tell you I absolutely loved my experience. From the little I know about Kenyon, it's slightly better at sports than we are and ranked a notch higher in academics, but Oberlin's music scene can't be beat. \n\nMy favourite thing about Oberlin was how supportive the students were. There certainly is academic rigor, but nobody is cut throat levels of competitive. I also loved the freedom we had and the wackiness and personality of campus. \n\nThose are some general points; feel free to message me with more questions if you're still deciding!", "author": "laniekiddo", "created": 1569127291, "upvotes": 1}}}
