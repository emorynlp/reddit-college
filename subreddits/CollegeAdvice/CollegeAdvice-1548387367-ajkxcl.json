I've lived away from home for almost two years and I feel like it would be weird. help!!", "text": " My family is moving to a college town in another state because my dad got a job at said college. If I go to that school, I can get in-state tuition AND save $10,000 a year ($40,000 by the end of my undergrad) by living at home. However, I'm scared I will have a worse college experience overall, and will be thinking about how I am missing out.  \n\n\nBy the time I graduate high school, I would have lived in dorms for 2 years and I know it would be very strange to go back to living at home. I didn't have many friends freshman or sophomore year so I didn't need to set boundaries with my parents about going out or having friends over. Now, I know how deep friendships can become by living with peers, and how I won't be making friendships like that in the so-called \"best years of my life\" in college. Some of my best friends have been formed BECAUSE I lived down the hall from them. Also at boarding school, I've learned a lot about independence. I know how to balance sleep, friends, and grades; how to utilize office hours; how to keep my room clean without someone telling me to; etc.  \n\n\nOutside of what I've learned at boarding school, I've (obsessively) read tons of academic articles about the psychological differences and effects between commuters and residential students in college. From what I've read, commuters lack in \"enriching educational experiences\" and \"student interactions with faculty members\". It looks like commuting students are less engaged in student life. Will I really have the same probability of making close friends by going to student events or getting an on-campus job as I would if lived in the dorms? Could my grades be better if choose to live in the dorms?  \n\n\nI've tried to research what it's like to commute to this specific school and what the school does for commuters, but I couldn't find much. Is that a bad sign??  \n\n\nEvery time I DO go home, I'm reminded me of all the things I didn't like about living with my family (talking about school an unhealthy amount, chores, feeling socially unproductive (that probably doesn't make sense)).  \n\n\nThat being said, I have a pretty good relationship with my parents (if I didn't, I wouldn't be considering this college), and this school is actually at the top of my list right now (not just because there's a chance I could save a lot of money, but also because of the academics and social life).  \n\n\nHas anyone else experienced any situation similar to this?  \n\n\nTL;DR: Is it worth $40,000 to forgo friendships that can only be made by living in the dorms? Can money buy me a social life? (There's obviously bias in these questions please try to help me with an unbiased answer) ", "author": "chocolatelab19", "created": 1548387367, "retrieved": 1632849341, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"efufhut": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ajkxcl/should_i_live_at_home_during_college_ive_lived/efufhut/", "text": "Honestly, saving money is such a huge deal- I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\nYes, it\u2019s fun to have the typical college experience, but at what cost? \n\nI\u2019m 30, and so many of my friends are knee-deep in student loan debts because they elected to have that experience. \n\nI decided to stay at home, and attend a university here, and graduated debt free.

I would have been devastated to miss out on something as big as dorm life as a first year student.

If you\u2019re still on the fence, live in dorms your first year at college like someone else recommended. If it doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference to you, then you can go back home.
