I plan to apply to all of the best schools for that program (MIT, GT, UTK, etc.) but I am not super confident that MIT is going to admit me. If I study at a Mexican university, (namely, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, although I am also looking at some of the other high quality engineering programs) will my masters degree from that university be respected by a doctorate program or an employer (either in industry or at a national lab) in the United States? How much should I prioritize studying at a domestic university?\n\nthanks in advance for any responses.", "author": "i12day", "created": 1563229058, "retrieved": 1632960991, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
