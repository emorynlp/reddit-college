  "text": "If someone has already taken the standardized test before the Corona pandemic and did well, will it increase their chances of getting into a good college? People studied throughout the summer and beginning of the school year focusing on getting a good score, which may have lead to lower grades in school. Would it be fair for colleges to accept another student who has not taken the SAT/ACT but had better grades since they were able to focus solely on school? I studied hard for the ACT and got a good score but will this be overlooked as standardized tests are no longer mandatory?",

      "text": "I have seen a lot of upper-tier schools announce test-optional admissions, where you *can* submit SAT or ACT scores, but it is not a requirement for a complete admission file. That being said, at least in my office, a good ACT score will still take you further than a comparable applicant not reporting scores.",
