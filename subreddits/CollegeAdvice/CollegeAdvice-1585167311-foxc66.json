  "text": "i am currently studying psychology and I don't know if I really wanna do this for the rest of my life. the thing is that I was doing business last year so if I change again this year I will have lost two years of my life, I am scared that I won't like the thing I'll do next, that I'll be a disappointment to my mom, that I will never find something I like. is it really worth changing my major and trying something new, even if I am not certain of liking it ?",
