  "text": "Are there any recourses, such as websites, that analyze and publish data regarding the political leanings of colleges? It would be especially helpful to find a resource that breaks down the various departments/majors within universities and looks at each of them individually. I\u2019m also more focused on the curriculum/faculty side of things over against the student body/clubs/etc. (though I do care about that as well).\n\nThere seem to be a lot of recourses regarding other factors such as age demographics, population, etc. but I can\u2019t find anything with much substantive detail regarding prevalent ideologies and such. The closest I can find is Niche.com which ranks \u201cmost conservative colleges\u201d and \u201cmost liberal colleges\u201d without any other details or further information. I don\u2019t even know what factors they use to reach their conclusions or how they measure and rank the \u201cconservativeness\u201d and \u201cliberalness\u201d of a college.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
