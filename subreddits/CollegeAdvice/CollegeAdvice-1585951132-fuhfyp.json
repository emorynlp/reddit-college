I am making the choice between two colleges currently (this one and umass Amherst), and I was wondering if anyone could tell me about their program (I would major in mech engi), as I cannot find much about it. Also if you have any input for a choice it would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you :) (UMass- accepted CHC with 14k scholarship, same price as bucknell)",
