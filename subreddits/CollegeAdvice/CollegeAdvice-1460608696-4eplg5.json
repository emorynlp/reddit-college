That's really the only way to look at it. I've taken two breaks in my bachelor's degree and keep coming back as soon as I'm able. It is scary living in limbo (especially forced limbo) but don't feel guilty or anything for not actively working on credits. Do what you have to do and forget what the 'normal' path is. If you feel like you need to keep the academic juices flowing to stay prepared for your eventual return, read whatever you can get your hands on about your degree subject. You'll probably be in better shape when you get back to school, and eager to continue. Good luck, and I hope your financial situation works out.", "author": "StarshipBooper", "created": 1475564732, "upvotes": 1}, "d66x94i": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/4eplg5/im_taking_a_break_and_im_worried/d66x94i/", "text": "If you love the classes and believe you can do it, then more power to you.
