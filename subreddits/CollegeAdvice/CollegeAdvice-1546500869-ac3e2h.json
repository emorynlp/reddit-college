But the following two semester I barely missed the requirements to get off probation and am about to go into my third straight semester. I\u2019m not longer happy, I feel very stupid, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m just going to continue to barely squeak pass in school. So I don\u2019t wanna be an engineer anymore. What I believe I would like to do is major in political science as history, government, and writing have always been my stronger subjects and I have a deep interest into how government works. The only problem is my mom doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve brought up changing my major a couple of times and it\u2019s been \u201cyou wanted to be an engineer\u201d or \u201cyou have to talk to your advisor\u201d or \u201cjust tell them you\u2019re not a good test taker\u201d (I\u2019m not) I think the main concern is that she understands what I\u2019ll do with a degree in engineering. Engineering degree = job as an engineer but with a degree in political science there\u2019s a lot of paths I can go down career wise so it\u2019s not as clear. I know she just wants me to be successful so I can have a better life than what she had and she wants what\u2019s best for me but I don\u2019t know how to just explain to her that I want to switch to political science because I\u2019m not happy and I will still be successful.
