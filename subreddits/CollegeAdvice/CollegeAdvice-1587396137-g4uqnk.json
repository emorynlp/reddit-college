I'm at a community college getting my DTA. The plan is two years at this college then transfer to a 4 year college in my state. I am in the humanities and my current plan is a history major. I've enjoyed my history classes but I've found that I hate quarter long research papers. I've really been enjoying my American Government class. My math classes have been whatever and I don't like my English classes. I'm pretty conservative so I haven't enjoyed my self-proclaimed feminist teachers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found that I like 19th and 20th century history and American/European government.

If you know what you want to do for your career, it will help you decide what to study but the subjects you are interested in could also help you determine your career.\n\nIf you don't know what you would like to do after graduation,  just stick to the courses/major that interests you.  I would suggest looking at political science as a major. Look at the required classes for that and see if it interests you.  Know though that any of these classes may also require you to write quarter long research papers.  Take  an intro level political science course next quarter and see if you like it, if you haven't already.  If you already did, take a different one (not from the same sequence).  If you decide you want to major in political science, then maybe you can take the history classes as a minor but look at the minor requirements for it first.  If you can't take the classes you want for the minor then look to an online program from another university or just take a few classes during the summer.\n\nYou could also look into American Studies and European Studies as a major.  However, these two may not be available at every university.", "author": "philatellie", "created": 1588624916, "upvotes": 1}, "fo1682k": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g4uqnk/classesjobs_with_what_ive_currently_doneenjoyed/fo1682k/", "text": "Your classes depend on what you intend to do with your degree. As a second year student, you should be considering your major's impact on your field and select courses that take you there.
