I don't really enjoy german, but because of how easy the class is, I'm able to be involved in the German national honor  society at my school. Thing is, if I drop german, gnhs goes along with it. I don't know if it would be more beneficial for me to stay in German for the honor society, or take another ap class...what should I do?", "author": "Chloean19", "created": 1517548476, "retrieved": 1632959962, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
