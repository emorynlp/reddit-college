Help?", "text": "So last semester I transfered to UT Arlington to pursue electrical engineering. In that degree a lot of math is required and it isn't really my strong suit, so this semester I switched to Software engineering which requires less math classes. Last semester I took calc 2 and failed so I decided to retake it this semester and try to get through it. Now I'm starting to feel I might fail it again and that engineering isn't for me. Thing is I never told my parents that I failed it and they don't know I'm retaking it. A part of me wants to drop the class and take it at a community college, but then I'd have to tell my parents and I would no longer be full time and would probably lose a grant that I have. Another part of me wants to just switch majors all together to business or something like that with a much more simple math. What should I do guys?", "author": "Pepe_The_Abuser", "created": 1581483209, "retrieved": 1632848336, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fhdhyh0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f2lthd/20m_going_through_college_but_struggling_in_my/fhdhyh0/", "text": "Your school probably has some sort of tutoring.  Many people find math tough and need tutoring.  Please see if you can get tutoring.  Depending on your college, you may be able to get help from tutor, TA, or the professor. Get help. You may need to talk to your advisor as well about your options... whether to stick with the major you are in or to switch.  Many people do switch.  Hopefully you have a decent advisor who can help you figure out best options.  One thing you do not want to do is jeopardize your aid. Do not drop any class without figuring that out.  Each situation is different, but usually it is best to communicate with parents, especially if they are paying for your schooling. It\u2019s better to be upfront and honest as soon as you can.  You will feel better and they may be supportive. Good luck.", "author": "mollymarie123", "created": 1581486915, "upvotes": 1}, "fhdhse7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f2lthd/20m_going_through_college_but_struggling_in_my/fhdhse7/", "text": "Electrical Engineering Major here.\n\nAnyone who says they\u2019re not strong in math will never get good at it. Math requires practice every day. Consistency is key; the trick to beat Calc 2 is to understand initial concepts and apply it elsewhere, especially since intergration and series are everything in EE. At this point, anyone can learn the math if they are willing to put effort into it. \n\nEverything in STEM is self teachable\u2014there\u2019s so many online resources you can use to help pull yourself up. I\u2019d recommend Professor Leonard on youtube to learn the concepts. For learning how to solve problems, PatrickJMT on youtubr is the man. If you just need a quick reference, Paul\u2019s online notes has a ton of calculus reference pages for every calculus topic. \n\nAll of the above tips is applicable to calc 1-3 and diff Eq. \n\nAs far as changing your major goes, I would advise sticking to software engineering (or go back to electrical engineering) because business degrees aren\u2019t so great anymore, unless you plan to go to accounting or finance. While the math isn\u2019t as hard,  both of these degrees are arithmetic heavy. In other words, math is a necessary prerequisite to having a solid career. You could go to r/learnmath and ask for a general set of guidelines to figure out how you should study for math and build mathematical intuition. \n\nGood luck, and keep studying.", "author": "WidjarjarBinks", "created": 1581486759, "upvotes": 1}}}
