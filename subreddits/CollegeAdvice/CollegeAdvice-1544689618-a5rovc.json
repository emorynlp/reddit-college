I take complete responsibility for that. The class consists of 1 Midterm, 10 participation points (reporting court cases twice), and 1 Final. My situation is that I know for a fact that I participated twice this past quarter to get the full points which equals 10% of my final grade, however, my professor forgot that I participated once really early into the quarter and never gave me the points for it. I ended the quarter with a 56%, but if I had the extra 5 points, I would have a 61% and technically would have passed the class. Am I right in feeling livid even though I know I did absolutely shit this quarter?

Next semester would have been my last, but by taking on the extra retake-course that I know under better circumstances I am able to get a solid A in, i decided it was better than trying to squabble for a mediocre GPA with a barely passing grade and possible effect on my other major-related courses as well. It\u2019s not the first time either. I retook two courses my sophomore year after coming down with pneumonia during finals my freshman year. \n\nI think if you just retake the class you can do fine and even do better because you\u2019ll know to participate more often and be more prepared for the final and get the grade you deserve. We aren\u2019t obligated to finish school in the 4-year timeline, and not doing so doesn\u2019t make you any less competent than those who do. If anything, taking the extra time and learning and coming out better looks good compared to those who breezed by with just passing or those who sacrificed too much to squeeze perfection into the \u201cexpected timeline\u201d. I\u2019m 28 years old, btw, and in my 2nd attempt at getting my degree after a major change and several years hiatus. \n\nDon\u2019t panic or feel shit about yourself, and sure blame the professor for being stupid and not remembering that one time you participated and just see this as an opportunity for a second chance to do even better and come out wiser. Best of luck. ", "author": "khaleesi_onthatbeat", "created": 1544697042, "upvotes": 2}}}
