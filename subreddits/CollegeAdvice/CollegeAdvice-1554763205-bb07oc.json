I really do not want to go to  county college, as a preference, because i took all of these AP classes just to go to a college open to everyone. I understand that sounds arrogant and there is nothing wrong with a county college i just really want to have a college experience. \nThey will not help me pay for Rowan and i only recieved $2000 worth of aid. Idk what else to do.

Would you rather spend a thousand  or so dollars or several thousands of dollars and student loans on top of that to take the exact same classes? You want the \u201ccollege\u201d experience but you can still get that without living on a college campus. Make friends with people at the school, or at any local colleges. I\u2019m sure you think your parents are being unreasonable right now but trust me they are trying to help you. College c\u0336a\u0336n\u0336 \u0336b\u0336e\u0336 is expensive.

A while back at a college visit I sat down and talked one on one with the chair of the dept. I was interested in.
