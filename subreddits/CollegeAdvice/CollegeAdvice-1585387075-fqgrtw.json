What can I do?", "text": "I am a third-year engineering student majoring in Electronics and Communications Engineering from India. I am from a tier-2 college and my college doesn't have any facilities for research and development. I have been studying on my own and finished subjects using books I found on the internet. I read PRML for Machine Learning, Convex Optimization by S. Boyd, Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto, Underactuated robotics by MIT OCW, and many others. I found a very good research internship at a top college and was hoping to do some good work there. But due to coronavirus, my internship is nearly canceled and I don't know what to do. I want to go for a Ph.D. after my bachelors but I don't have much research experience.\n\nCan someone suggest anything?", "author": "curious_sapien99", "created": 1585387075, "retrieved": 1632848323, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
