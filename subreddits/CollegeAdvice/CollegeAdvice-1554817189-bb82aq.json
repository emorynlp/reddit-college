  "text": "So I got a normal iPad 9.7 2018 model for Christmas. I\u2019ve barely picked up my MacBook since then. If you have access to school desktops I would highly recommend getting a tablet. The iPad is only $300. Compared to the $1000 MacBook that I barely use and don\u2019t need anymore. Probably going to sell it. It\u2019s lighter also.
