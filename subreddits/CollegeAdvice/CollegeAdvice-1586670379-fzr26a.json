I have a lot of time on my hands now due to the corona virus and there\u2019s a May semester coming up and I\u2019m not sure if I should go for it or not. I am also on an academic hold or financial aid hold because I withdrew from my classes in the fall due to some mental health stuff. I just have to pay back some money then I should register. I also had a lot of trouble deciding if I should stick to the major I was in before (nursing) or change to undecided because I still don\u2019t know if it is the right major for me. I already completed two classes in the summer last year. If there\u2019s anybody that is in college and would also like to give advice about being a parent and going to college at the same time that would be great.", "author": "brianalopez90", "created": 1586670379, "retrieved": 1632848315, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {}}
