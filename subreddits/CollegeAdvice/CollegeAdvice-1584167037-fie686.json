  "title:": "Being charged with Academic Dishonesty",
  "text": "Im taking an online course and we took the midterm last week. I took the test, some short answers, mostly multiple choice. I didn\u2019t do well. I shrugged it off. Yesterday morning, I got an email accusing me of academic dishonesty. I didn\u2019t cheat at all. I\u2019ve never cheated in my life. Im almost in tears because I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. The teacher isn\u2019t just taking it up privately, he\u2019s filed paperwork against me. I don\u2019t think even know how to deal with this. I emailed the professor explaining that I didn\u2019t cheat and he hasn\u2019t gotten back to me. In the initial email, he says he has ample evidence against me. I don\u2019t know what he has as it was an online (canvas) midterm that I didn\u2019t even cheat on. He\u2019s posted class updates during the day but still didn\u2019t respond to my efforts to discuss this issue. I don\u2019t even want to be in this class anymore because it makes me feel sick to my stomach whenever I think of the situation. I went to a school counselor and they said I should be fine and most likely nothing will happen once I have a conversation with the professor. Any advice?",

If it is decided that you cheated, keep fighting it. Go to the dean (provided he is not part of the hearing) and talk to them about it. I would also (discreetly) see if you can find anyone who has taken his class before who has dealt with something like this. Like, maybe go to ratemyprofessor.com and look him up and see what people have said and if anyone had a similar experience. I\u2019m sorry this is happening.",

He will stop at nothing to catch someone cheating. This is what scares me because obviously he has some reason to suspect me, what if it\u2019s something that I can fight? My guess is that my answers matched up with another students, I did the test too fast, or there was a glitch and it said I opened another tab. I swear I did not cheat.",
