I took the test, some short answers, mostly multiple choice. I didn\u2019t do well. I shrugged it off. Yesterday morning, I got an email accusing me of academic dishonesty. I didn\u2019t cheat at all. I\u2019ve never cheated in my life. Im almost in tears because I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. The teacher isn\u2019t just taking it up privately, he\u2019s filed paperwork against me. I don\u2019t think even know how to deal with this. I emailed the professor explaining that I didn\u2019t cheat and he hasn\u2019t gotten back to me. In the initial email, he says he has ample evidence against me. I don\u2019t know what he has as it was an online (canvas) midterm that I didn\u2019t even cheat on. He\u2019s posted class updates during the day but still didn\u2019t respond to my efforts to discuss this issue. I don\u2019t even want to be in this class anymore because it makes me feel sick to my stomach whenever I think of the situation. I went to a school counselor and they said I should be fine and most likely nothing will happen once I have a conversation with the professor.
