I am currently in my freshman year of college at an out of state university. I am originally from California, but I decided that it would be a great idea to get far away from home and step out of my comfort zone. The school I am at is really nice. The campus is beautiful and I've made quite a few friends here, but the out of state tuition is absolutely atrocious. I made the mistake of not looking into the finances when deciding to come here.

This has worried me quite a bit, because I do not want to risk the chance of getting rejected and getting stuck here. Also financially it seems a bit unrealistic. My first choice was UCSB because I already have a friend there, and the campus is gorgeous. I am also told that their Linguistics program is very good (I am a Linguistics major). I am now considering finishing one year here, dropping and going to community college for a year, and then transferring to UCSB.  \n>  \n>Here comes the next issue...the recommendation for linguistics majors is 2 years of one language and one year of a non-European language prior to transfer. My community college back home only offers Spanish. The language I started here is German. I can't really continue German if they don't offer it at any of the local ccs in my hometown. It's a complicated situation, but I really just want to here other's feedback. I think we can all agree that dropping out after a year and going to community college is better for me financially, but what am I supposed to do if I can't finish my major requirements at any cc.

I am from CA.  The rules for transfer can be complicated if you are not doing the traditional cc to uc route.  I would try to talk to an admissions counselor at a UC if you can find one willing to talk or at a junior college and if you can\u2019t find anyone to talk to even check w your old high school counselor.   It\u2019s important for you to find out the exact rules before making any decisions.  Also, talk to the financial aid office of the school you are at now to see if you could get better aid.", "author": "mollymarie123", "created": 1581440732, "upvotes": 1}, "fha5krg": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f23l4g/what_should_i_do/fha5krg/", "text": ">Hello all, I am looking for some advice regarding my current situation.
