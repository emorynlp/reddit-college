  "title:": "UC Berkeley vs UC Irvine",
  "text": "Hi!\n\nI got into UC Irvine for Computer Science and Engineering, which was the major that I wanted to major in. \n\nAt Berkeley, I applied for Data Science and I got in today, but I am not sure where to go to. I did not apply for EECS because I knew it was too competitive it is something I would not get into or enjoy at Berkeley.\n\nI am not exactly sure what I love to do yet, and I am worried that I won't like engineering, but I am also worried that I won't like Data Science but will not be able to switch into the College of Engineering at Berkeley.\n\nI know it seems obvious that I should go to Berkeley, but I always hear bad things about the place like it is very dirty, super competitive, compact, and that there is like nothing to do there compared to SoCal. It also sucks because I cannot visit any of the college this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on which school I should go to and why. :( it would mean a lot. thank you!!!!",

If you do go to Berkeley though, be prepared to work hard.  Nothing but good will come from working hard at college.",
