I did not apply for EECS because I knew it was too competitive it is something I would not get into or enjoy at Berkeley.\n\nI am not exactly sure what I love to do yet, and I am worried that I won't like engineering, but I am also worried that I won't like Data Science but will not be able to switch into the College of Engineering at Berkeley.\n\nI know it seems obvious that I should go to Berkeley, but I always hear bad things about the place like it is very dirty, super competitive, compact, and that there is like nothing to do there compared to SoCal. It also sucks because I cannot visit any of the college this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on which school I should go to and why. :( it would mean a lot. thank you!!!!", "author": "PhysicalPoem2", "created": 1585290662, "retrieved": 1632848324, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"flmwemz": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fps42k/uc_berkeley_vs_uc_irvine/flmwemz/", "text": "Depending on whichever curriculum suits you better, or check out the jobs you can do out of either major", "author": "WpandaReddit", "created": 1585299504, "upvotes": 1}}}
