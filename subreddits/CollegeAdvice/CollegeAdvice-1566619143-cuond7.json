I\u2019m not going into that in this story but basically I wasn\u2019t hopeful for my future at all and trying to make big decisions wasn\u2019t easy for me at the time. I also wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted in a school at all. I had no idea if I wanted a big or small school, one that was close to home or far away, or what type of location it should be in, etc. Everything looked the same to me when I went online and looked, and visiting places didn\u2019t help either.\nSo when the time came for me to actually start applying to schools, I was pretty much picking from a list of schools that I knew of that might be a good fit for me, but I wasn\u2019t really sure. I didn\u2019t pick many reach schools because I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t get into college at all, so a lot of them were safety schools. Most of them were state schools, two were private. I ended up getting into all of them, which was great but didn\u2019t help me decide.\nDeciding on which one to go to was a nightmare, but I settled on one of the state schools at the last minute. My family didn\u2019t have the money to send me to one of the private schools, which I\u2019m fine with. But after constantly thinking about whether I made the right choice, I am now just filled with anxiety and fear. I feel like no matter how much thought I put into it, I may not have picked the right school. After I made the decision, I started to think more about what I actually wanted. The school I picked is in a more rural area, but now I\u2019m wondering if I would be better off in the city. I also would love to be near the ocean. These are things I didn\u2019t realize while I was deciding, and I didn\u2019t think they were important.\nThe school I chose is affordable and fine for my major (psychology) but I\u2019m so afraid of whether or not I will be happy there. High school was not that great for me, so I want to make college a better experience. I\u2019m just terrified that by choosing the wrong school, I will be setting myself up to have a horrible time. I just wish I was excited to be attending a dream school (which I currently don\u2019t have) but I\u2019m not excited at all. Is this normal for incoming freshman to feel?\nI know that I should be trying to think as positively as possible or else it will be a bad experience no matter what, but I\u2019m wondering what transferring is like. If in a worse case scenario I end up wanting to transfer, Will it ruin the college experience for me? Would it be hard starting at a new school? No matter how much I convince myself that everything will be fine, I just can\u2019t stop thinking about this.", "author": "emjennab", "created": 1566619143, "retrieved": 1632848870, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"eyncozp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cuond7/im_starting_school_in_two_days_and_im_not_excited/eyncozp/", "text": "Hey there, just wanted to say that I feel for you. I am an incoming freshman this year as well! I think that some of the best things you can do right now is to explore your college and all it has to offer: it\u2019s people- staff and students- join clubs that interest you, or maybe put you out of your comfort zone just a little bit. And give it some time to adjust to your surroundings. If it still doesn\u2019t feel right after a few weeks, and you\u2019ve reached out to support systems at your school, then maybe it\u2019s not the right fit. And there\u2019s NOTHING wrong with that!! If you do decide to transfer to a new school, I believe that most schools have programs for incoming transfer students that get them to know other transfer students and help them transition from the old university to their new one.\nI wish you the best of luck and I hope that you end up loving your college experience :)\n\nEdit: the original post was put up a week ago, so let me know how you\u2019re feeling now!", "author": "gabchristine16", "created": 1567241583, "upvotes": 2}, "exyc8if": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/cuond7/im_starting_school_in_two_days_and_im_not_excited/exyc8if/", "text": "As an incoming freshman like you, I can relate to this as well since my school is also in a super rural area. I feel like its really up to you whether you can enjoy the ride or not, by checking out student activities or clubs, maybe exploring the local area.
