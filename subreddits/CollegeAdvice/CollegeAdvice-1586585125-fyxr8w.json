I\u2019ve had so much time even before quarantine to think about what I want out of life and I guess the barbering seems to align with more of that. With Med lab I was happy to help people but overall I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what I want in the end...but I feel like I\u2019m throwing out such a good opportunity. If I were to do barbering it\u2019d be a full commitment as I\u2019d want to open up a little shop someday so it couldn\u2019t be something on the side. Sorry about the rant but life just threw me for a loop haha and I\u2019m not sure what to do. Any advice or if you have a similar experience would be great. \n\nTLDR: maybe don\u2019t go for the scientific \u201cguaranteed\u201d career and follow more of a trade that might make me happier.", "author": "abcd_18", "created": 1586585125, "retrieved": 1632848316, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fn2kkxp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fyxr8w/got_into_medical_program_not_sure_its_what_i/fn2kkxp/", "text": "I also go to a similar, if not the same program, and it is quite stressful, but it's something that I wanted.
