I am going to be starting my freshman year of college this month and since I\u2019m attending a university close to me, I\u2019m commuting. I have friends going to this university that are living on campus because they want the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. Am I missing out on these experiences because I am a commuter? My worst nightmare is that I don\u2019t make friends as well or feel included because I don\u2019t live on campus. Are there any other people who commuter to college that felt this way? Are these things true, or am I just being paranoid?

However, I am good friends with some commuter students who decided to hang around the dorms, and they were getting most of the experience. Some of the time I forgot they didn't live on campus. So there is still hope for you. Just try to network and find a group you like, and don't be afraid to ask to tag along to events on campus. I wish you the best of luck", "author": "agent-doge", "created": 1564901502, "upvotes": 3}}}
