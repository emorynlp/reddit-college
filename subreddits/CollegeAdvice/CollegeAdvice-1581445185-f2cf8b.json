  "text": "Okay so. I\u2019m a high school senior and I\u2019m trying to make my decision on what college to go to in the fall and I need to make a decision soon. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to 2 schools. It pretty much comes down to \u201cdo I go where I want or where is cheapest?\u201d but there\u2019s also some other things that factor into it so here\u2019s my pros and cons list:\n\nCollege #1)\n-2 hours from my hometown, a pretty decent distance in my opinion\n-Many people from my high school go to this college, including my ex boyfriend that was really hard to get over (this is a con, but I don\u2019t want it to affect my decision too much)\n-I got a lot of scholarships and grants from this school and it would be pretty much paid for\n-they are well known for having a good program in what I want to major in\n-I don\u2019t really like the town or campus that much \n\nCollege #2)\n-4 hours from campus \n-$10k a year after my financial aid package because it\u2019s out of state\n-I really love the town\n-campus is nice, has nice bathrooms\n-lots of snow, this is a con tbh\n-Close to where my best friend that moved away a couple of years ago is going to college\n-I only know like 2 people from my high school that go there so it feels like a fresh start\n\nLet me know what you think. People that have student debt, how bad is it really?? Also I\u2019m planning on going into teaching so I have to keep that in mind when thinking about debt.",

      "text": "Ok, if you were one of my students I would tell you that looking at the ROI difference is negligible. Now personally I would look at your total indebtedness next. Depending on what your financial aid package looks like (idk if there are loans involved in college 1 or 2) to me a 10k loan a year seems rather high. I usually recommend staying at or lower than the national average which is about 30-35k and that would put you at over 40k (probably closer to 50k depending on interest). It also depends on you EFC and what your parents can afford towards college. However it is your decision at the end of the day, just make sure you have all your info before hand and understand what that is going to mean for you",
