Long story short, i have vastly different views than my classmates, and they take offense to my viewpoint. It has gotten to the point where anything i said, i get backlash from one specific student, telling me i am \"one dimensional\", closed minded and begins attacking my \"grammatical errors\". Please note its a private discussion of 6 people, we are providing sources and quick thoughts and ideas. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have asked the person to stop, but every single post he writes in bold letters stating grammar errors. To add, this is the type of person who boasts about when he is obtaining his bachelors, and shares his private comments from the professor in an attempt to intimidate me. As for the professor, i provided the conversation from the group to the professor in an email, along with concerns. He does not address the issue but rather asks a idiotic question if i felt bullied, in one sentence. I am not the type of person to kiss ass and help with a project, that has a one sided viewpoint.", "author": null, "created": 1585259031, "retrieved": 1632848324, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"flme36a": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fpkcok/when_should_i_report_student_and_professor/flme36a/", "text": "If you feel like it\u2019s harassment then tell the professor you are being harassed.

The moment you take it personally or bother you means that you are letting them hurt you. Which I cant fault you for, but it is better to be tougher emotionally and mentally to the point that other people cannot hurt you with their words. Keep a cool head and only let yourself think of potential solutions to improve your situation.", "author": "CollegeSuperSenior", "created": 1585267442, "upvotes": 1}}}
