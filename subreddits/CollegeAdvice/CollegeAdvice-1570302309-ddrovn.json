I only chose it because my school requires that students choose a major. Im already in my second month and I hate the idea of going into film and i hate working with computers and cameras and editing and all that. Im already failing the class and despise waking up in the morning to to it. If i drop it, ill get a w on my transcript which shows that i dropped the class so far into it. I already chose a new major that makes me happier and i no longer need this film class because obviously im no longer going into it. But i dont know if its the right move yet. Advice anyone? I cant talk to advisors because all they do is beg me to stay in the class and fake motivate me and im gonna have to wait 3-4 weeks to have them tell me this.", "author": "Chubss_247", "created": 1570302309, "retrieved": 1632960969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f2upega": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ddrovn/debating_on_dropping_a_class_and_getting_a_w_will/f2upega/", "text": "If you don\u2019t think about transferring to a different college then it really doesn\u2019t matter.
