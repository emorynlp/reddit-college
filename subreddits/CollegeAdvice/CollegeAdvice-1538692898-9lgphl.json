  "text": "i\u2019m a freshman at a \u201csmall elite liberal arts college\u201d in the south and there\u2019s a lot of things i really dislike about it.\n1. lack of racial/ethnic diversity- 83% of students here are white (probs bc it was named after two slavowners, one of whom was a confederate general) (you probably know the school now, if you\u2019ve heard of it) anyway, i\u2019m white, so this obviously affects me differently than students of color, especially black ones, but it still really bugs me, both at the institutional level and at a personal level. i feel as though by going here, i am being complicit in the system of white supremacy. for example, my (white) english teacher uses the n-word multiple times every class when reading or referencing quotes (it\u2019s a southern american lit class). the class is 18 white kids, including myself btw. coming from NJ i was shook when he didn\u2019t censor himself. i still don\u2019t know what to do, i don\u2019t think he should say it but idk how to speak up about it.\n2. economics- a large majority of the kids here are filthy fucking rich. like 20% are from the top 1% rich, median income of 260k+ rich. and while this doesn\u2019t make them all bad people or unfriendly, it can just be really hard to make friends, because their lives are so foreign to my lower middle class lifestyle esp bc the huge presence of greek life, which i couldn\u2019t afford to join even if i wanted to. which brings me to my next point.\n3. social scene- like i said greek life is HUUUGE here, which means partying is huge. there\u2019s actually a school sponsored bus system (named after the horse of a certain confederate general) specifically designed to take people to and from frat and srat houses. i don\u2019t drink, and i hate frat parties, and it seems like there\u2019s basically only frat parties or lame school sponsored events to go to on the weekends. it\u2019s also hard to do anything off campus bc the school is in the middle of nowhere. so i\u2019ve spent a lot of saturday nights feeling like a loser. \n4. feeling trapped- it\u2019s a super small school in the middle of no where, and i feel so trapped here. i realized too late that i wanted to go to college in a city, or at least a place with more than 2k students. so i really just feel so suffocated here.\n\ni have a group of friends, and i really like them, but i still feel left out. like everyone is better friends with eachother than me. i\u2019m trying to work on reaching out, but it\u2019s hard. being here makes me feel like my future is a black wall. like i don\u2019t wanna get to close to people bc i know in my gut that i want to leave. when i made my decision, i was lukewarm about all the schools i was choosing between (mostly small, \u201celite\u201d liberal arts school) so i ended up just going to the one that gave me the best financial aid package. but now, when i picture myself at most of them, and especially at my state school (which i didn\u2019t apply to, but should\u2019ve) i think i\u2019d be much happier at any of them. senior year marked a real decline in my mental health, first from the stress of applications and deciding, and then from my feeling of existential dread when i realized that i kind of didn\u2019t want to go where i committed to. the whole summer, i started turning into a sadder person, crying like once a week when i used to cry maybe once a month. now, i\u2019m thinking i might be depressed, and i think that the cause is my school. i\u2019m not really homesick at all, i\u2019m getting involved in clubs, working hard in my classes, trying to make friends. but my gut is telling me that i should not be here.\n\nso what i think i want to do is transfer to my state school, which is one of the better state schools in the country, and is in a city that i love. however there are a couple issues with this: \na) my boyfriend and a few of my friends from high school go there, which is not why i want to go, but i really don\u2019t want to be one of those people who is friends with/ dating all of the same people from high school. but 40k people go to the school, it\u2019s not like i won\u2019t meet a ton of new people.\nb) it\u2019s not as \u201cprestigious\u201d as the school i\u2019m at now \nc) i\u2019m worried about what people will think of me, bc there\u2019s an unfair kind of stigma that people from my state have against it. \n\ni\u2019m a little over a month in (i know, i know). but i\u2019ve never felt this awful before. i\u2019m trying to not be miserable but it\u2019s not working. and i know it\u2019s not just the adjustment period, i really think it\u2019s my environment. so i\u2019m wondering what i should do after this year. i\u2019m going to stay the whole year, but i need to decide what to do next year. should i trust my gut and transfer to my state school? or should i stick it out at a more \u201cprestigious\u201d school that i hate? \n\ntl;dr i don\u2019t like my college because i feel guilty for going to it, i don\u2019t like the social scene and i feel trapped, should i transfer at the end of the year?",
