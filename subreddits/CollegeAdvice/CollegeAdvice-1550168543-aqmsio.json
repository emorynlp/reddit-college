  "text": "Some brief background, I am in my final semester at UMass Boston. I am taking 6 courses this semester (i know thats a lot i regret it) and I have an online class right now, it is the only class this semester that is not on campus. Unfortunately it is also a 490 lvl (strategic business management) class and the professor is proving to be extremely difficult. These are the issues Ive had so far;  \n1. So far he has only give me 100s and 50s, not sure why there is no middle ground  \n2. He does not accept drafts for any paper, though is very critical when it does not meet expectations\n\n3. The syllabus and directions are extremely vague. My assigned team mates and I are constantly unsure of due dates and project organization/expectations  \n4. The professor has only one on campus day to meet with him in person, and it is only after 430pm, when I have to be at work.   \n5. He has offered to meet off campus but I have never met this man (I am a 20yr old female) and for other emotional reasons and a history of physical abuse, I refuse to meet a professor out of a professional setting.   \n6. Responses and critiques are given too late to provide a re-submission and each day late is 20% points off (sometimes more)  \nIs there anything I can do here? I have a meeting with an advisor next week to talk about it but I am not sure how much they will be able to do. I am also meeting with him today after requesting I clock in around a half hour late at work. Luckily I have a pretty understanding boss. ",
