I had mostly teaching classes as my major is to be an elementary/special education teacher. Well I failed everything but my band classes. I\u2019m currently on academic suspension. I haven\u2019t scheduled my classes for this semester. (I was supposed to before my winter break, but I had a business hold I couldn\u2019t take care of because I have no way to pay.)\nClasses start tomorrow. I can currently \u201cadd\u201d classes but I still have that business hold through financial aid that I can\u2019t possibly pay for. And my dad can\u2019t because mom keeps taking more and more money from him with this divorce. \nI feel like I\u2019m doing this more for my dad than myself. The first few weeks here last semester were the best. I was happy to be away from my hometown. Away from the divorce happening. \nI just don\u2019t think I can do this college life anymore. I\u2019m already stressing out. \n\nWhat I\u2019m really needing is, should I just go home? Get my old job back to be able to pay off last semester and pay my parents back on what they\u2019re doing for me already? Mentally I don\u2019t think I can come back here. I\u2019m currently sitting on campus contemplating what I should do.
