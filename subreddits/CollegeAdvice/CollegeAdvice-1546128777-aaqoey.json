So now, I am down to deciding between FIT in Melbourne FL or CSU in Fort Collins(for fisheries bio). I do really like CSU, even though I would like to study the ocean. Do you guys think it would be a good idea to go to CSU for freshman year, then see if I could transfer to University of Miami? Do you think I would stand a good chance? Any advice at all really would be of help here.", "author": "stefanfolk", "created": 1546128777, "retrieved": 1632961027, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ecuh0w6": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/aaqoey/advice_for_potential_transfer/ecuh0w6/", "text": "Speaking as a current student at CSU, I would say that you're probably going to get up much better education at CSU as well as having a much better time doing it. This probably isn't the place to study your whole time, but for your first two years, I would definitely recommend it.\n\nCSU is a good school, but something they don't tell you is that the infrastructure in Fort Collins is amazing. It's very easy to navigate this town with or without a car/knowledge of the area. Melbourne is fine, but it's a huge city, so you're going to have a lot of problems navigating it unless you just stay on campus 24/7.\n\nYou would eventually figure it out of course, but if you're only planning on going for 1 to 2 years then you probably won't figure it out in time, or you'll figure it out just in time to transfer.\n\nAs to the quality of Education, I'm sure you can find your own sources on that, but you really shouldn't underestimate things like infrastructure and to cost of living.\n\n Put short I really wouldn't recommend CSU for someone looking for a good grad program, but for a freshman it's perfect.\n\nOne thing I should add though is you can feel free to go anywhere since no one really cares where you got your bachelor's degree, it's the Masters that's important. And if you're only planning on a year two before I transfer then I would honestly recommend that you just find a community college near where you are already. So long as you're only taking General credits which most freshmen do anyways it won't matter where you go because the classes identical everywhere, that's the point of General credits.\n\n But if you really want to go to a 4-year University definitely I would recommend CSU for a freshman or a sophomore.", "author": "Hasemage", "created": 1546138431, "upvotes": 1}, "ecuflz7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/aaqoey/advice_for_potential_transfer/ecuflz7/", "text": "Are you in-state for Florida or Colorado? If your in-state for Florida, your safest bet is to probably stay at FIT and maybe apply to transfer to the University of Miami after your first year (if you're still interested in doing that). Staying in Florida would probably open more opportunities for you to complete marine biology related work as well. \n\nCSU is not a bad school too. Their biology program will expose you to marine biology concepts like most universities would. Saying that, if their program is anything like CU or the University of Northern Colorado next door, then you will most likely receive an emphasis on lake/river aquatic life (and opportunities as well).\n\nAnother thing you should keep in mind is what happens if you can't transfer into the University of Miami? What's your back up plan from there? Would you be more okay with the local opportunities/classroom material/costs from FIT or CSU? \n\nI hope this helps!
