      "text": "At most universities, 10-15 minutes is enough time. Check to see if the buildings are reasonably close to each other. If so, I recommend scheduling them immediately back to back. When you put a random hour between classes it ends up being a waste of time because you don\u2019t actually have time to do anything.",
