I started in psychology switched to education then to nursing and now I\u2019m back in education. But, i don\u2019t know that teaching is something i really want to do. At this point i feel like I\u2019m trying to just force myself to get a degree. Anyone else going through this and have advice on what i should do?", "author": "WuTangDanielle", "created": 1577584655, "retrieved": 1632960366, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"fcf6tmv": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/egztqj/i_cant_pick_a_major/fcf6tmv/", "text": "Here\u2019s the biggest question. Are you enrolled in a University or Community College? If you are enrolled in a university, I would recommend transferring at least temporarily to a local CC. This way you can take gen Ed\u2019s and find yourself a little, while you can take an array of classes for cheap. If you are already in a CC then I would load up on gen Ed\u2019s in many different areas to find what piques your interest. \n\nAdditionally, take a look at some of your hobbies you enjoy doing, and research if a career can be made out of it. For ex. Someone who may like computers/Gaming may get into game development or programming.\n\nAlso note that college is not a race. Only 41% of college students finish in 4 years (credit; [CNBC link](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/just-41percent-of-college-students-graduate-in-four-years.html)). Most students finish in 5 to 6 years, and others take much longer, it ya completely normal! (credit: [Source](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/681621047/college-completion-rates-are-up-but-the-numbers-will-still-surprise-you)). Take your time with this decision of your major and don\u2019t rush into anything because someone tells you to. If and when you choose your major, lay the course requirements out and map out your strategy going forward. \n\nAlso note that some major specific classes that you took in nursing and education may be used as general/specific electives, so talk to your school about that when the time comes! Don\u2019t feel that you have been wasting time, because by taking these classes, you aren\u2019t putting yourself as behind as you think!", "author": "melodycakez", "created": 1577627109, "upvotes": 1}}}
