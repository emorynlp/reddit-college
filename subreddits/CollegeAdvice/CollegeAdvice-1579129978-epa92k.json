Should I major in only one? Both?", "text": "I am currently enrolled at UCSD for a double major in Nanoengineering  and Cognitive Science : Machine Learning and Neural Computation. I was late at going to college, didn't start school till I was 25, spent 4 years at Community College until I had the right amount of credits to transfer to UCSD for Nanoengineering, and was 29 by the time I transferred to UCSD.\n\nI was originally admitted to the program for Nano, but since it was going to take a minimum of 3 years to complete, because of these prerequisites that were only offered once a year, I had these empty spots I needed to fill so I figured I would just double major, in my second choice of major which was CogSci.  A year into my program I got pregnant and had my first baby during summer break. Then for Fall quarter I was taking care of a 2 month old baby, and was overwhelmed by the engineering courses, and for fall quarter I was only working on courses for Cognitive Science - Machine Learning Degree. This quarter I am back working on the double major, but because I missed one crucial nano class which was prerequisite for subsequent classes, I am looking at graduating for two more years instead of one, plus this winter and spring quarter. Essentially it extended my schooling for another year. However, if I only majored in CogSci, I would still be out by spring of next year...which is tempting. \n\nI am having a difficult time making a decision, because I like both majors, but I don't know which one will be the most beneficial for getting a job going forward. I thought, what the hell, I will just do both and not make a decision, but that means I will 33 years old by the time I graduate. I wish I could have gotten through school quicker, but transferring from a CC takes time when your trying to get into an engineering major. I worked my ass off and took so many classes just so that I could get accepted into an engineering major! I feel like it would be such a waste of my time to throw it all away and just major in Cognitive Science - Machine Learning. However, when I start to look at my job prospects, I'm not sure Im really that interested in the jobs I could qualify for in the nanoengineering field. If I majored in both, I thought it might be cool to work in brain computer interfaces, or some sort materials science which utilized nanoengineered biosensors that were used in neuroscience research, or work on artificial intelligence or something along those lines, but its so niche that I wonder if I am taking too many classes in something that I may not be able to find a job in. \n\nHaving a baby has put a lot of pressure on making more money, san diego is expensive as hell, and I'd like start making money as quickly as possible, so getting out sooner rather than later is becoming very tempting, but I'm worried about what my job prospects will be, and the fact that I am so much older than the average undergrad, and do not have relevant job experience in the fields I am studying in, which makes me feel like an undesirable candidate for getting that first job. Also, trying to get part time jobs, internships or extracurricular activities or projects to give me experience is extremely difficult while taking care of an infant, and having little money to pay for daycare to afford time to do so. \n\nAnway, I just need some advice on what to do. Should I continue to double major? Should I just pick one or the other? Should I pick one and go one to master later, is that more worth my time? I know money isn't the best deciding, but which one will lead to more lucrative job opportunities, or just better opportunities in general?", "author": "TaylerMonster", "created": 1579129978, "retrieved": 1632960783, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
