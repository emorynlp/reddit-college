You can also go to community college the first two years which is much less expensive to get the basics out of the way.  The community college will have counselors to help you there and also help you with applying to transfer.  Good luck.  ",

He passed it in the second try in 2016, applied for Biology in college, got accepted, he will graduate soon and he's planning his Master degree. I'm very proud of him. He showed all of us and his kids that everything is possible!",
