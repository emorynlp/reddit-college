      "text": "Yes! In college, students actually have to select their own courses based on their own availability. You can choose to take your classes online, in- person... you can even choose to schedule al your courses on two days out of the week if you want, leaving you with time to work.\n\nIf your interested in studying a trade, however, they may have a set schedule.
