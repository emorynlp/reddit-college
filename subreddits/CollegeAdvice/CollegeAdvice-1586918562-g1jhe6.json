I graduated from a honors health science degree in University and now I have applied to Algonquin college for their respiratory therapy program. They ask for the following high school courses: english, math, biology, chemistry and physics. I only took high school english, math and biology; however, I took chemistry and physics in university. Do you think they will consider that since it has been done at the University level???
