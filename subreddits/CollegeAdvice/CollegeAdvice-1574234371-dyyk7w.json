It\u2019s much more chill and the people are nice. Hopefully the rest of my year will go well\n\nHey guys, so here\u2019s a little info: this is my second semester in the dorms, but my fifth at the school. I moved buildings to be a little closer to campus. However now the pod is full. They seemed nice at first, and one o them is actually a high school friend. However, four out of the seven of us have been a bit of a problem. Smoking weed excessively in the room, being loud and rambunctious late at night, having lots of people over at night, and leaving a mess in the bathroom and common area. Worst of all, there was a fight on the night of the 13th. I called but no one got here until after it was over. The next day however, the same boy in the fight caused a scene in the cafeteria, and later that day there was a stabbing and six arrests. When a room advisor came that day to ask about the fight the night before, one of the four problematic people denied it. My friend and one of the others (who\u2019s not causing problems) said that there was indeed a fight. Tonight I was woken at 1am by them coming in. I ask them to quiet down and I head back to bed. A few minutes later I hear keys swinging and scuffling, and someone said \u201cget off me.\u201d They get to the door on the end, next to mine, and the girl closes it. I peek out to see them slapping and pulling each other\u2019s hair. I call an RA and again it\u2019s over before they get here. The girl on the end denies it. Both people who denied the fights keep saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t real\u201d after they say \u201cthere\u2019s wasn\u2019t a fight\u201d which is kind of contradictory. I tried to get something on video but unfortunately my phone didn\u2019t work. I have one semester left after this before graduating but at this point I\u2019m considering just leaving. It\u2019s been made clear to the staff that people are smoking weed and leaving trash out where it shouldn\u2019t be and yet no one wants to try and figure out who\u2019s doing it. All that gets done is a slap on the wrist saying \u201cdon\u2019t do it again.\u201d I\u2019m so done with everything but I really need a degree. What should I do? I considered just moving rooms but there\u2019s only about three or four weeks left in the semester, and why should I be the one to move? I\u2019m just trying to sleep or get my homework done.", "author": "Sparrow-Hound", "created": 1574234371, "retrieved": 1632960940, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f84jcvw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dyyk7w/problematic_roommates/f84jcvw/", "text": "If you have exhausted all options by properly reporting the incidents and following the chain of command then you have nothing left to attempt but to move out. Is it fair? Nope, but at this point fairness doesn't matter. All that matters is that you finish you education successfully and if that means you are inconvenienced by moving, then so be it. Clearly this is going to be an ongoing issue if you stay so you need to control what you can control and get out.", "author": "drock13", "created": 1574251209, "upvotes": 2}}}
