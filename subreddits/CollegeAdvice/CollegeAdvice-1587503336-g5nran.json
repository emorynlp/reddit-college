That way they can help you move forward and they'll stop sending information about graduation.  This might also affect your financial aid though I'm not sure.  You should also check with the financial aid office, if you are receiving financial aid.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have just one semester left of classes to get the degree for computer science, maybe you can just get it done.  How many classes do you need to take?  You never know when you might need this degree in the future.  Having that spare degree can be helpful if you end up looking for a job that required this degree one day. instead of telling a hiring manager that you studied for x but didn't graduate because you switched majors just before you were done.
