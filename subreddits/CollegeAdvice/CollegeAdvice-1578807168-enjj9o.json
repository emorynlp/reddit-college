I am trying to become administrative profficient at the moment, which I should be able to do through my volunteer organization CAP (Civil Air Patrol) as part of command staff of a 150 member squadron. \n\nI know I want to major in business, but I don\u2019t just want a general business degree. I\u2019m trying to find a degree based around things like starting business from the ground up, efficiency, and either supply management or management in a training role. (Especially love training and public speaking) \n\nI work in retail at Target at the moment as a stocker, but I have worked 3 jobs at this point. I love learning the ins and outs of every position in anything I am working at paying or otherwise. I truly have a passion for making things run smoother, training, and actually managing operations to a degree. \n\nI am not great with numbers, but can handle them up to a point, I have Microsoft suite experience, and I have admin experience on a small scale level. \n\nPlease help recommend a major, recommended path, suggestions, internships, or anything you think could help.\n\n(Also I know that this is terrible formatting, is rushed, is not the most concise, or deepest thought out post, but I just have had this on my mind a lot lately, and I haven\u2019t had any luck in searching. I am in Leesburg, Virginia if that helps.

I think you\u2019d like it too. Having Managment as your major and then minoring in Accounting or Finance would be great since then you have expert knowledge in two fields. Also, being a Business Managment major means you get a taste of all things business so you\u2019ll pretty much know about every single branch of business. \nGraduating with a degree in Management is great if you want to work in HR, too.\nI hope this helps good luck!!", "author": "pinkvirgo11", "created": 1578969988, "upvotes": 2}, "fe3bqmw": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/enjj9o/need_advice_for_finding_a_major/fe3bqmw/", "text": "Thanks.
