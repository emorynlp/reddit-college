Recently I visited Robert Morris University in Moon, PA and something was just different about the college. Being there was way different than any other school I had visited. It felt \"cozy\" for lack of a better word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short I ended up applying and was accepted into their cyber security and forensics program. However I have been seeing a few people here and there saying they aren't really that good of a college. As of right now, I have a 2.98 GPA and completed my SATs with a score of 600 in EBRW and 610 in Math. Should I look elsewhere for a high profile/larger school or Robert Morris actually a decent school?", "author": "CCTrollz", "created": 1536375341, "retrieved": 1632849429, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"e5m1mo8": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/9e10f8/rmu_in_moon_pa/e5m1mo8/", "text": "The school struck the right chord with you, it has the program you like. Looking objectively at your gpa and sat, it will be difficult for you to get in to a competitive college that it seems everyone on r/a2c is applying to. \n\nLower-ranked schools can still be decent, but you will have to do some work for yourself to make up for the lack of name recognition from a highly ranked school on your resume. Internships, networking, etc. \n\nAll that being said, apply to more schools. Visit more schools. Worst thing that can happen there is that you confirm that RMU is your spot.", "author": "suchdogeverymeme", "created": 1536416176, "upvotes": 2}}}
