  "text": "Not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but it seemed appropriate.\n\nSo I've just received an email from my school's registrar telling me I require one elective to graduate, even though I just graduated a week ago...\n\nWhats more, I checked with an academic advisor on two separate occasions to confirm that my course selection would be sufficient to fulfill graduation requirements.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to approach this? I feel entirely low-balled by the school since they should have caught this a long time ago.",

      "text": "Look through your school email, make sure you didn't miss any email regarding a deficiency. Do you have any proof that the adviser said you were fine, emails or an official graduation audit?  Do you have a progress to degree system, what does it show? You are going to have to prove to them that you were misled, not knowing isn't good enough unfortunately.",

          "text": "I've combed through my school email and there is nothing stating any sort of deficiency. Also, I have an email from my academic advisor stating that the courses I selected for the semester would be \"fine,\" therefore, she doesn't explicitly state that I would be set to fulfill the graduation requirements. However, she knew me personally and knew I intended to graduate this semester.\n\nAs to your second point, the school does have a degree progress system, but it's very difficult to understand and doesn't appear to accurately reflect the courses I've taken.",
