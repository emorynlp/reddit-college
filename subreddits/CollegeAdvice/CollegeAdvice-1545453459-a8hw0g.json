I went into my first semester with 18 credits and no life, ended up failing every course and having to drop out of college on the first go. Not my proudest moment, but I reapplied and got accepted. Still fucked myself over any chance I got but I'm finally declared in my junior year. \n\nHeres the point to all this, no one cares what happens your first year, second year, or third year only classes they care about are your senior classes the higher ed classes. Cause those are the skill classes the ones they are looking for, only other thing companies want from you is that piece of paper that says I payed so much money to prove I know how to learn. That's it they dont care about gpa they dont care how long it took, hell they dont even care if you switched majors half way through. \n\nThe only time your degree matters and what your gpa is, is when your a doctor, engineer, or a scientist. Other wise most companies couldnt care  less, pick your head up stand up straight and say yea this shit was bad this shit was horrible. Let's make it better let's make the best with the shit hand I've been dealt, that's all they want. If you have any other questions or just need someone to talk to feel free to message me, it gets easier dont worry.", "author": "Classless_G3ntleman", "created": 1545458283, "upvotes": 2}}}
