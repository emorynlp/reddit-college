I\u2019m going to finish my first year with 50 credit hours (I took some dual credit courses in high school), and I\u2019m going to be transferring to another school. Right now I just picked a random major and decided to get my gen Ed\u2019s done. I can\u2019t decide what to do for my major when I get to the other school. I have a passion for music, and I\u2019ve been looking into this school\u2019s BA in music program. And I\u2019m not really that interested in going into education. However, I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to get a job that\u2019ll help hold me and a family up some day. I\u2019ve always been a firm believer in doing what makes you happy, but I\u2019m scared that there is too much risk going for a music degree. A part of me wonders if it\u2019s better to just go for something that\u2019s safe like a computer science degree, or taking the chance and trying to pursue music? Even after talking to my family and my girlfriend, I still can\u2019t decide. And the kicker is that if I\u2019m going to go for the music degree, I\u2019ve got to audition by the end of February, so time is running out. \n\nAny advice?", "author": "christianTW2019", "created": 1580964717, "retrieved": 1632848341, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
