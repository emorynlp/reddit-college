Anyone not go because of a broken home life? + my experience", "text": "I\u2019m a 26 y.o. male and straight out if high school, and well, technically since about 15 I\u2019ve just been in the work force. Unfortunately while my peers in my high school were planning for college and their future, I had a guy living at my home who got my sister pregnant, a new born baby living there, and an alcoholic mother. So basically. I tried as much as possible to avoid home, avoid school, and well, let\u2019s just say, not everyone has a fair start in this game of life. Not throwing a pitty party, many have it much worse, but I do feel...robbed. \n\nI am stuck in a dead end job, I have been working diligently at my art work and have gotten really good, hopefullly to pursue a tattoo apprenticeship and make SOMETHING of myself. Though the trauma of my childhood still pulls me down (anxiety, depression, dissociation) and makes me less competent than people around me(fuck trauma, am I right?). \n\nLife is certainly not fair but I understand I gotta change something or nothing will change, I have NOONE to go to family wise as far as how to even \u201ccollege\u201d...\n\nCan anyone relate? \n\nAlso not sure if college is even the right choice, I go onto career forums and see people with major degrees having quarter/mid life crisis about the job they hate, the meaninglessness of their work, the regret of their career choice, etc. A MAJOR reason I didn\u2019t go to college was the debt and understanding that I was still a kid with much to learn, how could I pick a career and spend thousands on it?!", "author": null, "created": 1579496970, "retrieved": 1632848363, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"ffjzg3u": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/er8hox/how_do_you_all_feel_about_college_anyone_not_go/ffjzg3u/", "text": "Biggest thing I\u2019d recommend is Community College. If anything, I should\u2019ve started out at Community College, but I was heavily pressured by my parents to go to 4 year University. Flunked out of University and transferred to Community College. Got my Associates and transferred to another university to finish my bachelor\u2019s. About to start up my Master\u2019s next fall. \n\nIf you have a plan to go to 4 year University, I\u2019d recommend going to Community College first, for your Associate\u2019s degree. My motto was \u201cBetter to have my Associate\u2019s, than no degree at all.\u201d It is literally the \u201ccore\u201d classes that are often up-charged at universities elsewhere. Aside from the main classes, the schedule also includes room for electives, in which you could check out the numerous career paths. \n\nSome community colleges also partner up with universities to where not only can you take classes at the CC, but you can also receive your 4 year degree at the CC through the universities. There are truly affordable options out there, and I would recommend checking them out.", "author": "Kwall_3147", "created": 1580011207, "upvotes": 1}, "ff4hix9": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/er8hox/how_do_you_all_feel_about_college_anyone_not_go/ff4hix9/", "text": "Yup I grew up in a highly disfunctional household and took a few years off before going to community college. If you\u2019re thinking about going back to school I\u2019d highly recommend meeting with a financial advisor at a local community college to see how much it would cost you and how much financial aid you would quality for. \n\nAlso don\u2019t go for an art degree or anything else that values experience over knowledge. If you go to college study something useful that either makes you happy, or pays well enough for you to work fewer hours and focus on hobbies.\n\nEdit: that\u2019s not to say that art isn\u2019t a useful skill, I just mean to say that it\u2019s not worth the money and time to study art in college in my opinion since you get better at it by doing it not by sitting in a classroom.", "author": "ElevenMeow", "created": 1579563754, "upvotes": 1}, "ff3x5uj": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/er8hox/how_do_you_all_feel_about_college_anyone_not_go/ff3x5uj/", "text": "Definitely. I haven't talked to my family since 2012 because of their disfunction. I had to concentrate on paying my bills living on my own working 2-3 jobs. When I worked for one place 3 years and could not get the management job I was trained for that would FINALLY make it so I could just work 1 job to pay my bills, I had my crisis, snapped and pumped away at college instead. (I was 25. I definitely didn't see myself working retail for the rest of my life.) If you are living with someone who can help supplement your living expenses, definitely start out with community college full-time. If you can't, there's still night classes, but it will take you a long time to get your degree. Talk to the counselors there and tell them you're taking classes to transfer to a 4-year University. Take all the classes you can that are required by most institutions (the counselors at CC will be able to tell you, but you'll want to take Statistics, Speech, Math, English, Biology...) all the core classes. Take more math than they recommend, if you don't mind math. Taking the general Ed's will help you get back in the swing of things and explore what you like studying. You'll get more clarity on what degree you want to get the more you explore.\n\nThough if you'd rather go the art route, that's also an option. You wouldn't need a 4-year degree, you just need talent.
