I am a military vet, married, with no kids (2 Great Danes so that kind of counts). \n\nHas anyone done a similar program? This program includes both the BS/MS degrees and I'm curious on workload. How feasible is it to work part time while going to a more in depth program like this? Any advice from other vets? \n\nI'm still active duty but anticipate attending in the fall best case scenario but more realistically it'll be the spring semester.
