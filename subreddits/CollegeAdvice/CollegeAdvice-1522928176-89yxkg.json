  "text": "At around 4am I woke up to the feeling of liquid on my legs. Imagine my surprise when I quickly realized it was my fucking roommate pissing on my legs, blanket, floor, beanbag, and book. Details: Our beds are all very raised so you can fit a dresser and other things underneath them so I have to draping a quilt over the side of the bed effectively blacking out all light and sleeping on a beanbag under neath the bed. My roommate pissed on parts of my legs then on to the quilt and finally on the floor even managing to sook a bool nearby. He is/was very likely blackout drunk and this is the second time he has black drunk stood up and pissed somewhere on the floor of our room. I cant deal with this shit. What do I do? What are my recourses? ",
