  "text": "Hello,\n\nSo recently I was accepted to an OTA program which i was super excited for. Until I decided to read other forums on whether OTA was worth the schooling. Now I don't know if I should continue or cancel the whole thing and move on to a different career. Please if you have any experience as an OTA or OT please share your experience with me\n\n",
