Throughout the majority of my college career, I've been receiving above average grades till I had a bit of a mishap these last two semesters. I've had a lot of personal issues going on at home and have had to drop three of my courses and failed, with an F (I stopped attending), two of my classes. I'm in the process of retaking these courses but, I'm very unsure if I will be able to attend a good University (hoping to transfer to UC Berkley or to a university near Monterey California).\n\nBesides that HUGE mishap, I've realized that I've not focused on doing any extracurriculars and/or clubs. I am attempting to correct my mistake and am willing to do pretty much anything to be able to, at the least, attend a good university.\n\nRealizing my mistakes took me quite of bit of time and self-reevaluation. I've realized that throughout these two years I have only been going through the steps of what society deemed \"important\" rather than attempting to find my own happiness in school and my dream. Getting into a relationship with my, now, future husband (we're engaged), I simply just want make myself better. Allow myself to improve in order to be happy with the person that I love.\n\nHonestly any advice really helps at this point. Please be honest as well. I know I'm quite in a bit of a hole.", "author": "cerzes", "created": 1587189455, "retrieved": 1632960021, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"foalvq4": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g3il9g/transferring_colleges/foalvq4/", "text": "You have already realized your situation and have come to reality mentioning some of what I would say if I were offering advice to you, your already back on the right path by re-evaluating your situation and looking to start new plans so think long term 5, 10, 15 years down the road where you want to be in life. Don't sweat the small details instead look at the bigger picture when it comes to your grades and re-take those classes you received poor or failing grades in because the higher grades will then be counted overriding the previous grades you didn't like. Finish what you started after all, your already invested financially so graduate from your cc and get your diploma! See if your cc has a transfer agreement with other universities, this will get you moving forward towards completing your undergrad easier. Also look at a few other universities your interested in maybe they have an online program that is more flexible for you and find out who will accept the most credits for transfer students holding your cc degree. You may not get accepted right away as a transfer student but don't give up, it took me 3 applications at the same university before I finally got accepted as a transfer student into the campus location I wanted. Best of luck to you and congrats on your engagement!", "author": "truxperience", "created": 1587648869, "upvotes": 1}, "fntaehh": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g3il9g/transferring_colleges/fntaehh/", "text": "The most important thing is your relationship with yourself, which it seems like you are doing a great job of understanding and improving! One of the great things about college is there is no deadline and no rush to complete. Focus on relationship building and everything else will fall in line! Take your time, get your priorities straight and have conversations (with your bf) about what are the next steps in your life/career! Hope this helps a little and gain a new perspective.", "author": "antilollipops2020", "created": 1587237728, "upvotes": 1}}}
