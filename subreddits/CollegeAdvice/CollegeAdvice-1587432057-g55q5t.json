  "title:": "Will a professor write a bad rec letter?",
  "text": "I am applying for an on campus job that requires two faculty recs. One is my advisor so I have no worries about him. Another one is a chem prof I have known since freshman year. I have heard from my sister that she would give bad recs to ppl she doesn\u2019t like. I haven\u2019t made the best grades in her class, but I have always worked hard and asked questions. I have even given her gifts in the past for all of her help. I am worried she will give me a bad rec, but I don\u2019t have anyone else I could really ask. Should I risk it?\n\nUpdate: She said that she would be happy to give me a rec. I am still unsure at this point. Please help!",

      "text": "Hi, anyone willing to write a **good** recommendation is willing to share it with you. Now that she's said yes, be specific about what your reader wants to see. I've seen a lot of letters telling me an applicant was nice but leaving out any information about work ethic. Tell her why you asked her (don't mention you didn't have anyone else to write it). Let her know you thought she would be able to vouch for the fact that you don't mind persevering even when you struggle, that you ask questions and seek clarity, that you are a hard worker and that you don't quit. I know some letters are submitted online through an automated system and go directly to employers so if that is the case, ask her if she would be willing to give you a duplicate copy of the letter for you to add to your portfolio. Again, most people won't write a bad letter (though I've seen a few) because they don't want to tell you they don't have anything of substance to say. They'll just write a bland letter without substance. I hope my answer wasn't too long but I also hope it was helpful. I also hope everything goes well with your new position!",

      "text": "If she says she\u2019s happy to give you a rec, don\u2019t worry about it! Most professors will let you know if they don\u2019t think they should be the one to write the recommendation (because they don\u2019t want to write you a bad one). Also, recommendations are for character. Your transcript has your grades, so it\u2019s more important anyways that the rec letter speaks about your hard work than say, the fact that you got an A in a class. You should be fine!",
