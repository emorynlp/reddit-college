But I wasnt the best student and ended up getting academically dismissed from school after 1 year. My parents were furious. I got a full time job and went to community college but i just couldnt do it. My old habits of waiting to the last minute and then giving up because im not as smart as i think i am, came back. I havent been kicked out yet but I am on academic probation and I havent taken a class i  about a year. \nBut my parents and gf were so proud that i was trying again. And i didnt want to make them angry/disappointed.  So Ive been lying for about a year saying that im still in class.\nMy plan was to tell them i was transferring back to the university after this semester. But now Im about to write the petition form for the university and I dont have a good reason to be let back in. I havent done shit. I passed some classes at communtiy college, but its just been a few gen ed classes. \nIve been debating going back and trying the community college again but i dont know how im going to explain to my family why im still at community college and not the university. Any advice as to what to do? Whether to go on with my plan or swallow my pride and go back to community college? Thank you\n\nEdit:Spelling", "author": "throwmeaway234567198", "created": 1578960014, "retrieved": 1632961150, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
