Before I started my first year I was working out everyday for the past 6 months and slimmed down from 190 to 165, then college hit. Being the ignorant bastard I was at the time not believing that freshmen 15 would affect me, it hit me hard. Living on campus in a dorm with a meal plan was the downfall of my progress. I went from 165 before school to 205 by the end of the year. However you don\u2019t have to go through that with this advice. \n\n-1) try not to eat at the dinning hall and do not get fast food. Attempt making your own food at the community kitchen, it will be 1000x healthier plus you\u2019ll be preparing for when you have an apartment and not focusing on the prepared food for you.\n\n-2) if you do eat at the dining hall check the website for nutrition facts and you\u2019ll see how overloaded their food is with sugar, fat, and sodium. Checking the website on what there is to eat will help you decide if you should make your own or know what to get. And just outright avoid the pizza, soft drinks, and dessert.\n\n3) Just maintain your weight. Attempt to go to the gym. It will be hard especially when you have to focus on hw, test, and classes. But an hour will not hurt.\n\nIm not health buff myself but these definitely keep you in line and away from the f. 15. \nGood luck and have fun.", "author": "CamsDonut", "created": 1561435452, "retrieved": 1632848931, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
