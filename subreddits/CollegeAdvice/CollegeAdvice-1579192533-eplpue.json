  "text": "I took 2 year break from college after highschool, and now I'm starting college for a degree in environmental science. \n\nI'm starting by doing courses online (only two right now) but I'm trying to balance a job as well. The reason I'm doing online (not my first choice) is because I'm working as a Teller at a Bank and I'm their part time employee that covers them while they do lunches. Sometimes I work 11-4 and sometimes I work 8:15-1 or 8:15-5:15. It's not a very reliable schedule. The plus side is that I make $15 an hour and it looks good on my resume.\n\n I've been here for 2 months and honestly Im very dispassionate about it. My coworkers hate their life and get irritated when I don't know something. It's very back and forth, one day they're all pleasant and the next someone pissed in their cereal. I don't think I'm doing work that is going to teach me anything about my future, and there is SO much they want me to learn that I feel like I'm studying at work! I have to promote sales, check their account history for stuff, and have a conversation with the customer as well. The customers are good and bad but mostly very sweet. I don't want to be studying banking laws and studying for college at the same time. \n\nI have a job offer to work at an ER on graveyard shifts. It would be 6 on 8 off 7pm to 7am. There's a lot of downtime and they're cool with it if you do classwork or watch movies or do anything. I would work the front desk, and it's a very slow place I already know the staff and get along well. I don't want to assume but I imagine the work is a little more manageable, as I don't have to memorize any lengthy laws and requirements and try to balance 5 different things at a time. \nThe pay would be around the same, but I would be averaging more hours. With more days off which I prefer- I would rather work three long days and have three off days than work a little everyday. \nI have NO idea how I would do with graveyard shifts though. I struggle with depression and seasons fuck with me when I'm not out in the sun. They're both not ideal but pay well, and again college is my priority. \nI could always go back to retail which I know will work around my college schedule. \n\nI have no clue what to do \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\n\nTldr- I'm trying to decide between two jobs while I'm going to college. One is part time 6 days a week with no chance of me doing campus classes. The other is 6 on 8 off full time 12 hour shifts where maybe I could go to campus but it's graveyards and I don't know how I'll handle it. Or maybe i should just go back to retail. College students how do you balance jobs and school?",
