  "title:": "Failing in Community College",
  "text": "Ive been attending community college for a few semesters now. Ive failed 2 classes already, one math and one english class taken during different semesters, and am about to fail a 3rd. The reason for my failing isn't that i'm stupid i'm just lazy and undisciplined. I procrastinate everything to the very last minute. Ive always been this way, but its gotten worse as ive gotten older(im going to be 25).My depression has also made it very hard for me to bounce back whenever I start doing badly, missing assignments etc.I want to transfer to a Cal State. Still doable with F's on my record or is my life pretty much over? Music Major btw.",
