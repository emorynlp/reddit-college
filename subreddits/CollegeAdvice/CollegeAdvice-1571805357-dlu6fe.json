  "title:": "In-State VS Boston College",
  "text": "I have the opportunity to go pretty much full tuition at my in-states Honors college or go to Boston College. Fortunately, my family's financial situation would allow me to attend BC, but it's still a dent to my parents finances nonetheless. I want to go to BC...badly. At the same time though, I don't think it makes financial sense to spend that much money on college especially if I am going to grad school. My parents say they will pay for it, but I don't know how much of an impact attending BC would have on my life...is it worth it?",
