I\u2019m aspiring to go to law school on the future, and the local school has a program that would accelerate the study and shave of a year of undergrad. I liked the campus a lot at the local school, but my heart is really at the distant one. The distant one would end up costing a lot more (around $40K-$60K), depending on where I go to law school.\nThere\u2019s numerous pros and cons to each, as the financial security the local school provides, as well as the ability to stay at home with my family and keep my current job would be helpful. However, I really want to have a traditional college experience and i think it\u2019d be more difficult to make friends as a commuter to the local school instead of living on campus at the distant one. The distant school also has a lot more prestige and I got accepted into their honors program, which would likely result in acceptance to a better law school. It also isn\u2019t too far from extended family members who I\u2019m also close with, but not close enough to be intrusive. \nAny advice as to what I should do would be much appreciated.

If you have to take out expensive loans, it probably isn\u2019t.  If you have money set aside for education, your parents jobs are stable, etc., then it might be.", "author": "mollymarie123", "created": 1585071421, "upvotes": 1}}}
