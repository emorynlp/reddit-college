I gain a lot of inspiration from a lot of artists who\u2019ve gone through the character animation program, I really wanna move out to California, and I\u2019ve always loved animation and the products from artists and animators I didn\u2019t know come out of their programs). \n\nBut, after joining the drama club at my school starting this year, I\u2019ve fallen completely in love with all aspects of theatre (both backstage and onstage, having been given the opportunity to do both sides with jobs I loved doing) and want to pursue a higher education in it. I\u2019ve performed a lot when I was younger with just singing but mixing that skill with choreography and speaking lines is something I found out I loved a lot.\n\nMy issue is, what should I pursue first? I feel like I can\u2019t make the choice myself and having been trying to for almost 4 months now and my time to prep for either is getting shorter, I feel like I need an outside opinion or just general information about either majors and what is really worth it or not, or which I should prioritize first vs the other. Is animation something I should pursue first for it being mainly out of state and my want to travel being eminent, my skills in illustration being developed for almost 5 years now with a main focus on wanting to pursue animation, and having wanted to pursue it first? Or should I pursue theatre, most likely musical performance, having been craving the stage now more than ever, being able to find great schools either in state or only a majority of a few states away from home for emergency travel to be easier, and being able to get my foot in the door with most likely going back for stage management (or minoring in it if available but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a major as well) and being able to get comfortable at a school that I\u2019ve already gotten a degree at and know the basis of that school\u2019s program set up and whatnot? \n\nIf I don\u2019t make any sense, it\u2019s probably because I\u2019m on a college subreddit at 4am and sleep not being much in sight for me and this has been bugging me everyday for months, but please let me know. If my situation is my choice and my choice only because of the specific situation or anything, that\u2019s fine just please let me know. And if I sound dumb for even asking, literally yell at me lol. But seriously, if anyone has advice, it would be much appreciated.
