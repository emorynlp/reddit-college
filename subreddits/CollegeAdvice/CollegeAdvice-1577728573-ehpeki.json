I wasted my 2 years of college and messed up my GPA (7.56/10). In the summer after my second year, I got interested in robotics after watching a video of Mini Cheetah made by MIT. After researching a bit I found that I have to study the things taught in the class and I finished my two years of course work along with 4 online courses and 2 books namely, PRML by  C.M. Bishop and Convex Optimization by S. Boyd in my fifth semester. I am currently studying Underactuated Robotics by MIT through YouTube. I want to go for research in robotics but I am confused how to proceed. Is it too late as many students already have fantastic achievements by third year and I am just starting. Can someone advice me?", "author": "curious__sapien", "created": 1577728573, "retrieved": 1632960504, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
