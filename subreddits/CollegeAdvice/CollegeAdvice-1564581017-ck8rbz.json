I had  a 740 on my maths arching and a 620 on my English and reading section. I applied and didn't get good schools. So I am applying again for 2019/2020 class. I think my English had something to do with me not getting into good schools. The SAT dates are not workable for me meanwhile the TOEFL dates are more than perfect. So I was wondering if there was anyway my TOEFL scores  would compliment  my English section SAT scores. PS I have a really impressive application and list of achievements. I need serious and quick advice.", "author": "airstrokeX", "created": 1564581017, "retrieved": 1632959368, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {}}
