Advice Please", "text": " So I got a 1390 (my third time, after getting a 1280 both times previously), 690R/ 700M. I spent so much time studying and was really hoping for at least a 1400. Now I keep thinking of a couple questions that I figured out at home which I should have put on the test. I did way better on the practice tests and felt really confident in my math section, but I guess I was wrong. I really don't want to take it again. I'm starting community college in the fall and after two years I want to transfer to a university. I had a perfect GPA in high school and was in FBLA for all 4 years, and NHS for 3. I also plan on taking subject tests, if the coronavirus will let me. Do you think I still have a shot of getting into a good college after I transfer? Any advice is appreciated :)", "author": "aiyana032001", "created": 1585335005, "retrieved": 1632848323, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"flwkcun": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fq2z74/so_i_just_got_my_sat_score_and_now_im_at_a_loss/flwkcun/", "text": "Don\u2019t worry about the SAT score, it won\u2019t really mean anything once you have 2 years of a CC under your belt!
