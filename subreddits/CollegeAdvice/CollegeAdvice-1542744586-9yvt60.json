Yesterday my uncle brought up entrepreneurship and it seems interesting and a possible route but i don\u2019t know much about it. I live in Texas and would like to stay in the state for college. Does anyone have any ideas about what i should do?", "author": "AyyBale", "created": 1542744586, "retrieved": 1632849391, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ea5iuy0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/9yvt60/need_help_choosing_a_path/ea5iuy0/", "text": "Music does seem like a long shot, unless you already have a portfolio very young and you write possibly? I don\u2019t know a tonne but those sorts of people tend to be more likely to succeed. Even so it\u2019s very hard work for little reward unless you\u2019re genuinely lucky. \n\nI\u2019d branch out and test the waters with stuff you do like. e.g I desperately wanted to pursue literary studies and go for a teaching position at a good university, but ended up in law school. i love it. \n\nYou could still keep up with music as a side thing though, as many people do. Teaching or starting a part-time music tutoring business (good piano lessons are worth gold), etc. \n\nThese are just my thoughts.
