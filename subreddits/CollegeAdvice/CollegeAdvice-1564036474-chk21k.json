  "text": "I am stuck. I'm still not 100% sure whether I want to pursue the medical or engineering field. University of California, Riverside, a school I never seriously considered to attend, has offered to pay for the entirety of my freshman year in order to pursue medicine. I have also already registered for classes at my local community college so that I may have a serious shot at transferring to my dream school of UCLA in 2 years. This situation would most likely be as an engineering major. I am a few weeks away from classes at the community college (which are refundable if I change my mind), and my Riverside orientation is on August 1. I'm hoping to find some helpful advice on how I should approach this. I don't want to settle for a school I don't really want to go to, but UCR offers the best shot at the medical field and saves me money. My community college allows me to be more flexible, and gives me an opportunity to transfer to my dream school. This decision has become even harder for me because I can't decide between medicine and engineering.",
