  "text": "It\u2019s my first day and I feel like I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m feeling social anxiety worse than I\u2019ve ever had it before and I just want to sit in my room. I\u2019m in a new place away from my parents and it\u2019s hard enough I feel too overwhelmed to make friends right now. Is it ok to not do anything my first day?",
