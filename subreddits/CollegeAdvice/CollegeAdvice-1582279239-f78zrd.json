I've already dropped one and am down to 10 hours. I was thinking of dropping two more which would bring me down to 5 hours which is less than half time. I know colleges have a census date and I'm confused as to what that has to do with the grant that I have. (Have to be full time to keep it) But even though I'm below full time they said nothing would change since it's after the census date. Can anyone fully explain and can I drop these two other classes as well?", "author": "Pepe_The_Abuser", "created": 1582279239, "retrieved": 1632960481, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fi9srqt": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f78zrd/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_effect_of/fi9srqt/", "text": "You still have to pay the loans.
