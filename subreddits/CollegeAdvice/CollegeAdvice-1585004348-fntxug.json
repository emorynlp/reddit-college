Then the third batch I messed up which set my career back four years I would be stressed out waking up without even doing anything.\n\n I have been struggling to find motivation to continue studying and looking for opportunities, back then I would be able to write a blog post/journal, hang out with friends, read, work out/gym, research EC projects, go to student senate meetings and more.  I've noticed that having a plan/schedule and waking up earlier helps. But now I struggle to push myself to do these things, any tips on how to move out of this ?", "author": "Throwawayboss11", "created": 1585004348, "retrieved": 1632848325, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
