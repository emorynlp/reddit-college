It honestly changed my life. I\u2019ve never read anything so mind bending and interesting. I have always been passionate about social justice, but the AOMX made me think for once that maybe I can do something about it. The way he lived his life, passionately pursuing knowledge, justice, truth and change, is how I have always wanted to live mine. I think it\u2019s time I do something about it. Everyone has always told me I am too smart to not go to college and I\u2019ve always replied that college is too expensive. However I\u2019d like to look into financial aid and start working towards getting a few credits under my belt. Does anyone have thoughts on what kind of majors or classes I should look into? I am looking at sociology or something similar. I really like history as well, always have. I\u2019m very skilled and passionate about English. I would most like to work towards criminal justice system reform, so criminal justice is something I\u2019m looking at as well. I know I have a long way to go before I even need to choose a major but I like to have a goal in mind and I would like to be able to start dipping my toes in classes that might lead me on the path I\u2019m seeking. Mainly I\u2019d like to create change in this world. Easier said than done, yes but I think education could be my most powerful tool to do so. I am not looking for gen. ed credits by the way. I will take those as well, but I\u2019d like to have some ideas for specific classes to take to figure out what I\u2019d like to major in. Thanks!

If you need more time to figure it out, go in undeclared (I wish I had and someone told me it was an option). Take a few courses, play a bit with something you're interested in and it should hit you. \n\nSome schools have criminal justice, others may have it under their sociology programs. \n\nBut all and all, I will say this: even when it came to Malcolm X, or MLK Jr, or other major rights leaders; their major did not define their path, their experiences and their reactions to those experiences did.\n\nAs a sociology major, I'll be honest, social work seems to do more with social justice than we do in our field. They seem more on the field, we're more in the books. ", "author": null, "created": 1529050212, "upvotes": 1}}}
