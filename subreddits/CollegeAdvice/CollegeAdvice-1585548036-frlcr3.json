I absolutely adore both, and a life without much of either seems unthinkable. My only concerns are whether it'll bee too difficult and the fact that I'll probably graduate later. What do you think? Are there any hidden issues that could arise?", "author": "hazardousautistic", "created": 1585548036, "retrieved": 1632961106, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"flx0dm9": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/frlcr3/what_should_i_consider_if_i_want_to_double_major/flx0dm9/", "text": "Idk how your college works, but at my college, we have both a computer science engineering major in the college of engineering, as well as a computer information systems major that\u2019s in our college of arts and sciences. Both cover around the same amount of programming, but the CIS major needs less classes (not as many math, engineering type classes) than the CSE major. If you really want to major in both, look for something like CIS. \n\nHowever, If you chose to do computer science engineering, you will still likely need a good amount of math, and may only need a few more classes for a math minor. Neither are a bad option, but I would highly consider prioritizing computer science over math. You will get math with computer science no matter what, but you won\u2019t necessarily get computer science in a math degree without additional courses. Also, no matter what you do, just plan out your courses well, and you will find at least one option that works for you. Hope this helps!", "author": "emilyw046", "created": 1585571624, "upvotes": 1}}}
