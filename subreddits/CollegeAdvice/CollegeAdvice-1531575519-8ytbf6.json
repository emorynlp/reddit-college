Everything has gone smooty up to this point with my roommate, found each other online, met in person and selected each other as roommates. However now,  my roommate is thinking that he cannot get a loan for the year because he cannot get a cosigner and therefore not go to college where we planned on going. My question is that if he cannot go, then what will happen with me. Our roommate request has not been approved yet keep in mind. Will I be put into a room with a random who didn't have a roommate? Or will I be by myself in a dorm (2 people to a dorm)? Also, if I wanted to possibly be by myself (I would think I would rather choose that than a random roomate), should I wait for the roommate request to be approved?\n\nThanks", "author": "sniperboy2000", "created": 1531575519, "retrieved": 1632961641, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
