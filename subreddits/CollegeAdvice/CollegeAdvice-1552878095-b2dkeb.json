I love animals and want to go into a field where I can interact with them, care for them, and ultimately protect them. Specializing with wild animals is preferable but I also rescue dogs so really I want to work with all animals. I also want to own my own Sanctuary or rescue some day, so I want to learn more about behavior. \n\nThe closest school to me that has biology doesn\u2019t have a general bio degree, but an ecology and environmental bio BS degree.\n\nI was basically wondering what those two together meant as a degree and where I could go with it? What can I do with a degree in ecology and environmental bio? Can I do the things (animal interaction) I would like to do or do I need to specialize in a different field of bio to work with animals?\n\nI know ecology is like the way organisms interact but the \u201cenvironmental\u201d part is throwing me off and making me feel pretty wary of the degree.
