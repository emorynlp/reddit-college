I'm vastly more interested in the subject, so far have a better grasp and a willingness to learn it than I thought and I don't think I'd mind being a  therapist in the future. Thing is I'm an arts student. Now that only means my degree is in the arts and sciences but in psych that really only means I'll be taking the psychology classes that are all scientific but my options won't be.  So instead of having chemistry or physics as options it's English, Film Study, Sociology from my understanding. But from what I hear you need a PHD to practice as a therapist and I don't know how any of that works.  Can I even get a PHD if my education is rooted in the arts? I only ask because switching to science on top of being incredibly challenging because I've never been good at most sciences besides psych and biology, it would require me to do some academic upgrading and take 2 high school courses I didn't get and those classes I specifically didn't take because I struggle with them. Math 30-1 and Chem 30.  Is my career path possible with what I'm doing now?", "author": "keegan112099", "created": 1548223894, "retrieved": 1632849343, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"egfrhjq": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/aiwqdg/so_im_a_canadian_psych_student_looking_for_advice/egfrhjq/", "text": "Hey! A fellow Canadian psyc student here with the almost same issue. Interested in the program currently but being shitty at core subjects in high school led me to pursue the arts program vs science. \nI talked to my psyc professor today actually basically picking his brain about what's out there/my options/what do I want to be when I \"grow up\" haha.\nFrom his advice, I would highly reccomend pursuing science programs. Believe in yourself and have your heart set on the end goal. Psychology will open more doors for you with a science background vs arts. Now not saying you're 100% limited with a bachelor of arts. But why not take that extra step and open more doors for yourself ? I have also been heavily advised against stopping at just a degree versus stopping at at least a masters. \nAs for your PhD, again not to sound blunt but as my prof put it- no. Lol. \nI dont know, it might be different in other areas! But that's the two cents I recieved. Just today which is funny that I came across this post on the same day. Good luck friend.\ud83d\udc95", "author": "kgnarc", "created": 1550119450, "upvotes": 1}}}
