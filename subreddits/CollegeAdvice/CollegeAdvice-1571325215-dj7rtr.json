I am trying to make a 4 year plan that will suit my interests along with satisfying my prerequisites for med school. So, I am wanting a degree in some sort for sure in biology, spanish, and psychology. I know I can handle the workload. I am sure I want to double major, one in Spanish, but I don't know if I should major in psychology and minor in biology, or vice versa. A biology major will be good for med school and preparation for the MCAT, but I am going to be ordering good study books for that (I learn better on my own anyway). However, I do much better in psychology classes naturally, so that would boost my GPA. What do you guys think? Which will be better? How should I address this? My counselor says both are good, so...that's not much help. Thank you! I am a very indecisive person lol.", "author": "alexandria-reborn", "created": 1571325215, "retrieved": 1632848818, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f4232su": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dj7rtr/i_dont_know_which_to_major_and_which_to_minor_in/f4232su/", "text": "Which major works best in case you decide med school is not what you want?
