UCB doesn't have a design program (only design certificates, really).\n\nshould i finish 2 years at UCB then try to transfer out as a junior? or should i complete my freshman year at UCB, spend my sophomore year at CC (which also allows me to explore more majors), then try to apply as a junior transfer from there? how difficult is the process?\n\n  \nanyone know of good majors that fit my description too?  \n\n\nsorry for asking a lot. anything is very much appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this if you did!", "author": "unbloomedsunflower", "created": 1586328289, "retrieved": 1632848317, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
