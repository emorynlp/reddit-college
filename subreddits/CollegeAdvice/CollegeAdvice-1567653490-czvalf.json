Last year i was really keen about going into a psychology degree (Arts) and my sister just recently graduated with a psychology degree. This year my mind is all over the place. \n\nI\u2019m very free spirited and I want to be able to have freedom when I have a long term career ahead of me. I\u2019m still interested in psychology but I feel limited as to what I can do with a degree in it. I\u2019m also debating going into education (secondary) however, I know teachers don\u2019t make a heck of a lot of money. I want to be able to travel but still make ends meet. \n\nI\u2019m not good with public speaking but I can fix that. I\u2019ve also looked at going into an English degree (Arts as well) however, I\u2019m worried i\u2019d go into it and come out with no job. I don\u2019t really have the option to not go to school. I want to go and I enjoy school i\u2019m just confused and if i go into education I need to switch right away and talk to someone!
