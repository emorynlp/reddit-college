Do a couple of elective courses in stuff you think you want to do. Go volunteer for a local charity or your local library, it looks good on a resume and gets you work experience which will help you later. I did 6 classes my second to last semester of college and wrote over 50 pages of research papers. I pulled it off with schedule sorcery and caffeine addiction.\n\nI recommend looking at accelerated courses. You'll get the credits about 7 weeks. If you are doing 6 classes total, it'll save your sanity.\n\nDo the six when you are on a campus full time. The library is open very late and you can get a lot of stuff done without distraction.", "author": "roguepen", "created": 1562195729, "upvotes": 1}, "esnk7nz": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/c8j793/6_college_classes_doable_scary_impossible/esnk7nz/", "text": "Woah, partner!

That is way too much of a load, 15 units is full time, as in 30+ hours a week of class and homework. Calculus is another 4 to 5 units and at most colleges 18 units is the max you can take without special approval. I do not reccomend adding anything else.
