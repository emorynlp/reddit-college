My current boss said that he will definitely write me a letter of recommendation, but i am leaving this job before the fall to go to a different school in a different city. Is it a good idea to have him (and others) write me letters of recommendation that i can use when i ho to apply for internships or should i wait and request them when the time comes?", "author": "Indiana-Joneses", "created": 1526942638, "retrieved": 1632961656, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
