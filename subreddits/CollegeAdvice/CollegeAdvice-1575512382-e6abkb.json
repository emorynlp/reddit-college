But since I didnt know what I wanted or really why I was here, I stopped showing up to class and because of this received many Fs. Stupidly I wouldnt even drop the classes. And even more stupidly I kept going back every quarter because hey this is whats expected and made the same mistakes over and over. Eventually, I took a break from college and just started working to figure out what I want. I have figured out what I want and what I want to be and that requires me to go back to school. But I have all these Fs and Ws on my transcript. Should I go back to the school I went to originally or should I go to a different community college altogether? Which would look better when I try to transfer to a 4 year institution? If I go to a different school that is known to be less academically rigorous than I went to originally, will it look like I quit and went to an easier school? Or will it look better on a transcript that I came back to the school I did terribly at and took those classes and did well in them? Or am I simply blowing this all out of proportion and it doesnt really matter at all? BTW if it makes no difference Id prefer the new school because I wouldnt have to retake those classes I did badly in, I could just take any class I would like, rather than retake those previous classes to raise my GPA.", "author": "CollegeHelpPlease1", "created": 1575512382, "retrieved": 1632848741, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
