  "text": "Basically, my dad is from Germany, so I've always beens speaking German as a second language, along with English. For my sophomore year I finally decides to tale German 300 at my highschool. During that year, I took a World Language Competency Test, on which I got a really good score. The results of the test give me four credits of German, so I now have completed my highschool's language requirements. The question is, what now? Should I keep taking German to get an easy A? Take another language? Another class? What choice would be most appealing to competitive schools such as Stanford or Harvard?",
