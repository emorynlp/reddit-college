When I was applying to schools during my junior year of high school, I mostly just looked at local universities, and most were by the recommendation of my mother. In the end, I ended up going to my state university since it was close to home & I got in-State tuition. Shortly after I began my freshman year, my mom said that she was planning on taking a new job in a different state (about 900 miles from where I live now), so my family would have to move down there. Initially, while I was disappointed that we would be moving so far away from the home I had grown up in for the past 10 years, I was a little indifferent since I thought I would be able to stay at the school I am currently in while they moved. It\u2019s not like that I would cut all ties with them, it would just be like the scenario that thousands of other people face when their child goes to school far away.\n\nAs my freshman year in college went on, I found myself to be not too happy and very stressed out, since I started in a very difficult degree program that proved not to be for me. I didn\u2019t make many friends, my room mates were awful, and I ended up being stuck with homework most school nights so I couldn\u2019t do much socializing anyway. Due to this kind of unpleasant environment, I ended up going home almost every weekend my freshman year, since I lived within a 10 mile radius from my college. \n\nThis pattern continued through to my second semester, though by then I at least had joined some clubs so I was able to meet some people. \n\nDuring the beginning of the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, my mom moved to the new state to start her new job, and I stayed at home with my dad, grandma, and two younger brothers. This was a very difficult time for all of my family since we are very close-knit, and it caused all kinds of stress, from my grandma nearly disowning her daughter (my mom) for \u201cleaving us\u201d while she took her job down there, to my youngest brother complaining about having to transfer midway through high school to a new school at our new location, and my dad complaining about having to run the house by himself now. \n\nEventually things leveled out, and due to my poor experience freshman year with living on campus, I decided to commute from home my sophomore year. Overall, I enjoyed commuting better than living on campus since I had my own space and was able to move freely around the community, instead of being stuck in a filthy dorm with no where to go. This helped my family out too, since I was able to help my dad with things around the house, and help my ailing grandma with her own tasks. \n\nI ended up enjoying my sophomore year much more than my freshman year. I did better in my academics, I took a supervisory role in one of the clubs I joined, I made a ton more friends, and I made some good connections with some of my professors and other faculty members. \n\nOnce the second semester started however, my mom started dropping hints that she wanted me to transfer to a school closer to where my family is going to be moving. She kept asking me to submit an application, but I ended up not submitting it, not to be spiteful, but just due to the fact I would forget to since I was busy with class work. Then one day I get an email from the school she wants me to transfer to saying that they\u2019d received my application, without me ever having sent one in. So my mom had taken it upon herself to submit one for me, and I ended up being accepted by the school. \n\nThen during my spring break, my youngest brother, grandma, and I go to visit my mom where she\u2019s been living for nearly a year. (This wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019d gone to see her, or that it was the first time she and my grandma had spoken to each other, it was just a trip to go see her)\n\nI expected that a tour of the school she wants me to transfer to was in the works, and sure enough once we\u2019d arrived and we\u2019re settling down in my mom\u2019s apartment, she gives an itinerary of what we\u2019ll be doing over the 4 day trip, and day 3 was a campus tour. I went on the tour without protesting, but I said a few times how I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of transferring, but these were brushed off by my mom and grandma.  Admittedly, the campus was very nice-looking, and people were very friendly, but I thought the programs the tour guide talked about were very similar to the school I currently go to, and the campus is a urban campus, a feature I was opposed to during my initial college application process in high school. \n\nShortly after I get home from the trip, my mom says that she thinks I should mail a copy of my transcript to the other school for a transfer credit evaluation, which I did. Cut to a few weeks later, and the other school had only accepted 31 out of the 52 credits I earned at my current school, and I would also lose my planned minor; since the new school does not have a similar department or classes, so I would essentially be starting my sophomore year over again if I were to transfer. \n\nI continue to tell my mom and grandma that I don\u2019t really want to transfer, but they reply with \u201cI think you\u2019ll be happier there.\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll, let\u2019s just wait and see\u201d or even \u201cOh, don\u2019t say that.\u201d I feel that my grandma doesn\u2019t want me to stay where I am now since she has grown to be rather dependent upon me for care since I lived at home this semester, and doesn\u2019t want to not have me around for help, as well as missing me, even though my youngest brother will still be in high school and living with my family when we do move. My middle brother was recruited to play a sport for a different college in the same state that we\u2019re moving to so he\u2019ll be moving there for sure, albeit a few hours away from where my family is planning on living. My dad has taken an indifferent stance on the matter of me transferring or not, and is too busy focusing on trying to move house than pay too much attention to it. My mom still wants me to transfer, and I\u2019m nervous that she\u2019ll continue to use sneaky tactics to have me transfer since she keeps telling my dad that she\u2019ll talk to me about it, but has said nothing to me. \n\nI feel very conflicted over this matter, because on one hand, I feel like it would be good for me to have a little bit of independence from my family, but also I will also likely miss them, and my housing situation for next year at my current school is up in the air since it is very difficult to move back on campus after moving off, and I haven\u2019t organized to rent a house or apartment with any of my friends. I also feel like I\u2019ll be letting my parents down if I don\u2019t transfer, but also that I\u2019ll be missing out on some opportunities at my current school if I do. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is a super long post but thanks for reading it, and I really appreciate any advice I\u2019m given.", "author": "phloemnxylem", "created": 1557089129, "retrieved": 1632848966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"emm0fjf": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bl2sv7/my_parents_want_me_to_transfer_to_a_different/emm0fjf/", "text": "I think that it's important to remember here that you are the one going to school, not your family. You need to make the choices that will work best for you and will lead to the best educational experience. The decision that you make overall, whichever way you choose, needs to be yours and yours alone. \n\nIt sounds like your mom is pretty involved in this decision so far, and I think that you should communicate your concerns with her. She is a part of this process, and I understand that you care about her (and the rest of your family's) opinions and want to take them into account when making your decision. But make sure that you only do that - do not let anyone else make this decision for you, and don't take any more steps towards transferring that you don't want to do or aren't comfortable with.\n\nAs you think about the decision of transferring, I would consider the factors that you have already identified, including academic progress, your social life, the campus style (urban, college town, etc.), and proximity to your family. Write all of this down in a chart so you can see it all outside of your head - this helps me when I need to make a big, complicated decision that involves family.\n\nI also hear your concerns about the idea of staying at your current school - you don't want to disappoint your family, and you're worried about how your increased absence will affect them. I think that if you end up deciding not to transfer, your family will learn to understand why you chose to stay at your current school as the best decision for you. In conversation with your family, reassure them that you love them, and that you are asking them to support you in this decision. I would expect that they would have some difficulty doing this initially, but you would need to stand strong in your decision if you think not transferring is what is best for you overall. \n\nMaybe there are some things you can do to strengthen your connection with your family if you stay at your current school - you could set up times to chat over the phone or Skype/FaceTime, depending on what you have available. You could also write letters - your grandma might enjoy that especially. Suggesting these ideas immediately after telling your family of your decision not to transfer could help reassure them that they won't be \"losing\" you, but rather that you all will need to adjust slightly to a new way of living. \n\nGood luck with making your decision and navigating communication with your family! The number one thing is to keep them in the loop and ensure that they feel heard in this matter, while making sure that your decision is truly yours.", "author": "writingoreos", "created": 1557110437, "upvotes": 1}, "emlaoz7": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/bl2sv7/my_parents_want_me_to_transfer_to_a_different/emlaoz7/", "text": "I really wish I could help but I\u2019m simply an incoming freshman to a college with no knowledge on transferring \n\nTry to post it on r/college since there are way more members and many of them would be able to advise you and answer your question", "author": "WpandaReddit", "created": 1557093625, "upvotes": 1}}}
