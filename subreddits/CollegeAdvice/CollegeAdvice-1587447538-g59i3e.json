I think it really depends on what kind of class you're taking for note taking options. \n\nMy first year I only took notes in a notebook. it was okay but not the best. for me it was annoying to have to carry notebooks around. and it was annoying that if I wanted to go back and edit my notes, I couldn't just add something where I wanted, I needed to go onto a new page (and that would mess up the order of my notes). personally with a notebook it wasn't helpful to study with either. you have to keep flipping back and forth between pages and if you can't find something then you spend time flipping through the pages. But I would say that if you're taking a math class or a class where there are a lot of symbols and graphs to write, taking notes on a notebook would be better. \n\nI've seen a lot of people use ipads but not everyone can spend money on a laptop and an Ipad. I now have a 2 in 1 laptop. I can use it like a normal laptop and then I can turn it into a tablet and it comes with a stylus. that for me has been the best option because all my notes are on my laptop. I use OneNote which makes it really easy to take handwritten notes, and you can just use one page for each chapter so all you have to do is scroll instead of flipping through pages when needing to find something. \n\nI now usually take notes on word or OneNote. I use my laptop for all my notes and carry around a small notebook with me just in case I need to use paper in my classes. I just type them out and then I can draw symobls with the touch screen. Sometimes (in my case most times) the professor will post the powerpoint lectures online, so if there was a graph that was included in the lecture you wanted to have in your notes, you can easily use the snip and sketch tool to copy paste it into your notes. With digital notes, it's really really easy to just go back at a later time and add stuff you missed or notes you want to add. It's also nice because then I can have all my notes saved and if I ever need to refer back to any of them in future years, I can still have access to them. \n\n\\*there sometimes will be that one professor that won't allow for laptops to be used in class, in those cases, an ipad or the 2 in 1 laptop can work too (at least in my cases). I usually just ask the professor if it's alright to use those as those for me are my \"notebooks\". if not then it would be smart to carry around at least one 1 subject notebook for in case they say no \n\nin the end, it really is up to you and what you feel best suites your learning and studying style. sorry that this was so long but I really wish someone told me all this stuff before going into college. I've gone through trial and error and wish I could've been doing what I do now when I first started college classes. I think the most most most important advice is to take smart ideal notes. don't spend too much time on copying everything down so neatly and perfectly. trust me, I've tried that and it didn't turn out well. you spend too much time worrying about how the notes look instead of focusing on the material and absorbing the information. also I wouldn't recommend spending too much time copying your notes from paper to digital or vice versa unless that works for you (for me personally it just takes too much time and in the end doesn't help me) but like I said do what you think will work for you", "author": "farah0606", "created": 1588129786, "upvotes": 1}, "fodjy7w": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g59i3e/for_note_taking_in_class_how_do_you_college/fodjy7w/", "text": "A lot of people use laptops and I have seen Ipads used here and there. Personally I usually use a pencil and paper because my politics and law classes often prefer us to not use a computer unless we really need to, because they can be distracting, and \"you can't have a computer in a courtroom\", as one professor said. This seems to be very specific to my major though, in gen ed classes I have taken most people take notes on their computer but in my major classes most people take physical notes. I definitely benefit from note taking by hand, so even in classes where I use a computer I will often copy the notes to paper when I get home. One benefit of an Ipad is that you can write in your own handwriting but still have an electronic copy of the notes. Note taking by hand has many benefits but typing is also faster so its up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away)", "author": "hannah_elise", "created": 1587685627, "upvotes": 3}, "fo2u5gh": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g59i3e/for_note_taking_in_class_how_do_you_college/fo2u5gh/", "text": "It totally depends on what you want to do and what makes you comfortable. \n\nI have a MacBook that I use occasionally for things like taking notes by hand from the textbook, and taking open note tests while using my iPad to look at the notes.\n\nPersonally, my school gives us iPads for learning and all of our teachers give us their PowerPoints to follow along with while they lecture. For basic classes that are mostly lecture, I'll put the PowerPoint into an app called notability (I think it's $10 but our school has it for free) and just highlight or add additional notes onto the PP. For more discussion based classes, I will open up a blank page on notability and write my own notes. \n\nOf course, some people can't learn this way. Personally I retain information better if I write it out but I'm too lazy to do that, but I do make quizlets which help.
