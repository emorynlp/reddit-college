Wanting to drop out of trigonometry for the second time", "text": "Look, ill be honest. I had no idea what the hell I wanted to pursue when I graduated last June. All my friends wanted to be engineers so I thought \"hey, if they can do it, I can do it\". I figured I would please my parents and do something in the STEM program. They were thrilled and so onward I went. First semester I was majoring in CHEM E and I didn't mind it so much. It was easy. Trig was the hard class. SO I decided at a point when I didn't know literally anything in the class to drop it. I went on with the semester and realized by the end of it that I no longer wanted to be a chem engineer. SO I changed my major (without my parents knowing ofc) to PreMed. Little did I know that I had to do the same damn classes I would've had to do for chem e so I was like \"alright, well I changed my major maybe I can do trig again but with a different prof.\". Well here comes second semester and I take trig again and its alright but I quickly realize I don't know wtf is going on and I see myself not doing so hot but I think to myself \"if I push through all the quizzes and tests, Ill be fine and I won't need to drop again\". Well here we are coming up on the 3rd test and I don't want to even walk into the class tomorrow to take the test. It would just be embarrassing to have the prof grade the test, I already know it. I changed my major for the 3rd time today to psychology and I'm hopeful for my upcoming major but I'm debating if I should just drop trig and not do it again or if I should continue doing poorly and just get the grade in the class. I don't need to take it for psych honestly. I have a 3.7 gpa atm and I really don't want this class to drop it bc I know it will. The deadline to withdraw from the class is next Monday 4/23 and I kinda need advice as to what you think I should do. Also, my parents don't know I've changed my major to psych which is fine bc I live 3 hrs away from them and they don't pay for my college. Its just hard having to do something in order to please them and not liking it, but they don't understand. They're set in their ways I guess. Anyways, all and any advice or comments are welcome.
