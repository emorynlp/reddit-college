  "text": "So a little about me. I attend a UC and I am going into my 4th year studying in chemistry. It is too late for me to transfer out of the major so I'm stuck here. The issue at hand is the fact that I seemed to lost all motivation. I got two F's the past quarter and my grades have been dropping my entire 3rd year. I want good grades and I want to raise my GPA. Am I studying wrong? When I do study, I study now with the mentally of hoping to \"pass\" not to get an A. How can I change this mentality of mine? I really need to do a a 360 but I am so lost as to what I am doing wrong.",

How are you studying?\nInstead of only studying when an exam is coming up soon, study class material within a week of learning it. Someone once told me that when you are \u201cstudying\u201d right before an exam, it should actually just be a review since you\u2019ve committed all the information into your long-term memory right after learning it.\n\n2. What is your health and study environment like?\nLimit distractions like your phone, a noisy roommate, or your own hunger.\nTake a shower, eat a nice and fulfilling meal, catch up on your sleep, and find a quiet environment to study. Look into apps made to help you stay off your phone like \u201cFlora\u201d or set an alarm to go off when it is time to take a break.\n\n3. Do you procrastinate?\nIf something is due on Friday, write down in your planner or make a mental note to have it done by Tuesday.\nMaybe write a to do list and have it in order of importance.\n\n4. Remember that someone is having to pay for your classes. Whether it is a parent, yourself, or anyone else. Think about how much it costs to retake a course and what that money could\u2019ve gone to instead if only you studied.\n\n5. Join or create a study group. Set a date to meet with a classmate(s) and go through the class notes together. Just having an open discussion with someone about some class info will help you remember it.\n\n6. Ask for help. Seriously, ask a counselor what to do about your situation because I don\u2019t even feel like I answered your question properly.\n\nEach day is another chance to correct your mistakes or to learn from them. With a little effort each day, you will succeed. Good luck, internet stranger!",
