But now, my mom came to me with a different idea.\n\nShe has a \u201cshe shed\u201d in the backyard. It\u2019s completely furnished with heat and air, and her office is out there (she works from home). It\u2019s quite nice, actually. It\u2019s in the backyard. Anyways, she suggested that they expand the unit to fit a cook area, a little more general space, and add a bathroom. The idea is that I would move in, and she would take my current bedroom for her office so I technically \u201cmove out\u201d.\n\nI loved the idea of actually moving out, but there\u2019s the benefit: If I moved into the backyard unit, my IRA will cover all 4 years and I will have no student loans.\n\nWhich option sounds best? Off campus apartment or backyard furnished \u201ctiny home\u201d?\n\nNote, my parents will 100% fuck off and give me full privacy. They said I\u2019ll be able to do whatever by that time if I stayed there in the backyard (technically staying at home).", "author": "kissyoursister", "created": 1578422743, "retrieved": 1632848398, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fdj75x6": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/elfpv1/need_advice_for_housing_next_fall_when_i_start/fdj75x6/", "text": "How far is the she-shed vs an off campus apartment, and are you in a state that gets snow?", "author": "Unleaver", "created": 1578460361, "upvotes": 2}, "fdi9uca": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/elfpv1/need_advice_for_housing_next_fall_when_i_start/fdi9uca/", "text": "If you can get out of college debt free, do it!
