Also, I spend way more time on homework than most others. I just can't picture myself getting a job, when I seem to be barely keeping up with the pace of some courses. Does this seem like an adequate reason to drop out of college?", "author": "Major_Fifth", "created": 1543630553, "retrieved": 1632849387, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ebdngs2": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/a1yyxq/how_do_you_know_whether_or_not_college_is_right/ebdngs2/", "text": "No! Not an adequate reason at all. Believe it or not working in the real world has almost no reflection on how well you did in college. I worked my a$$ off in college and graduated summa cum laude but I am now working for people that prob barely even graduated college. You need that degree to get your foot in the door. Once you\u2019re in it\u2019ll be all about proving yourself and moving up. So my only piece of advice is- GRADUATE. \nAs for the friends thing, join clubs, go out with even just one friend for drinks (it\u2019ll lead to you guys meeting others that are out). Keep putting yourself out there. You got this.", "author": "livelaughcake", "created": 1544301299, "upvotes": 2}}}
