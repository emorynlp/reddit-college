Reason being is that my mom thought I would like it (I\u2019m autistic and enjoy hands on things *and* patterns/sequences) and I actually really do like it, at least what I have learned so far. I went to college for a year and dropped out due to depression and not being able to choose a major. My mom thinks it\u2019s a good idea for me to pursue a degree in computer science so that I can have some sort of coding job after graduation, which I don\u2019t disagree with. The only thing is that I barely have any knowledge on the subject. I know some basic html and a tiny bit of css. I learned it all through udemy and skillsuccess. My question is, will this hurt me once I start school? What I mean is, do I need to know more in order to start, or will I learn everything I need to know once I begin classes? I start a fully online program through SNHU in March.", "author": "MO-life-MO-problems", "created": 1548300905, "retrieved": 1632849342, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eeuhx3h": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/aj8a2w/do_i_need_a_lot_of_knowledge_about_computer/eeuhx3h/", "text": "Of course not.
