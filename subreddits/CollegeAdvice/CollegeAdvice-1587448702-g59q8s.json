Each school has their own alumni list and you can even look at alumni who have specifically majored in environmental studies. \n\nAsk them how much going that school helped them in their career and how much did it help them specifically with their major.

However, I am not far from the university so I do know what the area is like and the campus.  It's not an exciting campus but it offers the same things you would find on a campus in a big city.  The city itself is in a suburban area.  You might have to travel to Irvine (further south) for internships.  There is public transportation (bus system) but that will cut into your time to commute by bus. From campus you can take the bus to downtown Fullerton. There are shops and restaurants but it's not a big downtown.  There is however a train station there so you can take the train into downtown LA, head home, or into other parts of SoCal (all the way into San Diego).\n\nI would suggest looking for companies that you could internship for and see where there offices are/if they have an office in the city you want to study in or nearby.  Also just google the campus and see what the area is like.  Don't forget you can also do your internship during the summer so you don't have to worry about trying to balance your schedule.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "philatellie", "created": 1588622700, "upvotes": 1}, "fo5hmwi": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/g59q8s/help_me_choose_a_college/fo5hmwi/", "text": "My immediate answer is one of the California schools.
