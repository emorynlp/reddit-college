I mainly worry about 2 things,my classes and social life,but currently i worry the most about my social life there because i know that induction is a way to meet and connect with people and mostly im an introvert so i really rely on the Induction week to meetup with new friends and not be ''the clueless one''. Any advice would be appriciated, thx", "author": "Cloudceejay", "created": 1566974889, "retrieved": 1632848867, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
