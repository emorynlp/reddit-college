Do any chores for family memebers? Look on camous websites usually under \"yourcollege'sname student jobs\" mine has a list of on campus jobs, some are like window washing and moving boxes which dont require too many previous work experineces. Otherwise in the \"off campus\" section are job offers from like local apartement complexes who needed someone to help paint an exterior or a local shop who needed someone to work a cash register. Just put your best on an application, try to visit an establishment and ask if the manager is there and if you can have an application, whats happened to me on like 2/the12 some jobs ive worked at and if its not busy the manager might sit down with you and if you're lacking previous jobs, you can wow the manager with how determined you are to work at their location. \nGood luck to you", "author": "Gohgie", "created": 1553042387, "upvotes": 1}}}
