Then life happened. I was in an abusive relationship with a lot of physical and emotional violence and was in an accident where I broke my back. I had been doing graphic design, web content, etc. since high school so I stuck with that. I now work for a university in Public Relations and sitting in front of a computer all day which is slowly sucking my soul away and contributing to my depression and making my life and purpose seem meaningless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The program:**\n\nThe grad program I am working towards, and have 2 terms into, is a Master of Arts in Teaching Biological Sciences at Miami University. The program is focused on directing informal education (for formal if you already have a teaching license) programs such as at a zoo, aquarium, interpretive center, national or state park, conservation center, you get the idea. My capstone project is on engagement in conservation education through print and digital media. Here\u2019s a link for anyone interested: [https://projectdragonfly.miamioh.edu](https://projectdragonfly.miamioh.edu/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I took a break:**\n\nI have pretty severe major depression (bipolar 2) and I had a really bad episode in conjunction with developing hypothyroidism (probably a large contributor) which gives you a lot of the same symptoms plus achyness, insane fatigue, hair loss, freezing cold all the time, etc. I needed some time to recover and adjust to both new synthetic thyroid hormone and new anti-depressants, so that\u2019s what I did. \n\nI\u2019m going to start with the cons and the reality of the situation:\n\n* I have a LOT of student loan debt because my POS ex boyfriend lived off of me while I was in college on the promise that he'd help me pay off my debt when he was finally successful (he was a software engineer/web developer and I'd planned on marrying him) then, shocker, he dumped me during the last term of my senior year. Yeah, I was 18 and an idiot so it's my fault. Nonetheless, I have about $67k worth of student loan debt. I don't make a lot right now and my payments are pretty reasonable at about $160 a month but who knows how that could change. I\u2019d have to take out about anther $10k to finish.  \n \n* The job market I would be going into is somewhat of a niche and finding a job would be tough all other factors aside.  \n \n* My current boyfriend, who I've been happily with for about a year, is tenured with the USDA and basically can't leave the small college town where we live. Further limiting my opportunities to find a job. I could possibly commute to slightly larger cities about 1 hour+ away.  \n \n* Despite the flexibility of this program, let's face it, working full time and going to school is ROUGH. Goodbye social life. Goodbye any free time. Goodbye savings account.  \n \n* Like I said, I have major depression/bipolar 2. This has plagued me my entire life and have spent the majority of my life being tortured by it. Despite currently feeling really stable and feeling like I have my medication where it needs to be again, I am really afraid I'll have another bad episode and won't be able to finish the program and then all of this is a giant waste. Having to take a break from my program has rattled me made me question myself and if I can do this.  \n \n\n**The Pros:**\n\n* I\u2019d actually have a chance at getting a job I will enjoy.  \n \n* I enjoy every second of this program.  \n \n* I\u2019d have the pride and self esteem boost of having a masters degree.  \n \n* Emotionally I feel like my life has some meaning working towards this degree and feeling like I could actually be a force for good in this short life.  \n \n* The program is flexible, almost entirely online (with the exception of research and projects I conduct at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle) and I can do it while still working full time.  \n \n* I can likely get another job in public service (as I do now) and have my student loans forgiven after 10 years.  \n \n* I\u2019ll be be able to spend some time studying at a Marine Science and Conservation Center in Australia. I\u2019ve never been abroad and never got to study abroad in undergrad because I was too poor, which is something a deeply regret, so having a chance to do that is a big deal to me.   \n\n* Though stress (like college stress) does contribute to my depression my life track is a HUGE contributor if not a large cause (aside from my terrible genetics and poor brain chemistry).   \n \n* I\u2019m already in this program and I managed to get in without taking the GRE. The likelihood of getting into another program without a fuck ton of work and money feels really unlikely and why would I? I did a ton of research before I applied to this program and this is really the one I want to do. Basically, I feel like if I don\u2019t complete this program I have to give up on a life goal of having a masters degree.   \n \n* I feel like this is my only chance to jump the tracks into a different career otherwise I\u2019ll be stuck doing public relations forever, which I only went into because I failed at reaching my original dream of teaching.   \n \n* Despite the fact that I do have a lot of obstacles I am a damn persistent and persevering person and have pushed through (still gotten up, still gone to work, still taken a shower) when I was at my worst. People that live with this fucking horrible illness will understand how difficult this can be. What I am saying is that despite my fears I\u2019ve definitely accomplished more with worse odds against me. So, yeah\u2026   \n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read all this, holy shit, you are a saint. I really appreciate any thought or advice. As you can see there is a lot to consider... Thank you so much.

I think finding joy is important for people with depression. There are cons to everything, but if the traveling and the animals and the teaching bring you joy, I say you should continue. Honestly, you\u2019re already in debt so even though more sucks it\u2019s not the absolute worst thing. And you\u2019ve made it this far in the program! Won\u2019t it be great to say that you finished? Even through all of these problems. ", "author": "amandamae689", "created": 1550890688, "upvotes": 1}}}
