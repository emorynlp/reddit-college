Idk", "text": "Hello I am a 19 year old college sophomore at a community college in their state transfer program(so my credits will 100% transfer). Currently I am a Business Administration transfer major with a plan to focus on Marketing (and maybe  international business). However I am constantly going back and forth mentally between business and biology. WHY? It is because I have am interest in the skin care field, I thought maybe in marketing I could find a skincare company to work for. And possibly in a future dream work on developing my own skincare product/company. However in majoring in biology I could pursue a career in dermatology as a doctor(takes 12 years total +$$$). I would get knowledge on dermatology which could be beneficial in wanting to have a side career in skin care. Also it is a more stable career, kinda a back up plan? my hairdresser was originally a dermatologist for a period in her life before, and eventually stopped and opened a hair salon, which was her dream. I don't hate either option, so I thought maybe I should double major so I have a backup plan? Or minor in business and major in biology? I don't have anyone I could really get advice from. I'm really torn and unsure of what to do? I know 100% that I want to work in the field of Skin care. Please offer me your opinions and advice, college is kinda overwhelming, especially when it comes to deciding majors.", "author": "lean01", "created": 1573083364, "retrieved": 1632960951, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f6tgkn0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/dsoprz/help_double_major_swap_idk/f6tgkn0/", "text": "Look at the type of job you want specifically and then look at how the companies are hiring for that.
