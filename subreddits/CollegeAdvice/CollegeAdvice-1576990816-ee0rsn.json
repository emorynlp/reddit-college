I\u2019ve been given a deadline of December 27th to fully commit to NYIT, which means submitting all my financial applications and information so I can have money to actually go to the school. Thing is, I\u2019m still waiting on BU to respond to my application and tell me whether I\u2019m accepted, denied or what have you. I submitted my application to BU in mid-November for the trustee scholarship deadline and BU is my dream school. The question is, do I fully commit to NYIT or do I wait on BU? Also, is it possible to submit financial stuff and then cancel later because I\u2019m going somewhere else?  I\u2019m really lost in when it comes to stuff like this,  sorry.", "author": "C-H-O-K-E", "created": 1576990816, "retrieved": 1632848573, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fd6yl3g": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/ee0rsn/commitment_issues/fd6yl3g/", "text": "Hi! I'm not sure if it helps at this point but...\n\nchoose the scholarship school. My dream school was the university of alabama, but I would have over $100,000 worth of loans. I ended up going to a much smaller, local, and state school where I had a full tuition scholarship offered. \n\nTrust me on this one, when your friends are all giving up their Christmas bonus checks to pay off student loans, you'll be going on vacations :) That's what I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you would like some more advice, my sister and I are making a series of youtube videos on what college to pick and scholarships, etc. (plus a few goofy and fun videos in between).
