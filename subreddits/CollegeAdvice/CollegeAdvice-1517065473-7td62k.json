I live in the suburbs and the university I am going to is more towards the city (tons of traffic to get there) I have to leave before 6am to get there on time otherwise I'll be stuck in the city traffic for hours. I cannot function on less than 7 hours of sleep but I can't go to bed at 9 every night as I have other responsibilities. I live right by the high school I went to and I just threw on the same uniform every day and tied up my hair like we had to so I never had to get out of bed before 7. But now I will be at college before I am even normally awake. Luckily my classes are usually only until 1pm so I won't be stuck in the evening work traffic. This is just a very big change for me as I am going to a new area and people from my high school don't usually attend this college so I am not going to know anyone apart from my boyfriend, some of his friends (all in their last year now) and my EX best friend. My university fees are also about $8000 (US) a year which is extremely expensive in the country I live in. This makes me feel guilty because it's more than double other universities I could've gone to but I didn't meet some of the requirements in time due to medical reasons. I feel extremely bad that my dad has to pay such high fees plus the petrol money to travel to campus everyday. I am very excited but also nervous to meet new people cause it's a very snobby area and people aren't the friendliest. I am also not a 100% sure if this is the course for me but I enjoy learning new things and I got very high marks in high school but am not sure how uni will go and I am nervous of failure. It will also be difficult to join clubs and sports teams at this uni because meetings and practices are held off campus and even further from home. So basically how can I deal with waking up early every single morning, feeling guilty for wasting my dads money (even tho he agrees if should spend my first year there) and making new friends as I'm very shy?

So I don't think you should feel too bad, considering that you may even be able to apply for financial aid (FAFSA). When it comes to making friends, I would definitely say that you should try to join clubs, greek life or something outside of school. This will help you tremendously, and maybe even make the traffic worth it.
