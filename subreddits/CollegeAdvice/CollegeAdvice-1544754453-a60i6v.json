SRS.", "text": "I am in a bit of an odd situation, as I have no real way of comparing my academic performance to my peers. First of all, I have been taking high school courses since my 7th grade year of middle school, and completed 4 high school credits before I even made it into high school. Because of that, I have always been in courses that were on level, but on level for somebody who was two grades ahead of me. (Ex: In my posted transcript, I took algebra 2 my freshman year, which is on level for a junior in high school, and several other classes that are on level, but years ahead of my current grade level.) This has made my GPA in these classes average, or below average. Will colleges take into account that even though they are not AP or IB classes, I was taking them YEARS before I was supposed to? I am also an early graduate, and will be graduating one year early with the class of 2019 with a distinguished diploma. My current cumulative GPA not taking this year into account is about a 2.9/3.0. I am now in my senior year, and on track to finish this year with a unweighted 4.0, or a weighted 4.33. Please give me advice here, I am terrified that I am not going to be able to get into a good school because admissions will just see my average GPA and performance and not care about the fact that I took my classes years before I was supposed to. Please just give me any advice, I am thinking about meeting with an admissions counselor at a local private school to get their opinions. My transcript is attached. Thank you. (Also, there is no grade 11 on my transcript because I do not have a grade 11, I skipped 11th and am currently completing my senior year.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ytojovgm5421.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cef8c44c09a93f7194bd7b62a6badb03f7a9e94", "author": "theawesomeman31", "created": 1544754453, "retrieved": 1632961590, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
