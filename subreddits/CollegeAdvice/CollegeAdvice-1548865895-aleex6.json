It has never been a strong point of mine. TL;DR at the bottom\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could use some advice,\n\nMy passion is numbers, I absolutely adore running over numbers, organizing and observing them; as well as comparing them. I used to play a game on my Nintendo DS by the name of Harvest Moon DS Cute; and I would pour over the best way to get crop yields, and how to strategize the best inputs for the best income. I was doing these things at 7 years old, and loving it. This was a hobby I carried on until I got into highschool, where my melodramatic unnecessary hatred of math decided to come out. I was notoriously bad at math, with the exception of Statistics, where I actually got a 100% on my class final.\n\nNow that I am, ~~albeit just a little~~ older, I have re-found my passion for numbers in a new way, budgeting. I overlook every possible expense of my husband and I's, all the way from our gross and net income, to our monthly bills, down to the habitual purchases we make every day (i.e: Coffee, eating lunch at work, etc.) and was able to move out at a young age by budgeting and keeping to a spending plan, where we could live comfortably, pay our bills and add to our savings. \n\nI have military obligations that require me to be away from my home coming up this year that would have me occupied and unable to go to college for roughly a year and a half to two years, however, I would like to begin narrowing down the correct career field that would best suit my passions. From friends, colleagues, and family members I have two options of potential fields of study, as well as degrees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Accounting\n\n* This involves more of the inspection and comparison of financial data, especially concerning money. This seems like the most appropriate option, but the tax season intimidates me.\n\n2. Data Analyst \n\n* This is more of a suggestive and more involved role, where input can be given and I would (theoretically) be involved in some decision making, which very much is something I would love to do. However, Data-Analysts do not directly deal with money, it can deal with other forms of information, and for whatever reason I have a weird quirk where if the data is not interpreted in the form of currency, it becomes a little harder for me to grasp the concepts. \n\nAnother thing that needs to be said is that as I will more than likely be following my husband around to his duty stations, as he is active duty, whereas I am National Guard. \n\nWhat universities, programs, as well as career fields do you think would best suit me? Ask any and all addtional relevant questions to best help me understand what I should do with my life. I have the general concept, however narrowing down the exact field I need to dedicate my time to is a roadblock for me. Any and all feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I like numbers, what should I do with my life?
