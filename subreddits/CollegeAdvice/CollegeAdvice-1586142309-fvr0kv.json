But problem is I often realize that I don't know everything needed on the test. When I take a test I realize that I don't know as much as I think I know. I did do my readings, but I often struggle with retaining info. Oftentimes I would be tricked by myself unintentionally into believing that I've actually committed it to memory, just to discover that I actually failed at doing so later.  Also, I suck at reading in general and struggle with it.  Oftentimes I don't know everything that's on the test even if the test is testing everything from the book.\n\nOther than trying even harder, any more advise on how to deal with this so I can learn a lot in the class and get a good grade without having to cheat on tests? (I usually don't cheat, but I'm more likely to cheat now that tests are online).", "author": "chenthehen", "created": 1586142309, "retrieved": 1632961092, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmk3rst": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/fvr0kv/how_do_i_make_sure_i_know_everything_i_needed_for/fmk3rst/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1586143837, "upvotes": 1}}}
