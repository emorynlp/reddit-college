  "text": "Hey A2C Community,\n\nOne of my colleagues on the research team at my company slacked me about this, and I thought I'd share. Please go to their website if you have questions, I'm not affiliated with this program in any way, I just thought it was cool and I know lots of people are desperate for summer programs atm.\n\nMy colleague's description: \"If your students are looking for an online hands-on research program I found one available online- Molecular Biology Research Immersion Program - ONLINE\n\nhttps://researchscholars.ucsd.edu/currentprograms/lifesciences/index.html#\n\nHaven\u00b4t come across any others out there of this kind with applications still open so would expect there to be a bit of competition. \"\n\nBest of luck!",
