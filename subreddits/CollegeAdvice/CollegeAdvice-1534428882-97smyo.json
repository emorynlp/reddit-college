  "text": "I started my bio major in sophomore year because I switched, however, my advisor for some reason did not assign me in the major first classes that freshmen usually take. So now I am a junior taking one freshman class among junior classes. Next year I\u2019m projected to take the major sophomore classes as a senior. I feel ashamed and stupid. Like I\u2019m wasting my time and I\u2019m doomed to never land a job or graduate school. Please help!",

          "text": "Thank you. I\u2019ve met with my advisor in panic today and I\u2019m going to apply for summer school. I don\u2019t want to be one of the older students there plus there\u2019s paying for extra time in school. I am also worried that having to spend more time would impact my acceptance for jobs or internships..",
