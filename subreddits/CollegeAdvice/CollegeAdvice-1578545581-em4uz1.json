  "text": "Hey everyone, im 2nd year college student and as many others rely heavily on my laptop. I have a Toshiba laptop and it messed up, so i need recommendations. Im also part of a low income household, and I have no idea which laptop would be best for me as well as it being affordable. I usually have my laptop for documents, sometimes gaming (very rarely) & of course school work. Any recommendation helps! Thank you.",
