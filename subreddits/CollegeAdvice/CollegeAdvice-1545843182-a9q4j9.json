  "text": "After failing two classes this fall semester I got kicked out of my degree program. Throughout my time in college, I\u2019ve been a \u201cB\u201d average student. Going into this semester I had a 3.1 GPA, after I have like a 2.7. I\u2019m just so confused about how I can be kicked out of program with a now \u201cC+/B-\u201c average... \n\nThis whole situation is so confusing. The email came from a different advisor in the program, not mine. And the required GPA for graduation is a 2.0, which I\u2019m well above. Also when I go online to view my student profile, nothing looks different yet. ie, no holds, messages, and I can still view my upcoming semester classes.\n\nI have a meeting with my real advisor and the potentially the board of academic appeals set for the day after New Years but I\u2019m just a giant ball of stress and anxiety.
