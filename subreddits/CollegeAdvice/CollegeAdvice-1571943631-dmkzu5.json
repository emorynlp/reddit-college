  "text": "The past few months, life has been hard. My grades suck, and I'm panicking because I can't lose my scholarship or else I literally have no way to pay for school without taking out $50k in loans. I'm scared to think about the reality of the current state of my physical and mental health, because I know they're both pretty bad. I'm always tired and unmotivated. It feels like I'm just on my own in this mess that I've created for myself. All my problems are a product of my own poor choices and lack of judgement. I lie to my parents and doctor and say that I'm getting better at managing my time, and that I'm meeting people, and my grades are getting better, and none of it is true. My social anxiety is at an all time high, and I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have no idea how to find friends, or a friend group. Lol, every emotion I have is overshadowed by guilt and regret. I don't know what's wrong with me.",

      "text": "I\u2019m going through a similar issue. I struggle with depression and anxiety and making friends has not been easy because of this. When I\u2019m feeling over whelmed what I tend to do is make a list and start with the small stuff. I\u2019ll analyze it and think of ways to solve it then I force myself to do it. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but the hardest part is taking the first step to completing that process. Your health should always come first. Talk to your doctor and your parents. They\u2019re here to help you even through speaking out is hard. I get it. Start with your health because that\u2019s the most important. Then move on to all the others. Talk to your instructors and ask about resources or tutoring or if there is anyway they can help you to improve your grades.  I don\u2019t know if this will help but I really do hope you start to feel better soon and that this stress goes away. I believe in you! :)",
