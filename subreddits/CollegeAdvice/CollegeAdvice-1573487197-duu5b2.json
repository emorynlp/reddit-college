  "text": "I really don't want to fall into the starving artist gutter, but I am skilled for literally nothing else. I'm not sure what major to pick, but for now, it will be Visual Arts and art having to do with interactive media.\n\nWhat should I write my essay about?? All of my friends have written their essays and I have mine, but I don't know if it's good enough or if I should write a new one entirely. I could post a link to the doc below if anyone could proof read it, that would absolutely save my ass.\n\nAlso, are there any good scholarships for young artists? I have been looking for a long while, and I have come to just a handful of things with tight deadlines.\n\nThanks for reading of you did, and thanks in advance if you help me out!",
