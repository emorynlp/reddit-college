  "text": "I got into both Cornell and GT for biomedical engineering (although I might switch to mechanical engineering) and I\u2019m not sure what to do. With total costs, Cornell looks like it is going to be around $12,000 more per year. I\u2019m leaning towards GT because of the cost, but is Cornell worth taking out loans?",

      "text": "Look Bro I\u2019m going to be honest with you. You have been accepted to basically the top engineering schools in the world . You won\u2019t be short going to one instead of the other . I\u2019m choosing to go to UF because of state tuition but if I had the money I\u2019d be going to Georgia and I believe that is the smartest thing you could be doing . Do your graduate or post undergraduate self a favor because you\u2019ll be recognized as a top tier student no matter where you select .",
