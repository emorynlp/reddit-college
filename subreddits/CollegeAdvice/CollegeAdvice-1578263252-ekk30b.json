This isn't a complaint about my roommate. We share a weird L-shaped room with a large closet on one wall and bathroom/entrance on the other. It's not big enough to fairly split in half; or I can't figure out a way to do it. I'm the type of person who would feel so much better knowing what side is \"mine\" and what is \"hers\". That way I can do what I like to my space without having to worry about what she thinks. For example right now I'm thinking about switching where my bed and desk is, but I have to wonder 'is that okay?' 'do I need to ask her?' etc. I don't feel like there's much of any privacy in our room. We can hear everything going on in the rest of the house and they can hear us. My roommate doesn't seem to care at all. She's really quiet and just sits in bed on her phone with airPods in all day. Basically whenever she's not in class.\nI don't feel comfortable bringing in the shelves I have.\nI'd really like to feel I have control over the space. I'm not sure how much is reasonable or how to ask, or how to resolve this feeling. :/ Or if I we can even divide this weird room. I tried talking to her about it when we moved in, but she just tried making conversation instead of answering.", "author": "collegekidoo", "created": 1578263252, "retrieved": 1632961151, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
