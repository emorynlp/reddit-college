  "text": "Hello. \n\nI have all my requirements done for graduation but I postponed graduation for the upcoming semester because I have no idea what to do with my life and graduating now would force me to find a job or figure it out all too soon. \n\nI found a career that i'm interested in recently but don't know much about it so i'm going to volunteer at a place to shadow and observe the career for 12 weeks. My issue is, it'll be during the upcoming semester and I don't know whether I should take the semester off or throw in a few classes I would need for this career i'm interested in even though i'm not sure its what I want. \n\nDo you think I should take the semester off and maybe find a part-time job while volunteering, or should I just take the classes anyway?\n\nI get financial aid and I know if I take the semester off, and return to take classes after the upcoming semester, I would have to pay out of pocket. \n\nMuch thanks!",
