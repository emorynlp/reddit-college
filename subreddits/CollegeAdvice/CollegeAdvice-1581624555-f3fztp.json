I asked the library and teachers at school and either they don't know or they give me vague answers like \"check the school site\" and others, including the library staff in front of me is like \"email the library\" and I'm in the library why not tell me and yeah I did check, but their was nothing there that could lead me to it , I tried google scholar but most appealing articles are block by a paywall.\n\nI did manage to find some books though, but I would like more up to date resources. so if anyone knows any trusted or useful sources, sites, information, media I could use let me know. It will be much appreciated. I'm doing a topic on the effects of segregation in Georgia communities, mostly post-segregation.", "author": "Coyotelightning-T", "created": 1581624555, "retrieved": 1632961140, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fhxolfy": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/f3fztp/any_good_sources_for_articles_and_media_for/fhxolfy/", "text": "You're in University correct? Almost every university library subscribes to databases on behalf of faculty and students. JSTOR is my favorite database, contains hundreds of academic journals and a well-coded wayof searching up academic articles about a variety of topics. \n\nIf you can't find out if your uni has access to JSTOR, \nMeet with a subject librarian at the library. You might be able to find a staff contact list online of the different librarians, there might be some who specialize in history or race studies. If you're still having trouble, go to the front desk and ask to speak to a librarian about getting access to academic databases.", "author": "CapriciousCupofTea", "created": 1581958960, "upvotes": 1}}}
