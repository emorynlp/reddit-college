I hear about the CHSPE test that I can take to legally drop out of high school and then go to college with it. As of right now, high school is rather boring for me and seems like a waste of time. If I were to drop out, what would my best options be and how should I apply to college. My plan is to apply for a community college for the first 1-2 years and then later transfer to a UC school junior year. Should I do this? How?", "author": "tomthegreatest", "created": 1547707114, "retrieved": 1632849348, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eecn82g": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/agv0ml/chspe_to_drop_out_and_go_to_college/eecn82g/", "text": "I passed the CHSPE and have been attending my community college for a while now. The next testing date would be in March, so you would probably get your certificate at the end of your junior year. The catch is you can only apply to community colleges. To transfer to a UC, you would have to stay at 2 least years(up to 3 if you are a STEM major). Although you can transfer to most other colleges after one year. The tricky part would be that transfer rates to anywhere but the UC's are notably lower. How are competitive are your grades and SAT/ACT/AP scores?
