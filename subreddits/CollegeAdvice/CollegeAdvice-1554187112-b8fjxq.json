  "text": "I am sure similar posts to this pop up in this sub-reddit all the time, and I apologize if it seems annoying. I am new to Reddit and this actually is my first post ever, so here it goes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI go to school full time and am in a band as a drummer. I also currently work as a cashier at Lowe's. I typically work 25+ hour weeks which sucks up most of my time and energy, causing me to not be able to practice drums, practice with my band, or be able to do schoolwork. Lowe's tends to make me work every single day of every single weekend because everyone is required to have open availability on the weekends. I understand this fully, but I cannot even meet up with my group in my Object Oriented Programming class to work on our group assignment because I am so busy and then exhausted after my shifts. This has literally sucked the life out of me and spiked my depression a lot. I do not usually eat breakfast in the mornings because I cannot wake up early enough. I lack the proper amount of sleep and I tend to doze off in class sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, the main question I am trying to get at here is this:\n\nWhat is a job I could have where I make just about the same amount of money without having to sacrifice my entire weekend?\n\nP.S. if anyone knows other sub-reddits I could put this post under, then please let me know.\n\nThanks :)",

              "text": "Some restaurants have shifts that don\u2019t end so late like around 10 or even have earlier closing times. It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask around. \n\nBest way to find a part time job is to take a file full of hard copies of your resume (any work experience, volunteering, physical labor, experience in stressful or service-type situations counts a lot more than you\u2019d think) and visit every shop, restaurant, whatever, in your town, or near your college and ask to see the manager and ask if they are hiring, and present the copy of your resume to them. \n\nYou might find yourself with a few options to weigh in on and pick the best one suited for your circumstances and be able to also talk to someone about it and even ask for consideration for those circumstances. Especially in college towns businesses tend to be pretty understanding that students are also just students. \n\nOtherwise, if you\u2019re really desperate you might just have to buck up and suffer a little for the semester, prioritize your studies over band stuff and make compromises. There is the upcoming summer vacation to consider as well as the prospect of having more control over your schedule in the next semesters...",
