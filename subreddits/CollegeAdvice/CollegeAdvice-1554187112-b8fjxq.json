I am new to Reddit and this actually is my first post ever, so here it goes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI go to school full time and am in a band as a drummer. I also currently work as a cashier at Lowe's. I typically work 25+ hour weeks which sucks up most of my time and energy, causing me to not be able to practice drums, practice with my band, or be able to do schoolwork. Lowe's tends to make me work every single day of every single weekend because everyone is required to have open availability on the weekends. I understand this fully, but I cannot even meet up with my group in my Object Oriented Programming class to work on our group assignment because I am so busy and then exhausted after my shifts. This has literally sucked the life out of me and spiked my depression a lot. I do not usually eat breakfast in the mornings because I cannot wake up early enough. I lack the proper amount of sleep and I tend to doze off in class sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, the main question I am trying to get at here is this:\n\nWhat is a job I could have where I make just about the same amount of money without having to sacrifice my entire weekend?\n\nP.S. if anyone knows other sub-reddits I could put this post under, then please let me know.\n\nThanks :)", "author": "jacobcolemandrums", "created": 1554187112, "retrieved": 1632848991, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ejy5gw0": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b8fjxq/good_places_to_work_for_a_full_time_student/ejy5gw0/", "text": "You could try to find an opening at your college.
