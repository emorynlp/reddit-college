Chasing some advice and slightly insane atm so give this a pass if you don\u2019t like to read.\n\nI\u2019m 18f, graduated from high school last year with a perfect score in English (VH10 so it\u2019s not possible to get better) and decent graduating grades as a whole. Not some genius but very solid skills and an excellent history of high performance in English, literature, debating, creative writing, that kind of thing. I\u2019m pretty confident in that regard but I know a tonne of students in the US have much better grades overall and TBH even some students at my high school ended up outperforming me (though none got close when it came to English and the like). \n\nJust finished a bit of work experience with a law firm (nothing special), very certain about what I want to do and very certain I want to do it in the US. My partner lives about 20mins away from University of Richmond which is pretty much my nerdy liberal arts wet dream. I\u2019d love to study law there.\n\nI think it\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019d like to make the most of my writing/speaking abilities as best I can, because it\u2019s the only competitive edge I can really bank on. I\u2019m throughly lower middle class, live in a semi-rural area so money is very difficult. I\u2019d like to know what my options are. I know shit all about the application process but when it comes to law I really want to give myself the best chance. \n\nI\u2019ve done half a year at the University of Qld under a Bachelor of Arts with ok grades and have guaranteed entry for law at another school (QUT).", "author": "porpoiseprncss", "created": 1538285843, "retrieved": 1632961616, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
