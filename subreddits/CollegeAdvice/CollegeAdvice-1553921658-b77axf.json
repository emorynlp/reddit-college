Some websites say to go directly into a 4 year school to get med school requirements then go straight to med school. Some websites say to major in a natural science and get a humanities degree while in that 4 year school. Some websites also say to not bother with going to a community college. Just the forensic pathologist career path doesn\u2019t have a clear path that everyone follows so I just need some tips in how I should pursue this career choice, starting with how I should plan out college/med school.\n", "author": null, "created": 1553921658, "retrieved": 1632961537, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ejqwyju": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b77axf/advice_on_how_to_pursue_a_career_path_in_forensic/ejqwyju/", "text": "Most people who want to get into med school assume that they have to major in the sciences, but that\u2019s not the case. You can major in any subject for your undergrad. \nHowever, the reason why most people choose a science such as biology, is because a lot of pre-requisites for med school are embedded within the bio degree, and quite frankly, most people who want to go into medicine prefer to study a science. However, I know someone who got into med school with an education degree. \nThere is no right or wrong answer for what you need to major in undergrad. Choose a field that interesting to you, make awesome grades, take the necessary pre-reqs and study hard for the Mcat.\nForensic pathology is what I call an advanced career path, it\u2019s something your aiming for in the future, but is something that you need to break down into steps to achieve \n\nEdit: also, attending a community college has nothing to do with the end goal. Plenty of people attend a CC and then transfer to a 4-year college. I personally think it\u2019s the smart thing to do. ", "author": "mayg09", "created": 1553967445, "upvotes": 1}}}
