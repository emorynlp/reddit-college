So I\u2019ve had the same best friend for the last five or so years and last summer we both planned on taking a trip to the Bahamas this upcoming June. Her family has paid for everything and it\u2019s practically set in stone (unless it\u2019s cancelled because of corona) and I\u2019ve been really looking forward to going on my dream vacation with my absolute best friend in the world. Everything seemed fine till I applied to my top choice of school. My junior year was really rocky and my grades slipped so when I applied to go to the school I also applied to start during the summer in order to boost my application. I honestly didn\u2019t think about the trip when I was submitting my application and if anything I was just hopeful that I would get in for regular admittance and I wouldn\u2019t have to start during the summer. I received my letter of approval but I can only go to the school if I start late June for the summer courses. This would consequently clash with our trip and I wouldn\u2019t be able to go with her. I have the option to start at an alternative campus in August and go there for two years before I move to the main campus for the university (I absolutely love main campus and I want to go so so badly) But I really can\u2019t see myself being happy at an alternative campus. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s my dream to go to this college, but I feel like this is another dream that I could also accomplish by going on this trip with my friend. They\u2019re both once-in-a-lifetime experiences and I honestly am at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know how I could tell my best friend that I can\u2019t go on this trip with her so that I can start at this college during the summer, but I can\u2019t see myself going to the alternative campus for two years before going to main campus.
