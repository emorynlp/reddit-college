  "text": "Hi everyone! So I am a beginner when it comes to anything art. I am starting a graphic design program at an occupational center in August so that I can learn how to get better at art. It will be a two semester long certificate program. I am hoping to gain enough skill in this program to be able to go to college for graphic design. I want to *hopefully* go to CSULB. Which I know I can get into because I went there for a year (had to leave due to health, but on my own terms).\n\nHere\u2019s my dilemma. I am also very interested in animation. I don\u2019t have the skill *yet* but hope to gain them. Problem is that I can\u2019t double major in both graphic design and animation at CSULB because they have a max unit limit for graduation and both majors are high unit degrees.\n\nI was wondering what it takes to go to school for one bachelors degree, then go back after graduating to get a second bachelors degree. How does it work? Have any of you done this? How expensive was it just for getting two separate bachelors?\n\nFinancial aid only covers six years of school so I need to find funding. Other than that, I would like to know more about going to school twice from your personal experiences.\nThanks!\n\nTLDR; I want to go to school to study graphic design, graduate with a bachelors, go back to school for animation bachelors. How does this work?",
