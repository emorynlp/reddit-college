At the very least you could then apply for Stafford Loans.\n\nIn terms of loans, you'll want to start with ones subsidized by the federal government (Stafford), but you'll need to demonstrate financial need (ie completing the FAFSA).\n\nThen, you'll want to get unsubsidized federal loans. You do not need to demonstrate financial need for these. Interest accrues while you\u2019re in school unlike the subsidized ones, but rates are still better than private loans.\n\nIf you need to take out private loans, consult your bank or credit union first to see if they offer any student loans as they typically have lower interest rates and no origination fees (fees charged simply for taking out the loan).\n\nIf all else fails, and you need to take out a regular private loan from a loan company make sure to take a look around ([NerdWallet has a good breakdown of options here including Ascent which specializes in loans with no co-signers)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/loans/student-loans/private-student-loans). You'll want to try and stick with a fixed APR. A variable APR may be smaller in the beginning, but they almost always go up. Then, you'll want to choose the shortest amount of time for paying it back you can comfortably manage. If you choose a 5-year payment plan instead of a 10-year one, your monthly payment will be higher but you will end up paying less in the long run, so you'll want to do the shortest amount of time within your budget.\n\nI hope this helps and wish you the best of luck!", "author": "Whatever21ism", "created": 1581633657, "upvotes": 1}}}
