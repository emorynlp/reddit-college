  "text": "So heres my situation: I am a senior in high school from the midwest interested in marine biology(kinda weird I know lol). I am leaning towards college in Florida because it would obviously be beneficial for my major and I love the area. However, I have been accepted at Colorado State for fisheries bio, and I know it's a great school. I have also been accepted to Florida Institute of Technology, and was unfortunately turned down at University of Miami. Here are my questions: **Are there any other colleges that have strong marine bio programs in Florida I should consider? And since I applied Early Decision 1 at University of Miami, is there any chance I might get a second look from them if I apply for standard admission?** Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from someone who has been/is in a similar situation.",
