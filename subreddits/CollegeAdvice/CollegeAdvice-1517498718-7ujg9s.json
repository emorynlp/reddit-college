I am leaning more toward taking a year off from college before I head toward my master's degree. More and more I am considering something else other than just getting my master's to get licensed as a therapist. I found human sexuality interesting and that's really the only topic I found interesting enough to perhaps counsel in one day. The other topic I found interesting was Ethics and Professional Issues and I am wondering if I should just get my master's in Human Resource. I currently work in a hospital and I even considered Hospital Administration. I still wanna be able to help people and eventually I wanna still get my Doctorate so I don't know where to turn for advice on this.
