Me being one of those people who didn\u2019t like high school, I took the opportunity. I did my standarized tests (1440 SAT 34 ACT) and applied to schools. I applied to 7 and got into 1. That one school is a pretty okay institute of technology which i attend as an Aerospace Engineering student. I certainly don\u2019t hate my school, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s where I want to be.\nMy first choice was Oxford in Physics, but I didn\u2019t have the time to study for the exams you have to take to apply there. Now I am going on a Study Abroad to Oxford for a summer semester and I realise that none of the choices i\u2019ve made in regards to my college experience are actually what I want.\nI want to be an astrophysics major, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get me the jobs. I want to be attending a foreign university (preferably in the UK) but i chose a tropical climate school that is wholly american and has a bunch of white guys with a god complex (I being a female in a school that is 90% male am losing. my mind). \nAnd honestly i could switch majors but my colleges physics program isn\u2019t amazing and I don\u2019t have the money to go to another school in the US without considerable financial aid. I could apply to Oxford or Cambridge and restart college as a freshman (and finish at the same time because they have 3 year degrees) but I don\u2019t think my parents would be for that idea even though it is much cheaper at one of those schools. I\u2019m not really sure what to do. I feel insanely frustrated being at a school, in a degree, and around people that i don\u2019t particularly like and I don\u2019t know how to deal with these problems, so is there anyway to approach this that could make some (if not all) aspects of this at least dissipate? should i try to get into oxford and restart my degree since I would be starting at the same age as every other first year and would still graduate early compared to americans?
