Turned out that the teacher was pretty lax and there were <5 people in the class so he let us use digital copies anyway. I now regret buying the book and I just bring my laptop and use ctrl+f on the textbook to find whatever I need, and it works pretty well for me. There's readings and homework that we do at home, and a digital copy is enough for me for those things. I've gotten digital copies of everything else. In my experience, they're cheaper, don't tear/break, are easy to store, and one laptop/phone will hold all of my textbooks without too much hassle. The thing I love about traditional books is how they feel and how they don't need to be charged, can be resold, and generally look better, but for me, it doesn't justify their weight and lack of convenience.\n\nMind you, I have all of my books in pdf format for convenience, as I really hate online book viewers because of the necessity to have an internet connection at all times, and because of how much the online viewers generally suck. If you can get over that, which is a very big 'if', then I'd reccomend digital copies, whereas if you don't like using online books and their viewers, or are uncomfortable with exporting them to pdf, I'd reccomend the traditional ones. Traditional ones will get you the same functionality, resale value, and the same grade in the class.", "author": "awesomehippie12", "created": 1521421846, "upvotes": 1}}}
