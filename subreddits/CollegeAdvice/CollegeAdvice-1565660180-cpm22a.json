  "text": "hello there, I\u2019m currently packing for college as I\u2019m moving up next week, and my mother and i are in an argument. i want to take my 32 inch TV, she wants me to take my 20 inch TV. she says i have no space for a tv of that size. also, I\u2019m taking my PlayStation and want to take 4 games up with me. she says i should only take two because I\u2019m not going to college to play around, I\u2019m going just to study, work, and sleep. i just wanted some outside point of views",
