  "text": "\nI have a question or more like I want some advice from people that may have been in this situation or someone going through the same thing. I\u2019m currently a senior in college, basically heading into my last semester. But a few days ago I finally came to the realization that I don\u2019t really enjoy or like a lot of things about my major. To be fair, I\u2019d been feeling like this for about a year now but it was too late to start something new and I don\u2019t even know what it is I\u2019d change to. Because of this I\u2019ve adapted an \u201ci don\u2019t care\u201d attitude towards my major and I don\u2019t put as much effort into my classes, projects or anything related to it. My problem is so many people have found their passions and know exactly what they want to do with their lives and I feel like I don\u2019t feel that strongly about anything. There are other subjects and majors I\u2019ve liked but I\u2019ve never felt the urge to pursue them any further either.  It\u2019s just i don\u2019t hate them but i don\u2019t love them either. And now I feel like a disappointment because my parents have sacrificed everything in order for me to go to college so how am I supposed to tell them that I don\u2019t want to use that anymore? Also, how will I know if I find something that I love so much that I want to wake up for the rest of my life and do that one thing? I\u2019m honestly just so confused and I feel like I\u2019m wasting my life and destroying it all at the same time. I\u2019d appreciate any advice anyone can give.",

          "text": "I was thinking of going to grad school for something else, I just need to figure out what that is and also how I\u2019m going to pay for it. I don\u2019t think teaching would be for me at all, I\u2019d never been even remotely interested in doing that but who knows, stranger things have happened. I went to my advising center a little\nwhile ago and sat down with my advisor and explained all this and she all but blamed me for doing this to myself, she wasn\u2019t helpful or understanding which is why I came here to see if I could get ideas or maybe someone would have a perspective that I hadn\u2019t thought of yet. Thank you for your response, it\u2019s helpful to know I\u2019m not the only one dealing with this or something similar. Good luck to you as well, hopefully this turns out in the best possible way for us!",
