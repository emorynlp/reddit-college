My parents, on the other hand, think JMU is a shitty school, which I won't get a degree from. I was really impressed by JMU's psychology program, and plus I'd have to go to graduate school no matter what.

I personally really like showing stats. If you go to college scorecard you can see the average national salary for your degree vs the average debt for that degree at the specific school. You can also show admissions rates to grad schools (google research) and their grad rates/retention stats. If you want to go a little further go into their common data sets (just type James Madison common data set and it should come up). In other words know their reservations with the school and arm yourself with facts to help not only persuade them but also put any fears they might have at ease.", "author": "medicalentusiast", "created": 1578377452, "upvotes": 2}}}
