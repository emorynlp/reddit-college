I really enjoy relying on finding new ways to improve myself and my life but recently I've been struggling to find any good ones.\n\nI would really appreciate any suggestions of websites, books, YouTube channels, blogs, etc that you enjoyed as a young adult/college student.\n\nThank you!!", "author": "Chaotic_Catherine", "created": 1552798409, "retrieved": 1632961549, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"emjg7fr": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b21ok5/what_are_your_favorite_resources/emjg7fr/", "text": "My absolute favorite place on the Internet for young people (especially girls) is Rookie Mag - sadly, they recently stopped publishing new content, but their whole archive is still available online. They have music playlists, personal essays, art, poetry, advice columns, and are awesome! They have a 90s zine vibe. Here's the link:  [https://www.rookiemag.com/](https://www.rookiemag.com/) \n\nAnother of my favorite places to read is the New York Times' online Smarter Living series - they have a lot of good articles on life and skills. I'm currently a digital subscriber through my college, and I'm not sure what your financial situation is, but I think they offer at least a few free articles per month. NYT also recently started a newsletter for college-age students and recent grads called The Edit - I'm not sure if you have to be a digital subscriber to receive the newsletter, but it's worth checking out! They curate online NYT content for a college age audience, and they include special, short non-fiction essays written by an editorial team of college-age and recently graduated writers of diverse backgrounds and geographic locations.\n\nI also LOVE podcasts - some of my favorites are The Moth (real-life stories told by people who experienced them), Dear Hank and John (dubious, comedic advice given by John and Hank Green - John Green wrote The Fault In Our Stars, an excellent book if you haven't read it yet), and Stuff You Missed In History Class (the one on Carry Nation is a favorite of mine)\n\nSome of the articles on BuzzFeed Goodful can be interesting too!  [https://www.buzzfeed.com/goodful](https://www.buzzfeed.com/goodful) \n\nI'd also like to give some book recommendations, but I usually go off of what people like to read and give recommendations of similar books. What do you usually like to read? One author I will recommend straightaway is Anthony Doerr - his prose is so rich and lovely, he is my favorite. His book All the Light We Cannot See is wonderful, as is his story collection The Shell Collector. I'm savoring the stories and working through them slowly, hopefully going to finish the book during my last, upcoming year of college.", "author": "writingoreos", "created": 1557028971, "upvotes": 2}, "eipsi33": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/b21ok5/what_are_your_favorite_resources/eipsi33/", "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in high school and what really helps me is hiking and mountain biking,  even though it\u2019s Clich\u00e9 you always feel accomplished afterward and it\u2019s a healthy activity with time to reflect while in nature ", "author": "ggrriiffffiinn7", "created": 1552804601, "upvotes": 1}}}
