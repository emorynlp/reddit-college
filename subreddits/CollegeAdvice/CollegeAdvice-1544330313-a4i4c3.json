I luckily have a teacher that has really worked with me and does allow retakes of the exams (although they are much harder). \n\nThere are three tests total and a final and I have had to retake every one of those three tests and I have a low grade C in the class. The final is on Monday and the review sheet he gave us was written by the college in a totally different format than what we are used to. Someone please tell me I'm not the only one failing! I am going to be so discouraged if I fail this class as it is one last class away from my associates and this will put it off further! Also, in order to pass this class I'll have to do really well on the final and seeing as my tests have not been that great....I'm nervous.", "author": "justine_10", "created": 1544330313, "retrieved": 1632849381, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ebfe7qp": {"link": "/r/collegeadvice/comments/a4i4c3/might_fail_college_algebra/ebfe7qp/", "text": "Are you able to retry infinitely many times?", "author": "Major_Fifth", "created": 1544364388, "upvotes": 1}}}
