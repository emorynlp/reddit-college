  "text": "I know I'm not the only one to post about this (unfortunately) but I have barely been scraping by in my college algebra class. I luckily have a teacher that has really worked with me and does allow retakes of the exams (although they are much harder). \n\nThere are three tests total and a final and I have had to retake every one of those three tests and I have a low grade C in the class. The final is on Monday and the review sheet he gave us was written by the college in a totally different format than what we are used to. Someone please tell me I'm not the only one failing! I am going to be so discouraged if I fail this class as it is one last class away from my associates and this will put it off further! Also, in order to pass this class I'll have to do really well on the final and seeing as my tests have not been that great....I'm nervous.",

Problem is that I only have until Friday to do another retake on one of those. I've net with the teacher during office hours twice a week since the beginning of semester and also gone to the tutoring center every week.",

              "text": "Well, just remember your not the only one. And, don't even think about comparing yourself to highschool students who take AP math. For me, AP courses were taught much slower than college courses, making them way easier. I would say give it your best shot. If you don't do well, you could always try again! What major?",

This same teacher is also teaching again next semester and I'll take from him again over anyone else just because he has worked so hard with me and allows all the retakes. Its also been 9 years since high school so there is that too! Thanks for the encouragement!",
