I\u2019ve wanted to go to the university I go to since eighth grade. I\u2019m about to go into my senior year at that university studying accounting. I\u2019ve always been the person that knows what I want to do and has had a realistic plan to get it done. \nBUT I just started an internship. It\u2019s not in accounting, but it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity, so I took it. It\u2019s in Merchandising. I didn\u2019t think I wanted to do Merchandising, but after learning what I\u2019m going to be doing in this internship, I\u2019ve realized that my secret dream job since I was like 10 has been in Merchandising. \nBut it\u2019s too late to change my mind, right? I\u2019ll still enjoy accounting. Will I regret switching if I switch? Or will I regret not switching if I don\u2019t? \nHELP!", "author": "livefastdieinyour40s", "created": 1557851569, "retrieved": 1632848953, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
