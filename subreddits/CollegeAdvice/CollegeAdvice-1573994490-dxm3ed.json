But there are 2 problems with the course . 1 the professor puts different stuff on the test then what we studied for, and 2 his grading syllabus. His grading syllabus is what bothers me the most. I feel like this is enabling me even more. I have had classes with more assignments and he is usually 30% of grades. Also no offered extra credit. I passed sta2023 but having difficulty in mgf1106. There is also no online book just PDFs with random pages. \n\nAssignment (5x4 ) 20% \nDiscussions             10%\n Module 3 exam.       10%\nModule 4 and 5 exam     20%\nModule 1and 2 exam  20%\nFinal exam 20%", "author": "Harryfonda2020", "created": 1573994490, "retrieved": 1632848766, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
