Also, I dont even know why you would need a whole dishwasher if you only need to wash a few dishes for yourself or a few friends. Unless you\u2019re planning to cook a whole feast\u2026in that case i guess knock yourself out",

              "text": "Though there will be a bottle of dish soap and a sponge in the kitchen for everyone to use, i would still recommend bringing a small bottle of dish soap and sponges for your own dorm sink. You can easily wash your own dishes in your room without having to go to kitchen. I just mentioned there will be dish soap in the kitchen if you need to wash pots and pans that you borrowed from the kitchen.",
