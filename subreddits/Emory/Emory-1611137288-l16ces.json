                  "text": "Why can't you say that you didn't vote(many people find that as understandable this past cycle except maybe TDR resistance libs or crazy \"the election was fraud\" GOP folks)? It is easy to discuss that neither candidate was really viable.  I get that you have some weird students who really believe that voting Biden gives them some moral highground, but it doesn't and I think it is worth explaining any alternative position to them so that they can learn to think in a more nuanced way beyond just using a Trump Derangement syndrome to justify having alternative bad politics.   I don't know, I think people just have to not be scared or easily frustrated by having a political disagreement in the first place.  If the other person is weird and won't hear certain things, find someone who will. \n\n When I went there it was very liberal generally but when you get into the weeds of conversations that are SERIOUS and not just emotionally charged, they end up super interesting and you see how things like upbringing, class status, race/lineage and other things influence someone's ideas. Often they aren't as homogenous as people think but most aren't willing to try to have a conversation (and I think this is really both sides. Either side is prone to starting with something or someone who is a non-starter).  I mean if you know that saying you voted for Trump is a deal breaker, learn how to start with something else that does NOT center ANY political candidate but instead centers a policy agenda or idea.  I think people have to learn how to have these conversations.\n\nAll that stuff you said about \"Nazis\" or w/e is just people dodging.   Ask some of these same people about what policies they support since they are so \"liberal\"(again not leftist).  You'll find it very limited and unserious given all the stuff they talk.  \n\n\n*Also do not conflate liberalism with leftism. I know college campuses make people highly prone to that conflation but they are NOT the same whatsoever (there can be some overlap on social issues I guess).  I don't think a lot of college liberals or conservatives understand what leftism is and what issues are important to leftists.  Often you just see a bunch of superficial takes on identity/representation and whatnot(lifestyle issues, tone of speech) that is characteristic of liberalism. It's just often very bland and not substantive. And I'm not interested in Emory confessions.  Often you'll get weird stuff in social media spaces like that...especially something for something like freaking confessions of all things.   I wouldn't use it as a barometer of ANYTHING. Just have actual conversations (ideally in person eventually) with folks outside of hypersensational contexts like a confessions website/page or even twitter",

Many near peers have student newspapers that are effectively marketing arms of the university or college until the students get real pissed.  The Op-eds can just be weak in the Wheel at times in a way that reveals the priorities of the student body. Hint: They aren't the same as the schools that are the level of elite that places like Emory and near ranked schools aspire to be.  Don't get me wrong, those schools have similar political leanings, but their papers are much more serious about certain things. Beyond some petty lifestyle things, Emory students aren't very good at making serious demands that will better the school outside of say...\"diversity\" initiatives.  The latter is just not enough",
