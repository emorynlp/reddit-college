  "text": "Now that the dining plans for Fall 2020 are up, I'm wondering which of the 2 (non-kosher) plans I should pick.\n\nDining Plan 19 - 19 Meals per Week + $200 Dooley Dollars\n\nDining Plan 14 - 14 Meals per Week + $400 Dooley Dollars\n\nIs the extra $200 worth 5 meals per week? Would it be worth it to divulge from the dining room meals with 14 a week?",

But I know people who go to to the dining hall just to socialize or prefer actual meals who would probs pick 19. Depends on your eating style/schedule",
