      "text": "My experience has been negative. If you are not in the business school or doing a pre-med program, Emory does not focus on you.  As someone studying the natural sciences I felt as though my academics and programs were an afterthought. My friends who were interested in business joined various clubs like the Emory Impact Investing Group or Goizueta Investment Management Group. The opportunities as a science major are far fewer. There are undergraduate research opportunities, but they are almost entirely unpaid, unlike many other schools, and the programs are limited. The extracurricular but still academically related programs outside of research are non-existent for science majors.\n\nEmory has not treated my social life well either.  The fraternity I was going to join got kicked off while I was still pledging, continuing the trend that has been going on at Emory for the past few years. While most people say it is not \"necessary\" to join a fraternity I disagree. If you want a social life and enjoy going out and having fun, most of the people that also enjoy those things are already in fraternities.  While not everyone is, it will be much much harder to meet new people without joining Greek life especially coming in as a junior\n\nAt this point I can't wait to leave.",

I've never second-guessed my decision to come here. No doubt about it.\n\nIf you're coming in as a junior, there's just one thing I'd warn you about \u2013 by now, a lot of people in your grade will already have friends. To make Emory feel like home, you'll need to work a little harder to meet people. It's totally possible, though. Overall Emory students are outgoing and friendly. \n\nGood luck and enjoy your first year \ud83d\ude0e",
