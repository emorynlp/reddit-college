  "text": "I just got off the Emory College waitlist, I was previously set to attend Oxford college. I simply do not know what to do. Excuse my lack of coherence as I try to describe my situation and current mindset. I feel I would benefit greatly from the academic aspects of the LAC, I have only ever attended small schools and I hear only good things about Oxford. That said, over the course of my college process I was of the belief that I would benefit greatly from the social aspects of a larger campus. I have visited both and genuinely really enjoyed my time at both. I was sort of hoping to rush which is something that is a bit more difficult for Oxford students to do, but I feel like I wouldn't need as much time to adjust to the Oxford lifestyle. I really don't know and have two days to make my decision. Talk to me y'all.\n\nEdit: I should mention that I am probably going to be a PPL major with  secondary interests in history/econ/french.",

Having access to fun things outside of campus was important to me, and it didn\u2019t seem like there was much of anything to do in the surrounding area at Ox. If that\u2019s not important to you, maybe give Ox a try. You\u2019ll be in Atlanta in two years anyway.",

Not to mention the opportunities that Atlanta as a city has. I like a kind of LAC style environment but Emory is small enough for me tbh so idk. I picked Atlanta and so do most people given the choice",

There are very few \"social groups\" at Ox and a lot of them are sketchy, you don't have a lot of options. The only thing that makes me suggest that you might potentially enjoy Ox is the fact that you said you like LACs. However, Ox is a special LAC in the sense that it is extremely small and you will get tired of the people around you very easily. The courses to select from are not nearly as great as those on the ATL campus. Although people say you get more attention from professors at the Oxford campus, if you make the effort to go to office hours and depending on your department, the professors at ATL are still extremely easy to get to know. I know for me personally, I interacted more with professors at ATL more than Ox because they suited my interests better and I had warmed up to college living by then. It also depends on your department though. PM me if you have more questions! Good luck!",

The majors you propose have no disadvantage (in fact I think it may be advantageous to start there for humanities and social sciences)if you start at the Oxford campus and if you are creative enough to make a good social life for yourself(plus Ox seems to have some good traditions and whatnot), you should be fine.  \n\nNow if you end up starting at ECAS and want a truer LAC like education in the humanities or social sciences and wanna learn how to write well earlier, get closer faculty/scholar connections, you probably should consider doing the Voluntary Core or at least some of its courses (I think fellowship/scholarship opps open up for those who do it as well so another perk).",
