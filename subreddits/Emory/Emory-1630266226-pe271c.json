  "text": "Did they ever send out a link to the activities fair orientation (for the InvolvEU week)? I know that we had to check the box to agree that we'd attend the orientation before the fair when filling out the registration on The Hub and that the time was TBD, but we never received any email about the date/time of the orientation. Our club's registration for the activities fair was approved, so I'm a little confused.",
