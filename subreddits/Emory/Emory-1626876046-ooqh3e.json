  "text": "I'm a second year and did random roommate assignment and got a roommate, but I just checked and they are no longer on my dashboard. I'm in Clifton and can see the other people apart of the suite, but the person in my room is gone. Is it possible to be in a double without a roommate if they got a different room and no one is assigned to mine?",
