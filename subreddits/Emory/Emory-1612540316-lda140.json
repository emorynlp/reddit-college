  "text": "Hey all, \n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again where there are a ton of questions about applications and acceptance chances. These tend to clog up the sub and honestly we aren\u2019t the ones making decisions on applications, so it\u2019s not like we can give you a guaranteed answer anyway. \n\nPlease try to keep all chance-me and other application related questions in this thread.\n\nAnd if you were accepted, Congrats! Feel free to pick a flair.",

Emory has a solid Bio department and there is also kinda a negative stigma about the business school for a lot of faculty at the college (for a bunch of different reasons. Some think it\u2019s unethical, some think it just takes students away from the college) so I wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the people reviewing your app didn\u2019t love the BSchool. \n\nDon\u2019t force Bio if it doesn\u2019t fit, but if both work then it\u2019s probably better to say Bio. I doubt it makes much of a difference at all though. It would really only effect you marginally and would not be the reason you get in or not imo.",
