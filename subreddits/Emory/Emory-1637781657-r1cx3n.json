  "text": "So basically this girl and I were talking, like seriously flirting, for a few months. I mean it was planning dates and sexting and all that good stuff. and I thought it was pretty clear that she was interested in me. We hadn\u2019t met up in person all too much besides a few times in class when I got her number and Instagram, but I definitely thought she liked me based on everything.\n\nSo one night we\u2019re coming home from this party and on the way back she starts hardcore flirting with me, telling me how I\u2019m good looking and how she\u2019s happy I am not dating anyone else. This combined with everything else made me feel like there was ample implicit consent and so I kissed her. She kissed me back. We kissed for a bit but did not go further. \n\nA few weeks go by, I had to go home for a family emergency, and then I came back. When I came back she was super cold and disinterested. My friends weren\u2019t talking to me/messaging me either. I was so confused for a second, and then someone told me that this girl told a bunch of people that I actually tried to rape her. \n\nNow I was shocked, I mean I stand up for believing all women and supporting women who come forward, but this was such a ridiculous 180 from this one specific girl and I felt sick to my stomach. I told my closest friends my side of the story and this is where we are now: half are split and half believe me. The rest of my friends believe her\u2014 again, I\u2019m not advocating for not believing women, just am saying that this specific girl is lying.\n\nWhat is my recourse here? Do I just move on with my life? And potentially lose friends/have a shit reputation? I\u2019m so upset and confused.",

      "text": "Coming from a victim of SA:\nWe dont go around telling everyone that we were just raped or almost raped. At least in my experience.\n\nHonestly I'd talk to her about it, though. Tell her what your intentions were and tell her that you're sorry you kissed her without asking. A lot of things can be fixed with communication.",

      "text": "Made an account just to post this. I hope you are still recieving info on your account.\n\nObligatory I am not a Lawyer, and this is not Legal Advice.\n\nGET A LAWYER ASAP!\n\nYou are being accused of a crime. A very serious crime.\n\nThis can get you kicked out of school. It can get you sent to prison.\n\nIf what you are saying is true, she has serious issues. DON'T CONTACT HER! For that matter, don't contact anyone involved in this incident until speaking with an attorney. Do not speak to the police or investigators from the school without an attorney.\n\nWrite down everything that happened as best as you remember it. Include dates, times, details etc. Make note of any other witnesses to said incident(s). Also, as much as possible, write down what exactly she is alleging happened, again, with as much detail as possible.\n\nMake sure you have preserved communications between you two, and any other relevent communications between yourself and anyone else regarding her.\n\nContact an attorney experienced in false sexual assault cases as soon as possible for the next steps on how to protect yourself. The information I told you to maintain may help them.\n\nIt seems you have yet to have a Title IX investigation opened against you, and she has yet to go to the police-- and she may not go either route. However, it is incredibly important to talk to a lawyer now, regardless. It will cost money, but it could cost you much more down the line in terms of money and/or freedom should she start an investigation, or press charges, and you are unprepared.\n\nI don't know your relationship with your parents or the adults in your family, but you should find one of them to talk to and help you navigate the process of procuring/paying for a lawyer and what not. They can help you manage that so you can stay focused on school. Tell them everything, even if your family has a complicated relationship with premarital sex/ dating and what not. The possible awkwardness is much better than the prospect of expulsion or jail.\n\nThis entire situation is unfortunate. I know you are concerned about your immediate reputation in your college circle, but the stakes are possibly much higher. Don't listen to the other poster telling you to talk to her.\n\nGet a lawyer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Changed allegating to alleging.",
