  "text": "Hey, everyone.\n\nJust a quick question about title. I have to provide an official transcript from Emory for a job, but noticed that some of my test credits were missing - specifically all of the AP ones. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be there in the first place (considering the AP credits are on my *unofficial* transcript), so I wanted to see if anyone else had the same issue\\*. Thanks for your help!\n\n\\*If it is just a me problem, does anyone know who to contact? I tried the transcript order number but that was just for tech issues.",
