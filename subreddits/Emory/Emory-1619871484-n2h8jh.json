  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm going to be a freshman this fall and am expecting to major in math and computer science (BS joint major). What is the workload like? Is it possible to combine it with a minor in humanities e.g. econ or a foreign language?\n\nIf you're currently majoring in the given field or are an alumni please pm me.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "At Emory you can only do a double major or a major and a minor unfortunately. If you\u2019re interested in humanities/ other topics combined with comp sci/ computation at all, I\u2019d recommend looking into the QSS major. There\u2019s also a Digital Humanities course being taught by Dr. Sinykin next semester in the English department which uses Python (for those without a coding background) to learn NLP and other data science techniques for the humanities.",

I've taken a look at the track and you would def be able to fit in a humanities minor, i've seen people in the program w that joint major + another stem minor so you should be fine but it would def be helpful if you had credits to skip the lower level classes",
