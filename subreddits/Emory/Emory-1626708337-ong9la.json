      "text": "hey! me n my roomates also contacted housing about triple info and here\u2019s what we got back:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we do not have a floor plan for triple rooms.  They are essentially extensions of the double floor plan. Furniture is also very movable if you and your roommates chose to do so. \nWe, unfortunately, do not have images on hand as there are very few triple rooms.\nYour room will have either three closets or two closets and a wardrobe (a closet that is not built in).\nIt will be three lofted beds.\u201d\n\ngathering from other info on the sub, expect the room to be slightly larger than other doubles and at the very least \u201cADA-approved\u201d (large enough for a wheelchair to move around)\n\nhope this helped!",
