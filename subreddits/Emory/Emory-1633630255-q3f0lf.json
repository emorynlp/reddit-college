      "text": "A vague date like \"early October\" means you shouldn't worry too much--it's just an idea of when you can expect the info by.  If you don't get any information by the last week of October, then I would email admissions and ask.  There are lots of things that can delay the release of info, and a late release doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong on your end.",
