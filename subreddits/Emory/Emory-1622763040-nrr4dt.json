  "text": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a junior and I\u2019m moving back to campus in the fall and I want to live off campus. My budget is under 1000 but I\u2019m willing to pay a bit over. I\u2019m having a hard time finding a roommate or apartments that do lease by the room. I don\u2019t personally like living alone (plus the rents are a lot higher for 1b/1b). I\u2019ve tried the Facebook group for Emory and GT Subleases but to no luck. Does anyone know where I could look for a female roommate or apartments that rent by the room? I plan on moving by the end of August (around 20th). Thanks!",
