      "text": "huh? This shouldn't be for us to determine. Emory gets good recruitment and has a strong alumni network/presence in those areas but prestige and rank should never be looked at as a golden ticket. What do YOU want from a school socially and academically other than to be propelled into.a well compensated career post grad? That cannot be the sole determinant of whether Emory is right for you.  There are higher and lower ranked and more and less prestigious places that can do that for high achieving and/or well connected students. What do YOU want to do while at university that maybe Emory could help you with? Do you want to do research in humanities or get intellectually involved with a field, other ECs/co-currics(maybe Emory could be good and the philosophy department offers fellowship opps or opps to engage with other students and faculty about the area outside of class. Maybe the Voluntary Core and programs through the Humanities Pathways thing may interest you)?\n\n Do you see college as mainly a 4 year social/party experience where the academics are just an unfortunate obstacle that you'll deal with and perform well in (maybe a less expensive place with a bigger party atmosphere would be better for you as you're just as likely to do well in a humanities are there than at Emory)? Do you want big sports and the social life elements that come along with it?\n\nWithout knowing stuff like this, your post basically boils down to \"Does Emory have enough prestige for my come up?\" which should be a yes if you do it right but there are plenty of schools that have that.",

              "text": "Okay so we're starting from the framework of elite schools being backup schools. Sounds like a problem from the get go.  And again, stop looking for any school to be your springboard. That was never really the case. When some Ivy/Ivy Plus(and it is only a hand full, not really even all of them.  I mean BYU outranks many T20-25s and a couple of Ivies as an IB feeder) schools are marketed as such a golden ticket to finance and consulting, no one wants to talk about the huge % of their student bodies shooting for that and how they throw apps at those companies and how generally well connected so many of those students are from the get go.  \n\nAnd no one also wants to talk about how competitive it is if you aren't among the connected.  A huge number of such students are placing into those areas from rigorous math, economics, or even engineering programs and the students and courses in those areas are tough.   Whether you get to whatever career destination is largely up to you, how you leverage your own connections, Emory's career services, and alumni network, and how you train(in class and via internships) and market yourself for the positions. Emory can easily facilitate all of this but do NOT view it as a \"spring board\".  That concept is vastly over-rated unless you took a lot of quantitative classes and built skills that are sought after but not so common now-a-days.  It isn't like at any of these places (sans good connections or nepotism which is quite common) that you could simply get a good GPA and be easily propelled into those areas from any old background.\n\nYour goal should be to develop.the profile of the more successful applicants and if you do that, and do all the necessary professional development stuff, you'd be fine.   Consulting placement is quite excellent at Emory (from BBA and beyond) and finance generally is solid (especially from.BBA but success is probably expanding to other areas too).",

Not even any other Ivies or Duke or whatever. However Emory should open up enough doors that you can be on the path to eventually working in VC. Emory is very strong in business especially in the south. Nobody can say if Emory is a good place for you without knowing your other options or anything about you but strictly from a career perspective it\u2019s an elite school that will not close any doors and the 100k in aid will just help.",
