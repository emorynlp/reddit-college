Once things kick up in some key classes, you may definitely find some new partners in crime.  But this ain't HS.  Feel no pressure to become superficially popular and befriended by everyone.",

The plan is highly dependent on courses not crossing over as well, but hopefully it pans out.\n\nSince I've been out of school for a while I know I have a lot of catching up to do. Can't let these freshmen with their AP courses beat me!\n\nAlso just gotta put it out there for anyone interested, QSS+Biology is such a good track for medical school. The major requisites are pretty much what you need as long as you take Biochem and Physiology as your upper-level Bio electives. The major requires Biology, Physics, and one semester of chem so obviously you just gotta continue chemistry and you'll be set. HAP and HSC courses should consist of Psyc/Soc as well.",

You'll end up finding that Emory's NBB major has a bigger research focus than that at most schools (as in, much of the core courses and electives will have a heavy methods/experimental focus versus say a neuroanatomy or cellular neuro and signaling pathways) focus and breaking into some neuro research can often benefit from some additional quantitative training (much of behavioral biology and neurophys research is VERY quantitative) So do some of the core courses (401, you read papers and some modules will lean very quantitative. NBB 301 is also fairly quantitative for half the course.).  \n\nPoint is that the NBB appears designed more around how one would do neuroscience research or grad. school versus just giving info. that may be prime folks to pursue med. school and specialties like neurology or neuroscience (It offers things for this group but the learning goals and curriculun design clearly target them less than one would think)\n\n  You never know. QTM was actually made to serve social sciences and humanities majors who are the bulk of the majors and new growth in the very fast growing major.  I'm sure they definitely came into Emory thinking \"if only I could never do any math or science again\".",
