      "text": "I am currently a freshman taking intro to CS. I came in with 0 experience and can attest that it is really hard. Even people with experience are struggling. But if it\u2019s something you really want to do, it\u2019ll be worth it. I think you just have to remember that in STEM it will be hard to reach your academic goals if you don\u2019t do what it takes to get there. This means spending an hour after every class practicing what was taught in the lesson or going to office hours 2-3 times a week. Cs anywhere is hard and if it was easy more people would do it. If you do decide to apply and get in, I would advise practicing Java basics and turtle graphics over the summer so you can have a smooth transition.",

              "text": "Okay, I'm just gonna have to tell you this.  You should NOT apply to a selective college or universities wanting to major in STEM if you are pre-emptively worried about your GPA this much (it indicates that you lack confidence or are insecure.  And there is only so much of that you can have to propel you to medical school or even through a STEM curriculum at a selective college or university).  You should only do this is you WANT to be challenged in different ways and on a more consistent basis than many significantly less selective universities or even your HS would.  Either that, or that you truly believe that better training (with short term pain of having to apply more effort and be independent in your learning) will benefit you in the long term.  Both are long term considerations, but going on sub-reddits thinking: \"Okay, which one of you schools is gonna ensure I have a strong GPA for med. school\" is short-sighted and highly problematic as some people may gas up a school for it allegedly having lenient grading only for you to find yourself at the bottom of many classes because they make even the average grade student jump very high for those softer curves they give.\n\nIf you are majoring in STEM, you don't just go to the \"elite\" publics and privates to just exist and hang out with other ambitious and bright people or because of some magical (it isn't magic, Most of these places earned it for a reason) prestige. You're supposed to go because they allegedly train better and prepare you for more realistic situations better than a place catering to much less well-prepped students, so just being at these schools comes with a cost beyond just the tuition and fees.  Even a lot of the elite universities that get clocked for extreme grade inflation have UNUSUALLY (places like Harvard have gateway STEM courses that mirror upper divisions or grad. classes at other elites) rigorous STEM courses in terms of the content and level of problem solving and thinking skills demanded.  In addition, usually grading in core/gateway STEM courses is not that lenient even at the most \"inflated\" schools.  You're just gonna have to do the work and be willing to put the effort in.  If you are, you'll likely succeed most of the time even if it isn't always an A/A-.\n\nThere are essentially no highly selective universities where any STEM major will make it super easy to maintain some GPA for whatever post-grad. oppurtunity so you need to stop fishing for that and stop asking this question over and over again in different selective schools' sub-reddit.  You're just gonna have to roll with the punches and if you don't end up with a super competitive GPA for medical school at the end of a CS degree, you cross that bridge when you get to it, and hopefully you've learned enough via classwork, EC opps, personal projects, research and/or internships to land a damned good job post-grad.  And likely med. school can remain on the table depending on how you use your time after college.  But seriously, stop asking this ridiculous question.  We don't know you, your work ethic, your level of preparation, and your ability to tolerate or deal with whatever level of academic challenge so don't know what GPA or whatever you can get.\n\nYour best bet is to assume that any STEM major or course worth doing is going to be very tough at times, especially at very selective colleges and universities.  You accept that, figure out how to study, and use whatever resources these extremely wealthy universities have to facilitate your success.  Do the damned best you can.",

I\u2019m not sure what the higher level CS classes are like but the intro is a huge time commitment. I would suggest that you take Chem + bio freshman fall and take intro to CS freshman spring. I would also suggest meeting with an academic advisor once you get in so they can help you plan out your classes.",

I\u2019m pretty sure if you search the subreddit, you\u2019ll find past posts asking this same question. It\u2019s a good program overall but you don\u2019t have much flexibility for course planning. Another downside is that for higher level classes, you can\u2019t really choose your professors and from what I have read/ heard, they don\u2019t seem very good.",
