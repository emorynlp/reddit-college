  "text": "Hi, this is the schedule I am interested in taking for the fall semester of my freshman year. Are there any classes in my schedule that are hard to get as a freshman? Also, are there BBA & Psychology double majors who are willing to talk or share some advice about this academic path?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iwjuogj6me71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=b94f0a5362b53e3aa5f5f1c9dcd15cf9df6a6389",

      "text": "I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re coming in with AP Stats credit since you\u2019re only taking the QTM 100 Lab?\n\nAnyways, if you\u2019re incredibly confident you\u2019ll get off to a great start in your first semester in college, go for it. It\u2019s a solid schedule and will set you up great for your interests in finance and psych. If I recall, I don\u2019t believe either of the psych classes are tough to get into as a freshman. The only one that might be tough is ACT 210 since a lot of ppl wait longer to start bschool classes. I had a bit of trouble getting in as a sophomore. Not to discourage you though, I had a few friends that took financial act as a fresh and it was great bc they applied to the bschool early.\n\nHave a good semester, and I think by the end you\u2019ll know if psych is a good fit. Take Kazama, don\u2019t take edwards if you can avoid him.",

      "text": "Double major (BBA & Psych) here. That is a pretty solid schedule. Definitely looks a little too tough given that you\u2019re taking Psych 110 (which is a more theory & science heavy class) and ACT 210. A lot of pre-BBA students wait to take accounting since it\u2019s a bit challenging if you have no prior Accounting experience and you will most likely be taking it with sophomores in the class. It\u2019s something to definitely keep in mind given the b school is graded on a curve. I would also recommend Kazama for psych 110, he was amazing but it requires good amount of time outside the class.\n\nIf you\u2019re using AP stats and only taking QTM Lab on Fridays, I would still recommend it but if you\u2019re planning on taking QTM, both psychs, and Accounting, and then also plan on getting involved in extracurricular and have a social life, I would recommend to tread carefully. \nDoing a double major in Psych and B school is not that hard given the fact that you already know coming in you wanna do them both. You can easily get through it in 4 years and you have a lot of time to finish the classes so don\u2019t try to overload yourself your first semester and burn out. Pace it, you will do just fine!",

I took a accounting course in high school so I think it wont be that much harder idk tho. Do you have Instagram, feel like it would be cool to know someone who also is doing bba psych :)",
