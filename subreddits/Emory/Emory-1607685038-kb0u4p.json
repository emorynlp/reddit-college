  "text": "I am happy to be accepted by both Emory and Oxford college. I have already read about some information on the official website, but I think that your suggestions would be more up-to-date. I have some questions that I hope you can advise me on.\n\n1. What is the commute time between the campuses? Is the advertised time of 30-45 mins true?\n2. How often do I need to commute if I am in Oxford college? I am considering to study economics as a major, and may consider taking biology as a minor.\n3. Are there some classes that only open in Oxford college? How rare are they?\n4. How different are the availability of different student organizations between the campuses? Are most organizations in Emory college?\n5. How close is the \"close knit\" community of Oxford college? Is there a major difference between the colleges? I am an international student, and I am really nervous about being in a new environment all alone.\n\nThanks for your advice, and Look forward to join you at Atlanta soon!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kb0u4p)",

      "text": "Hey! I went straight to Emory College and graduated class of 2019, but have friends who went through Oxford. So obviously you\u2019ll need to also hear from an Oxford student but my take is\n\n1. Yup, that\u2019s about accurate\n2. You almost never commute to Emory college unless it\u2019s for a club or some event. Most if not all Oxford students take all their courses on their campus which should offer all the same courses p much with just a couple exceptions. \n3. There\u2019s a good chance of that yeah. I can\u2019t comment on that tho bc I don\u2019t have any experience or info on it.\n4. Definitely way more options on the main campus. That\u2019s just the result of there also being that many more students at Emory college over those at Oxford.\n5. Oxford students tend to be pretty close to one another. The class size from Oxford tends to be smaller so you really get to know everyone. After two years, you\u2019ll graduate from oxford and go to main campus; when that happens, many Oxford kids lean on each other to help with the transition and stay very close.",

Ox certainly has enough for most students. I personally went to ECAS but my knowledge of and interaction with Ox students tells me that Oxford goes out of its way to get students in leadership positions via various orgs and opps during those early years (freshman and sophomore year).  It is one thing just have a bunch of stuff available vs. an institution actively allowing steering people towards things and developing talent and skills early on.  I would consider that.",

I would encourage at least showing up for the first GBM for as many clubs as you can, and only sticking with the handful that interest you. You might find an unexpected interest!",

                      "text": "They can show up to whatever initially but I don't think they should literally try to \"join\" every damned thing permanently and that is what  I see lots of first and 2nd years do treating clubs as if it is HS where you just slap stuff on the resume.  The goal should be to find a few for fun and aim to.try to develop something or have an impact in a few. It takes a lot of work and effort to seriously be involved in clubs. \n\nEither way I think both campuses have enough stuff to interest most students to the point where \"amount of clubs offered\" should not be a deciding factor. The campuses have two completely different styles of handling and developing undergrads which I think students should consider a bit more than stuff like that.     If they did lean Ox, they can always find additional clubs or interests  on main.  I think people still imagine Ox as \"small ECAS\" when it has sort of evolved into something quite different with one being very aggressive at truly developing younger students and the other being more hands off/sink or swim.",

      "text": "Commute time depends on traffic and time of day. All of the below assumes 70mph usually being maintained.\n\n* No traffic, sure 45-50 minutes. (Saturday and Sunday mornings are good examples)\n* Some traffic, but no real slowdowns, about 60 minutes.\n* Usual morning commute route with a minor slowdown about an hour and 15 minutes.\n* Usual morning commute route with a \"of course.... of friggen course\" slowdown, about an hour and 45 minutes.\n* Usual morning commute route with a \"why do i bother?\" series of accidents, about 2 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours.\n\nMost common for me is the hour and 15. This is if I leave between 6:30am-9am. Does not matter if I take i20 to Glenwood or i20 to i285 to hwy78 or some other route I have stashed for a rainy day.\n\nI have a firm belief that everything is \"about an hour and 15 minutes\" from Oxford. Marietta, Acworth, Athens, Macon, Downtown ATL, Roswell, Sandy Springs, all of it.\n\nSource: Been living in Oxford for many years while working for Emory.",

      "text": "I am a junior currently at the ATL campus but I went to Oxford for the previous two years, so I can't really speak for covid times.\n\n1. yes, the commute is right, it's about 45 minutes. It can feel like a long time because of traffic sometimes, but it can also feel short.  \n2. It really depends on how much you want to be in Atlanta. I did not go that often during my freshman year because I did not really know a lot of people and what to do on campus. I probably went to Atl around once every two weeks (before covid) during my sophomore year though because I became more comfortable and I started to dislike Oxford lmao.\n3. There probably is, but I am not really sure. I am guessing they're rare.\n4. There are definitely way more options at Emory, but I think both campuses have a good variety. IMO, Emory has too many clubs, but Oxford has a good selection of clubs that are still very different from each other. A lot of organizations have an Emory and Oxford club especially for huge clubs that have a lot of interest and sometimes, they do collaborations.\n5. I would say pretty close-knit. Because the campus is so small, you tend to get to know people easily and really well especially since you see people every day. I know the international community is really tight, so I wouldn't worry there so much. I have heard that Emory is a lot more \"cliquey\", but I don't know how true that is.",

      "text": "I attended Emory at the Atlanta campus all four years and my wife completed her first two years at the Oxford campus before coming to the Atlanta campus for her final 2 years.  \n\nThere is a shuttle that will take you to and from the oxford campus if need be, but which ever you decide, you classes will be at the local campus.  If you are moving from abroad, please plan to live on campus.  Everything will be within walking distance on campus.\n\nIn my opinion the Oxford is ideal for those people who like a slower pace and a smaller community.  The basic classes are fairly similar for first and second year students between campuses.  The Atlanta campus has a lot more going on.  More social clubs, a better night life, access to the city and interacting with other colleges in Atlanta.  There will probably be a larger Asian community at the Atlanta campus, if that is important to you.  Also the Atlanta campus has all of the graduate programs, so the student body is larger and the diversity is as well.\n\nIf this is your first time away from home, it may feel safer at Oxford.  If you are a free spirit and can adapt easily, you may prefer the Atlanta campus.  Neither school is quite as overwhelming at large state schools.  Class sizes will be modest and the campus is not all that large.",

Like with many things, it is what you make of it.\n\nI drove to Atlanta 3 separate times during the semester. 1st time to explore little five points, 2nd time to explore main campus and meet some club officers, and 3rd time to go to the high museum. The drive was reasonable tbh, but I enjoy driving so take that with a grain of salt- it was around a 45 min drive each time I went. You don't really need to go at all, it was just on my bucket list.\n\nGranted, there's not too much to do in the Oxford/Covington area.",
