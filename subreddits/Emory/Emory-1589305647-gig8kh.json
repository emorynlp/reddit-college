  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I\u2019m pretty good at League of Legends (I hover between D2/D1 for anyone that plays). I played for my high school team, and it was pretty fun, so I wanted to play at uni too. Does anyone know if we have a League of Legends team and if it\u2019s active?",

There is a smash ultimate team (locals), League of Legends (collegiate level), and Hearthstone (collegiate level). I think we had StarCraft II at one point, but there are too few players at Emory for a team. See them at the student fair!",

It was great.",
