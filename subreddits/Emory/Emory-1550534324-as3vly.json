  "text": "Anyone who was around/affected by the chalking a few years ago, cane we discuss how you interpreted the messages when it happened and what kind of reaction you had? I'm a first year now and most people I've talked about it with weren't there, but most of the people I've talked to in real life are of the opinion that the 'over the top' reaction to the 'chalking' was completely ridiculous.  I'm trying to figure out if media blew it out of proportion/ what actually happened. And was it as big a deal as everyone made it out to be? ",

      "text": "I remember seeing it around campus that day and thinking it was in poor taste, but I personally wrote it off as a drunk prank not worth much extra thought versus a legitimate political statement. It turned into one of those situations where maybe 20 people on either side of the argument got very angry and that somehow warranted a media storm labeling all 6000+ students as \"snowflakes\" fighting a battle of free speech. It was pretty embarrassing to listen to my (southern conservative) family mock the university for a while over it. I was a senior so in my mind it blew over quickly, but that may have just been because I left. I'm actually kind of surprised that it even still gets brought up.",

      "text": "There were some actual protests (small).  However, it seemed as if it ended up being used as more of a political tool and opportunity for some right wing/conservative Emory students to go on Fox or CNN and lament about how \"freedom of speech\" is being crushed on college campuses and how right wing voices are being silenced.  I think the decision for those few students to go to the national media simply made it bigger than what it was though.  It simply contributed to a \"snowflake\" narrative that was being pushed a lot back then so was an easy target to highlight.  Overall, Emory is actually decent on the \"free speech on college campuses\" issue and in fact revised some of its policies to be better on it as a result of the incident as well as the Sudexho protests (and banners) that took place in 2012 or so I think.  Again, I just think the political atmosphere at that moment in time was ripe for the amplification of this particular incident in the media.  Oddly enough, Emory wasn't hurt by it. People calling some of the protesting students \"snowflakes\" did not stop it from collecting money from the higher volume of applications it received the following cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, some may have complained about either side, but I personally think it was interesting to see Emory politically active or visible on a decent scale in any context as it is known for a sort of apathy (unlike some of its peer institutions, it isn't like Emory gets alt right activists or the Klan to come disrupt and nor does it really have the issue of having confederate memorials and named buildings to protest, though Dooley is slightly questionable, but that has essentially been reimagined to represent something politically neutral.  I mean, Emory has an unusual amount of buildings named after URMs instead).  Such political fervor, even on seemingly \"petty\" issues is so common at Emory's peer institutions that it was almost  refreshing to see that even Emory students could escape their daily grind to do something else (though I honestly feel that in this particular case, the students who went to the media were disingenuous and pretty much looking for attention).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

          "text": "I consider my political stance mostly neutral with slight leaning towards the right, so take my words with a grain of salt. But I do want to point out that the reason for some conservative students to turn to the media was not because of the protest itself, but the fact that the president of Emory, James Wagner, sent out an email to all students following the protest stating that the school sympathized with the students who were feeling distressed and was working on tracking down the offender. While I have nothing against the protesting students, that last part was deeply concerning to a lot of people like myself because I agree with you on that Emory is actually decent on the topic of free speech but an official school statement like that only served to alienate those on the conservative side and made them feel like their voice was being silenced. Again I agree that it was completely blown out of scale but I did think James Wagner could have handled it more properly. ",

              "text": "I guess I just don't really care.  They could have still not chosen to go to NATIONAL media.  I think they took that step because they wanted the attention.  And today, many organizations have cropped up for the sole purpose of galvanizing conservative students to go after professors who have a perceived liberal bias in their classrooms.  Any attempt to get attention in order to say: \"Look, save us from our pre-dominantly liberal environment in the university\" is unsurprising to me.  James Wagner was an equal opportunity screw up late in his tenure.  The man compared Emory's department and budget cuts to the 3/5 compromise in front of a large audience of people and got censured by certain organizations for both the departmental cuts and that comparison.  Interestingly enough, that only made it to print media that was mostly run and read by other academics.  I don't remember fellow liberals/politically centrist folks going on Fox or CNN to expose everything about the problematic half of his tenure which was likely more important than anything he was doing to save his ass from the fall-out of the chalk incident.  He actually did or presided over enough negative press and decisions in the last portion of his tenure to damage Emory's application volume substantially.  That is pretty hard to do to any high ranked school. \n\nEither way, I am down for both the serious and potentially petty political activity that may take place at Emory as long as it doesn't involve violence.  Emory at times, could be one-dimensional and boring due to a comparative lack of political demonstrations.  I always think: \"let'm have it, as long as it doesn't get anyone hurt or completely shut down the campus\".  Don't really care which side of the political spectrum one is on.  At one point in time, pro-Israel student groups would have tense standoffs with pro-Palestine groups at Emory.  It was just \"more interesting\" at some points in time.  Kind of sad that this incident was over chalk, but I'll take it and more petty occurs at peer institutions. Emory, for example, hasn't had constant \"Halloween costume controversies\" blow up in the national media to my knowledge.  ",

He encouraged attendees to chalk and of course, they trolled or put their opinions everywhere. \n\n3a. This includes chalking phrases like \"build a wall\" specifically on the walls and stairs leading up to Centro Latino (then on the second floor of the DUC). I have been told that targeted language was also used in the area of the Black Student Union but can't confirm. \n\nResult:\n\n1. People chalked in response, turning pro-Trump/etc phrases more \"positive.\"\n\n2. People protested the fact that Emory did nothing about the fact that people had put what seemed to many people, particularly people of color and immigrants, hateful speech all over.\n\n3. When people chalked in response, Emory began reminding people that they were only allowed to chalk on horizontal surfaces. Also, it seemed that the pro-Trump stuff only really got removed by the rain. Afterwards, Emory was quick to spray away/remove counter-chalking. \n\nAdditionally, people painted protesters as overreacting because they treated this as a singular incident, rather than a very visible incident in a string of other incidents.

      "text": "To further clarify, students protesting the chalking also did so to protest the university\u2019s response to it. Chalking is allowed on any flat surfaces at Emory with our prior approval (in comparison with paper flyers which must be approved by residence life and housing before being posted in residence halls). This instance needs to be understood in context with an event a month or so prior where maintenance staff washed away a Black Lives Matter chalking on a flat surface despite the university policy being to leave messages up until they were naturally erased by rain. In contrast, these chalkings were done on a vertical surface and were not washed away by maintenance, leading students to demand equitable action from university administration. While these seem like small nit-picky things, they reflected a campus culture that rejected black activism but upheld conservative ideology that was and continues to be embraced by white supremacist groups.

Either way, keep in mind that these elite schools are big marketing machines.  They don't like \"speech\" that might tarnish their brand or affect the opinions of prospective students (notice how hard many elites go to suppress data regarding sexual assault or cover up other aspects of student behavior that could potentially tarnish the image.  However, some schools that are Harvard, Princeton, and Yale level have had more petty and serious instances that make national media, but of course their brands are impervious to negative attention at this point).

Regardless of \"maturity\" levels and whether a reaction is worthwhile,this has been the case forever Even Vietnam protesters on college campuses were depicted as \"snowflakes\" in a sense.

Yet, sometimes we make it too easy for them. Perhaps it is a catch 22. On one hand we have hypersensitivity, and on the other we have apathy.  However, I do think the bottom line when it comes to this specific situation is the same. We had the ability to sidewalk chalk freely, and now we don't because it got abused. Emory made the executive decision to ban chalking to avoid further upheaval because the student body collectively doesn't possess enough grace under pressure to handle these emotionally charged situations.",
