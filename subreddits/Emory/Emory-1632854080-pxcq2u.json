  "text": "Curious to hear from students and grads, what do you guys think are the hardest and easiest majors? What\u2019s the difficulty/workload that you or peers experienced? What was your gpa? It\u2019s well known at any school that STEM is going to be a harder than majors in the arts. Was wondering if there was anything that stands out at Emory. Also I know classes in the bschool are curved so there\u2019s some artificial difficulty that comes with that.",

      "text": "Do you just mean in terms of grading? If so, Emory mirrors every other school.  Outside of STEM lower enrollment majors (minus maybe sociology which has solid enrollment) are gonna have easier grading.  Keeping the enrollment they have or growing it is key to their survival/funding and the easiest way to do that is to meet the perception and expectations of students and grade easily or water down key courses. Overly lenient grading and Gen. Ed requirements are pretty much life support for some departments.",

      "text": "I know you mean generally easier. However, I will say if you are looking into something you actually enjoy that in and of itself will make the major easier. I started off in one major where the material wasn't terrible but the classes were hard because I hated the content and had next to no motivation. Switched to one that was generally on the same level but I actually enjoyed and it made a world of difference.",

      "text": "The philosophy major has the least required hours I think (like 9 courses?). \n\nIMO the CS major is very difficult. By contrast, the BS in CS is 18 courses. There\u2019s not much wiggle room in terms of classes like there is in a natural science, and there\u2019s an expectation for you to learn a lot of stuff outside of classes. \n\nAnd idk about the more advanced math courses, but a lot of the intro math courses are taught entirely by recent grad students and TA\u2019s, which is rough. \n\nIn conclusion: STEM courses that Emory doesn\u2019t specialize in are hard to get through.",

          "text": "The issue with core/required gateway math courses being taught by grad. students is almost universal at privates (even top ones) so that isn't an issue of CS and math being an Emory specialty (CS is really only a \"specialty\" of a few select privates and is mostly a big thing at higher tier publics and math teaching at most places just ain't great but publics ARE more likely to just have a giant section size with a solid tenure or lecture track professor whereas at privates, they want those folks teaching electives and intermediate cores when possible so let grad. students fullfill TA requirements with the lowest division courses).\n\nAnd I think the natural science you refer to is maybe biology.  Emory generally seems rougher in things like neuroscience because it is one of the few schools that has a core for the major (like 4 courses where the mean/median grade will be no higher than B, and will even be B- in maybe 3/4 of the classes) and then there is chemistry (a natural/physical science I guess) which is redesigned to be more flexible and allow more elective exploration, but then there are 5-6 classes (depending on how you leverage AP/IB if you have it) everyone has to take (and you only get limited access to electives before completing all of them or else you have to sort of fight the dept. chair or DUS) that have VERY stringent grading where they openly target a B- average which apparently has gone out of style at most of Emory's private peers including the nearest ranked ones.   People complain about Berkeley and Georgia Tech grading in certain STEM fields, but Emory still sort of mirrors those patterns in many areas.  The only reason why Emory may have higher grades overall is because there is a much more significant social science, business, and humanities contingent, and no engineering school because STEM seems to stick to relatively traditional grading even in courses where the content and assessments (p-sets, projects, exams, whatever) may be pitched at a higher level than average even for an elite tier school.\n\nSo  I guess this difficulty thing is relative.  I think lack of flexibility in foundation coupled with stringent grading can contribute, but I also like to see if I can figure out how the requirements, content, and assessments for a department compare to at least near peers of Emory and what is interesting is that even some of the \"easier\" and more flexible majors seem more inflexible than many of them and then there are departments like psychology and political science that catch a lot of people off-guard in terms of how many foundation and elective courses actually demand a lot of effort at least versus what they anticipated for those divisions.\n\nMany seem to find them rougher than expected at Emory whereas they'll find those majors and associated courses living up to the stereotypes of being consistently predictable and easy elsewhere. My guess is that this is because things like psychology are much more science and clinically focused at Emory so methods/experimental design become a bigger thing earlier in the curriculum than just memorizing theories like lots of peers and less selective schools.  Political science (which gave birth to QTM) was always more methods and research oriented at the UG level than programs at peers (including some of the more \"aspirational\" super elite peers.  The goal of polsci has always been more to prep people for grad. school than to assume that students were just pre-laws passing through who needed super high GPAs, but it doesn't seem to have hurt because Emory has excellent law school placement even among those with imperfect GPAs) and also always offered more quantitative electives (and with the advent of QTM, this is more so the case).\n\nMeanwhile depts like physics, math, and econ. are as average as you can get for a top tier school (pretty much in line with near peers.  Nothing special. Can't compare too well to super elite tier schools for those areas).  Things like biology are probably harder than some near peers due to how many electives and stuff are now heavily focused on primary literature, and critical thinking vs. memorization, but because of the column requirements and elective requirements, if you just wanna get through a bio major by memorization, you could theoretically dodge the more serious courses that require more thinking, but methinks they are making that much harder.\n\nSeems they are going through and revamping a lot of the classes that were holding out and changing the pedagogy, assessments, instructors, or adding discussion sections to demand higher ordered thinking.  But generally, anywhere that takes life sciences education seriously is going in this direction so Emory isn't but so special here.  Only difference may be that there are still more \"traditional\" graders among biology professors at Emory, but at least there are no clear departmental norms anymore (like you'll rarely read on syllabi in bio that: \"The department targets a B- average\" like in chem courses) so even those \"harder\" elective courses and column requirements may have a lot of grace with grading.",

                  "text": "That's pretty common in STEM (if the program is at least half-way decent at least and has strong students that professors believe in).  I would argue it's less common in biology where they do try to make it more straight forward, but chemistry, physics, and I guess CS according to you (and I believe you) tend to assess more on general problem solving skills and even creative problem solving so will often ask you to derive something or be able to make very educated guesses/leaps of faith on exams or problem sets, so yeah they make you stretch.  But that means that those departments are likely doing what they are supposed to do and it mirrors the demands of the best programs.  I know it is frustrating right now, but you may appreciate it later.  They just want students to be more than sort of like robots/obedient types and be able to sort of adapt and deal with unexpected complexity they weren't explicitly prepped for on the spot and sort of develop an independence.  I went through it as a chem. major and in the more loosely structured biology classes and sometimes it was frustrating, but trust me it pays off and you may thank your professors later.  They do it for a reason and you can do it despite it being different from HS or even your expectations.  You can do it!  It just means the professors actually believe in your capability to push you like that and I know y'all are smart so I damned sure believe in y'all.",
