I\u2019m not currently a student at Emory (rising junior in hs), but Emory is one of my dream schools and I\u2019m trying to get an unbiased, real view of being an Emory student. \n\nPlease, tell me what you love and hate about \n- housing\n- campus culture / housing\n- academics\n- and everything else you can think of!\n\nThank you! I\u2019m exciting to be applying soon!!",

No D1 football or basketball team basically\n\n2) Need more food options at Cox",

(Some people would say this is the case everywhere but I transferred to emory from a T20 and it\u2019s definitely not)\n2. Students are committed to social justice and community service/they are amazing to learn from/engage in dialogue with\n3. Honestly shuttles CAN be annoying but also lots of universities don\u2019t have shuttles and it\u2019s nice AF to be like \u201chmm I don\u2019t want to walk across campus right now\u201d and wait 5 mins and take the loop\n4. Kroger/publix/groceries are v close and they have (more annoying) shuttles to them for 1st years and people without cars",

If you are, you'll be in great company and have a great network of people!  If not, some say it's a bit off-putting to be with so many pre-professional students.\n\nI've loved my time at Emory so far! Best of luck :)",
