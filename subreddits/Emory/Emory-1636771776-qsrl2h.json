  "text": "Hey I'm a Freshman finance+qss major but I want to learn some programming too and take a few CS classes. However, I have no prior experience and I've heard that CS 170 is brutal for those with no prior experience. I'm considering taking CS 170 P/F next semester. My goal is to break into Investment banking/consulting and then get an MBA. Would taking this pass/fail class negatively affect my chances during recruiting or MBA admissions. What are your thoughts on Pass/fail classes?",

      "text": "MBA admissions are not particularly GPA driven and are more experience driven than anything, so I wouldn't worry about that.  Just keep something solid within the context of your major/concentration. And no one is gonna frown on you pass/failing a course outside of your major that not but so many other recruits would take.  However, you should think about yourself and whether or not P/F will be a fail safe or just another excuse to blow off the course to the point where you get a \"passing\" grade but aren't particularly competent (assuming that is the goal)  Maybe really only do this if you have a schedule that would result in you getting something in the C range (or maybe B- or lower) because no one will punish you for that B/B+ in a gatekeeper STEM outside of your major especially if you can demonstrate what you learned.\n\nMy guess is that if you are truly committed to the QSS part, while 170 is challenging, you should be able to do fine if it is graded (I think QTM has plenty of \"brutal\" core classes as well as electives that seem pretty committed to holding students accountable for concepts and content in the core courses which cover challenging content and cases. If you feel you are strong enough to learn and do well in those, you can probably do 170).  Like are you taking any intellectually challenging or workload heavy courses right now, and are you doing well in these courses? If you are, you may push yourself to learn more and score better in CS as long as the rest of your schedule isn't burdensome/overly strenuous.\n\nAnd honestly, if it is, maybe kick the CS 170 can down the road for when you can accommodate it and put enough effort in for a solid performance or at least be able to really commit to learning the material.  You shouldn't go in with the assumption that you'll be beaten because you are a \"new comer\" (again, is that how you are gonna approach some of the more intense QTM cores? You'll be new to that too).  You don't have to rush it as you'll likely be getting a decent amount of programming (especially in python if you choose certain electives) experience through the QTM major.  Don't feel like you'll be impressing a recruiter because you slap a graded or P/F CS 170 on your transcript.  Your transcript in terms of QTM and experience should be more than sufficient to signal you have at least some skills in programming and computational thinking.",
