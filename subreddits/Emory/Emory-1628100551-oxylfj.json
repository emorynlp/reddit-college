  "text": "I hate asking but I wouldn\u2019t if it wasn\u2019t an emergency/necessary. But is there anyone willing to buy a parking pass for me? I\u2019m an incoming freshman from Texas and I\u2019ve tried making many request to parking about it and they have all been denied. (Which I didn\u2019t think would happen because the reason for taking my car is pretty urgent/reasonable) \n\nMy number is 832-297-3309, please feel free to contact me",

If your reason for having a car on campus is in any way related to accessibility issues, you'll want to contact the [Department of Accessibility Services](https://accessibility.emory.edu/) asap. They wield a tremendous amount of power and will accommodate any accessibility related needs you might have. Best of luck",
