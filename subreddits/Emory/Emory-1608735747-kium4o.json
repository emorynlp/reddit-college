I think it\u2019s useful for getting regular stuff.\n\nI think Alabama is in a pretty good location. Haven\u2019t heard much else about it. It\u2019s probably a regular residence hall.",

I stand by the water filter comment b/c none of first floor trusts the stuff from the fountain lol. Other than that, ig some of the downsides are that you\u2019re super close to the hospital (helicopters) and bell tower (which rings every 15 mins).",
