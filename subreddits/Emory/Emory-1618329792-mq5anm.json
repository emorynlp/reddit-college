      "text": ">  I live in Georgia, and while Mercer is a good option\n\nIf you live in Georgia, Mercer is a great option. Staying in Georgia allows you to keep building connections, which is great for establishing roots for Georgia medical schools like MCG. You can even think about their Special Consideration Program for medical school. However, if you don't have $$ then University of Florida might be cheaper than Mercer even as an out-of-state student (I don't know).\n\n> I feel like overall Emory would be a better option for me. \n\nYou don't know what school would be better for you as you have not attended any college. Don't write off the schools you got accepted to, you may end up liking it there and forget about transferring. The grass is always greener. For all we know, the correct choice might be for you to save your money and perform well in community college first rather than diving into a 4-year with all these relatively bigger fish, all trying to be doctors.\n\n> Could anyone give me advice on what I need to do to be accepted as a transfer?\n\nAside from getting straight As or A-s in your courses and doing well there, you probably would have to provide a compelling reason why an institution like Mercer isn't enough for you. It probably won't be fit, location, or anything like that. They both have Atlanta campuses as well so it's not that different in terms of environment, but the Macon campus might be.\n\n> I know roughly 20-25% get in. \n\nIt's actually 32.6% now last Fall 2020.\n\n> I want to be a bio major and a pre-med.\n\nCool, but I would suggest picking another major if your only reason for being a biology major is to get into medical school. You'll need more than that to do well without losing motivation.\n\nSource: I'm a transfer.",

          "text": "Thank you for the in depth response :) \nYou are right, I guess I can\u2019t just assume Emory is better for me. It\u2019s just that in my decisions between UF and Mercer, a lot of the people giving me advice that are in favor of UF talk about where it\u2019s prestige and recognition will get you. I figured with Emory being in Georgia and being a medical focused school that\u2019s more prestigious than Mercer that it\u2019d be a direct upgrade. But I guess there could be other issues about Emory that I don\u2019t know about.\nI will add that price wise, Mercer is $20K cheaper than UF, and the website said that Emory doesn\u2019t give merit to transfers. Merit being the only one I\u2019d probably qualify for in normal circumstances. So Emory would wind up being more expensive than UF by almost 40K and more expensive than Mercer by almost 60k. My dad did tell me we could afford UF without financial aid,, but probably not Duke which is a little more expensive than Emory. So money wise I guess Emory isn\u2019t the best option at all",

              "text": "No problem. It looks like you have a good and open-minded relationship with your parents (or at least your dad). Talk with him more, does he want you to remain close in Georgia? Do you want to explore another state and see what's out there? Which opportunities do you think these schools offer you best, STEM-related or not?\n\nWhat you do at your undergrad institution and how well you do it matters more than where you do it. Don't worry too much about prestige in undergrad if your goal is medical school. Plenty of people get into top medical schools coming from state schools, it will never be a death sentence for you. If you end up not going to medical school and end up just doing biology, getting into a good PhD program is focused more on your research more than your university's name.\n\nIt's the blind leading the blind when it comes to HS seniors selecting schools. Why do they get attached to these schools that don't even give their applications a second thought? Very few people attend more than one or two institutions. It's kind of interesting how much stock they place into prestige based on what others tell them. It's a facade and it's better for you to understand that now.\n\nDo well wherever you go. This will open more doors for you in the future. Save money now because medical school will rip open your wallet more than you think and having less undergrad debt will make your life easier.",

Although I guess I\u2019m not sure how much there is to explore at Mercer compared to Florida so I\u2019ll have to figure that out, as well as the research opportunities.\n\nI also know my dad wants me to pay for my medical school on my own :P so I guess that\u2019s another reason Emory won\u2019t be the best cause I\u2019d probably have to pay some undergrad out my pocket too if my parents can\u2019t afford all of it. \n\nI\u2019m glad I found such a helpful individual so soon :) thank you for all your time and advice.",

You can choose your friends, but your family will always be there to support you (hopefully). I'm not saying be bound to your families, but they raised you and if you can see yourself being more comfortable being near them (or loving them farther away), that's your choice. It looks like your mom will be hella happier with Mercer.\n\nI'd stick around and wait to see what others will say. I'm only one person and my experiences are limited. I will add that I was in the Army for four years before transferring to Emory. That added a lot more perspective to my life as far as what I want to do, and now I'm able to afford Emory because I'm considered in independent student and I use the GI Bill.\n\nThere's more ways to skin the college cat other than the traditional option. As long as we all end up being better for it, never consider your own experiences inferior to others just because they attended X school and you didn't. However, I do look forward to you submitting your transfer application if you still decide to do so after a year or so.",
