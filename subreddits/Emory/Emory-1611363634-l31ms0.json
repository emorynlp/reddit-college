  "text": "Was the dean\u2019s list for last semester announced? \n\nAlso, I took a language class last semester but wasn\u2019t able to get into the next level this semester. Will I still be able to take the second course next year or do I have to take the language classes in two consecutive semesters of the same school year?",

      "text": "For the language class you can just take the second course next year. When they say consecutive they mean in the same language or else people would take Korean 101 and Spanish 101 or some easy combination to fulfill the requirement. I am taking Chinese 203 this semester but I took 103 last year first semester and they said it is totally ok so no worries.",
