  "title:": "What\u2019s the social life and school culture at Oxford?",
  "text": "I\u2019m trying to figure out if I would do better a small liberal arts school like Oxford or at a larger state school. I\u2019m really introverted and it\u2019s somewhat difficult for me to open up and make friends. I\u2019m not socially awkward but it just takes some time and I\u2019m not very outgoing. It seems like my class at Oxford would be around 300-400 students. This seems super small so I feel like It could possibly be easier to bond and make friends. However, it could also be harder to find a friend group since there\u2019s a limited number of people I could be friends with. At my state school I\u2019m worried that with the large environment it might be harder to make friends and I could more easily shut myself off. I would have to actively put myself out there, rush, join student orgs, etc. to make friends which is more difficult for me. On the other side, I would already know a few people from my high school but I really want to branch out and make new friends. \n\nI\u2019m also not sure if I\u2019m into partying or not. I was never into drinking or partying in high school but that could have been because I was so focused on getting into a good college. At my state school there would be a ton of partying going on. I know there\u2019s some people who wouldn\u2019t party but it\u2019s overall a large part of student life. I\u2019m not opposed to it but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my thing or not. I might be wrong, but I think Emory/oxford has a much smaller party scene and people are a lot more invested in school and dedicated to working. There\u2019s still some partying but on a much smaller scale and of less importance. I\u2019m also really burnt out from high school. It\u2019s somewhat appealing to go to an easier state school where I could just chill out for the next four years. It would be a lot less intense and I could probably get by with a moderate amount of effort. Overall, I feel like Emory fits my high school personality more. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s who I want to be. I\u2019ve given so much of myself to school over the past 4 years. I like school and I enjoy learning but I don\u2019t think I had an especially fun high school experience and I don\u2019t want to fall into another 4 years of constant studying because there wasn\u2019t a lot of balance. However, I also don\u2019t know if I would fit at a large public school. Any advice would be appreciated :)",

      "text": "I graduated from Oxford years ago, but I don't think the environment and/or culture has changed much, and I can at least provide one perspective.\n\nOxford for me, and for almost everyone I know, was a friendship incubator.  I chose Oxford because of the small campus, the smaller classes, and the excellent education that I would get from Emory as a whole and I got all of those things. But I also got an AMAZING social experience at Oxford.  \n\n300-400 people per class means that you will know almost everyone on-campus by the time you leave. You certainly won't be friends with everyone, but you'll know them, and it is (or was) a very easy place to make friends. I'm an introverted person who hasn't kept in touch with a single person from my high school but I have a huge group of friends from Oxford that I still talk to weekly, if not daily, and I graduated from Emory 10 years ago.\n\nThe campus is part of what makes it easy to find friends.  You're away from the distractions of Atlanta and so you've got classes (rigorous, not easy, but we all survived), you've got events happening on campus, and you've got each other. There weren't giant block parties with 1000s of people like you might see at UGA, no bar scene, no SEC sports culture, but there were definitely parties, plenty of drinking, whatever you wanted to get into, really. Occasionally, there would be house parties in Atlanta that we would pile into cars and drive to. It was a blast. Oxford and Emory were a good example of work hard, play hard. *Lots* of studying during the week, great classes, excellent professors, and then everyone let off steam on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nMaybe some current students can chime in with their more recent experiences though.",

              "text": "The rigor won't hold you back; you want rigorous courses. It sounds like you've been a very diligent student in high school, so depending on what you study, Oxford might not be much of a struggle.  My high school was a joke; I did not have to work hard to do very well, and I struggled early in my first semester to adjust to the workload at Oxford. But I did adjust and ended up doing just fine in pre-med classes.  Wherever you end up choosing to go, take advantage of the resources available.  Every university is going to offer study sessions, tutors, TAs, pre-professional advising and student groups, etc. at no additional expense and they can all help make the difference in making you a super competitive applicant for med school or grad school.",

      "text": "I agree with everyone\u2019s comments but just be a bit careful, especially if you\u2019re going into Oxford STEM. Oxford academics are extremely rigorous and you will absolutely find friends to help you through it, but if you feel burnt out and need rest it may be wise to take a gap year or so, as going into Oxford burnt out may not be the best thing to do. The math, biology, and computer science departments are notoriously hard if that\u2019s your thing. In terms of research opportunities, leadership positions, and recommendation letters for medical school it should be much better than a large state public school like Berkeley, UT\u2019s..etc.",

      "text": "I\u2019m pretty much in the exact same position as you in comparing UT and Oxford. What made me choose Oxford over UT besides cost was that I wanted a change. So many people that I have known since middle school are all going to UT and I want a chance to be in a completely new environment with people I have never met before. I felt that staying in Texas would keep me within driving distance from home and most of the other people I have known over the past few years. Personally, I view college as a fresh start and a chance to learn and adapt from new challenges and I felt that Oxford would provide the best opportunity over UT. From research and asking around, it seems like Oxford has their fair share of parties and that UT Austin has their struggles with work/life balance. These things are problems for most college aged students it seems so every university is going to have their caveats somewhere. Either option is what you make of it and with effort I don\u2019t think you will be trapped in excessive studying at Oxford or just be drowned out at a large school like UT.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of that applies to you and cost is definitely important, but I just wanted to share my thoughts since I was (and still kinda am) making a similar decision. Ultimately, I found it\u2019s hard for others to give advice since very few people have experienced actually attending both schools undergraduate programs. Others can mostly give you their guidance or opinions from their friends at other schools, but it\u2019s pretty much just a tough choice you have to make. Good luck with whatever you decide though!\n\nPS: Considering that Fenves just left UT for Emory might be a sign for something ;).",

      "text": "hey! i'm a second year at oxford right now. i'm also pretty introverted and can kinda suck at making new friends (i had the same friend group for most of my life so i never really branched out). i was really worried about making friends at oxford but i found myself with close friends within the first week! i'd say just dont worry too much about making friends like i did, because it will just happen. with your orientation group (your PAL group) and any clubs you may join, i say oxford does a really great job at creating environments to become friends in. i've made lifetime friends for sure. \n\nas for partying, i'm pretty sure emory has a decently large party scene but oxford less so. not because we dont like to lol, but because we have to take the shuttle to the atlanta campus to go to any decent parties since the only type of party to have at oxford would be a dorm party. so you definitely do not have to worry about party life at oxford being intrusive. i'm also not a huge fan of going out and i really only go out a couple times a year, so i'd say in that regards oxford is perfect for people who like going out occasionally but it isn't their main concern.\n\ndo be aware that oxford has some pretty challenging classes though. i'm a linguistics and english major so i cant speak to any science/math/psych/etc classes but i know from my friends and just things i've heard that the classes are challenging for them. if you want to take things slower than you have been in high school, know that you should be mostly fine freshmen year but once you hit sophomore year things will really pick up the pace.\n\nif you have any questions feel free to shoot me a pm!",
