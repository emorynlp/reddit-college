  "text": "The person one room over from me seemingly decided to start *learning* piano/keyboard towards the beginning of the semester. It is pretty loud, and sometimes occurs after quiet hours. I when I say learning, I mean from scratch, so it\u2019s not particularly enjoyable even in the best of circumstances. I don\u2019t have any established communication with him, so I\u2019m worried I would come across as a little rude mentioning it directly with him. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a keyboard and I don\u2019t get why he wouldn\u2019t just put in headphones off the bat if that was an option. What is the most respectful but effective way to handle this situation?",
