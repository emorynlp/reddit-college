                  "text": "I wonder how well these strategies work for more problem solving oriented courses where the teacher doesn't demand that students memorize but so much content but instead curate a smaller bank of content for students to know/memorize and then assess in a way that requires students to graduate to an ability to really apply or adapt it to new scenarios in order to hit the upper grade ranges (B+ or higher)\n\nSounds like some of it is useful for sure, but it sounds like advice that is especially helpful for courses that are ultra content heavy and maybe only give assessments that mainly test say level 1 and 2 items on the little Bloom's taxonomy pyramid where some obscure facts/details are sometimes tested.  I mean, like how did Kazama test and were those strategies pretty much effective for the caliber of tests he gave?  Don't get me wrong, due to different incentives, students are probably going to mostly take instructors that give level 1/2 tests unless they are in certain majors and even then only a few may exceed that.  So I can see it being beneficial for a majority of the courses many students choose to take.  I just wonder how well it works for more practice oriented courses, especially those where the instructor gives \"curveball\" problems.",

                          "text": "That is very interesting.  Sounds likes he incorporates some type of student appeasement into his assessment strategies which is okay sometimes. That clearly has limitations though.  If all professors had to stick primarily with what students today like or feel less annoyed with, they would all stray from evidence based teaching strategies (as they often do in order to avoid initial penalties in their teaching evaluations) as well as just water their course down (as they often do..again, to save teaching evals). \n\n Generally, due to awful incentive structures placed on students by 3rd parties usually, we like any class or course structure that doesn't seem to threaten grades or the ease with which we can earn them (which doesn't really have to have anything to do with learning. You can just give folks some simple tasks/assessments that don't promote long term retention and most of a well selected class will get an A or B with no curve required).  With that said, I hear that Kazama is apparently somewhat rigorous for an intro. social sciences class which isn't that common anymore. \n\nOf course I doubt he is an Edwards (I have no idea if Kazama uses higher level items or items based on research studies and predictions or not) but an Edwards like professor in the social sciences with today's academic norms(pretty much everywhere) is sort of a relic for better or worse.  Students also tend not to like cold calling (Edwards and a few top tier STEM professors do this) and call it \"putting us on the spot\" because it requires preparation in advance of class to participate, but it is very effective as a motivator (as well as tool to induce active engagement) that usually gets students to think on their feet and do higher level learning. I'm sure folks are initially both impressed (at ability of instructor to remember names) and annoyed, but it seems to work when the lecture has direction and purpose.\n\nEither way, thanks for responding. Kind of interesting to see how professors make their decision sort of based on a mix of evidence and judgement that does take the academic realities into account.",

                                  "text": "Oh I absolutely agree. There are always psychological and political realities. I think it just raises certain questions about motivation and \"enjoyment\". Do some of us only enjoy it when it will be/feel easy/we aren't expected to do much with the material.  Usually there is a balance at highly selective schools (or at least there was) where a large chunk of students want to be challenged, but don't want to be completely overwhelmed or experience too many impossible challenges which makes sense of course.\n\nI guess the question is whether or not you design a course such that the differentiating factor is mainly the extent at which students merely \"know\"(and can regurgitate) and have a surface level understanding of the material which typically makes everyone happy (these are called \"fair\" because the assessment items are pretty much given to you as they were presented to you) or if it is the difference between those who can do that very well and then those who can demonstrate that they can do way more with the material.   \n\nAt some point, you can't win them all. What is impressive is that generally, the Edwards, Eisens, and Weinschenk tier of professors DO maintain high ratings and reverence.  And they all build into their grading styles and scales the ability to sort of \"fail\".  Like you can get a B grade if you make something in the 70s (even 60s in some cases) for all of these classes.   And honestly that type of challenge and grading is fairly typical at top tier universities outside of the U.S (UK is an example:though those places often have less frequent high stakes testing). \n\nThere is clearly something unique about American highered (even at most top tiers like Emory and many of its similarly ranked 'friends' and competitors) where people just need to see high(80+) raw scores to feel confident/like their learning no matter how final grades are assigned. And that usually means that instructors stick to designing fairly simple assessments that don't push students to understand particularly well/deeply (I personally think this has problems in terms of preparing students for say...graduate or professional training, but especially graduate training) but will yield a feel good average.  \n\nBasically I feel that the \"enjoyment\" aspect is contrived in the wrong way(sure 'happy' students learn in some capacity, but at what caliber/level if they are comfy all the time?  And what caliber should an instructor at a top tier aim for realistically?  I don't really know the answer). And most places that train students the most effectively and have high placement into careers that are actually related to their majors (vs. remaining a pre-professional factory like Emory) don't adhere to this anywhere near as much (they just make it intellectually challenging whether it upsets students or not and let the curves/grade inflation take care of the de-motivation or fear. Again, built in cushion).  I could go on and on.   I guess it isn't best to even continue this conv. here but it was interesting reading your ideas/what you know about it.  I just really do think there is a cultural element in play for sure.",
