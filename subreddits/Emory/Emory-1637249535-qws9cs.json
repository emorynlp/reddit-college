Hurt so bad to swallow, congestion and pressure in my sinuses, coughing like a chain smoker. And emory student health was predictably unhelpful lol. Not to mention that the second you mention any covid-like symptom they automatically freak out and assume you have covid so you can\u2019t go anywhere till you get a test result back",

They should call you pretty quickly to schedule an appointment after you fill out that form",
