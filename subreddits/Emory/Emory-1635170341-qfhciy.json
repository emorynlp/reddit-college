      "text": "Again, it\u2019s literally fine? Internship success is based more on your effort once you\u2019re at a school like Emory. The name may get you past the resume round, but you need to do the work to find, apply, make projects, and prepare for interviews. There\u2019s tons of companies like you said nearby, but you just need to be on top of it and be aware of when the internships open up by checking their career pages. Do be aware though that for CS, you will be against GT kids, and GT does tend to have better builtin pipelines for some of those companies, like Home Depot, Chickfila or NCR",
