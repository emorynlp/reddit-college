  "text": "Hello!! So I am a HS Senior and Emory is my ideal top choice right now. However I only received about 14k in financial aid so it would cost around 60k for me to attend. My parents are divorced but both do relatively well although we are not rich by any means. I want to appeal my financial aid package to try and get a better deal, but the document with instructions on how to appeal aid looks a bit daunting as it seems to only call for people to appeal financial aid if they are in extreme situations (i.e death of a parent or lost job). In my situation, I have a younger sister who will soon be applying for college, have a father who will be retiring in the next couple of years, and genuinely just cannot afford to pay 60k a year. \n\nI also got a good deal from Tufts U where I would only have to pay 30k, so that is obviously in the back of my mind. Also I want to study public health & political science on the pre law track just FYI.\n\nIs it worth appealing the Emory financial aid?",

      "text": "You can appeal and it might work. However in the way things stand I would definitely pick Tufts. Tufts is an equal caliber peer school to Emory. In fact if there was one school that is the most similar to Emory in the country it would be Tufts. Emory is  better for public health but not worth 120k more over 4 years. If you can bring the difference down to say 12k/year then it would be reasonable to pick Emory if you like it more",
