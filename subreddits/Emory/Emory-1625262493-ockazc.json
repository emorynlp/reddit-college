              "text": "Yeah, they have a graduate housing initiative and there is now a Youtube video that shows how phase 1 will look, but Emory really needs to start raising money for undergraduate housing as the on campus % of undergrads is far behind most of its peers.  They will probably need to get creative to figure out where to put them and if the Master Planning maps/documents(which seem to have been kind of wiped from the internet recently) are an indicator, looks like Greek housing was on the chopping block to make room for that (I feel no type of way about it as its that housing which only accommodates a relatively small portion of students vs. a significant housing build out that can get Emory 80%+ on campus housing).",

It was an \"interesting\" proposal to say the least.  Some students would be living in some scenic and sort of distal areas but I guess ultimately at least the housing would be more connected/contiguous whereas now it is sprawled (even excluding C-mont because you have Woodruff and Clifton Tower).  Also it looked like Complex was on the chopping block for what would be the new Law School building (they desperately need a new facility but good luck raising the funds when the rankings are slipping or stagnant) across from GBS.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get the feeling Emory is waiting so long to show off the proposals/framework because things like Greek life housing removal will cause an uproar and they want to get the Capital Campaign started before they step on any toes (take the money and run from people into the Greek life stuff and then use the rest of the Master Planning proposal to stimulate fundraising efforts for other aspects).",

The huge trees surrounding the fields were quite a sight. But I am afraid it's the only choice.\n\nI may have misunderstood but I thought the new law building was going to be shared space with gbs and the existing law building would stay.",

I think that WAS the plan for the law school, but the Sasaki proposal had the proposed new \"arts neighborhood\" buildings exactly where the current law school is.  I imagine it is possible that at least the building (which is one of the more interesting brutalist'ish' buildings aside from Cannon Chapel) would stay but it looks like the shared space you allude to would be across from the current GBS building.\n\nAnd I agree on the fields and I do hate the idea of Emory losing tree coverage anywhere in or around its core.  It appears they tried to preserve as much as possible (like there are currently those cultural houses and stuff back there and it looks like those were gonna go too.  And that may make sense because they can work the other LLCs for upperclassmen that get a floor at Clairmont. Instead they'd get a floor or 2 in the new housing so it would be easy to absorb them).  Hopefully they find a way to minimize loss of woodlands.",
