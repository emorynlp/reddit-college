  "text": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman to the Atlanta campus and I take medicine that must be shipped and refrigerated on arrival. I take it every two weeks and between then, it needs to be in a safe refrigerated location (i.e. not my dorm minifridge). So I am hoping to store it in the Student Health Center or someplace similar. \n\nIs there someone to contact so I can make that happen or how else would I go about getting this done? Also, if anyone is or knows someone who is in a similar situation, please let me know what you or they did to solve this. Thank you so much for your help!",

      "text": "Here\u2019s what I had to do for my cold meds: I would suggest getting a PO Box at the UPS store. There\u2019s one in Toco Hills. This way you can know when the package arrives. I was too worried with Emory mail service that my meds would be lost for a day or so, thus making them worthless. I kept my meds in my mini fridge bc I had to use it everyday. I don\u2019t think student health would let you store something like that.",
