  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m an incoming freshman. I\u2019ll probably major in polisci or PPL, but I have to take a lab science for gen eds. Are there any lab sciences that won\u2019t leave a humanities person sobbing over their textbook at 3 in the morning? I took environmental science in high school and liked it if that helps.",

Favorite class I ever took at Emory and now I\u2019m in love with astronomy :)",
