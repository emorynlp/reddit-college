  "text": "So, I\u2019ve met a few girls and we\u2019ve talked and are interested in rooming together. I saw that when housing opens you have to make a roommate profile but like how does it work? If we wanted to do a double suite and have 4 girls to the room would we just mark that as our preference and then put those girls wherever we indicate who we\u2019ve chosen as our roommates? \n\nSorry if that was confusing lol, thanks!",

However, even if you do luck out and get a suite as you'd like, you cannot choose your suite mates - they will be assigned.",

      "text": "From what I did you had to select one as your roommate. Also there was suppose to be a survey where you list your preferences for roommates like when you go to bed etc. So it should be where you get selected to room with the other 2 girls or girls that have the same preferences as you. You can make your preferences so absurd that it narrows down the list but it is not a concrete way of getting your choice suitemates",

      "text": "The roommate profile is a straightforward survey that you just have to fill out with information like your sleep schedule, privacy preferences, etc. This helps the university match you with a suitable roommate if you haven't already arranged with someone else.\n\nAs for prospective roommates, there should be a tab/page after you complete the roommate profile survey where you can input the names and email addresses of your desired roommates. I spent my first two years at Oxford, so I'm not entirely sure how freshmen dorms at Emory work, but at Oxford the dorm rooms were limited to two people per room and there were no suite style dorms.",
