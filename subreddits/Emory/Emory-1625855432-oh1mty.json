  "text": "Trying to decide between a cs and qss informatics major. Does anyone have any idea how well the qss informatics degree prepares one for programming based jobs? As well as whether typical software engineering employers would look at it favorably at all? If not I\u2019ll probably just go with cs. Thanks.",

      "text": "Eh....I'm willing to bet most raw CS majors would be better prepared (it is about your preparation from whatever classes and EC/CC experiences derived from the foundation in those classes and lesser so the label on the degree at the end of your Emory tenure), but it probably really depends on the amount and types of coursework you take and whether or not you get an internship/participate in competitions that match the skill-set of the job you are seeking.  I don't think they'd look at a specific major any type of way.  It depends on how YOU choose to engage that and whether you do the bare minimum or take relevant classes/find other ways of proving that you have the skills they want.  Hopefully others in this area can confirm but I think a lot of internships and jobs have coding challenges and stuff before the interview to screen or will ask you questions to guage your skills and their alignment with the job description so throwing a CS or informatics label on your degree will be insufficient.  \n\nSo you can do this informatics major or even CS major, but be sure to look into the skills/programming experience your ideal entry level job or internship demands (you may find yourself teaching yourself a lot of things outside of the context of coursework) and tailor to that. Like you may decide it may be helpful to take some other CS classes beyond the informatics requirements or to take specific QTM electives for the jobs you're targeting.  Fortunately, I do suspect that the professional development apparatus (networking nights, certificates, datathons, etc) in the QTM dept can maybe help you explore or learn a little about what to do (or especially about some programming intensive data science jobs).\n\nInterestingly, I stumbled upon this guy from Georgia Tech (really ambitious guy it seems) who explained how he got different interviews and what they were looking for/made him do before hand:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UnUJpITtEA\n\nWhile he seems to be intense (in terms of how quickly he progressed through academics and how he leveraged it), his videos will give you some idea about how things may work in these fields.",
