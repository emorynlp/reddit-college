      "text": "I lived in Fleming and Haygood and have visited friend's rooms in JRC and Elizer/Murdy, studied in all the halls. Fleming is the best imo because it's the newest and you'll often find people hanging out in the 1st floor common area. \n\nHaygood feels cozy and if you're a science major it's convenient bc the OSB is right next to it. All the halls are pretty good except for JRC lol",
