  "text": "I originally intended on pursuing pre-BBA and took FIN 201 - Business Economics to knock out the Macro/Micro requirement. However, I'd like to study QSS instead now.\n\nWhat can I do with the FIN 201 course I took? It's not listed under any of the GER sections or in any QSS major concentration. I'm thinking of taking Econ 101 - Micro which would go towards a History Culture Society GER and be easy given the knowledge I learned from FIN 201, which was basically Micro.",

      "text": "What QSS concentration/disciplinary track are you doing? QSS comes with a concentration and most are social sciences and humanities so it would make no sense to back track and waste time with something like econ 101 (UNLESS it is an econ concentration) when courses within your concentration will likely fulfill the same GER:\nhttp://quantitative.emory.edu/undergraduate/majors-minors/index.html\n\nThe answer to the fin. 201 thing is probably a no unless you are doing QTM/BBA",
