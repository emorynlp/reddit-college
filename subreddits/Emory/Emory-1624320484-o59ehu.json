  "text": "Hi all! So I'll be living at mlao house this fall, but there's barely any info that I can find about the 20 eagle row building. Would there be anyone who's lived in/visited the building that would know anything about the living situation there? Would appreciate any and all info (esp about the rooms/bathrooms). Thanks in advance!",
