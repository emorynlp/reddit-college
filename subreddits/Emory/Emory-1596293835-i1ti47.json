  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman, and this is something I\u2019ve kind of been worried about. Whenever I\u2019ve looked at the subreddits at other universities last year, apparently cheating on exams was a common occurrence. I\u2019d read about how the class average in intro science exams would be abnormally high for example. As a result, there would be no curve, and anyone who didn\u2019t cheat was essentially punished.\n\nDoes that happen at Emory? I really don\u2019t feel comfortable cheating, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll be unusually harder to do well in my classes because of this. I\u2019m going to be premed so obviously my gpa is really important too.",

      "text": "Did people cheat on last years online exams? Probably. Was it widespread? Hardly. The average grade on the chemistry final exam last spring was a B-, which is exactly what it was supposed to be and the same as previous years. \n\nAbout curves, none of the intro bio/chem professors really curve anyway, so that\u2019s a non-issue. The final average in my bio and chem classes were both at a B, which is just a tad higher than the B- target (although first semester it was also a B, when we weren\u2019t online, so not much of a change there). \n\nSpecifically for CHEM 150, the professors write their own exams, so you will not be able to find them online anyway. Hope this helps!",

          "text": "Thanks. Do you mind me asking how grading works at Emory? Like, how much do exams determine your grade? Assuming it\u2019s 60-70%, does that mean you can get a B+ if you do well in everything else and the average of your exams is a B?\n\nAlso, were the online exams open-book? And you mentioned that the average grade for a final exam for a lab was 69-71. Why was it so low? What do lab finals even test you on? And do you have any tips to do well in chem/chem lab classes?",

              "text": "In terms of grading policies, every teacher and class has their own grading breakdown. For Chem 150 and 202 (the second semester class), the three midterms were worth between 45-48% of our grade, and then the final was about 25% of our grade, so overall exams were about 70-73% of our grade. For BIOL 141 and 142, exams were 80% of our grade. The other portion of grading comes from a mix of in-class activities and outside activities. So yes, your overall grade will likely be a little higher than your test average.  (These percentages reflect pre-covid, it may look different this year).\n\nThe open/closed book policy varied from class to class. Chem and Bio had weekly open book and collaborative quizzes and then closed book exams. \n\nThe Chem 202L final was written to be difficult, as the grades going into the final were extremely high as the difficult portions of the lab were omitted when we went online. Pretty much everyone had an A, so he wrote a hard (but fair) final to get a little more of a distribution of grades. It was 20% of our grade, so overall grades were still pretty good. It was very calculations-based, and had scenarios from the various labs we had done/watched our instructor do. \n\nTo do well in chem lab classes, do the post lab assignments diligently and actually understand what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t just mindlessly copy what you see online. They\u2019re hard but helpful. Bio lab is a joke so you\u2019ll be fine. For Chem Lecture, do the worksheets and understand the connections between topics, not just memorizing a bunch of stuff. The exams require synthesis of information",

The design of these exams was that there would be usually just 1 or 2 \u201cinteresting\u201d questions, but McGill was great at preparing us for those.\n\nThe Chem 202L final was a tough one, I think the average was between a 69-71.

                  "text": "Oh okay, yeah that sounds normal I guess for chem.  They often have the 1 high scoring exam, and then a low scoring exam, and maybe an intermediate if there are 3 midterms. That's alright I guess.  I honestly wonder why they are so worried about grade distributions when they could just give a somewhat challenging take-home assignment in lieu of those exams or in addition to a classroom component that require students to learn better.  There is no need to give regular midterms if they gotta think about all this cheating stuff and it won't teach students to solve cooler problems.  They had an oppurtunity to do something else.  Oh well, guess they gotta find ways to stick to their B-/B target as that is the only indicator of rigor to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that lab sounds more like what will happen in 2/3 of the organic professor's classes (but Soria doesn't usually give averages because they don't matter, but they are definitely in the \"this was very challenging\" range like 50-70 or something like that) for each test but they'll just be effectively curved so folks will be alright.",

      "text": "You don't need to cheat, but perform.  The final grades usually targeted in the pre-med classes is usually B/B- and according to the poster below/above, classes like bio and chem were NOT trying to write exams challenging enough to be curved in the first place (so imagine, they wrote a test targeting 80%, and a few a-holes cheated.  Then it goes to 83%. Neither of these warrant a curve.  And what I think usually happens is that there is one higher scoring exam given in classes like bio and chem and maybe one \"lower\" or \"intermediate\" test somewhere in the 70s so sometimes the average going into a final may be higher than B/B- so even a 70 something average on the final wouldn't warrant the course being curved)  so the averages don't matter in that case.  You need to just perform.\n\nAnd trust me that for classes where many professors do write exams that warrant curved grading, a large chunk of the tests are just NOT amenable to cheating (like with Weinschenk, you can maybe only score as high as 30-50% without being able to apply knowledge and think beyond what you practiced and present clear approaches to challenging problems).  They are written in such a way where people should be writing up different answers because they aren't just problems from p-sets, the book, or class.  They'll be problems derived from scientific literature in the field or applications that really make you think at a higher level so they aren't designed for students to necessarily get the exact same answers or even be able to collude to get an answer (unless a student has a brilliant friend, I wouldn't trust them with answers on the applied section of those exams, and even then....I'd recommend being in a position to trust your own instincts because Weinschenk and Soria often even put 1-2 items that challenge and/or blow the minds of very top students).",

We should discuss what seems scary to YOU based upon your background.  I just wanna be clear of your concerns (like whose class out of McGill and Weinschenk are you scared of.  Are you afraid of 75-83 average tests?  That seems pretty high for STEM to me and suggests tests are mostly predictable.  Do you think your HS curriculum felt too easy?
