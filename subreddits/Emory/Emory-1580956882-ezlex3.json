  "text": "Hello all,\n\nSenior here getting ready to graduate in less than 100 days (yikes). Just wanted to say how happy it makes me to see all of you so excited today about being admitted and joining the Emory community in the fall, it\u2019s quite refreshing to see.\n\nI hope you all enjoy the celebrations and the rest of your senior year of HS (or whatever you are doing). Life will be markedly different in the fall, but hopefully for the better. \n\nMy inbox is always open if you have any questions, concerns or just want to talk about life at Emory.\n\nAgain, congrats!!",
