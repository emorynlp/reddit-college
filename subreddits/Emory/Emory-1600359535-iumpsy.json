  "text": "Hi, I am a freshman and am planning to apply to a business school during my sophomore year. \n\nI applied to 2 executive positions for 2 clubs and applied as a member to 3 other clubs. \n\nI got a fatass rejection from all of them lol. I am not bitter about it but am worried if I am \"behind\" compared to other freshmen who are also going to apply to the business school with a resume of better experience and positions. \n\nSo, now I am getting nervous and have some questions for the upperclassmen.\n\n1. Do we have to **apply** to **every** single club (even for a member position)? or do you only apply to executive roles? This shit is so different from high school where you can mostly just join a club of your interest, so I am confused. \n2. Does the application open every semester?\n3. Are there any fun clubs and business-related clubs that are inclusive?\n4. Because of the pandemic, how do you think the clubs will work out this year? Like, I am trying to build connections and utilize sources that these \"clubs\" are claiming to provide, but getting all the rejections and being in quarantine (I'm off-campus rn btw) makes it harder to write a good resume until next year.",

      "text": "1. No depends on the club. The business clubs make members apply because quality > quantity and because there are only so many projects we can manage at a time. And as members, you actually have work to do.The overarching Goizueta clubs are no applications for members. I\u2019m talking Goizueta Consulting Club as opposed to CYC, Atlas, or 180. Most college orgs also do not require apps to just join as a member.\n \n2. Most clubs, yes they are open every semester. \n\n3. Gozuieta level Consulting, Analytics Real Estate, etc. Women in Business, Ascend (if you are Asian, there\u2019s more for other ethnicities i just don\u2019t know their names). Also, econ department might have some related clubs.\n\n4. Do not know, graduated :/\n\nAlso, bschool does not care if your club is business related. It does not have to be at all. They just want to see you involved in something, whatever it is.",

          "text": " thanks for the detailed answer. I know the b school has a high acceptance rate, but I just want to build my resume the best I can and getting rejected to all of them makes me feel like I'm failing in s1 lmao. Also, do you mean \"involved in smth\" as a school restricted activities or other personal projects (outside of school)?",

It can be side job, volunteering or clubs. I will say on campus will help you find advisors for rec letters later on though. It\u2019s okay, most people get rejected. I was in CYC, and we could only afford to take like 10 out of 120, otherwise there would not be enough work to go around. So it\u2019s not you aren\u2019t good enough, the clubs just can\u2019t handle that many members.",
