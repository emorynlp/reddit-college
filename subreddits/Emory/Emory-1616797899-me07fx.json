  "text": "Hi everyone! \nI was recently admitted to Oxford college for spring admission and I\u2019m super grateful. However, the only way I\u2019d be able to go was if I was going in the fall. As the title says, is there anyway I can appeal my admission to the fall? Should I send a letter to the admissions office? It \u2019s my top choice right now and I\u2019d hate to give it up.\n\nThank you for the help!",

      "text": "I have no idea, but if your only option is to attend Oxford in the spring, PLEASE commit to another school. I\u2019m an Oxford graduate, and I can confidently say that Oxford itself is already an atrocious scam, even before COVID times, for many reasons that aren\u2019t hard to find on here. \n\nBut I can guarantee you that entering Oxford in the spring will make your experience there even worse, as a lot of friends groups and leadership positions are already established by the end of the first semester. You will be missing out on a lot by not being there in the fall. And if they\u2019re not letting you take fall classes, then you will graduate in one semester later than your peers. It\u2019s not worth it, and frankly it\u2019s an insult to students like you who most likely have other respectable institutions ready to welcome you with open arms.",
