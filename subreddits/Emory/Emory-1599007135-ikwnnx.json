  "text": "I applied to a few and there was one that I was really banking on and I just found out I got rejected today. I feel like there were barely any positions and it makes me slightly mad that I have this federal aid money but cannot claim it simply because I wasn't selected for a competitive work study job.",

She did finally did hear back from an employer giving her a position. Handshake is the only portal to find a job. I believe jobs are scarce because so many things aren\u2019t open. This is definitely not fair for you guys. Maybe there is something you students could change as a group...? Good luck!",
