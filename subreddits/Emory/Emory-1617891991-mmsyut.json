  "text": "I recently received my financial aid information and saw that I was having to pay $47,000/year. My family\u2019s income from our 2019 taxes was around $94,000 so I thought the Emory Advantage would allow me to get a lot of grants but I only got $15,000 in grants. My family income fell to around $40,000 this past year since my dads business suffered because of COVID. I was wondering if this would be a good enough reason to guarantee some money from appealing?\n\nAlso, how could I schedule a meeting with my financial aid advisor?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "If your family income falling to 40K this past year was not reflected in your FAFSA or CSS Profile, then that is absolutely a good enough reason to appeal. However, $47K expected annual family contribution calculated on a 94K household income doesn't sound right... Does your family have substantial assets that are being taken to account (for example, a substantial 529, large stock holdings, or high value real estate)? If your father's business is highly valued, that explain might also explain.\n\nFind your Emory finaid advisor here and shoot them an email: [https://studentaid.emory.edu/undergraduate/manage/contact/advisors.html](https://studentaid.emory.edu/undergraduate/manage/contact/advisors.html)\n\nIf another school calculated your EFC much lower, include that information in your email",

Bring that up with Emory along with your family's current financial situation (covid hit business hard - 40k household income in the past year, and ask if they can recalculate your EFC with this additional information. \n\nBe polite and don't offer ultimatums but you can be blunt. I'd say something like \" I really want to attend Emory/Emory is my top choice, but with my family's current financial situation, 47000 EFC is unaffordable for me.\"\n\nYou could consider running your family's financial information through the Emory aid estimator: [https://app.myintuitionapp.org/institution/c622088d-9e2b-492f-8f79-dcace4bdf645/costestimator](https://app.myintuitionapp.org/institution/c622088d-9e2b-492f-8f79-dcace4bdf645/costestimator)  \n\n\nIf the result there is substantial different, ask the fin aid advisor if they can help you understand why.",

Complete the special circumstances appeal and if they can't help, turn your attentions to another university, assuming you don't want student loans. Sometimes individual school's finaid offices are just weird af. I remember most schools put my EFC at around 15K and offered grants to make up the rest, but Rice only offer 4k in grants and expected my family to pay the rest (which was not possible). If a school is being unreasonable, perhaps you should cut your losses and move on. There are multitple paths to success and you have several good options",

Those assets are going to be my parents only form of income (besides social security) when they retire but there\u2019s no way to count it as a retirement plan because they can take from it whenever they want. I guess they just expect my parents to trade their retirement for my college education (especially when I plan on going to law school after undergrad)",
