      "text": "This question is weird because the school is Geographically diverse in terms of domestic students and also has like 15-20% international students (which may have no affinity towards American college sports at all).  Some of the most well represented regions domestically don't have as much college football fervor and people from regions that do are going to remain loyal to the favorite teams from that region.  This might be a different conversation if Emory was an elite private more like Rice where the home state had much better representation but that is just not the case. \n\nIf you see anything, it may be more in the realm of professional sports but to expect \"Emory students\" generally to compensate for the absence of football with just ceding loyalty to teams from outside of their states/regions or to even pick up an interest where one never existed doesn't make much sense. Mind you I am all for finding alternative traditions that might generate some spirit to compensate but it just ain't gonna come through being a sports fan at a place like Emory, sorry.",
