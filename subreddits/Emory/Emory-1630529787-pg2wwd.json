Many students have abused the no-mask guidelines outdoors by hosting large gatherings. 5 of 6 classes that I have are online so I won't be affected as much. My 6th class already had instructions for transitioning to online.\n\nYep we're going back.",

          "text": "Did they have severe symptoms? I just have to wonder how much \"testing positive\" matters anymore because these institutions seem determined to stay open with standard education.  I'm betting they may give a stern yelling and impose more restrictions until it is under control but I just suspect that it'll take a lot to go fully online.  Like I think people are beginning to realize that we'll be living with this thing for a while even with vaccines. It may become a thing to more so manage than be extremely reactionary towards.  I don't know. There are just a lot of \"just deal with the cases\" forces out there.  It's a wild time to be alive. I also suspect that flu season will cause confusion and other problems with relaxed mask restrictions.\n\nI think there will be a bunch of temporarily virtual stuff if professors get it though.",

The other classmates were not named; we were just made aware.\n\nTesting positive still matters imo because it would be important to know the rates of transmission in vaccinated subjects. I agree that we will be living with this just like the flu; human nature (politics, economics, radical beliefs, misinformation) prevents us from eradicating a disease like this even though the possibility exists.\n\nBut I'm not expert so as an undergad I, personally, will just do my part to reduce the spread, stay informed, suck it up, and roll with whatever the experts say we're going to do.",

The price point and not wanting to lose revenue and the perception of the universities' efficacy is going to drive some high risk decision making I promise. Like that online stuff was awful! IMO, it made most privates look pretty bad when they charged full tuition (even with a tuition freeze) and they know they would have a hard time justifying it in the future. The only \"good\" it did students was additional grade inflation but the quality just wasn't there vs. In person especially in things like STEM.  If I was from the state of a private and was paying even half tuition, I'd strongly entertain transferring to an allegedly much weaker flagship or IS public option.",

I'd take an Emory education worth a bigger fraction of its price tag even with the inconvenience unless you are in an area where there is very little difference between online and not or are a senior that can care less because you're almost done. But I know most departments had their quality shot! Online is like robbery and many first years from last year probably won't realize it until this year I'm betting.",
