  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I just got assigned assigned a double in Eagle Hall. I just have a few questions about the room itself. How adjustable is the height of the beds? Can I fit my desk and chair underneath to save space? Also, does anyone have any pictures of the room itself? The ones on the website don\u2019t give me a good idea at all of the kind of space I\u2019ll have. Thanks so much!",
