      "text": "Houston Mill to La Vista (Houston Mill is not super hilly past a certain point either) then right is a nice scenic walk.  Maybe cut through Lullwater on the way to Hans woods as your access point to Houston Mill(you will have to cross the bridge and then left along the trail). There may be an easier way (I know I have gotten there other ways such as through neighborhoods along Mason Mill, but I don't know if it is less arduous. Like maybe I had to go through some woods/down some type of slope or something).  Possible that there are ways to cut through the VA from what I remember (I think that was another way I did and it is probably less distance but more tricky).\n\nThe first way is certainly the easiest way to do it without getting confused or lost.",

Minus the turn left on Cmont route, Google Maps is probably unlikely to pick up on other shorter(or slightly longer) routes that say...involve cutting through Lullwater from Clairmont.  For a walker trying to get to Toco Hills, Cmont campus is in kind of an isolated location.  basically in the middle of a forest. The only other routes involving side walks that Google Maps would probably pick up easily are very long.\n\n\nEdit: I just checked, it only picks up on the Cmont road route.",
