  "text": "Hey guys, just wondering what your opinion would be on someone like me coming to campus for the spring sem after being remote for the first sem. Will it be easier or harder to make friends? Just don\u2019t want to be completely lonely because I decided to be remote in the fall.",

However,from what I saw, I can confidently say that as long as you put in the effort to get out there, people will be more than happy to get to know you and become friends.",
