  "title:": "Need Help With Transferring to Emory",
  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nThank you for reading this. I need your help :<\n\nI'm currently a sophomore at GSU. I maintain a 4.0 GPA and have some ECs, in the attached.\n\nBackground: I was born in Vietnam. Moved to China at 15 to learn Chinese. At 17, moved to America to pursue higher education.\n\nPersonal statement: about my adaptability to new places without knowing any Chinese or English. So, I became a TA in China and America to teach the other students the value of learning. Then, I realized the mental health stigma in Asian Community. It motivated me to remove this stigma by studying psychology and being a psychiatrist...\n\nDo you guys think I will have a chance? I also apply to other schools like Cornell, Northwestern, NYU, and Rice and pray that any of them will accept me.\n\nAlso, Emory's deadline date is on March 15. I'm preparing my applications now. But I want to apply on Feb 10 because my prof said he will have more good things to write on the letter since I will be his TA next semester. Does applying late or early really matter?\n\nThank you so much guys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55m2he15gfv71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=852c9333968f6bd6e34a5c10be5e20c6dea3b9f8",

      "text": "Hello, transfer student here. Emory doesn't have rolling admissions so it wouldn't matter if you applied early or submitted on the deadline. I would recommend you listen to your professor's advice and apply later since a good letter of rec will have a huge impact on your admission. It looks like you have a solid GPA and extracurriculars, so as long as you write good essays, you'll have a good chance.",

      "text": "I like your activities. App seems really strong. Seems like someone I'd hang out with and ask about their story. I'm no adcom, just a previous transfer. I didn't have to do much to get in. And I sure didn't have a 4.0 by my sophomore year.\n\nOnce you get in, I'd say check out other behavioral studies besides psychology. We have psych, neuroscience and behavioral biology, and anthropology/human biology. I personally chose the third one. Any of these three would adequately prepare you for applying to med school (notice I didn't say prepare you for medical school, just to apply).",
