  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman with a history of depression and social anxiety disorder. Both of those things have gotten significantly better, but not to the point where they\u2019re nonexistent. I still do therapy and take medication.\n\nDo you guys know of any on-campus resources that are available to students with mental illnesses, and do any of you recommend that I use them? I\u2019m aware that most mental health services at universities in general in the US *suck*, so it\u2019s probably no different at Emory. But still, even a little help on campus would be nice. \n\nI\u2019m mainly worried about adjusting the first few months since I\u2019ll be away from home. I think everything will get a lot easier after that. I\u2019m definitely going to be looking at therapists/psychiatrists in Atlanta. On a side note, does having something like depression allow you to get a single dorm if you go through DAS?",

I first went to CAPS, which transferred me over to long term treatment and therapy at Emory\u2019s psychological center. I go to Student Health Services for psychiatry. I hope that helps a little.",

There are probably lots of psychiatrists nearby because of the hospital, but for me I found it easier just to walk over to student health services. It\u2019s really up to you though! I know student health services can be really slow sometimes though.",
