      "text": "Totally understand not wanting to double up on science your first year! That said, unless you have a compelling reason, I would recommend taking chem rather than bio your first year. There are a number of reasons, some of which oldeaglenewute2022 mentioned, why it is nice to get started on your chem sequence earlier. If you have more questions about chem vs bio, feel free to PM me. Good luck this semester!",

      "text": "No problem really (at least in terms of performance.  Some things like the metabolism, enzyme, etc modules may be a bit troublesome for you to fully grasp though) but I still think you should take chem first and maybe not bio.  Bio and ochem make more sense as a double up combo (for your sophomore year-most med schools expect you to double even on lab sciences at least once so you'll need to do it eventually.  If you avoid it while at Emory altogether, it'll probably weaken the application at many of them especially if the MCAT ends up lackluster.  So ease in this year but don't overdo it trying to avoid doubling in sciences afterwards).  AND you'd probably wanna position yourself so that you can take biochem.1 (which requires 203) as early as fall junior year and you also want to avoid summer versions of important classes (certainly don't do more than one pre-med core sequence) for a variety of reasons.  \n\nThere is also the fact that chem makes bio (especially a lot of bio 141-Emory's gchem sequence isn't a plug and chug type of thing like at most schools and covers concepts useful to understand biological concepts and it also covers enough organic chemistry for you to understand some of the reactions that happen in biology) make more sense. You can do well without the chem background but you can make a lot more connections that others won't (because they'll just memorize the stuff they can't fully grasp due to lack of background in chem) and seeing connections between the pre-med cores is useful given that the MCAT passages often stress interdisciplinary knowledge and thinking. PHA and bio instructors usually advise folks take gchem first if they are really averse to doubling as a freshman. Lastly, technically chem is rigorous enough to build the type of time management skills you'll need when doubling in the future. Bio..not as much which is important considering you want maintenance of a very strong performance or a very good upward trend.",
