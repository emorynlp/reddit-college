  "text": "Hey, so I\u2019m bringing a bike to campus this fall (rising sophomore), which I plan to use to buy groceries and also just to get around with if I want to have fun at Decatur square or surrounding areas. How safe is bike transportation, and also, is there a bike rack at Publix? I do not have a kickstand and am also generally inexperienced with bike commuting so I would like some input. \n\nIf there is anything else related to traveling by bike in the Emory area that I either forgot to ask about or that you think would be useful for anyone else to know, feel free to add it! Thanks.",

      "text": "How safe is bike transportation\n\n* It's absolutely doable! There's a fairly simple way to get to Downtown Decatur (via Coventry road) - though it does have  a steep hill. But you'll get used to it. I commute on it every day.\n* Getting to Publix is a bit more complicated. But I do know of students who live there who bike to campus; they may use the sidewalk for a significant part of it.\n\nIs there a bike rack at publix\n\n* I'm not actually sure about this... There's definitely a railing you can lock to if there isn't.\n\nIs there anything related to travelling by bike in the Emory area?\n\n* All Emory Shuttles have a bike rack in front so you can take your bike on the shuttle. All MARTA buses also have a bike rack in front, and you can bring your bike in MARTA trains at all times.\n* Check out Emory Bike Social, the undergraduate bicycling club. They have a facebook and and an email emorybikesocial at gmail.com\n* Check out the Fixie the bicycle cooperative on campus where you can learn how to and fix your bike for free.\n* I recommend getting a heavy duty chain or a U lock, don't rely on a cable lock. There is occasional bursts of bike theft on campus that affects unlocked and poorly locked bikes. (In my experience there'll be a 2 day period where a lot of bikes got stolen, and that's it for the year). Make sure bike racks you lock to are attached to the ground.\n* Office of transportation has a decent summary of bike resources. [https://transportation.emory.edu/bike-emory](https://transportation.emory.edu/bike-emory) Their email will also answer emails - [commute at emory.edu](mailto:commute@emory.edu)\n* Lullwater Road brings you to Freedom Park Trail which goes all the way to centennial park/old fourth ward/other parts of atlanta\n\nLet me know if you have further questions!",

      "text": "The bike ride to Ponce City Market at the Beltline is also pretty easy.\n\nTake Lullwater Rd NE south towards Fernbank, cross Ponce De Leon Ave and turn left, you'll see the Freedom Park Trail start on your right. You can follow that all the way to Moreland Ave. Cross the street and continue on to the Beltline. \n\nVery important - when you hit Moreland, when facing west, [take the bike path on the *left* (south)](https://i.imgur.com/ByDo3fc.jpg) as the northern path takes you to the wrong park.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and when you're on the Freedom Park Trail, be warned that it's very hilly and if one were to hypothetically hit wet leaves while going very fast, one might find themselves at Student Health Services with a wrist brace.",

      "text": "Just be careful (I believe Publix has a rack or places for people to keep their bikes if you are talking the one at North Decatur)  The topography and infrastructure make biking a bit tricky in the Atlanta area (the wild drivers don't help either) as you may have seen if you are currently on campus. Luckily getting from the Publix area to Decatur square (via Clairmont) is a relatively flat route, but honestly, if you are concerned (and perhaps you should be), you can probably go up near the McDonalds and gas station on N. Decatur and Clairmont and take CCTMA Emory shuttle to Decatur Square on weekdays or MARTA 36 on weekends.  There are bunches of shops and restaurants at the other end of N. Decatur as well and you can try biking (warning, that is a fairly hilly ride. Big drop along the shopping centers at the top of N. Decatur and then it eventually goes slowly uphill towards Walmart/the shopping centers) or you can take(you and your bike) the North Dekalb Mall shuttle on weekdays (36 goes by it before going into Decatur City/square if you do this on weekends).",
