      "text": "Labs can be \"open\" till whenever.  You should be getting keycard access.  Many graduate students and post-docs will be 9(or 8) to 5ish, and many will do longer.  Science (if we're talking science) often doesn't wait for people so you're going to see a range of schedules and should coordinate with others in the lab (so you'll be able to come in when others can assist, supervise, whatever) before designing a schedule.  Different labs have different cultures with regards to this. Figure yours out.",

      "text": "Just as a general thought, I would try to make larger blocks of time available in your schedule for research. I have found it to be more time effective to spend 4-5 hours in lab 2-3 days a week, depending on what your lab expects, rather than 2-3 hours every single day. This can be a little trickier to figure out in terms of scheduling, but I feel like it is more beneficial. If at all possible, try to carve out the majority of one day for research per week. If that isn't going to work, an afternoon or morning per week for research is also helpful. \n\nAlso, it's helpful to keep in mind where you will be researching. For instance, if you are researching in Whitehead and taking classes in the bio building, it would be great if you could be in lab before or after class. This way you don't have to spend extra time walking back and forth to research. It's not a big deal for a lot of people, but it is kind of nice to not run back and forth between buildings on campus when you are already pressed for time. This is just a personal preference, so please follow whatever works best with your schedule and lab. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other questions about managing time for research or anything about research in general. Best of luck!",
