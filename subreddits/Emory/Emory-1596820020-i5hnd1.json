  "text": "hey guys! i'm an incoming freshman and i wanted to potentially major in human health on the premed track, and also explore econ/other areas (also looking at the bba concentration in health innovation). \n\nCHEM 150L (2)\n\nCHEM 150 w/ McGill (3)\n\nBIOL 141L (2)\n\nPACE/HEALTH (2)\n\nPOLS 190 w/ Reiter (3)\n\nthe seminar class I was assigned is actually in person, but I'm conflicted because I'm not super interested in the topic. I really wanted HLTH 190 w/ Welkley or DANC 190 w/ Staib but i'm not sure i'd be able to get them. my question is, if i wanna explore human health, should i take a HLTH course that knocks out a GER, or would it be better to try to get that HLTH 190 seminar and just take an interesting class that fulfills a GER? with another class I'd be at 15 credits.\n\nsome courses i was looking at: HLTH 250 (waitlist), FILM 101, ANT 101, ECON 101\n\nI'm coming in w/ bio, macro, bc calc (hasn't shown up in opus yet), and lang. i'm so sorry for the long post, but i'd love to hear any advice/ input anyone has!:)",

      "text": "Your schedule looks good, but definitely a little light. I\u2019d definitely consider adding another course like the ones you\u2019ve mentioned. Just a note that you cannot get credit for all of your AP Exams. Calc BC counts as 6 credits, while the rest are 3, and Emory caps you at 12 AP credits. An FSEM in health will not fulfill any sort of human health major requirements, so you\u2019d be better off taking a class in the human health department and taking an FSEM in a different department. It\u2019s a great opportunity to study new and different things (I\u2019m a bio major/premed and my FSEM was in the Jewish Studies department).\n\nANT 101 with Easton is insanely easy, but not particularly motivating and it wasn\u2019t as interesting as it should\u2019ve been. If you\u2019re looking for an easy way to get an HSC done, this is definitely a good way to do that. If you\u2019re interested in anthropology, id suggest a different anthro course. This is the only course I\u2019ve taken of the extra ones you\u2019ve mentioned so I won\u2019t comment on the others.",
