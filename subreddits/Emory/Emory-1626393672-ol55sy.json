Trash builds up pretty quickly\n* Shower sandles + caddy to bring your stuff in \n* Surge protectors / Power cables (there's not many outlets tbh in your room in convenient spots)\n* Cold weather gear! Atlanta gets cold in the winter (sub 20 F), don't think it's warm all year long! \n* STORAGE!!! The amount of random papers, swag, and random BS I got my first year, I was dumping it in a drawer and ended up losing some important things. \n* Last, a desktop calendar, one of those big ones you spread out on your desk. I would go through at the beginning of each semester and fill out every assignment / deadline on that calendar. Was a life saver one too many times.\n\nI could probably go on, but that's my brain dump. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about Emory.",
