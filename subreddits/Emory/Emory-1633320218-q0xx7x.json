The problem solving techniques you practice there will really come in handy for the \u201cstretch\u201d question(s) on the exam, which ask you to synthesize your knowledge and apply it to something new (usually this means analyzing some famous chemical reaction with the knowledge and concepts you\u2019ve learned so far). \n\nAs for specs grading, this doesn\u2019t affect how you should be preparing. Her standards for pass/high pass in 204L last semester were pretty reasonable on any given assignment, but it doesn\u2019t actually affect how you should be studying.",

              "text": "To be clear, and maybe Yankee can confirm, but LA sessions are NOT for people \"struggling\" in the course and nor are office hours.  Like LA sessions, book problems, and occasional office hours are the bare minimum expected to even those who feel they are keeping up with the course because you get exposure to different problem solving methods and more intel/advice about the course.  Spec grading will have no effect on how you prep.  The test is graded out of a number of points and whatever number of points you get vs. whatever she sets as a pass,high pass, or whatever for an exam is what you shoot for.  Spec grading wouldn't change that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, take this seriously:  Those with As/A-/top students are usually the students using ALL of the resources associated with these tough STEM courses.  In the future, even if you do well on the exam, you need to take advantage of them because the material does get harder and those resources are ways to make connections with potential upper classmen mentors AND the professors (office hours).  They have to know you if they are gonna write a GOOD rec. letter for you (they won't just give a good one to people simply because they earned a certain grade in the course when like 20-40/100 other people also earned strong enough grades) or if they are going to perhaps select you as a future LA.\n\nSo think of these as a mix of learning the material at the highest level possible (like LA sessions are supposed to be exam level problems and good TAs may ask additional questions or follow-up questions for you to think about that you won't get if you say...just wait for LA sheet answers to come out.  And you also have to keep in mind that in-class worksheets may be more representative of easier problems because there isn't but so much time per class session and it would be tough to cover more nuanced problems during them) as well as making connections that will benefit you personally and professionally.",

All the worksheets are standardized and there are several sessions throughout the week so it's absolutely in your best interest to actively attend. Instructors have data that show you that the highest scoring students are the same students who actively attend LA sessions if word of mouth still isn't enough to convince you.",

                      "text": "I mean, yeah you gotta work on that.  There are SEVERAL LA sessions and I think the LA sheets are standardized so they aren't specific to a certain section.  I don't know how you'll do, and hopefully you do at least okay but I would expect those who attend more regularly to have an advantage (this is seen in most foundation level STEMs.  Maybe the advantage is diminished in biology because those problem sets aren't very good, but even there there is supposedly a decent advantage).  Can't view it like HS where you probably were just a sponge.  Chemistry, physics, and apparently even math foundation classes do tend to write exams that are at least a little demanding in normal years (as in not last year).\n\nAnd then also, minus ALEKS (webassign, mastering bio in physics and bio respectively) and the somewhat infrequent quizzes, there is so little graded work in college STEM classes that you may feel like not much is going on or that you aren't struggling perse but you have to keep up with and see how you think through the more nuanced problems (like harder book problems and LA session level problems-like seriously work them and even pause when you struggle. Don't just run to the key and say \"oh yeah I get it now\".That is the biggest trap and where folks run into problems over-estimating their preparedness) to see where you really stand.  It's unsafe to assume that only the most straight-forward problems that you feel you easily understood are going on an exam.\n\nYou never know and then the time constraints of an exam can make in-class problems and harder book problems feel quite challenging (and versus HS, colleges, especially selective schools like Emory tend to populate the exams with a greater percentage of sort of time consuming problems vs. mostly a bunch of freebies/regurgitation oriented conceptual problems and then maybe 1-2 real problems at the end of the tests.  Like even MCQs, when offered may involve serious calculations).",

      "text": "There are some LAs on here (I know one for her class).  Maybe wait and see if they respond.  But from what I'm hearing, the midterms are supposedly gonna be a different format (for ALL sections-I suspect there will be significant standardization) than previous years (and especially last year) so you are in new territory with everyone else and you'll have to do the best you can.  Also, please note that \"pass\" is kind of a vague term and that there is another midterm, several quizzes, and a final offered such that you and everyone else can learn from and adjust study methods based upon the demands of the first test.\n\nIf they choose to write a challenging test (where median and even some solid/top students are challenged) where the average is significantly below 80, the final course grades will be adjusted back upwards until the grades correspond to a final course GPA in the B-/B(2.7-3.0) range so it is all relative.  If the test is relatively simple and straight forward such that the mean is 80+, then indeed you need a 60+ for a \"passing\" grade and I don't know what she set as \"high pass\" (if it is 80 something, it may indicate the level at which she'll pitch exams).  Either way, don't panic now and worry about what you think you can't do.  Use the time you have left to position yourself the best you can.  That is all you can do because if you go into the test with a panic mode, you're more likely to jeopardize your chances at a solid performance even if you are well-prepared.  And don't get upset if it is clear they were INTENTIONALLY trying to challenge and push y'alls thinking.\n\nThat will sometimes happen at Emory, especially in chemistry courses (like you'll be more ready for chem 203 where that type of exam style and calibre is really common). Know that a lot of others (mostly first years with a \"meh\" k-12 STEM curriculum or even over-coached AP experiences) probably will have been challenged as well, and that the adjustment I alluded to will make up for it (challenging tests are meant to just make more clear distinctions in terms of who can do what with the material and to reward the chunk who can do more than sort of repeat the methods of the practice problems).\n\nAlso, as for a \"high pass\"....look if you want that, you will REALLY just have to study and see how it shakes out. There are usually never guarantees that will happen even if you prepare a decent amount.  Again, Emory courses and assessments are supposed to be more challenging than the same courses at significantly less selective places, so you just have to learn as you go and do the best you can.  If the exam is meant to even challenge students in the slightest, there will likely be some uncertainty as to whether you hit whatever mark she considers a \"pass\" or \"high pass\".",
