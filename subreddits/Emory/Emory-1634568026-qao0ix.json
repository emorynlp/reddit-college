      "text": "It's a Capital (fundraising)Campaign.  The last time Emory launched one was in 2008-9 I think and I guess this one is more forward looking because the last Campaign was trying to accomplish stuff in a few years during a recession.  It makes sense to look at least 10 years into the future.  The main questions to me are:\n\n 1)What is the target fundraising goal (last time was 1.5 billion I think so hopefully it is higher)?\n2) Will the targets per unit/school be more evenly distributed than before? Last time ECAS, Ox, law, Laney, and business were on the low end and allied health units(med, nursing, public health) had insane targets\n3) What are the specific plans? Will this and its unveiling also be coupled with further unveiling of campus master planning strategy?\n4) why now? When a bunch of elite privates, possibly including Emory just got giant endowment boosts from weird investment strategies? It's just a strange time to ask alum and even historically big donors for more money. But best of luck! I guess..\n\n\nIf current undergrads give any damned about whether the quality and prestige of their degree will grow during the time there and when you graduate, I'd pay attention to this and attend some events where they may lay out specifics of the vision and division of resources.  You may even have a chance to influence it.  Don't just sit on your hands. Find out how they claim they'll be using the money.",
