      "text": "It's a Capital (fundraising)Campaign.  The last time Emory launched one was in 2008-9 I think and I guess this one is more forward looking because the last Campaign was trying to accomplish stuff in a few years during a recession.  It makes sense to look at least 10 years into the future.  The main questions to me are:\n\n 1)What is the target fundraising goal (last time was 1.5 billion I think so hopefully it is higher)?\n2) Will the targets per unit/school be more evenly distributed than before? Last time ECAS, Ox, law, Laney, and business were on the low end and allied health units(med, nursing, public health) had insane targets\n3) What are the specific plans? Will this and its unveiling also be coupled with further unveiling of campus master planning strategy?\n4) why now? When a bunch of elite privates, possibly including Emory just got giant endowment boosts from weird investment strategies? It's just a strange time to ask alum and even historically big donors for more money. But best of luck! I guess..\n\n\nIf current undergrads give any damned about whether the quality and prestige of their degree will grow during the time there and when you graduate, I'd pay attention to this and attend some events where they may lay out specifics of the vision and division of resources.  You may even have a chance to influence it.  Don't just sit on your hands. Find out how they claim they'll be using the money.",

      "text": "Well, here are some vague answers (4 billion over 15ish years I guess seems a bit larger than the 1.5 billion over like 7ish I guess):  [https://news.emory.edu/stories/2021/10/er\\_2O36\\_campaign\\_launch/campus.html](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2021/10/er_2O36_campaign_launch/campus.html)\n\nI'll let y'all fill in the details as I'm definitely not gonna be there all the way from the other side of the country for no homecoming stuff.  To make UGs \"thrive\", they'll be needing more than financial aid, more/nicer dorms, and support (academic/mental health, whatever) resources though.  They need to invest in current and new undergraduate programs so that they are good enough to actually make Emory students even more competitive than those not only at near peers but the next tier up.  Sadly part of that will involve getting students to buy into having \"better\"(which often means more intensive or with things like research requirements and capstones included along with other characteristics really only common among the very top private schools in the U.S.) programs which is not what most would actually want I don't think.\n\nMost people, whether they'd admit it or not, just want some of an admissions selectivity and yield momentum based ranking boost versus an actual change in the academic environment that would result in a serious upward trajectory (that extends beyond USNWR metrics) because they already find Emory not fun or stressful.\n\nThe secret about schools in that super elite tier is that very few students at schools in Emory's tier actually wants them to become like the HYSM crew whether they had those a 1st choice or not.  Having undergraduate programs at the calibre of those places comes at a cost. Sure they have even more \"grade inflation\" but generally their most visible and successful programs are extremely intensive in terms of what is taught, the level of depth, and how early in the career even their \"average\" (so not just those opting into honors/accelerated options) students are introduced to certain material/problem solving methods than private and public schools in the 13-30ish range of USNWR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish them the best of luck.  It'll probably have to involve changes in recruitment strategy as well because it'll take more than just higher SATs/ACTs and GPA (which are damned near maxed out already) to facilitate any of the more serious stuff on the undergraduate front.  They can probably start throwing up more dorms and crap tommorrow if they wanted to because that is easier than doing things that require cultural changes.  That decision with the graduate housing was awfully fast!",
