  "text": "So, I got rejected from my first choice I had listed on the nms thing for finalists and plan on switching it to Emory, which I believe gets you 2000/year. I also won the one time 2500 scholarship from nms. Will these two conflict with each other?",

      "text": "I looked on the NMSC student guide, and it says, \"No student can receive more than one monetary award from NMSC.\"  Although the scholarship is technically sponsored by Emory, I think it still counts as an award from NMSC since it's through the organization.\n\nI'm guessing that you wouldn't get the $2500, but this is honestly a question better suited for NMSC.  I would call/email them to ask and make sure.  The number they have listed is (847) 866-5100.  Hope that helps!",
