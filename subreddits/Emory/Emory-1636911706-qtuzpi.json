I completed all my GERs and pre-BBA courses, and the only classes I'm finding on the atlas are either 300+ level or sound really boring to me. I'm a first-year so a lot of the courses are already filled up by the time we register (tomorrow). Would appreciate any recommendations!",

              "text": "They allowed you to bring in credits to count as the 3 Continued Writings and the \"diversity\" requirement? Was this from a 4 year university with similar gen. eds?  And I don't know what petty person is downvoting what was simply an informational response.  If anything, people need to know what you did so that future prospective students can exploit it (if they are situated to do so) despite the fact that I am pro many of Emory's GERs (like I think learning to write in different disciplines and do like a research paper at the college/specifically Emory level is good for even STEM and business majors).  Also, if you have maxed out GERs using this method, do NOT go by course title(or even description) to decide whether you think you'll be interested.  You should have enough room in the schedule to mainly consider professors at this point.  Maybe take some \"Emory classics\" professors in areas outside of STEM.  There are plenty in disciplines like English, History, Political Science, African American Studies, etc.  And these professors can make you interested in things you didn't think you would be.  Despite all those credits and being pre-BBA, just keep an open mind.",

                      "text": "That's cool, but you said you were looking for interesting classes, and are in a position to use a CWR as one of them (might double dip into whatever couple or one course you are missing).  I think I, even as a double STEM major, took more than the required number of CWRs and maybe only one of them was in STEM (pchem lab I think).   There were a lot of good classes or professors teaching them that made it worth while. And people are generally happier towards the end of spring semester because of the weather and festivities so completing the major assignment usually feels less burdensome.  I wonder if any of the 200/300 level history courses with no pre-reqs are available because I know they are pretty small.  I was gonna recommend the new version of Arab-Israeli Conflict but I think they made it seminar style so it may be closed.",
