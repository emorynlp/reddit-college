  "text": "Hello, I will be attending Oxford College this fall as a freshman. I've been looking online and I can't get a clear answer as to whether there is an established International Studies major available at Oxford. I figure that if not, I can construct one since it's available at main, but I'd like to know, do any Oxford students know of people who majored in International studies? Also, how do I get on a pre-law track? I emailed my advisor about both but it's been weeks and she hasn't responded. Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "I think you may have a misunderstanding about how oxford academics are structured because this question seems nonsensical. You don't have a Oxford major distinct from your emory major. You get an AA degree from Oxford but it's not specialized. International studies at Emory University (oxford or main campus makes no difference) is an interdisciplinary major based in the Political Science department, and many of the required courses, particularly intro ones are offered at Oxford so you will can get to main campus and be at the same stage as emory college int. studies majors in your year. Hope that helps?",

              "text": "How many others are focusing on International Studies varies year to year. The political science and international studies majors at Emory University are very similar. Main differences are whether you want to take US politics and the foreign language requirement. That said functioning curriculum is available at oxford in the sense that you can certainly take your foundational major courses. You could likely also take a couple major-eligible electives, or you can focus on completing your GER. Either way, you'll be on track when you arrive at the Atlanta campus",
