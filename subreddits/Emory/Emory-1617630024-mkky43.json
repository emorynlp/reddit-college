      "text": "Hi :) Congrats on your acceptance! I went to Oxford (currently a junior in ATL) and am an English/CW major and polisci minor, pre-law. So far, the Eng/CW department has been great. I took Jericho Brown's intermediate poetry workshop last semester and it was amazing. I agree with the point that there are both good and \"eh\" English classes. There seem to be a lot of options, though. The Eng/CW department in ATL also hosts many events, some of which you'll be required to attend as a CW major. The major requirements can be a little vague (you need a couple prose classes, poetry, pre-19th century, etc.) so make sure you keep track of your classes and which requirements they fulfill, to make sure you're on the right track.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that once you get to the Atlanta campus, you'll have to take one creative writing workshop per semester (can't take more than one, at least to my knowledge). So, this might make it difficult if you're considering graduating early. Oxford doesn't have many English profs, and only one CW prof (at least while I was there). I'd definitely recommend taking the Intro to Creative Writing class with Dr. Wright while at Oxford as your first workshop. I also enjoyed Dr. Ivey's class on African American women writers. Hope this helps!",

The social scene is one thing I\u2019m concerned abt (as an Oxford admit), and I feel like it could be tough to make friends with kids who started at Emory. I know you know everyone from Oxford, but have you felt pretty limited to those people at the atl campus, or do you feel like it\u2019s easy to make friends w kids who started in atl? Hopefully that makes at least some sense lol",

Also if you\u2019re interested, getting involved with Greek life (or having friends in Greek life, like I did) is a great way to get away from Ox for a bit and meet new people. My bf is in a fraternity and also recommends this. Basically, try to make friends in Atlanta early on so you can have some connections before you arrive.",

      "text": "I was an English major for my first three semesters at Ox and my first sem at Emory (graduated early). Honestly, I had a very \u201cmeh\u201d experience. My first advisor didn\u2019t respond to my initial introductory email and then upon checking OPUS a few months later my advisor had switched (without my knowledge). My next advisor was fine, but it was an odd experience to say the least.\n\nThe classes can be very good, but it depends on what you\u2019re interested in. I have 0 experience with the CW dept, but the English department is a mixed bag. At Oxford, some of my English classes felt like high school discussions, while others were actually at the college level. At Oxford it can be tough because since the faculty is so small, so you\u2019ll likely end up taking classes about Shakespeare/Early Modern period, AfAm Lit, comic books, and/or Victorian literature. I ended up liking the Shakespeare far more than I anticipated, so it\u2019s not entirely bad. I eventually switched to the Comp Lit major because I found non-English literature and interdisciplinary studies more interesting. We have meetings with our cohorts in the CPLT major and I feel like the faculty is much more invested in their students then the English dept ever was. Overall, the English, CPLT, and CW departments are all good, it just depends on your interests. That\u2019s just my two cents.",
