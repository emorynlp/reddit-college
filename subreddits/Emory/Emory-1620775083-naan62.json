      "text": "There are research opportunities in Oxford for all disciplines, but similar to research in ECAS, you will likely need to take the initiative and find them. Oxford has their own version of SURE and Dr. Smith in the biology department runs a cancer biology research course. I suggest building relationships with professors and inquiring about research to see if you can find a mentor. Plenty of Oxford students also participate in the summer research experiences at other institutions as well, so that's a great option to look into early.\n\nWhen you transition to the Atlanta campus there are lots of opportunities but again, you'll have to seek them out. Cold emailing, asking an advisor, talking to professors, etc are strategies I've heard. There are student research ambassadors that you could speak to, too. You could also apply to the SIRE program at the end of your sophomore year, which is a research experience aimed at people with minimal research exposure to work with a mentor and present their findings at the spring research symposium.\n\nIf you want more tips getting started in research I'd be happy to speak with anyone/refer to a friend!",
