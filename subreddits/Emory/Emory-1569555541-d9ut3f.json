  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at Georgia State, looking into transferring to Emory after my first year here at GSU, majoring in chemistry. How difficult is it to transfer into Emory after just one year at another 4 year college? Will they be taking my SAT scores into consideration if I maintain a 4.0 GPA and had high grades in my AP classes in highschool?",

      "text": "Yes, they\u2019ll still look at your test scores unless you\u2019ve completed two full semester at the time of applying (so basically in your first semester of sophomore year or later). I think the transfer admission rate last year was ~20%, they accept about 100 transfer students every year (only in the Fall). If you had great grades in college & high school and your ECs/recs/essays are good, that might make up for mediocre test scores. How low of an SAT are you talking?",

              "text": "That is a solid test score (despite being a bit lower than freshmen mean/medians.  It shows that you can likely handle a top tier school).  Do keep in mind Emory's chemistry curriculum which you may or may not know about. GSU, like all USG schools has a standard general chemistry sequence.  So if you are taking that this year, note that Emory will likely advise you to take its version of gen. chem 2 (which is like half organic chemistry) if you are admitted and decide to enroll.  So you'll basically lose that credit and be behind a class in the chem major.  Just be aware of that.",
