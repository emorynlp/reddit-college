      "text": "1. From what I've been told by upperclassmen some professors might not be allowing undergrads into their labs this year, but that doesn't mean not to still reach out\n2. If you're just planning on emailing a bunch of profs with a generic email you're going to get ignored. One of my friends is a research coordinator at a major research university and one of his jobs is to interview and train new undergrad researchers. His BIGGEST pet peeve is quote \"all the fucking pre-meds who clearly haven't even read what we do but email me asking to participate because it'll help me get into med school\" Don't do research because you think it'll help you check off boxes. Find a project you're actually interested in.",

      "text": "There are a few approaches I used to find a lab. \n\nFirst lab was through cold emailing. I just looked up labs that were doing research I found interested and skimmed through a few of their more recent articles. Didn\u2019t suck up with it, but just said \u201cI am interested in x,y, &z. Do you have any open positions or know of any?\u201d Got ignored a few times but ended up in a pretty prestigious lab by pure luck. \n\nFew semesters later I found a professor I really liked with and would occasionally ask about his research in office hours, eventually asked if he knew of any positions that were taking on undergrads. \n\nLastly I had a friend graduating who was a lab tech for another lab, and she got me in to take over for her when she was leaving. That was nice because it was paid, but also got a few grants to pay me to be a research intern over the summer. \n\nBasically as long as you\u2019re proactive you\u2019ll be able to find something. Might be a bit harder in times of COVID, but persistence is a virtue.",

      "text": "I think cold emailing is totally acceptable, as long as you\u2019re writing a good email. Make sure you\u2019ve researched the lab/PI you\u2019re interested in and reference some of their work that you\u2019ve read and how it relates to your interests. Like another poster said\u2014 don\u2019t just cold email because you\u2019re pre-med and need research experience. Try to find labs that are actually compatible with your interests. \nBut that\u2019s when the world is normal. I\u2019d be really surprised if you can find anyone to take you (are you an incoming student? Underclassman?) right now. Onboarding someone into a lab can be a lot of work, and finding remote work for a new student would be fairly difficult. If you\u2019re an incoming student, personally I\u2019d say don\u2019t stress about it right now. Next semester or next year you\u2019re likely to have better luck. But then again, it can\u2019t hurt to email.",
