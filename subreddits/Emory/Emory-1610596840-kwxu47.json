  "text": "How is the gym at Emory. I know there is a separate weight room for athletes, but I'm interested in the equipment outside of that room since I am not going to be doing any sports. \n\nIs the equipment outside of the weight room any good? I'm into powerlifting so I was wondering if there are any squat racks or benches to use.",
