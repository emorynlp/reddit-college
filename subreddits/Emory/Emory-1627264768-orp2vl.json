      "text": "1. I'll let people in the b-school comment on this one.  I appreciate and love to many things about Emory generally to list but my experience was in ECAS.\n2. I kind of don't get that 2nd question because really only a handful of \"more prestigious\" schools have significantly different outcomes from Emory (and when you talk business schools, despite not being some crazy WS feeder, it appears that salaries of BBA grads are very similar to b-schools that feed more heavily to them so....I don't know what that means other than Emory BBAs managing to get paid well via a variety of employers and fields) that is due to prestige (I'm talking your HYPSM level schools and maybe a couple more in the top 10).  Emory has been performing well (even better than some schools) in terms outcomes and award winning students about as well as several peers between 11 and 25.  So it isn't like anyone can be in a position to \"regret\" or \"miss out\" from that tier of school because so few people gain admissions to that special group (there are exceptions like Georgetown which is just historically well-connected to certain career spaces so far outperforms any prestige or rank assigned to it.  Same with a place like Georgia Tech)\n\nThe difference comes (or at least should) from the lack of engineering yet Emory's salaries and outcomes (oddly enough, Emory somehow got 4 Goldwaters for the past 3 years and they were basically all life sciences when engineering and physical sciences at other schools should make winning it much more easy because they tend to avoid the \"looks kind of a pre-med\" applicants) run awfully close to many in the T20 WITH engineering schools. Emory can improve but I don't know if being a bigger WS IB feeder would be considered an improvement if students can get the same amount of money from elsewhere, plus the QTM is likely gonna grow the amount of students that become more competive for quant leaning jobs.\n\n3. Lack of school spirit and the continuance of blaming lack of D1 sports or engagement with our sports teams for it.  There are other ways to develop new traditions and spirit generating events IF the student body (or individuals within it) was more creative and less driven by either what everyone else does/what is already pre-organized or in place (need more spontaneity at Emory) or what happens at other schools (like being quirky, nerdy, intellectual and/or weird can be okay in a D3, more academic leaning environment.  If someone made Dooley into a thing, hopefully 21st Century students can think of other ideas.  Emory seems to recruit too many who instead of building their own stuff would rather dream up a different reality where it became a big Greek and Sports private like Tulane, Miami, VU, or something)  There are plenty of D3 LACs and Research Us that have a lot of spirit or interesting traditions that fit the interests of their student body, the academic environment, etc.  And there are also D1s, like many Ivies, that have traditions that don't center sports whatsoever that are likely a bigger deal than any sports rivalries or events.  Perhaps one way to solve this would be for Emory to have more coherent residence life programs that not only build in reshall community but also engages other reshalls (via competitions and all types of get-togethers, parties, whatever. Get the reshalls a real sense of identity beyond just songfest).",

              "text": "It was ALWAYS close to the WS feeders.  Thus there is no point in obsessing over the WS stuff. Whoever wants to do that should position themselves to put in a competitive application and then ready themselves for the interview process. Period.  Any change in \"feeding\" represents increased or decreased interest from Emory students vs. Past cohorts. It isn't like recruiters are just suddenly waking up to some Emory magic or some non-sense.  You have to want it and be very good sans nepotism and/other connections.",

Most B students didn't care about that, but you might.\n\nBTW you can major in anything you want and get in an MBA program. I did. Just putting in another plug for things like LA and science.
