  "text": "\nI\u2019m (21M) an EMT, graduating paramedic school in December from a local community college. I\u2019ll have an associate\u2019s degree, which I\u2019ll plan on turning into a bachelor\u2019s before trying my luck at higher education in medicine. Since I work 80+ hours a week and in shifts that often exceed 48 hours, I\u2019m limited in terms of free time, but I use my downtime on shift to study between 911 calls. \nMy paramedic classes are in person, and I took A&P I and II in person as well. However, I\u2019d prefer to take electives and other less relevant classes online, so that I can keep coming to work and treating patients. I\u2019d still like to take chemistry and other biology courses in person, since I learn far better that way. \nI\u2019m excelling in college so far and have yet to make less than an A in the two years I\u2019ve been a student. I love emergency medicine, and I\u2019m confident in my ability to continue my education. I just don\u2019t want to leave the ambulance for the classroom just yet if I don\u2019t have to.",

      "text": "Are you at Emory/applying to Emory?\n\nRegardless, will your degree say it's online? Will the courses say it's online? No? Then they won't know/care.\n\nHowever, at Emory, a course being online is entirely dependent on the professor. I am accustomed to online classes, I have only one in-person class this semester at Emory because of chance and course selection. Four of my prereqs prior to this have been online because I either had no choice/it was the best choice. No one will know it was online but myself (or for obvious reasons such as the pandemic).\n\nBe prepared to not have your way, but otherwise it's a good strategy to have electives online and get a great GPA.",
