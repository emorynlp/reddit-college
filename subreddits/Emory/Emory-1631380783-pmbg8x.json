      "text": "Yeah I've done it multiple times at the cul de sac on Clairmont campus. It's fairly simple, just make sure not to order more than you can carry at once or bring friends to carry any extra load. It's usually reliable and they come on time so no need to worry about that, you can even schedule the instacart to come at a time you want. If you have any more specific questions let me know!",
