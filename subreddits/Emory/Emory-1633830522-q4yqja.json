  "text": "Any course would be appreciated!\n\nRegistration for Spring 2022 is soon, and because SPAN 212 is my first class to satisfy HAL, I still need another SPAN 3XX for graduation. However, the 3XX all seem super difficult... Wonder if anyone who had taken a SPAN 3XX in the past could share the syllabus? Or do you know if asking the department would help? Thanks!",
