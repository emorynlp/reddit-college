  "text": "hey everyone! i\u2019m not sure if this subreddit is the right place for my post, but i figured i\u2019d see if anyone has some advice anyway. i\u2019m a current second-year at UGA (majoring in art history and journalism) and am currently waiting to hear back on my acceptance to emory as a transfer. i\u2019m considering transferring partially because i\u2019ve found UGA\u2019s humanities programs to be rather limited, especially in my art history major. i\u2019ve struggled with finding research opportunities and internships, as well as just getting classes i need. for some context, i\u2019ve taken the equivalent of six semesters of ARHI courses and still don\u2019t have the required prerequisites to officially \u201cjoin\u201d the major because a few classes i need haven\u2019t been offered any of the four semesters i\u2019ve been at UGA. i\u2019ve also struggled with the social atmosphere here, greek life isn\u2019t really my thing (although, just from scoping out a few of emory\u2019s sororities, it looks much more inclusive there) and i don\u2019t really care about sports, so it\u2019s been hard for me to find a niche and feel really comfortable going out and making friends organically. \ni\u2019m hoping someone here can speak to the differences between emory as a small private school and UGA as a huge state school and the benefits of transferring, why you chose emory, and your experience so far. \nanything is really appreciated because i\u2019m having trouble deciding whether to stay at UGA or transfer to emory once i know if i\u2019m accepted :)\n\nupdate: i got in!",

There are lots of research opportunities, and the history department is pretty good. Greek life is present but not overwhelming like state schools, and emory tends to have a nerdier vibe than schools like UGA",
