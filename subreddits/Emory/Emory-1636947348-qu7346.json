All I can say is that at least Carr was a lecturer, while this Kobin person is a post-doc so may be less committed to teaching which could be a problem if the course is indeed standardized (or run by Carr behind the scenes) and is as intense as it was with Carr.",

      "text": "I\u2019m currently taking MATH221 with him. Hands down one of the best math professors I\u2019ve had. He gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit and after each week, you can fill out a short reflection thing on canvas about what is going great and what is not going great in class. He reads all of them and makes good changes to the class based off of it. The quizzes are straightforward and definitely fair game and you will do well if you show up to lectures and do hw. Hw isn\u2019t graded but it\u2019s good to do because it\u2019s practice for the quiz. His tests are straight forward and he curves the average to around low B/ high C. He\u2019s a nice down to earth guy and will explain things again if you ask him to. I highly recommend.",
