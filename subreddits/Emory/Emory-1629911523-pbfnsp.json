  "title:": "Leaving with stuff from the DCT",
  "text": "I was a freshman last year and because it was takeout, we were welcome to take food from the DCT. I'm confused with the switchover to sitting down what we are allowed to take. Am I allowed to fill a reusable water bottle up with milk to take back to my dorm with me? I've never seen anyone fill something up that wasnt a provided glass. I guess I just dont want to be yelled at by a DCT worker.\n\nIf anybody has done this or seen someone do this or know the rule on it, please let me know!",
