  "text": "As someone applying as a first year student I just wanted to know how competitive the dual degree with Georgia tech for engineering is compared to a standard engineering program like engineering sciences \n\nMy gpa is a 3.75 and my sat is 1450 with a 39/45 IB predicted score and good ecs (2 internships, 2 research papers, 1 publication, varsity athletics and decent guitar player)\n\nIt\u2019ll also be helpful to know how easy/difficuly it is to transfer to the dual program once admitted in a standard engineering program",

      "text": "Oh man here we go.\n\nFirst, get into Emory. Your HS stats only matter for getting into a school. Once you get into Emory, just forget about everything you did. None of your high school crap matters once you're in college. Ever. (Life pro tip, none of what you do in college matters once you enter the work force, too, unless you're applying to graduate/professional schools).\n\nIf you can't do the first paragraph, none of the rest of what I'm going to say matters. So secure the acceptance to Emory first.\n\nOnce you're in, get a respectable GPA at Emory while completing the prerequisite courses for the engineering program you want to finish. GPA should be minimum 3.3 (mechanical, electrical, computer, industrial, chemical, and biomolecular) or 3.0 depending on the engineering field. This is the *minimum* and by far most people who want to do this end up getting higher GPAs. You also have to complete Emory general ed requirements along the way, minus one writing course (hurray?).\n\nIf you have the courses and the GPA, really... dude nothing is stopping you from completing the program except yourself. And this, folks, is the exact reason why people don't ever finish this program. They think they can, and they think they won't burn out or they can spin some purpose of why they're getting dual degrees... but eventually they just don't finish. The hard part is finishing it, not getting approved to do it.\n\nAlso, Emory's engineering sciences is not a \"standard engineering\" program. If you want that, apply to Georgia Tech. Emory doesn't offer engineering degrees. Engineering Sciences can prepare you to complete a master's in engineering if you want, but it's really a physics/materials/geoscience degree.",

          "text": "Thank you so much this was really helpful!!\nJust another question \nthere is an option to apply for this course directly as well on the common app and get in with the dual program \nIs it more difficult to get in through this program or through engineering sciences and then transfer\n\nAlso would it be possible to get me in touch with someone who is doing this program so I have a better idea of exactly how difficult it is \n\nOnce again thank you so so much!!",

              "text": "Whatever major you put in the common app doesn't matter. Everybody comes into Emory undeclared (no major) and you don't have to be a specific major to do the dual degree program. Obviously, it would help if your major *also* needs to complete the courses for the engineering side (for example, math or chemistry) but it's not needed. You could declare art history and then transfer to do engineering.\n\nSo no, whether or not you put it on your common app doesn't matter. You have to apply for it separately once you're at Emory. Sorry I don't know anyone doing the program right now. The difficulty is based on the major you choose at Emory and the engineering you choose at Tech.",

              "text": "You can go through the admissions site and maybe find a rare unicorn doing it or something(there is this \"contact an Emory student option), but it isn't difficult to imagine why it's hard. Imagine cramming an Emory major (where tons of them have way more scaffolding and are more prescribed than at peer universities for better or worse) and squeezing pre-engineering physics and math pre-reqs (I recommend you use every AP credit possible] to graduate in 3 years. That means pretty heavy courseloads per semester.\n\n  And when you get to Tech you are basically trying to cram an entire (also unit heavy and highly prescribed) engineering major into like 2 years while also maximizing professional development access like co-ops.  It's just highly unlikely and you need to be open to doing more than 5 years of college.  Many who attend these highly selective schools aren't.  Now compare this to going straight to an engineering program/school where you can spread out foundational basic STEMs and engineering major specific classes over 4ish years.  Just think about it...",
