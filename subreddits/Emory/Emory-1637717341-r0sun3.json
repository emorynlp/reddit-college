  "text": "i\u2019m a first year right now living in a dorm with where lofted beds are the only option, and i might have to have hip surgery over winter break. in that case, i wouldn\u2019t be able to climb up to my bed. does emory allowed for temporary dorm switches to a single until i\u2019m able to climb again, or would i have to switch dorms for the whole semester? i love my roommates and my dorms and would hate to switch out. i can delay the surgery until may, and i\u2019m honestly considering that so i don\u2019t have to do recovery at school and leave my current dorm room.",
