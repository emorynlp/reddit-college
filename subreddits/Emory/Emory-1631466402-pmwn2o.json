  "text": "Hi, I am a senior and am very interested in Emory. I think I would have a pretty decent shot at getting in, but I have some questions about the social scene. How prevalent is Greek life at Emory? I am not  interested in joining a frat, but would still like to have a robust social scene and go to parties.",

      "text": "Always varied between 20-35%  (been around 25-30% lately) which is substantial.  I'm personally no fan and there is plenty to do in the Atlanta area if able and willing to leave campus, but I also wouldn't write off joining it if you are basically already saying it kind of needs to be there as a venue for you to enjoy. Lots of people claim they aren't interested as prospective students and end up joining so keep an open mind.  There is likely an org that fits your personality (Don't feel pressure to join a \"top\" anything if the group doesn't seem like a fit).\n\nUnfortunately it has been like 2 years since a grade report was made public (makes sense because online classes naturally had much higher grades on average so it isn't as useful or representative), but I was pretty close if the trend remains stable:  https://osfl.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/current-members/Spring2019OverallCommunityStatistics.pdf\n\nAround 25ish %",

And wow that campus life website needs work I guess!\n\nAnd damn, they really just did give mostly A/A-/B+ during COVID as I expected. Yikes! It'll be painful if grading goes anywhere back close to normal.  COVID online was like a 0.2-0.3 spike at least",
