  "text": "The current classes I\u2019m taking are: Chem 203, Biol 141, Psyc 205, and Soc 101. If I were to drop a class, it would probably be intro to sociology. I was just wondering, if I\u2019m premed would it look bad if I took a light course load for the fall? Not sure if I want to yet but some reasons would be:\n\n- I want to focus on chem/bio.\n- I want to be involved in more activities on and off-campus without being stressed.\n- I want to get adjusted to the normal difficulty of classes.\n- I want to do a lot of social stuff and have a typical college experience for one semester.\n\nA part of me feels like I\u2019d be missing out only taking 3 classes though too and that I\u2019d feel better being in 4. Also, soc 101 isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s not a difficult class and I\u2019d only save *some* time by dropping it. Not a huge amount. Just an idea that was floating in my head and was curious as to what other people thought.",

      "text": "You obviously have some good reasons not to take 16 credits. That's not 4 classes, that's actually 6 (don't count lab out as a whole course). Don't sell yourself short. There's a reason 12 credits is considered full-time and that's what it is. It's going to take more or less a full schedule. There's nothing wrong with 12 or 13 and using your spare time to enjoy college or do ECs, while having time for yourself. Those who can do more are sacrificing other things to be able to do so, trust me. It may seem like they can do everything when taking 19-22 credits while doing ECs, but something was given up for sure.\n\nOn the other hand, SOC 101 is not that difficult. It's also not really a requirement for medical school, only for MCAT. You can self-study that portion along with psychology no problem without taking the course. Still, medical school requires humanities and social sciences courses of any nature, so I recommend broadening your options. \n\nAnthropology is also an interesting field, I would consider that. I always thought intro sociology courses were too demographic-based and I find that reading scientific papers researching self-identified demographics/identities are unreliable. That's just me, though. Find a course that's interesting to you and it won't start to seem like work.",

          "text": "What you\u2019re saying makes sense. I actually took 17 and 18 credits the first and second semester. I feel like it was really doable because everything was online though and there was less stuff to do on campus. That\u2019s another reason why I\u2019m a little concerned too, changing the amount of credits I usually take. On a side note, I\u2019m also taking 9 credits over the summer so I don\u2019t have to worry about falling behind since I\u2019ll be starting with 47 in the fall (I have an extra 3 from AP credit).\n\nI\u2019m a psychology major so I\u2019ve already got the social science prereqs for the MCAT covered haha. I took two anthropology classes last semester and they were pretty fun, but I feel like I\u2019d rather take something else. And it\u2019s not like sociology feels like work \u2014 in fact, I enjoy learning about a lot of things. It\u2019s just that an additional class requires *time*, time that I would rather put in something else at the moment. I would feel the same way if there was a class where I had to learn about Valorant and play it for homework. It\u2019d be fun, I\u2019d just want to try out doing more non-academic things and focus on core classes, you know?\n\nAnd sociology wouldn\u2019t really count towards anything. I just thought it\u2019d be a fun class to add since the other classes for my major/minor were all full.",

              "text": "1) Who are you taking for 203?\n2) Can you maybe find a nice and easy 2-3 credit class so that you have a cushion to stay full time in terms of credit hours in case something goes awry and you say...find yourself really needing to double down on ochem and bio (you can choose a 3 hour to drop if too much and then stay full-time).  Like definitely consider this if taking Weinschenk (you may also find that you may keep and use the last course as a slight GPA buffer in case it doesn't go the way you want).\n\nI understand that you'll definitely be adjusting to the style, rigor and exam weightings of in person courses but I think the other courses you have are super doable (even, if not especially, in person because it seems that many historically easy non-STEM classes had a higher work load during Covid by adding a sort of busy work component that they thought would help folks stay immersed.  During the year some of these were sort of happy go lucky lecture based courses with a few spaced out assignments and simple exams).\n\nAnd don't worry about \"looking bad\".  As long as you sort of ramp it up later and do well in those courses, you'll be fine.  Add the 4th course because YOU wanna try a regular course load, wanna learn something else, or because you want the additional course as a protective measure. The only time I worry about how things \"look\" is if you constantly avoid doubling in sciences, take lowish credit hours, or seriously abuse (like more than one sequence. Definitely more than 2) the summer option for pre-med core requirements.",

And it\u2019s interesting that you said they\u2019d be easier, I honestly thought it\u2019d be the opposite, or at least take more time overall. I guess one thing that\u2019d be harder is that there probably aren\u2019t open-book exams, which means I\u2019d have to maybe study for them now.\n\nThere\u2019s a 2 credit online health class, but I\u2019d have to move around my bio lab so don\u2019t want to take it. There\u2019s also a bioethics class, but it\u2019s closed right now and is opening up for freshmen. Might be able to get it during the next a/d/s and it should be a little easier because there\u2019d be no exams. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be dropping chem or bio though. I really just want to get it over with my sophomore year and focus on other classes junior year.\n\nMy overall gpa is pretty good so not worried about a B or a B+ tanking it too much. I\u2019m more worried about my science gpa. My overall gpa is a 3.9, sGPA a 3.7, and non-science gpa a 4.0. I don\u2019t like to think about gpa too much though. I just like to try my best and see what happens and not worry about it unless it becomes a big issue.\n\nEDIT: actually might take the hlth class because it turns out it\u2019s in-person once a week and bio lab would be easy to switch. Doesn\u2019t seem too difficult.",

                      "text": "Usually open book exams in historically simple classes are made harder than the corresponding closed book. The sciences went a different direction likely because they saw students weren't in the mode to handle even normal rigor exams whereas for most social sciences and humanities, exams tend to be sort of like checkups in a normal year and writing assignments are the real assessment so they could make exams a little harder (at least when open book) without adding much stress. \n\nAnd your GPA is fine. Remember that everyone is in the same boat as you in this adjustment and I think you said you took McGill(?) which may make transitioning to Weinschenk a bit easier than those who took online sections (she is better at emphasizing the concepts and gave more structure and mechanism focused group Qs and exam questions).  \n\nAnd then you'll probably be fine in bio since you did well in chemistry both semesters (it'll make 141 concepts much easier to understand than freshmen who are just taking chemistry. And then by time you hit metabolism-glycolysis, TCA, etc you may even have enough knowledge from 203 to do more than just memorize the pathways. You'll understand the chemistry behind many of the transformations in them).  An ochem bio combo can actually be really nice because you may find that you can draw surprising connections (a useful thing to do for the MCAT).",

                              "text": "Isn't this 16 credits even before health?  I thought bio and chem w/the labs were 5 a piece and then soc.  and psych 3 a piece. You can add the health.  And my advice for a research paper that short is to try to plan ahead and spread it out (sounds simple I know-but phase in different aspects of the paper almost like it is one of the CWR classes).  203 will mostly be self-paced studying and p-sets vs. a bunch of graded stuff like Aleks, quizzes, GQs in 150/202 so you should be able to find time to ensure that paper doesn't sneak up on you. \n\nMy understanding is that bio is now more designed like chem than it used to be (with Mastering Bio, quizzes, etc) and has a constant workload but most do well if they just keep up (bio 141 tends to give a lot more low level questions on assessments anyway which means you just need to know a lot but not necessarily that deeply until you get near the middle/end of the course when things get more conceptual than detail oriented).\n\n\n*Either way the schedule looks fine. One trick with ochem is to maybe just try to do like 30 minutes-1 hour per lecture some time before the next lecture. What worked for me was reviewing ALL lectures as I went along (so some sessions would take longer).  So if there are 2 lectures your first week (I doubt cause Emory usually starts on Wednesdays but just go with it). Review lecture 1 on wednesday (next class thursday) and then both in one sitting before the next tuesday, and then all 3 in one sitting before thursday, and so on (and of course do W's lecture note/QTP problems as soon as you can). \n\n I just recommend this because making connections between reactions and concepts between lectures is very important in 203 vs. 150 and 202 where topics weren't always the most coherent in progression, and where truly multi-concept/deep thinking exam problems weren't common. And another goal is to be in a position to be able to try OYO psets as soon as they come out and maybe even try to derive the problem types that he hasn't explicitly taught the concepts for as that practice mimics what you'll need to do for harder exam items.",
