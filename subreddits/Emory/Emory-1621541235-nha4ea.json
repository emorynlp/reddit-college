Favorite course at Emory for some, you\u2019ll get an A if you participate and put even some effort into reflections. Personally left me feeling better after every class I went to, and assignments and reflections legitimately made me happier, especially through a virtual semester. Highest rated course at Emory (or at least tied with a 5) on RateMyProfessor if that means anything to you. Waitlist is routinely like 60 people long though so you may need to wait until senior year (I know OP is a senior, but others interested might not be). It counts as continued writing requirement too.",

If you're not well-versed in java, I'd take CS 170. \n\nThe course is hard and a lot of work, but it definitely does drill down some programming basics. It will prepare you well for programming courses to come, but if you feel like you had a really strong understanding of your AP CS class, you might be able to work hard at the beginning of 171 and get by without it. \n\nCS 171 spends about one hour reviewing programming basics before diving into more complex concepts like coding  sorting algorithms and data structures like stacks and queues. If you need a refresher on any of the fundamental syntax aspects of java, or on recursion, then you should probably take 170. \n\n I, a first semester freshman who had never coded before, was able to BARELY scrape an A. You need a 93.3 to get an A in the class and I got a 93.39. Had to fight for every point.",

A lot of the time we work in investment firms or banking, others manage money for any given company on the planet. Sometimes we oversee supply chains or develop strategies for marketing, product development, or any other aspect of business. \n\nAccountants, data scientists, analysts, and consultants are a few job titles that a lot of business majors take on. \n\nMy career plan specifically is a little vague as I'm not all that ambitious or focused on climbing the corporate ladder. Most  companies hire at least a business major or two to manage money or perform analytics, so I'd like to do that at a company that does something I'm passionate about.

Clearly they are turning the business major into something at some schools. There are many schools where it is sort of known to be a default major and the student outcomes show it.",
