  "text": "Uhhhh so I applied for a program that\u2019s sending out free condoms (500) and I need to distribute them for the upcoming spring semester. I have 250 set away for my school (don\u2019t go to GT and we have a surplus already) and 250 that I need to distribute to the local college community as part of the agreement. \nBrands include Trojan (various sizes), Durex, Lifestyles, etc. Can anyone use them? Or any organizations? The reproductive / health clubs at my school are not running so I have limited access to other intracollege organizations at this time. \n\nLink to the initiative: https://www.advocatesforyouth.org/campaigns/the-condom-collective/",
