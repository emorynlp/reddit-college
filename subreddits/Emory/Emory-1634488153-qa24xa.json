  "text": "I\u2019m a high school senior working on refining my college list and was wondering if any current Emory students or recent alumnae could give me their take on Emory. I\u2019m attracted to Emory because I\u2019m interested in publishing and journalism and it seems like there are many opportunities to combine art, media, and English. I was particularly interested in the integrated visual arts and the English and Creative Writing departments.\n\nI\u2019m from the West Coast and am also curious about what the transition from here to Atlanta might be like.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "A huge thing about the English & Creative Writing major is you only have to take 2 classes per semester (a writing workshop and a 300-level english class) to meet the major requirements!  This gives you a TON of space in your schedule to explore other subjects or double major in something else without overloading.  \n\nThe Creative Writing department has been amazing for me.  Classes are 15 students, so your professor knows you and your writing and there are so many opportunities to make connections with your peers/professors.  The faculty is insanely talented and devoted to their craft and, so far, they've all been sensitive and supportive teachers who have improved my writing so much.  There are tons of out-of-class writing-related opportunities like readings, scholarships, etc.\n\nThe English department has been excellent for me as well--super interesting classes and great professors who care about their students.  One negative for me is that as someone who's pretty quiet, it was hard to adjust to classes that are entirely discussion-based.  Other than essays, there's not usually a lot of opportunities for engagement besides speaking in class.",

Are there any professors/ classes that have been particularly enjoyable or inspiring for you? How common is it for students to double-major? \n\nThanks for taking time to answer my questions!",

              "text": "It is super common for students to double major in the Creative Writing department; idk if I've actually met anyone who is only doing English & Creative Writing haha. \n\nI'm on the poetry track, so if you ever get the chance to take a poetry workshop with Professor Christle or Professor Schiff I would definitely recommend, even if you're more interested in fiction or nonfiction!  I haven't been as close with profs in the English department, but the ENG389 special topics classes tend to be super interesting and fun!!  Like this semester there's an environmental fiction class, and next semester there's a true crime class, just to give you an idea of what they offer.",
