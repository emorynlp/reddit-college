Basically you pick a text and you write a couple essays about it, combined with journaling about other peoples texts and some other readings. I found it really fun and pretty easy to keep on top of, and the teacher is super nice and open to offering extensions.",

Dr. Wendland grades really easily, so it should be an easy A with enough effort. Only drawback is there are more assignments than other classes because it takes some practice to learn the principles.",
