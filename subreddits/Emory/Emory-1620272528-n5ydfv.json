  "text": "Not that I am trying to cheat or anything but I know that there have been lots of cases after we moved to online learning. I am curious where/how do they obtain the evidence necessary to accuse someone of an honor code violation? I heard that there was one case accusing 80 students in a single class of cheating. Obviously it is easier to cheat now, but where is the line between academic integrity versus invasion of privacy?",
