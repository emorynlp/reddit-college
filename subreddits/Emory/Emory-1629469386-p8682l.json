I use an android tablet (because it's much cheaper) with OneNote and I love it. \n\nYou should know that some things will be easier (carrying everything) and others will be harder (flipping through notes). So know your limits and consult with your professor about your use of electronics in class if they have a policy about it.",

Any reasonable professor would agree. Of course, there are some unreasonable professors so your mileage will vary.",

              "text": "Hmmm I wonder if it's that much better given all the info. We have on the lack of efficacy of most passive lecture style environments. In many classes where the lecturer mainly just talks, people are being passive and frantically copying whether they write or type.  It may be that the yield in terms of any level of learning is so low that \"writing\" looks good in comparison even if it still sucks. I understand some stances professors take when it comes to how they run their courses but I never got this technology tyrant thing (except maybe in very large tiered auditoriums.  Other people's laptops, if not being used the course content I suppose can distract those who can see it). Let students grow up and figure out for themselves.",

Can't really do that on a laptop unless it's touchscreen or you have a drawing tablet.\n\nThis is anecdotal, but because writing is slower than typing, I find that I'm much more conscious of what I'm writing down and trying to find better, concise ways to jot down notes. I think that helps me remember content better since I'm internalizing the material as it comes in. If I'm typing, I often find myself simply transcribing what the lecturer is saying, which is easy to autopilot.",

You probably didn't believe that the purpose of lectures was to sort of sit there to just copy everything verbatim and hopefully absorb it like a sponge(either during or after the session) as if the explicit lecture content is the totality of what you should know how to do vs. An appetizer before all the stuff that needs to happen outside of class.  You're actually thinking and trying to make meaning of stuff during the session and it makes everyone else look bad! Lol\n\nOn the serious side, I.agree for many STEM courses especially. At least for the better ones that require using more than one part of your brain.",

You have to actively think and fully understand the material you're learning. College was, at least for me, a completely different beast from high school. Not just in terms of rigor, but in terms of *how* I studied. And good notetaking skills can do a lot of heavy lifting in that regard.\n\nEDIT: \"good student\" lol. I had good habits that worked in undergrad but those habits evaporated during quarantine, as evidenced by the fact that I'm on reddit and playing chess at my desk instead of focusing on my work",

Plus you can ask around to find out if specific professors have a gripe against technology (I can tell you that Campbell in biology is very pro pen+paper) and know ahead of time when you register for classes. I believe for the classes you're taking, your iPad will be just fine. Do whatever works for you!",
