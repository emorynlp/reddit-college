  "text": "hi, I'm an incoming freshman and I'm so confused. I just took this Emory essentials thing and they were like are you going to take ECCP for Chem 150? Do I even have to take Chem 150?? (I'm pre-business school). And I also took French all of high school and will continue French at Emory so do I have to take a placement test for that too? What do placement tests even do? Are there other classes with placement tests??  Help lol",

              "text": "Wait, will your career path or major require chemistry?  If it requires you to do more than 1 semester or taking bio next year or whatever, you may wanna consider taking 150. 150 is \"basic\"(but challenging because....survey STEM) and is designed to accommodate those without AP/IB.  That shouldn't hinder your success.  If you are really afraid, just fill your schedule with easier/less demanding courses to balance it out.  \n\nDefinitely don't completely forgo it on the idea that it is some impossible course only designed for those with experience to do well.  You just have to be willing to put in the work.  The 150/202 course seems to be taught so well that folks, instead of looking at it as just a weedout like it is at other schools, actually yields an unusual amount of chem. majors (despite the curriculum deviating from other schools in many ways).  \n\n*It is possible your academic path doesn't need ANY chemistry.",

                      "text": "That doesn't matter. The ECCP will fix that and put you where you need to be.  That is its purpose. Note that a lot of  the actual150 content/concepts is de-emphasized in AP so students are more or less on a similar playing field.  It is just natural that those with some exposure can kind of learn easier, but I wouldn't worry about what you forgot and all that.\n\nThe course will be at its least complex this year due to limitations of online course delivery and all of that. Get this course out of the way!  Also, it helps you understand biology better.   You want to make it so that you can avoid the core pre-med sequences during summer and can take some sort of biochem junior year (or at least before the MCAT).\n\n*Please do not view the ECCP (especially the knowledge check) as a \"performance\".  It just tells you what you may be rusty on and then ALEKS will help you fix that area.  I know people come to these schools thinking from a competitive lens and that is understandable to some extent, but intro. STEM courses should not be viewed by anyone as \"stuff I should already know, but will be tested harder than in HS\".  There is some of that, but they are designed for entering majors and pre-healths to learn however Emory feels you should understand them before you move on and that may differ from HS (even AP/IB).  With chem, they are using ECCP to put folks on a similar wavelength(pun intended) so that they can challenge you with newer/more meaningful stuff during the semester vs. just say...spending several lectures on stoichiometry, dimensional analysis, and teaching students how to do variants of math word problems.  \n \nIt allows them to focus way more on conceptual understanding and then maybe connecting it to necessary math concepts without worrying about whether students already know the basic math strategies.",

If you are scared of the first option for whatever reason (202z is kind of \"fast paced\" but the instructor covers stuff and kind of tests for a superficial level of understanding so the course is actually quite easy if you can just keep up and have some study skills.  203z goes in depth and expects much more problem solving skills in real contexts so is an adjustment from 202z but because of the tests being objectively harder, has massive scaling/curving so the course is low risk unless you just flounder), the 2nd option makes sense but be sure to review the 150 ochem stuff towards the end.  If pre-med, you'd have to take 204 anyway, so z sequence is a reasonable pathway (vs. other schools where taking freshman ochem means that you \"skip\" 2 semesters of \"inorganic/gen. chem\" so have to take a compensating inorganic course.  202z fills in as an ochem biased version of 202, Emory's \"gen. chem 2\" which blends gchem and ochem and takes a unit to transition to the ochem stuff).  \n\nIt's up to you, but I don't think they really want high pass folks from IB and AP taking 150 because they likely don't want the higher enrollment numbers.  Unless you are really rusty, they appear to recommend the z sequence.  I know \"orgo\" sounds scary, but trust when I say taking it with freshmen at least gives you are softer curve than with the sophomores and you get to be sort of eased into learning something new (again, Jui is not really trying to challenge students.  The only challenge is the pace. With McDonald, the worst that happens is you end up riding a curve which is okay. Chem midterms shouldn't be easy/have high averages if they are assessing anything useful).\n\nStraight from the chem. website:http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/courses.html\n\"Students with AP/IB credit may elect to swap CHEM202z/203z for CHEM 202/203. This accelerated track is the preferred pathway for students entering with a strong chemistry background.\" \n\nObviously for pre-meds,this would be viewed as a risk (but so should being pre-med at Emory or taking a weeder intro. like 150/202 designed to target a B- average with teachers that KNOW a huge chunk have a high pass on IB/AP.  It looks like Z targets more like a B/B+).",
