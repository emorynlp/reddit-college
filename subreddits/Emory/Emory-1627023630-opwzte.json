  "text": "just a few qs about getting around w a bike on campus\n\n1. is there kind of a guideline as to where we shouldn't be riding our bike? like i know according to georgia law you're not supposed to ride on the sidewalk but like,,, the entire campus is basically a big sidewalk lmao so i'm wondering if there's like specific places where we're advised not to ride thru or if it's kinda just a free-for-all kinda thing. sorry if this is a dumb question lol but i'm just trying to make sure i don't mess shit up i literally learned how to ride a bike a few weeks ago\n2. do most people wear helmets when riding around between classes? i feel like this question is gonna get a lot of \"better to be safe than sorry answers\" but i'm just wondering what the general consensus is. i have one and i'm not uncomfortable with wearing it but it does kinda feel unnecessary considering it's like a few-min rides between buildings\n3. are bike thefts common on campus? i'm just wondering if i should be suuuper concerned with that kinda thing or if it's not super common. i bought a pretty heavy duty lock but i just wanna know what i'm getting myself into\n\nthenks :-)",

      "text": "1. I feel like main campus you can ride anywhere, a lot of the campus space is no cars but that makes it safe/convenient for bikes. Even on roads with cars, it\u2019s fine to ride as a biker, and Emory has built in bike lanes on those roads anyways. \n\nWhen you\u2019re talking off campus and Clairmont campus, most close spots to campus are very bike friendly: closed road between haygood and Clairmont campus, side streets to Emory village, Clifton road down to Emory point, etc. \n\nI would say biking to the publix or any other nearby grocery stores is when it gets a little more unsafe as a biker. Anything about half a mile away from main campus starts to get unfriendly for biking. Taking north Decatur to Clairmont road is an example of when I\u2019d might prefer to ride on sidewalks despite the legality of it. And I\u2019d 1,000000% percent wear a helmet on any of the bigger roads off campus (Clifton, Clairmont, north Decatur, Houston mill, haygood, etc.). In fact, I might uber or take a cliff shuttle instead of biking those roads above. \n\n2. If you ride a bike from an on campus residence hall for a short ride between to an academic building, you probably don\u2019t need a helmet, and biking is just a convenience thing. \n\nRiding through lullwater park, eagle row (because of all the parking decks and cars coming in and out in a hurry), or any off campus street, I\u2019d recommend a helmet. Now, helmets are annoying I get it, but you gotta understand how important they are when biking\u2026 if someone does something stupid that causes you to fall\u2026 you gotta protect that skull.\n\n3. Get a lock. Not a big one or anything, those wire ones are sufficient. However, if your bike is not locked, it *could* disappear. I\u2019m not saying bike theft is common, I\u2019m just saying think about fun it would be for a drunk freshman to joy ride your bike. Or if someone is late to class, and they see your bike\u2026 just saying. Emory\u2019s campus is very safe so just get a simple lock and it should be fine, and there are plenty of places to lock your bike.",
