The best I can do is begin to convince you that it makes sense by sending you what MCAT questions look like.  It should convince you to not follow the students who only wanna take the easiest professors. Most of them will end up screwed.",

                              "text": "They don't understand that there is a penalty and I get why given how med. school admissions looks on the surface (it will naturally induce shortcuts and desperation). They believe they are doing what the med. schools want by engineering a perfect GPA, but they usually don't get that because most easier professors find slick ways to yield the same grade distribution as the harder profs and this would be okay if there were big selection effects (like only good students go with one prof and then only weaker folks go with the easier one) but that usually isn't the case.\n\n The person who made an A ot B in one will make the same or close in the other. So this means the B students would have gotten a B either way and will learn a lot less too so no GPA advantage and MCAT disadvantage.  And then it adds up if you make the same decisions for too many pre-med cores.\n\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I get some decisions like if you know calculus isn't on the MCAT so you aren't trying to be challenged in math 111 or math 116 so you find a simpler professor. But many people are dodging the more intellectually rigorous professors in things like even intro bio (where no one is unusually challenging) and beyond as well as chem classes which are all high yield and are done in a way that preps well for the MCAT by better profs and done in a way that may actually be harmful (you may be misled to, for example, think MCAT bio will be about how many details you memorized and say \"well I made an A so I must be ready!\" when u aren't) with the easier ones.\n\n*Either way, I'll talk about this forever until Emory yields more students that \"get it\" and ultimately boost the entrance rate success levels.  I'll send you the MCAT material (it is a good way to gauge the style and level of your Emory course work vs. where you need to be eventually) and a GOOD PHA(Princeton) website to follow with regards to these issues because I assume you may be open to the advice.",
