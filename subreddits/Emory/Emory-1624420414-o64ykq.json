  "text": "I was curious if anyone had taken cs61a from Berkeley and if it counted for any credit. I\u2019m taking it over the summer that it would count for cs170 but the office told me that they would determine if it would count for credit only after I had taken the class. I\u2019m on the fence of not dropping the class cause they have been hella stingy with my transfer credits and I don\u2019t wanna waste my time on a class that won\u2019t get me credit",

      "text": "I don't know man I took a basic IT troubleshooting course a decade ago and they thought it was an equivalent for CS 170 which I got credit for. Not only did it not have any Java, it was also 3 credits instead of 4. I'd say just finish it unless money is a factor, then take the Emory version because that meshes better with 171. I'll say I was playing catch up for sure.",
