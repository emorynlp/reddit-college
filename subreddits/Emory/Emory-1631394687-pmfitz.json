  "text": "I feel like the BBA QSS will be most useful to my career along with a CS minor(Ik technically can\u2019t do a minor but will take enough courses for a minor) and Econ out of interest. Or my alternative path is to do Finance and MSBA within 4 years how hard will that be. I\u2019m just trying to figure stuff out. Any helpful advice would be appreciated. Also I\u2019m a freshman",

      "text": "You're asking how hard it would be to triple major plus have a de facto minor? The confidence of freshman is always astonishing lol\n\n>Or my alternative path is to do Finance and MSBA within 4 years how hard will that be.\n\nUnless youre looking at finishing a masters in as short a time of possible for financial reasons (in which case you probably should've gone with a different school), then what's the rush? How about you spend your time in undergrad actually focusing on learning rather than racking up as many credits as is humanly possible in as short a time as possible?\n\nIf you want to have no social life and hate your time at Emory, then yeah go for for your 3 major+1 minor plan. If you don't want to hate your life for the next four years, just do two majors like a normal person.\n\nFor now, just take graduation requirements and B-school requirements. After a semester or two you'll understand how insane your plan is and can actually make a long-term course plan. Your interests have a high chance of completely changing too by then.",

      "text": "I would say take a few B School courses and a few econ courses - see which fits your boat more. Typically, the former is more practical and the latter is more theoretical/mathematical. They both can lead to the same careers - with econ being more versatile but business being better for professional growth.  \n\n\nI would not do BBA+QSS+Econ+CS altogether.   \n\n\nYou could do a BBA+QSS and then take some CS courses that you think could add to your career. Be selective/intentional about your courses. CS is known to be tough at Emory.   \n\n\nReally though, a BBA is good enough. BBA+QSS is more than good enough. And BBA+QSS+ a few CS courses is something I'd only recommend if you love that and are okay with working insanely hard.",

Although, getting the MS definitely opens more doors down the line to more advanced jobs that are gated by MS. But doing it directly after/during bachelors can put you in a weird spot since you don't have experience to put with it.\n\nI did the MSBA in 4 years but as BBA(ISOM) and Theater double major and took like 3 CS classes because I wanted to do more coding. i\u2019m a DS now if you want to PM me.",

              "text": "Okay given my knowledge of consulting, and I imagine IB is similar, here are my thoughts. Entry level roles in those fields are pretty well defined, and even if you have a lot of these extra skills, they don't care about them since you'll be in Excel anyways. In those first few years however, you may be able to get yourself involved on more advanced/cooler proejcts than your cohort just because you have those technical skills, but even then, the industry is still pretty old fashioned and your boss will expect Excel anyways.\n\nIf you really want to work using these coding skills, then you will have to network within your company your first few years to get into those more analytical teams where these skills are actually required, for example BCG Gamma. However, a lot of those teams require higher degrees (MS or PhDs) anyways if you have less experience.\n\nIf you want to work at those kind of companies, and be coding straight away, you will definitely be more back office or siloed onto the engineering teams, and not client facing (and therefore no traveling).\n\nIf you look on LinkedIn and filter for emory alumni, you will find some CS people who went into consulting, and MSBA people who went into consulting, or QSS/Econ people who went into economic consulting who may be able to give you more insight into how their majors were or were not useful. I suggest asking to hold 15-30 minutes phone calls with them.\n\nFinal note, not to say you should only do these things because they would be useful for your career aspirations either. If you actually enjoy them, take them for your own enrichment! Learn what you want to learn. I'm just being honest with you that these may not factor as much into your career as you'd think because you want IB or consulting",
