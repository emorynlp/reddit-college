  "text": "I currently have 17 credit hours. Previously I had 15 with dance which was perfect but turns out the dance class has an extensive waitlist. With the new schedule I have 3 politics-based classes ( Pols 190,SOC 190,ECON 190). I\u2019m wondering if this seems excessive and is difficult to manage. I read that the average is 15 credits a semester and don\u2019t want to ruin my Gpa since Im hoping to do pre-law!",

      "text": "Trust that one semester is not going to ruin your GPA for law school (and average GPAs at law schools have fallen quite a bit), especially with mostly intro social science and humanities classes whether it is 15 or 17 hours. 17 should be just fine because 2 are just PE and the ECS 101 thing.  Worry about your more advanced courses in later years and also think about how you'll develop writing and critical thinking skills that will not only help get you into law school, but help you do well or stand out (this is important since the shine and employability of law degrees have deteriorated) IN law school. \n\n That means you'll probably need to take a few professors that expect good discussion contributions and great writing/research ability and 'unfortunately'(not really) those instructors may be more challenging than average to earn an A, but even if you miss it, you should have quite the cushion as there is plenty of easier classes you'll take and like medium workload ones with grade inflation/softer grading. \n\n  At the professional school level, you can't just hide by taking easy stuff.  The cohort will take basically the same professors and courses.  Unless you are doing something as intensive as QTM, you should be able to handle most undergrad social science and humanities profs and courses at Emory, even a lot of the harder ones because they grade fairly for the most part.  You keep up and do high quality work, you get an A/A-.  Unless you are taking some crazy tough courses and professors now, which you aren't, you shouldn't be worried about your non-existent GPA yet.  \n\nAssume that you start with a 0 and then earn a GPA vs. \"Ruin a 4.0\" that you haven't earned yet and definitely don't come.in with the mind set that your GPA is at risk because parts of your course load are challenging or because PE and ECS 101 put you at a number of credit hours slightly above average.  Get ready to have fun learning in college vs.viewing the challenges it may throw at you as an obstacle to your law school dreams.  Trust me when I say that a broader range of GPAs from Emory are getting into solid and even top law schools than you may think. Don't panic, get excited and find people and classes that make you think better than what you were made to in HS.",

This website also says \"Any course that satisfies the First-Year Seminar Class requirement may not satisfy another general education requirement\" which means that if you take another seminar course(if you even allowed to) the credits won't go towards anything since you already satisfied it with your first seminar course.",
