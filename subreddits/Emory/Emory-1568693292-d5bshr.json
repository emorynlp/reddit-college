  "text": "Hello! \n\nI am a current senior and I am trying to decide where to ED. I love Emory but I am so conflicted and indecisive about EDIng because there is another school I like. Can you guys speak to some amazing things and some not as amazing aspects of Emory? Specifically about campus life, as I know little about it.",

Many will wear the gear of other similar caliber schools they have no affiliation with other than maybe being wait-listed or denied.  I'll take advertising for Coke over advertising for WashU, Dartmouth, JHU, or Chicago, 3/4 which are D3 places that also tend not to have the \"spirit\" folks claim Emory lacks) or giving a history of the product so much as blatantly advertising all the way through.

The 2nd paragraph is me complaining about the stupid Coke museum which is an actual advertisement.  You alluded to the coke toast sort of being that.\n\n I also complain about how Emory students effectively advertise for other schools (I am willing to bet they still do it).  I'd rather a tradition be an advertisement or do something to build affinity towards Coca Cola (something that helped build Emory) than Emory students constantly do things that show affinity towards competitor schools. \n\n I find that more problematic about Emory than any \"embarrassing\" traditions (seriously, I always ask who is responsible for lack of spirit or whatever everytime folks complain about it).  These are basically my ways of complaining, and its current traditions aren't among my complaints.  There probably need to be more or new ones though.  That has to be left up to students' imagination and their ability to implement.",

No matter the real reason, it leads to that perception and I think many (current) students do have warped views of Emory's position or relative strength versus some same or similar caliber competitor schools (largely because they conflate caliber with admissions/rankings as many were taught to do), so it could indeed be an expression of that.

Chicago was/is known for tough academics but came up with nerdy/quirky traditions (like their scavenger hunt thing which may actually have them build things) that really resonate with its students and have stood the test of time. My only differing opinion is that students have to be the source and have to be creative because of lack of D-1.  The latter is in no way prohibitive though.  \n\nIt is a combination of fitting traditions and knowledge of what the school has done or even what y'all do at it to enhance its reputation that ultimately builds it.  Folks from some D3 schools like Chicago and JHU may complain (they actually honestly take pride in having academics tough enough to tell stories about much like Georgia Tech) but are very aware of why the places are great/very aware of the overall impact of their institution and that certainly helps.  There are pathways and I honestly think Emory's relative newness to an elite academic status is what is prohibitive.  Having history of it generates more history worth knowing and pride even among undergrads. I always note that Emory is too humble and quite.  It should do a better job of rubbing institutional, faculty, and student achievements in everyone's face.",

Stuff doesn't change through magic or complaining on here or in the Wheel, especially student centered traditions. Admins can facilitate and help, but students have to drive some things.\n\n  I've been hearing this spirit and tradition stuff for so long. What are dissatisfied folks doing about it other than expecting spontaneous change? Perhaps the lack of a sense of obligation or one's potential role in \"spirit\" and \"tradition\" among students is and has been the problem.  You can't have good \"spirit\" or any of that stuff without it, some imagination(yes, people need this at a non-D1 place) , and attempts to get buy-in into whatever new events and traditions they may be interested in.",

Ability to do that obviously affects the university (or whatever unit you were a part of) fundraising, and overall health.  Ideally, students would rather have memorable traditions and experiences so that they find it worth having long time relationship with it. \n\n I find some aspects of D1 sports and the campus culture it can create cringy but no doubt it and the traditions students created around it is good for most students who like it (a crap ton) and the institution.

If we complain about traditions that Emory does have or say it is \"embarassing\", then what is to replace it or be added at a D-3 school?  And then when you ask that question to any Emory student they then say \"I am not obligated to help change or enhance it\", but the unproductive complaints about things(that I have yet to see change or enhance) that put them at least at the center are apparently obligatory. \n\n I just find it confusing.  If everyone says \"I expect everyone else or the administrators to be creative and find better means to generate traditions and  school spirit so that I can watch it passively and smile\".  It makes little sense and will never fix the issue because it seems everyone is taking that attitude.  It isn't just them, so I am sorry if I came off combative specifically to them.\n\n But going after that particular event is indeed a little petty given the relationship of Coca Cola to Emory.  Perhaps we should spice it up by inviting all of Georgia Tech's first year class to do it with Emory.  I mean I don't know. I'm just gonna leave it alone now, but this:\"I really want the currently absent spirit but shouldn't have to come up with to conjure it\" thing has always irked me much like my posts on here for lots of people lol",
