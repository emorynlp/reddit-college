  "text": "Are the foreign language courses at Emory one semester or one year long? I was reading about the requirements on their website ([here](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/60367/pages/reference-pages-%7C-advising-and-registration-language-courses-and-placement#:~:text=LANGUAGE%20COURSES%20AND%20PLACEMENT,-Explore%20all%20of&text=All%20Emory%20College%20students%20are,be%20at%20a%20higher%20level)) and it says you have to take two consecutive courses. Does that mean you're required to take two semesters of a foreign language, or two years? \n\nAlso, (sort of related) has anyone on this sub taken Hebrew? I know a bit from my Bar Mitzvah but I sort of memorized the prayers and would like to learn the language better. If you've taken Hebrew, can you talk a bit about how it went and if it's suitable for someone who knows very little Hebrew coming in?",
