Plus, it would fill the continuing writing and the ways of inquiry degree requirements. But I'm worried with the other classes I'll be taking and work stuff about how stressful it will be. I'm considering dropping psyc 110 as that's also jot a major requirement, but it interests me so if I don't have to I'd rather not.",
