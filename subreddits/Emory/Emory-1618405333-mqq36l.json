  "title:": "First Year Student Enrollment Agreement Question",
  "text": "So I recently signed the student enrollment agreement after being accepted into RD. However, I was stupid and I guess I forgot to read all the terms and conditions because I just realized that it says that \u201cyou have agreed to withdraw all applications submitted to other colleges and universities and make no additional applications.\u201d Unfortunately, I thought that paying and signing the agreement just meant that I hadn\u2019t committed committed, just paid the down payment to reserve my spot in the c/o 2025. I had been put on the waitlist to UPenn and UCLA, so I had been waiting to hear back from those. This is a stupid question but per the agreement I signed, I would have to withdraw these applications right?",
