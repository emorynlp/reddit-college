I\u2019d love to hear from current or former students about their experiences with studying different languages at Emory. (Note: I will NOT be doing a tonal language. Way too hard lol.) Thanks! :)",

      "text": "I recommend Russian, it's a very chill and small community. Don't be scared by the alphabet, we got it done in like 2 weeks. It might be a little hard to predict which electives will count for the minor since the department is equally small, but lots of courses can be approved for it.\n\nI recently declared the minor after doing a year of Russian and while I'm not really as invested in the area studies portion (for any minor), I need to finish up writing gen eds anyway so might as well.",
