  "text": "I know this question has been posed a few times, but I'm still wondering about how many freshmen (especially Oxford freshmen) are heading to campus. Does anyone have an estimate? \n\nAlso if you are going, what convinced you? I'm just unsure, given all the restrictions if it's still worth it.",

I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s mainly international students that won\u2019t be coming.\n\nI\u2019m going because cost isn\u2019t a huge issue to me and after watching the webinar I realized there\u2019ll be *some* opportunities to socialize. They also said they\u2019ll be trying to place people that are in the same residence hall into an in-person freshman seminar, which is nice.\n\nAnd someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think they said people from Oxford will be going to the Atlanta campus for the fall term?",

      "text": "I\u2019m going because I can\u2019t imagine staying home for the next 4 months. I would prefer to sit inside a dorm than to stay here. Oxford still plans to host events and whatnot albeit socially distance so it won\u2019t be too bad. We won\u2019t literally be forced to stay in our dorm rooms 24/7. I would also like to get at least some form of the freshmen college experience even if there are a lot of restrictions. Honestly, if I were a higher risk group or didn\u2019t mind learning from home I would probably stay. It ultimately comes down to what you are comfortable with safety wise.",
