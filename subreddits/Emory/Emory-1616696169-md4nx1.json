  "text": "Hello! I am super stoked that I got into Oxford for spring admit. That being said, I\u2019ve been diving into my research of the college to see if I would fit there and I had a few concerns. \n\n1) I\u2019m definitely not the party type of person and I\u2019ve noticed most social events are frat parties/clubbing. Are there options for introverts like me?\n\n2) I\u2019ve also noticed that many people mentioned that there are a lot of \u201cJAPs\u201d (Jewish American princesses). While I\u2019m definitely not at all like that stereotype, I am Jewish and I am kind of worried about antisemitism on campus.\n\n3) how is the transition from Oxford to Emory? I\u2019ve heard a lot about how Oxford students are sort of looked down upon and I\u2019m worried that it will be uncomfortable transitioning (my high school has 5000 students so it\u2019s more the social aspects then size)",

I\u2019m not Jewish, but there is a pretty large Jewish population on campus. A lot of my friends are Jewish and involved in a ton of on campus religious/community events. From my perspective it seems really supportive.\n\n3. No idea. I know that Oxford has been pretty rough this year because of COVID, but I\u2019m on the main campus.",

      "text": "Isn't number 2 like some weird pre-2010 stereotype that people used to talk about (and admittedly it tended to come from a lot of people OUTSIDE of Emory at other comparable caliber elite schools trying to bash us)? While no one or no student body is perfect (I'm sure there will be some anti-semetic weirdos anyway), there is strength in numbers and I think Emory and WUSTL have historically had a very high Jewish population (like probably most of the white students were Jewish at one point. Maybe the demographics of white students have changed. I don't know).  I personally could never tell who was Jewish unless they told me.  Just another white person to me.\n\nNumber 3 also sounds like some pre-2010 or even pre-2008 mess.  I don't get where you are getting this from and when that stuff was said. Most people don't care.  There would be no reason to look down on an Oxford student if you don't do the same with a transfer student (who is more likely from somewhere far less selective than Oxford or ECAS which are equal in student quality at this point). Are you just looking for weird stuff that was at one point said on the internet?  I mean, I would say just avoid any strange person that looks down upon or thinks twice about whether a person is from Oxford.  That's just weird. If your transition goes smoothly from one campus to the other, you may very well outperform those people anyway academically, and they can look down upon that.\n\nAs for 1, it is freaking Atlanta and the main campus has like thousands of students and Ox has what I imagine as a cool LAC type of environment.  If you can't find stuff to do, I blame you and whatever people you choose to hang out with.  Even as an introvert, if campus is nearly fully functional it should be easy to find stuff to do to enjoy yourself in whatever capacity unless you are super picky with your tastes in \"fun\". It's college, be creative and make fun for yourself or explore when you can.  And Ox is supposedly known as a tight-nit, kind of quirky community that is more open minded about definitions of \"fun\" than ECAS students from what I remember (I had quite a few friends from Ox, and to me they were generally a little more \"interesting\" and it was refreshing and likely helps given that Ox is sort of in a rural/exurban area of Atlanta metro.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Also, how do you know that most events are clubbing, etc?  Those would be the most high profile events where students who do them of course heavily market, promote, and present themselves doing.  Everyone else having normal outtings or creating fun for themselves is just gonna enjoy themselves and not constantly promote what they are doing.  You even have quite a few Emory Youtubers who do relatively mundane things that I'm sure many students (especially introverts) would enjoy).",

Tonight, I got invited to a fraternity party but stayed in to read a book - very INFJ of me,  i know - and i'll hang out with my friends tomorrow. I'ts there if you need it, but no one pressures you to go out unless you have shitty friends\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndon't worry about antisemitism - emory is one of the largest jewish communities on any college campus.  you'll be accepted no questions asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni'm main campus so can't speak to oxford, but congrats!",
