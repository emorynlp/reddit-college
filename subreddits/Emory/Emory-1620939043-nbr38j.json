      "text": "Are you only limited to history courses? I've taken a few HSC anthropology courses that have smaller papers and no big one at the end. Most writing courses do require a final paper and one of my classes that wasn't a writing course still assigned one. Best bet would be to check the syllabus for each course as you get closer to registration and see what the requirements are.",
