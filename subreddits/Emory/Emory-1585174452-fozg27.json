  "text": "Just got my decision from Emory, got into oxford but waitlisted at emory proper. Is there any advantage to Oxford, or is it kinda just like a training ground for Emory rejects? I toured reg emory in the fall but not oxford. Also, if I was at Oxford would I still have access to reg Emory ECs? I really want to do debate at Emory but is it possible if you go to Oxford? Thanks.",

So most of them had to wait to reach main campus to really move farther into their major, so they were behind in classes level relative to most that start at Emory. However, most oxford students take advantage of that by doing all their gen ed requirements at oxford so that once they get to main they can focus just on their major.",

Heaven forbid they were pre-med and tried to spread the pre-med cores out while at Ox. I have seen many end up in quite a pickle at main. Nothing like a semester with something like NBB 301, ochem (or some other pre-med core), a more serious NBB elective, and some other stuff that ain't so easy.",

                  "text": "Take the money but plan more carefully.  If pre-med, but especially if not, consider doubling up one year on the STEMs required for the major. Definitely get physics, gbio, and gchem done at Oxford as those are most important for NBB 301 and you don't wanna be stuck taking physics with 301 (knowing E&M and circuits helps for the first 2 exams of the course tremendously).  And try to take an elective or two in psyche or anthropology if available as they usually don't have 301 as a pre-req.  \n\nIf you don't wanna take ochem at Ox but want or need to take it on main, NBB 301 is offered fall and spring and so is NBB 302.  NBB 302 does not require 301, so take it in fall with chem 203 (this will allow you to take a good instructor for chem. 203 like Weinschenk without things getting ultra unmanageable) and 301 in spring (I think this is more akin to an Oxford style rendition of NBB 301 anyway and has case studies and a bunch of cool applications that the fall rendition doesn't do because it is large and run by tenured professors) and chem 204 (if you need) or more electives that don't require 301.\n\nWhat often happens is students may end up with two of those pre-med weeders and NBB 301 or writing/primary lit. reading intensive 401 (which will be taken as a senior by most) on top of electives. You wanna allow yourself breathing room so that you have more or less the standard load an ECAS student would and more control over electives by senior year (often NBB hosts its own 300 and 400 level electives and some of the most research and science leaning build upon or flat out require NBB 301).  Just be positioned to take 301 at ECAS with a schedule that is manageable. If you do that, you'll be fine.\n\n*One thing to be said is that even though main makes scheduling much easier, I am willing to admit that Oxford still cleans main campus's clock when it comes to intro. biology and physics education.  Them being small really allows them to do interesting things that analogous courses at research Us typically do not or cannot as easily.  This will help a lot for NBB 301 a lot and for many of the cool electives that may build upon it.",

      "text": "Hi u/Devil_green461! I went to Ox for a year and then transferred out, so I think I have a bit of a unique perspective (and none of the hot takes from ATL people hating on Oxford without reasoning).\n\nYou can do debate at Emory through Oxford, if you want to do so I highly recommend bringing a car, but it's honestly manageable enough through just the shuttle. You'll have access to all Emory ECs, and for business EEVM/Everview have a strong presence at Oxford, and GIMG I think has some Oxford folks.\n\nThe perk/curse of Oxford is how small the campus is - it's absolutely tiny with just under 1K students. This means you have a really amazing learning environment, something I didn't realize until I transferred to a bigger school. That said, there's a singular dining hall, a singular library, four dorms. The facilities etc. you'd get a bigger schools don't exist at Ox which kinda sucks.\n\nThe whole Oxford vs ATL thing is overblown and really stems from a small minority people at Ox who genuinely believe it's Emory's honors college/Atlanta people who have a superiority complex. I almost never noticed/cared about not being in ATL while I was there, and it wasn't really an issue in networking with alums/getting access to resources etc.\n\nAs other folks have noted, courses can be limited, if you're a QSS/NBB major you're going to have a much tougher time taking classes you want versus a physics or econ major",
