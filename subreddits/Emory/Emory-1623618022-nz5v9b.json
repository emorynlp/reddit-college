  "text": "Hey r/Emory I\u2019m an incoming freshman with virtually no idea of what taking Emory college courses is like, I have yet to make my schedule (not sure how easy or hard I need to go in my first semester), I think incoming freshman make them in July. Can anyone give some advice on what to schedule for freshman year for someone who plans to do business later on. Also does Emory accept credits from online courses like outlier? I intend to take my calc prerequisite on there since math isn\u2019t a strong suite for me. Lastly I have AP credits but I\u2019m not sure when and how to apply them to my credits. Thanks for any help with these questions!",

      "text": "I\u2019m not business so I won\u2019t add to that but what AP credits are you coming in with?\nYou are required to take ECS 101 (used to be called PACE) and HLTH 100 your first semester. Both are 1 credit each. If you have AP English credit I would take your freshman seminar. If not, take freshman english\n\nOnly courses taken at an accredited college or university are considered for credit outside of AP/IB. There are no prerequisites for Calculus 1 (Math 111) but yes it\u2019s extremely helpful to know pre calc beforehand\n\nI remember sending my AP scores and it was uploaded to my OPUS. I did it through CollegeBoard\n\nPre-BBA Requirements:\nhttps://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/curriculum\n\nMost students finish these requirements and then apply some time in their sophomore year. You can apply later too.",

      "text": "Scheduling is tricky because it really depends on the type of person you are. For example, I like my schedule sort of spread out evenly, while others like having a lot more classes on 1 day. Some classes are hard, some are very easy. Some classes take up a ton of time while others require very little to get an A. The way to succeed I think is to find the good middle of having easier classes and hard ones. Often times Ratemyprofessor can help a lot with this, which I really recommend you use whenever looking for classes. May I ask what major you are pursuing? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Ap credit, there is a process that you can find on the Emory page I believe.",

And take the freshman seminars or a language class (those are required courses to graduate). Then take business pre-reqs during second semester.",
