  "text": "I was admitted to a PhD program from the waitlist after my program\u2019s recruitment weekend. I have 2 weeks to decide if I\u2019m accepting but I\u2019d like to talk to other admits and current students beforehand. Are there any Facebook groups or GroupMe/Slack chats? I\u2019m going to be connected with a current student in my program, but I\u2019d like to hear from others because not all of my questions are specific to my degree. Help?",

      "text": "Hey, I\u2019m a current PhD student at emory- I\u2019ve found that most of the FB groups tend to be program and cohort specific and I\u2019m not aware of any GroupMe or slack groups (although I don\u2019t use either of those apps lol so they could def exist). You\u2019re welcome to PM me if you have any questions about emory- I\u2019ve been here 4.5 years now so hopefully I can help if you have general questions!",
