  "title:": "A few nuggets of advice from a senior to incoming freshmen",
  "text": "So, I'm having a quarter life crisis rn as I realize I'm already a senior. Feels like just yesterday that I was an innocent, nervous freshman walking into my dorm with a bunch of suitcases for the first time. \n\nOver the past few years, I've had many ups and downs at Emory. As I reflect over my time here, I wanted to pass on some advice for the incoming class about things that I did that I think made my time at Emory enjoyable, and things I wish I'd done differently:\n\n1. Don't take more than 15-17 credits your first semester. I took 19, thinking I could handle it. College studying it a lot different than high schoool studying, and I ended up spending too many nights a week at the library, not being able to hang out with my friends.\n\n2. Explore Atlanta. Look, I get it, drinking and partying is fun. Especially when you're new to it, like most people are. However, Atlanta is a big city with lots of cool things to do, many fun places to explore. One of my biggest regrets is not doing that enough, and choosing to spend too much time sitting in my dorm or frat houses drinking and partying. \n\n3. Your professors are amazing. Use them. Go to office hours, build connections with them. Trust me, it'll help.\n\n4. Join clubs. I saw too many of my friends not getting involved in extracurricular activities, then submitting resumes half a page long when applying to internships and jobs. Get involved, it'll help you professionally, as well as personally, by allowing you to learn new skills and meet so many new and cool people. Emory has a great variety of clubs and orgs!\n\n5. Take your academics seriously. People love using work hard play hard on Tinder profiles, but very few actually live it. Usually people tend to get lost in one or the other (more often the latter), but dont neglect your grades. Emory is a competitive school, and you will need to put in a good effort in your first two years to get good internships/research positions in later years of your college career.\n\n6. Go to campus events. They might seem lame at times, or the lines might seem long. But they're fun, you get to do new things, experience new cultures, and interact with new friends! They will also be some of your biggest highlights looking back on your college memories. \n\nBonus - if you're an international student:\n\nYour fellow international students will likely be your closest friends as you meet them during ISW before most people are even on campus. But don't limit yourself to that group, try and branch out and connect with locals. This can be hard at times due to cultural differences, but it's very worth it. \n\nI'm a senior in the Business school, so if you have questions about the BBA program, or general questions/wanna make a friend/tour guide, I'd be happy to answer/connect with you on or off reddit!\n\nGood luck y'all, and welcome to Emory!",
