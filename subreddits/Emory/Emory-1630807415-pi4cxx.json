      "text": "Acapella member that graduated 2020 here:\n\nThere's 7 / 8 groups:\n\nNo Strings Attached (NSA) - all male, does pop\n\nThe Gathering - all female, does pop\n\nChai Tunes - sing in hebrew and english songs\n\nSuri - sings bollywood mixes & english mashups, has competed\n\nAHANA - multicultural, sings R&B\n\nDooley Noted - tends to compete, does pop\n\nAural Pleasure - does pop and alternative stuff\n\n86 - chinese acapella group, but not super official? not sure what happened to them since they tried to start in 2019\n\nOxford only has OxCappella.\n\nMy advice, join the group you vibe the best with, especially cuz you\u2019ll be spending 4 hours at least every week singing with them. Keep in mind some of the groups have higher time commitments than the others due to competitions and gigs. This was my favorite extracurricular activity that I did all 4 years, and I\u2019m still sad I didn\u2019t get do a final concert due to covid.",
