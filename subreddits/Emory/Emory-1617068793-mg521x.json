  "title:": "Question about Social Life at Oxford",
  "text": "Hi all! I was recently admitted to Oxford College of Emory. I just have a couple of questions:\n\n1: For the Midwest Students, what is the transition to Georgia like? I\u2019m from Chicago so Oxford/ Emory are very far from home. \n\n2: How rigorous is Oxford? This may be a relatively vague question, but is the work load manageable? \n\n3: What is the social scene? I\u2019m a very social person so I definitely want to participate in clubs and parties. \n\nThanks for reading :)",

Its manageable but rigorous \n3. In covid times its been fairly social, but im not sure what it would be like in non covid times. There\u2019s definitely parties and clubs",

I always run into Oxford girls at parties in sororities who seem like they\u2019re having a great time. \n\nGet a fake ID though, you\u2019ll need it if you don\u2019t have one already. Don\u2019t want to wait for a month for it to come in the mail and miss out on all the stuff the first few weeks - orientation week rocks because no one has hw!!",
