Go to the free concerts, eat the free food, use the gym, participate in the free or subsidized clubs. \n\nYou have an opportunity to meet all new people and reinvent yourself to an extent, so take time to think about the things that interest you and the person you want to be.

At college it\u2019s natural to sometimes feel like a different person than you used to be say in high school or at home. Just make sure you have a few friends that don\u2019t make you feel like you need to be someone different. Be unapologetically yourself and be confident in what you bring to the table. Also stay in touch with your friends from back home. Anytime I\u2019m bored I FaceTime a friend from hs or back home and even if they don\u2019t pick up they drop me a line later or something.",

      "text": "DO: try really hard to get off campus and explore Atlanta and some of its funner suburbs.  Try to connect with Georgia residents if you are not from GA because it will help more easily expand your social scene beyond campus.  Try to challenge yourself but do well at the same time. view Emory as an oppurtunity to futher develop any talents you have in and out of the classroom vs. just an oppurtunity to express or confirm talent you have from k-12.  Also try to connect not just with other students, but with your professors.  Mentorship relationships with various faculty and key staff members not only will enrich your life but open doors up later.  Try to join clubs that you are interested, and not just all of them so that you can have a \"laundry list\" of stuff like you may have in HS.  Try really hard to find a few things where you can put forth the time to have a real impact through what you do in your activity/organization, and don't feel pressured to have the absolute top position within it.  There are many ways to have a big impact without being president.  It is perhaps more important to be able to describe to employers or other 3rd parties (grad, professional schools, national scholarship/fellowship interviewers) exactly what you did in those orgs vs. just name dropping yourself as president, vice president or whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't:  Do not flippantly choose your courses even as a freshman.  Try to explore, but pick the best (in terms of teaching quality and useful type of rigor that develops study or thinking skills under-developed in k-12) and more caring instructors.  Do NOT conflate ease of an instructor with \"kindness\" and a \"general care for students' well-being\".  Usually it is just laziness on the instructor's part (though they'll smile while being lazy and may even sound great in class, but that doesn't necessarily facilitate long term learning or anything meaningful) and them trying to keep you away from their office hours or an attempt to game student evaluations of their teaching.  You'll probably not be mature enough to see through such stunts because you'll be too elated about whatever grade you are earning (and the ease of earning it) whether you learned a lot or not (you'll be in an easy class, or a class that ended up being easier than expected and really think you're the sh\\*\\*  or that the teacher cares so much. Trust me, this isn't the case).\n\nI'm gonna use that to go on my normal rant (I see this stuff and it really annoys me and is bad for undergraduate teaching at a university in the long-run): Do not go and give ratings of your professors like this on RMP or student evaluation forms: [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=798151](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=798151)\n\n\"Professor McDonald is not bad at lecturing. I learned a lot from his class, but his exams are not a reflection of how well you know the material. They are overly complicated and very harshly graded. Hardest exams I've ever taken\"\n\nThis is a freshman class, so you are not in a position nor do you have the experience level to determine what is \"overly complicated\".  The fact that you learned and that the lectures/teaching is solid should be enough as no one is entitled or just deserving of an easily earned A grade simply because their performance in HS suggests they were perfect \"students\" (eventual goal should be to grow into a scholar which is a different thing) back then.  In addition to this, if plenty of people were able to find a way to do well, then the test likely were fair/a reflection of what was taught and supposedly (so maybe not what or how YOU  learned it, but how the A students did.  So that could have been an opp. to seek help from those A students.  Put ego aside and ask for help in college. Period) learned.\n\nIt is college, unless the instructor was absolutely incompetent, time to become more independent learners and take most of the responsibility.  Most of the most important learning and studying happens outside of class anyway.  And while most Emory students are high achievers, they need to let the idea of soaking in material like a sponge during lecture go.  The fact is, most can really only learn material at a surface level during a lecture no matter how clear they are, and it does take lots of work and study outside of it to learn at a much deeper level to handle more complex demands some professors may have.  But you made it to Emory, so you should be able to manage that.  Noobs should view lectures as merely being a warm-up or foundation (vs. having a \"only the barebones stuff that was explicitly covered in lecture or the book should be testable\" attitude.  Simply ain't enough time in a class session) for what they need to be doing between class sessions.  Emory is supposed to be more challenging than your high school or significantly more challenging than a much less selective school will be in terms of the complexity of demands you're dealing with (and not just the amount of competition/talent from peers), and when it is not, especially in something like a STEM (or even a social science) class, you should begin to ask some serious questions about whether you are choosing the right courses or instructors (again, your goal should be to learn more and at higher levels than you did in HS, not simply prove that HS prepped you for easier Emory classes.  It is tempting to think that: \"I can just find a pathway that allows me to cruise through Emory with a high GPA and I'll be set because it is prestigious\"...this has serious limitations and is not even applicable for several pathways as Emory is simply just not HYPSM, and that tier of elites.  You need to clearly display knowledge, an ability to think on the spot, and other key competencies for many pathways.  Having  manufactured high stats and a laundry list resume won't cut it for a lot of things as they have ways to screen beyond the superficial/\"on-paper\" excellence).  Either way, do not use RMP or student evals to punish teachers for challenging you especially if all else was fine.\n\nThat is a little unfair and can hurt junior faculty (luckily Ole McDonald here is tenured) who actually DO care about teaching undergraduates and want to teach students at a level that is appropriate for an elite university.  It just has a chilling effect and some of these junior faculty will go on and get tenure and then become shit teachers after such an experience (so they'll be easier than expected, but will do anything to avoid undergrads or just avoid putting any effort into their own course because they've already been told that: \"Okay, students don't like it when I put in serious effort, especially if they have to reciprocate it\".  You may wonder why some instructors are much less accessible or seem \"not very enthusiastic\", and sometimes all of this stuff plays a role so be careful about how you use any power you have to give feedback. You coud ruin it for future cohorts or even yourself if you end up having to take later courses with the same person).\n\nJust try (I get it is hard) to remove your ego from things like grades and how challenged you feel and instead try to convince yourself that the instructor who actually does challenge you does so because they actually believe in you and your abilities to adapt to higher level demands.  Instead of merely being upset that you were exposed as \"not the sh\\*\\*\" vs. others, reach out to them and whatever other resources available for help and start making that mentor oriented connection to get whatever you can out of the experience if it won't be an A.\n\nYou never know.  Often the most challenging professors KNOW that they are trying to challenge students and if they know you well/know you worked hard, they will appreciate even a B level effort (because that does mean that you did learn at a solid level in their particular course) and could end up writing a very strong rec. letter for whatever you need them to.  You don't need to be perfect/A-level to get support from some instructors, but it never helps to just give up or decide to not engage with them because you feel you are struggling or conflate them making the course difficult/challenging as them \"not liking students\" (and I know a lot of students, especially freshmen, view challenging instructors like this.  They view them as an obstacle or adversary which is usually just wrong.  Try not to take things so personally).  Again, usually it is the opposite.  They really like students and would love to do everything they can to help students reach the high bar they set (which is usually to ensure that you get the \"Emory edge\" you are paying for or can compete better in upper division courses), but they aren't gonna force you to seek their help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving on-Avoid 8am courses (maybe you can pull it off 1st semester, but still) if you can.  Avoid all nighters if possible (you can do this spacing out study/assignment work and procrastinating strategically instead of all the time.  You'll find that college gives lots of \"free time\" that ain't actually but so free so don't get caught off guard).  Do not buy books from the bookstore if you don't have to (Amazon, Google, and upper classmen are your friends).  Lastly, do not expect for all the folks you met as a freshmen to remain your closest friends, or to even make friends right away necessarily.  It is okay to have transitions or tiers of association.  And it is also okay to take longer to find your niche (or several).",
