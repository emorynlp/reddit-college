I do have the cgpa required but i am afraid i wont be able to complete it as i am not an extraordinary student. Any senior doing it right now and can briefly explain how hard and how time consuming is it? What level of work is expected in order to be successful in the program?",

      "text": "The main feature of your honors thesis is research.  So either you like or can see yourself enjoying and completing a productive project or not.  If you have the right GPA (keep in mind that econ. can have weird rules like have a 3.7 in major, but I get the feeling not but so many econ. majors have that problem now-a-days as the B grades in core classes may go to many who just sort of minoring or taking econ. courses \"for fun\"), you are already in a solid spot.  You do NOT need to be some 4.0 or perfect student to do well in research and in fact, many of those students end up hating research due to the amount of ambiguity and it having no clear answer or silver bullet strategy to find or interpret answers.  Basically research usually does NOT mirror a majority of the classes people take.\n\nYou can perhaps gauge your interest (which matters more than competence right now) by how well you have done in economics or related courses with significant research and writing assignments.  If you found those assignments fruitful or interesting, then you have the potential to enjoy research which indeed can be quite challenging at times (because it is discovery and interpretation).  You need resilience, an ability to tolerate ambiguity, a growth mindset, and true intellectual curiosity that will give you intrinsic (versus extrinsic such as grades or parental pressure) motivation to succeed.  Again, you don't need to be a perfect \"student\", you need to be able to grow into a solid scholar and those two can be very different things.  If this makes you think you may enjoy research, then go for it!  But if you just want to pursue it for a title, there are many other things to do and pursue within econ. and beyond to pad your resume with accolades.  Always be honest with yourself!",
