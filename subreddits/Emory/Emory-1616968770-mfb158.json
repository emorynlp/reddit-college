  "text": "I am a 3rd year pre-med student majoring in psychology, however, I want to take more bio classes over the next year to year-and-a-half in order to be more competitive for med school since I didn't do so great in the pre-req science classes. That said, I just want an idea of the hardest and easiest bio classes offered at Emory so I can structure my schedule with a nice mix, so I\u2019m not overdoing it. I'll be studying for the MCAT next semester if that helps. Also, if you have any recommendations on how many to take, or which ones to take together that would be great. I plan on taking 2 per semester (3 max) along with my major reqs. Any advice will help!",

      "text": "I don't know if this makes any sense. Taking \"more\" bio classes isn't going to make you more competitive for med. school. Just choose a couple or few that you actually want to take and will help facilitate MCAT prep and THAT will make you more competitive by getting a higher score (and those courses are going to be on the medium or harder side to be MCAT useful).  If you are not a bio major, no need to do this \"more\" stuff vs. useful stuff. If you are worried about the pre-reqs not being the best, take followups like cell, genetics (med schools like seeing success in these areas and cell and genetics build off of 141/142 well while building the reading and thinking skills for MCAT bio focused passages), and biochem, do well and call it a day and try to kill the MCAT.  If you want, you can throw in physiology as one of the more \"straight-forward\" classes(and so is bchem).  Either way, I would target some high value classes that show you are med. school ready vs. a smattering of random bio classes to generally pad the STEM GPA. Also, are there no psyche courses that would help you pad the GPA? Like maybe NBB 302/Psych 353?  It may be useful AND help.\n\n\nIf you have time, there are raw GPA padders (if you are actually interested) like animal behavior with Gouzoles.  Many who perform better in regurgitation oriented courses will like organismal form and function and developmental bio as well.    \n\nAnd actually there IS a course that I think is MCAT beneficial and fairly easy grade wise(and it has roughly the same format no matter who you take it with so even if the lecturer is bad, you can probably succeed because the material is simple): Evolutionary biology; You learn to.read STEM focused primary literature, you learn evol in context of cases/problems. It has more of an interdisciplinary/experimental bio approach, and lots of non-test grades to buffer against a weak exam performance. The content isn't particularly aligned with medicine all the time or the MCAT but the format of the course builds skills for it and the content is fairly intuitive so it isn't like you are learning tough content AND being asked to do challenging problems and thinking with it. The latter part comes easy because the material makes a lot of sense.\n\nMost of the other bio classes that may impress med. schools tend to be at least intellectually challenging if not grade wise (talking things like NBB 301, RNA biology, epigenetics, and immunology.  You'll have to think and maybe even work hard in them but they are good).",

I remember being a freshman and wishing a hide guidance like this so that is a big reason for why I decided to post this question. I\u2019ll look into the courses you suggested. And yea there are some classes that intersect and I have already taken a few of them.",

              "text": "I think I get what you are trying to do and understand it, but I was curious and looked at that free MCAT practice exam and realized that Emory bio at the intro level in its current state is selling people short (a lot of schools, selective or not, are, but Emory used to be a lot better for gen. bio. Better than average even among top tiers for a while: But I'm sure those who made an A/A- are thrilled with themselves thinking the performance is a sign). \n\nBased on what I saw, genetics and cell the way they are now taught at Emory seem to be overlooked choices among a lot of pre-meds because a) they don't seem as med. school related as a physiology(which Emory PHA strongly recommends but few other elite tier UGs do in lieu of cell, genetics, and microbio) which is vastly over-rated (exposes you to body systems in great detail which is nice for the few discreets on it, but physiology passages tend to be cell biology or physics problems contextualized as a physiology problem) and b) because they are supposedly \"hard\".  Well, the MCAT mirrors those \"hard\" classes more so than how bchem, phys, and  organismal bio (O'Toole's version. Beck's is good but looks like he gave the class to her) are taught and tested and it isn't like these 3 are the easiest of As. to everyone.\n\n Either way, Emory has lots of what I see as problematic, ill-advised(as in I don't see any advising office at the most elite U's PHAs advising what I see Emory's doing. Many of these schools don't even have a bio dept that offers a physiology course) course bandwagons especially with regards to bio classes, so I'd rather steer you in a more nuanced direction (I think there is a reason many other selective schools have a MUCH higher success rate than Emory and it isn't grade inflation. And the places that are more similar have similar advising or vague advising).",
