  "title:": "How difficult is a humanities program at Emory?",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\nSorry for the absurdly broad question. I\u2019m European and admitted to Emory for an exchange this fall. I was wondering if any humanities students could shed some light on the level of courses and maybe share a syllabus from one of your classes so I can see the density of the material and such. I know it\u2019s not very specific but I\u2019m mostly allowed to only take electives within humanities (am studying humanities myself) so I don\u2019t have any specifics yet - they\u2019ll sign me up for some courses themselves. I also need to take a statistics course (for dummies) and an intro CS course so if anyone could tell me what the syllabus and such are like it would also be incredibly appreciated. \n\nIf anyone also has any experience with European universities and can contrast to the level of difficulty at Emory that would be great too!",

      "text": "Dude I hate to tell you but the humanities courses have the least amount of standardization and I am also sure that \"European Universities\" have lots of variation like U.S. (there actually may be more trends in the U.S.). All I can tell you is to generally expect a smaller discussion based class unless it is a survey course The smaller seminar style intermediates and upper divisions are more likely to have heavier reading and writing loads. It is not about \"density of material\". It could be the raw amount of reading required and the level of class participation expected, frequency and length of writing assignments.\n\n In addition, some instructors will choose to enforce high standards for quality whereas others may have a \"just get it done and I'll pretty much give you a high grade\" mentality. Bluntly, many of the better instructors have higher standards and more immersive courses but I can't say that is the norm (it is all over the place). \n\nI have read that a common theme with European Universities is less frequent graded work on average, more lecturing, and perhaps less handholding and then decently consistent high expectations for graded assignments whereas analogous U.S. courses tend to have much more frequent assessment, more active/interactive class sessions, and more \"hands on\" instructors. especially in humanities and social sciences. However if your university has a tutorial system, you may be kind of used to a U.S. system.  Either way, take that with a grain of salt as humanities and social sciences are way too variable\n\nIf it was STEM, I am willing to bet the Euro U would be significantly tougher because the secondary preparation for STEM curricula is on average further along and more uniform in many European countries.",
