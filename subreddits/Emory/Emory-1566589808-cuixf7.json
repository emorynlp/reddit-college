(Like TechLab). Those guides should have some written instructions.\n\nThey look like this --> [https://imgur.com/a/L2ltUNG](https://imgur.com/a/L2ltUNG)\n\nWhat usually trips people up is that there is a little agent to run that verifies your machine status. It's looking for \\*some\\* sort of antivirus. It's much less restrictive than previous years, so it should be easier than any upper-classmen's experience. \n\nOnce you try all this, **if** you have issues still, you can visit the STS in Woodruff Library. We encourage you to at least try it before just visiting them. We've put in effort to make it easier than ever, so... yeah...\n\nIf you want to register a Smart Device, like a SmartTV or Google Assistant type thing, follow that first link I gave you. There's a section on TVs and whatnot, just follow that process. You should be able to register anything you have on your own.",
