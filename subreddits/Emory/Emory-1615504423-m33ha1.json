      "text": "Why does it matter? Hopefully, the university is a sample of real society. You are going to see people of all walks of life and have to learn to deal with people who may not have any overlap with your ideology or political stance. When I was at GBS, I was put on team projects with folks that I used to think \"unworthy of Emory entrance\". Years later, I regret my view and my position. For one, I failed to learn those folks and their circumstances. Second, although some of the people on my team do not want to focus on schoolwork, I failed to take the opportunity to learn how to deal with people. When you step out of school, you will be required to deal with people with different skill sets and different levels of skills in those skill sets. I paid a hard price for those failures, which could have been prevented if I had taken the time to learn how to deal with them.",

              "text": "I wouldn't characterize Emory students as \"Leftist\".  They are more like bland liberals into superficial aspects of diversity and inclusion (most liberals seem fairly anti-Left but I'll admit that like any college you'll be able to find a few true Leftists or outside of the liberal/conservative paradigm at Emory, more than you would off campus).  If you dig deep more of them are more \"moderate\" than they would like to believe. Plus it isn't a very politically active campus beyond voting \"blue no matter who\" type of politics.  We aren't talking Berkeley, some LACs, or more activist Ivies here. \n\nIt's a work-a-holic school that tends to be a bit apathetic. If you wanna find out people's views you'd probably have to talk to them about those issues.  Either way, I would keep an open mind instead of trying seeking out those who are like minded. You may be pleasantly surprised or find yourself open to changing your mind or having a more nuanced view. College is a time for exploration and not really a place to find some boring ass liberal/moderate or conservative echochamber. Learn what you can, form your own views, and talk about them if someone you know is open to it.",
