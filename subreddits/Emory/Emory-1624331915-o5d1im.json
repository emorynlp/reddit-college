The ones below really piqued my interest:\n\nThe Wheel\n\nVolunteer Emory\n\nMock Trial\n\nEmory Readers\n\nEmory Cooking Club\n\nFair Fight U\n\nYoung Democrats\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n1. How difficult is it to join each of these? Are there any that take people with little to no experience?\n2. How time consuming are these normally? \n\nAny additional insight would be great. Thanks! :)",

This would also mean you would be spending a lot of time writing for them as well. Again, I can\u2019t really comment on the rest but my guess is they\u2019re not as intensive",
