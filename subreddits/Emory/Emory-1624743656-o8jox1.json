  "text": "So I took summer biology and ended with a C Plus, where as my freshman year of relative same difficulty classes ended me with all A's. RIP my 3.9 gpa. I'm usually someone who isnt too picky with grades and am happy just trying and doing my best, but Med School was something I had been considering (although I guess not anymore) and a C isnt really going to cut it. I'm looking for any advice on what I should do to lessen the impact this will have on me GPA wise and future wise. I'm considering retaking the class in the fall, even though I know the original grade will stay with me.\n\nAny help or advice is very much appreciated. I'm reaching out to my major advisor but I had never spoken to him before and I'm not sure what their job really is, so I dont know how much help he will be.\n\nEdit: I had AP Bio credit for this class, so i technically didn't need to take it? But I'm not sure if that matters now because I cant just untake the class.",

      "text": "A C+ is fine. You\u2019re not out of the running for just one grade, and it\u2019s still going to be possible to get a 3.6-3.7 sGPA even with that. Think about how many science credits you\u2019ll end up having taken by the time you graduate. 50? 60? Maybe more if you\u2019re a STEM major. 3 credits is not going to determine your overall science gpa in the long run. \n\nI know it\u2019s easy to feel really bad about this when everyone around us mentions having an A in bio/chem all the time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the truth though. Sure, a lot of people did this year, but there are plenty of people who got lower than that too. It\u2019s just the people that get good grades speak up and the people that don\u2019t are silent. You\u2019re not alone.\n\nYou still got this. I\u2019d try to figure out what went wrong and how you can move forward. This can be a learning experience. I heard summer bio was really rough too. But anyways, I\u2019d also recommend maybe contacting your prehealth advisor instead if you want to get further advice. Major advisors are mainly helpful for info about the major you\u2019re in, although I\u2019m sure many professors are knowledgeable about this stuff too (especially if your major is bio/chem/etc).",

          "text": "Well most pre-meds take more than 2 biology classes, so even with AP for 141 lecture, they'd still have to take 141-lab and would likely take multiple upper division or intermediate biology courses that would fullfill that requirement. Most medical schools do not specifically require \"general biology\", but something like \"a year of college biology courses with a lab that ideally focus on x,y,z\" so they would have been fine.  I know an awful lot of people who skipped 141 and are actually in very well-ranked med. schools.",

      "text": "Do NOT retake a C grade above a C-(C- and lower is a real tank. This is more like a little blemish).  You should consider compensating by taking the analogous intermediate or upper division biology course(s) and doing well (B+ or higher) and those courses biol 250 (141 big sibling) and biol 264 (biol 142 big sibling). Those are great research/problem solving oriented (vs. Just memorization) reinforcements that help prove yourself in key AAMC pre-med competencies as well. And then later you should be able to do well in physiology and biochem.  \n\n Either way, a C+ ain't ruining no one who does pretty well in most of their STEM classes, has relevant EC experiences, applies with a strong overall and STEM GPA, and does well on the MCAT.  Believe it or not, most med. School admits are NOT perfect (3.9+) and I've known plenty who have gotten a C grade or 2 or several Bs who went on to do well in the process.  Successful applicants are generally very good/excellent but not perfect.  So just do better but don't waste time retaking anything within the biol 14x sequence.  Let it go and build the upward trend grad and professional schools value. There are multiple classes that will allow you to demonstrate competency in topics directly or somewhat related to the cell biology and genetics you were introduced to in 141.",
