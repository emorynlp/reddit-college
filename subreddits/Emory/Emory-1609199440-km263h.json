  "text": "Hi, I'm a freshman right now and I'm just wondering whether I need an internship in the summer before sophomore year? I'm wondering because I'm a pre-BBA student and I virtually know nothing besides supply and demand so I'm not sure how much use I'd be in an internship. Do people regularly have internships the summer before sophomore year? If so, do I just apply to them through Handshake? I know PACE had a course on internships but I forget all of it lol. Thank you!",

      "text": "If you\u2019re a freshman, you absolutely do not need to worry about internships in the summer. Many sophomores don\u2019t even have internships after their second year and it works out for them in the end! I don\u2019t think a lot of worthwhile internships are even open for freshmen to apply anyways so I think you\u2019re better off either taking classes to fill prereqs, maybe doing research on campus, or just enjoying your (possibly) last free summer vacation.",

      "text": "Never hurts to have an internship, but because of COVID, summer 2021 internships probably won't be as common. Use your summer for something though, whether that getting a min-wage job, helping care for family members, volunteering, taking a summer course, learning a new skill, or completing an internship. Just don't sit around and you'll be golden",
