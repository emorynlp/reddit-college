      "text": "Yes. Emory follows a holistic review process, which means they look at all parts of the application. Aim for a 1470 SAT and no lower than B's, and you'll be totally fine. Don't stress about the C. One or two or even a few C's won't break your chances.\n\nWhat really matters is showing improvement since freshman year, taking the most intellectually invigorating classes that are offered (and that you are capable of), investing time into extracurriculars, and writing good essays.\n\nYou can totally PM me if you have specific questions.\n\nGood luck! :)",
