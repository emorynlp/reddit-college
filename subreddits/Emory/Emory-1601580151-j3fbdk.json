  "text": "It feels like all I do is school work this semester, but at the same time, I\u2019m so behind on all my classes.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the online classes, but I\u2019ve never experienced feeling this way. I used to be way more involved with clubs on campus and had more social time while managing all my class work.",

      "text": "No you're not the only one feeling behind. Emory decided to move everything a week ahead and got rid of fall break and labor day break, and professors here in general don't care that everyone was screwed over by a week and they actually think they're better professors if they pile on the work than if they didn't. Also, there's fewer exams, which normally take 50-75 minutes to complete and 1-7 days to study for, unlike projects and papers which tare multi-week commitments.",

No matter how much studying I do or how much \"good grades\" I get for an assessment, I feel behind too. I always feel anxious by having to check canvas' calendar and each classes/group mes multiple times to know if I have submitted everything. And not being able to socialize makes the academic process really lonely.",

Many of them are feeling similarly wildly out of sorts and they may be able to help you either catch up or give you some leeway.\n\nAlso, use office hours, they can help reframe and reiterate key information and many professors are more flexible since office hours are mostly zoom.\n\nHang in there, this is an insane time for all of us.",
