  "text": "So I am starting at Oxford in the fall, (yay!) and I\u2019m having some trouble knowing which math class to start on  in order to get where I need to be.  I\u2019m on the pre-med track, NBB major. I took precalc my junior year and AP stat my senior year, which was a struggle for me. I don\u2019t consider myself the strongest math student, but I\u2019ve never gotten anything but an A, so I guess I\u2019m not too bad. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to spring right into calculus. Any thoughts?",

      "text": "You may be ready for calculus (calc. 1 is not extreme in its reliance on pre-calc./trig, but calc. 2 does more so rely on those concepts...except that life sciences calc. 2 which you need for NBB and will likely be taken on main is something a bit different from standard calc. 2 anyway), however calculus is NOT a pre-med requirement and is just an NBB requirement.  If I were you, I would maybe consider doing QTM 100 first (that is a pre-health recommendation/requirement and an NBB requirement).  It also depends on what all you are taking in your first semester.  Like if you will be in 2 sciences, maybe no need to rush into any math.  Enjoy your other gen. eds and freshman requirements which may be discussion based and intellectually intensive enough.  Totally up to you (don't get me wrong, I am not necessarily saying that 1 math and gen bio/chem is too hard.  Just saying, that maybe you can mix stuff up a bit).",

      "text": "I am a rising sophomore at Oxford college, pre-med and probably Chemistry major. I took Calc BC and Multivar Calc in high school in which I got both A+. I don't like math, but I think I'm decent at it. Since I took calc BC before and did well on it, I thought I'd be fine taking Calc 2 straight away at Oxford (Chem BS needs Calc 2 BA only needs Calc 1). This was definitely in the top three for the list of critical mistakes I made in my life. I took a class by professor Jonathan Hulgan, who seemed to think that his class of normal calculus 2 contained solely math majors, and made the tests/exams impossibly difficult. He had these complicated problems plus super harsh grading which messed with my GPA a lot. Idk if it was just him, but he made all the tests for other faculty's classes too, which also destroyed the kids in those classes.\n\nTo summarize, I DO NOT recommend jumping into math at Oxford, as it is known to be hard here. Especially since you're a premed. Your GPA matters, and I HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST taking advanced math at Oxford. The best option is to do it at main campus, where its easier. Take the easiest classes you can, ask the second years for who's the easy professor, and LISTEN TO THEM. DO NOT make these assumptions that oh I'll just try super hard and I'll be able to power through them. This assumption will not give you any advantages in medical school admission, and will ONLY proceed to make your life harder.\n\nQTM 100 is a good place to start. Free A if you try, and gives you good base for not only school but also research and stuff that you'll do later as a premed. \n\nI'll see you around next year. Lmk if you have any questions. Good luck and welcome to Oxford!",

          "text": "I can confirm these experiences with Hulgan. He absolutely destroyed my love for math during Calculus 2 and I recommend you stay away from him. Most tests averaged around 40% - 65% with no curves and made most people drop out of the class. I managed to get a B- overall, but I had to work my ass off for it. If you have any questions or concerns about Oxford in general let me know! I'll also be a second year at Oxford this upcoming semester. Hope to see you around.",

          "text": "Calc 2 isn't advanced math lol, but I get what you mean.  I did hear that Ox (like lots of LACs/LAC model schools) took math very seriously and made the calc. classes very intense.  One thing I will say is that I would advise taking easier classes for math since it isn't as important for med. school or MCAT prep, but wouldn't advise the same for chemistry and biology courses simply because they are integral for the MCAT and students benefit from taking certain styles (some which on main may grade on the harder side and some that don't) of bio and chem courses that mirror how the MCAT tests.  I would generally say that even the harder bio and chem. classes are perhaps fairer than the scenario you described with math.\n\n\\*Note that with main campus, folks should be careful.  Looks like they are up to some changes with 116,112 and maybe 111 by installing more lecture track folks, and apparently one is known to be unusually difficult (he is newer and has solid ratings, but still..it almost looks like they are sending him to have at least one section in every math that has a decent pre-med population).  Instructor makes for huge differences on main.  Difficulty in some areas (like if you are a chem. major, why bother if you will avoid certain professors.  Certain classes and professors are just a part of the Emory experience lol.  Plus most who care enough can do well) is worthwhile, and I'll agree that for some it just isn't in other areas (like math).",

It's difficult in and of itself and prepared me well for Math 111. Both math courses move quickly and Math 111 is slightly easier, but slightly in the sense that it had fewer grade-boosting quizzes. Math at Oxford, I'll say, is difficult. You'll have to take QTM 100 at some point for NBB and pre-med as well, so I'd consider doing that sometime as well.",

If you're not good at calculus I wouldn't recommend anything higher than 111, though. \n\n(I took MATH 111 for my math GER and it was hellll for me, so I really wish I took PHIL 110 instead.

          "text": "Math 116 may be good for an NBB major because it gets them to practice doing more interdisciplinary math (there is a mix of calculus/differential equations/a little multi, linear algebra, and statistics and focuses on modelling certain systems)  problems (specifically those possibly related to biology) which could help them for 301 which uses a good amount of math at the beginning (mostly algebra/physics and chem focused math, but it is used to model and interpret decently complex scenarios, especially for a bio course).\n\nThere is also the trickiness of Oxford.  Physics 141/142 (which they'd want to take before NBB 301) supposedly has at least some calculus in it (unlike main which confuses me) at Ox.  142 would incorporate calc. 2. , so there is that.  It may be unavoidable if the OP wants any sort of advantage.",

Also, it is 7 years ago.  It covers matricies \n(linear algebra), differential equations (first order), slope fields/basic multi concepts, integration, and then goes into probability and statistics.   Often when covering this stuff, it uses these mathematical techniques to model.different phenomenon in the life sciences.  I get to chime in on this one.\n\nHere is evidence: https://mannalela.wixsite.com/manuelamanetta/math-116\n\nNo change in this course.  Only change is that they got rid of math 115 which differed very little from 111 so I don't blame them.\n\nIn case 3 years ago is too long of a time period and people think that the class has been transformed since then...Emory's course atlas thing is public.  116's barebones description even today is: \"Integration, differential equations, multivariable calculus, and discrete probability and statistics, with an emphasis on applications to biology.\"  So...no change (math and physics are ultra stable curriculum wise anyway).",
