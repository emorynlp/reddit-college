  "text": "Hi everyone\ud83d\udc4b!\n\nI am pretty new to the Emory Reddit community. Always find some excellent insights from you all, and I got a question of my own now with regards to choosing the right meal plan.\n\nHere is an overview of my meal needs for context (w/ each one regarding whether I would prefer having that meal as a Meal Swipe or not):\n\n1. Gotta get some morning breakfast (weekdays preferable, weekends optional)\n2. Lunch is a must (weekdays preferable, weekends optional)\n3. Dinner is where it's at (weekdays preferable, weekends optional)\n\nI tend to spend about $13 DD on average per week but wouldn't mind getting a bit more DD for food if that means a bigger bang for my buck.\n\nThanks and look forward to hearing from you guys!\ud83d\ude4c",

      "text": "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a sophomore so if u can afford it, the unlimited option might be ur best choice if you average 3 meals a day during weekdays. Other than that, maybe plan D might be ur best option which is roughly 11 meals per week so not even two meals everyday. Good thing about DD is that u can always add funds to them so i wouldn\u2019t worry so much about it. So think about ur eating habits and whether you eat out a lot, if u like COX better than DCT since cox doesn\u2019t take meal swipes anymore and it\u2019s with DD, etc. Personally, I got Plan C bc I don\u2019t eat at DCT a lot and normally i eat 1-2 meals anyway",

I was considering Plan D for those reasons, especially since bagels and cereal may just be the plug\ud83d\ude02\n\nOn a side note, being that Cox allowed meal swipes the past two semesters, I hope they continue doing that...",

      "text": "I picked plan D because it provides the most bang for your buck IMO. It's more cost-effective than plan C because you get 50 extra meal swipes, and if you add manually add $450 dooleys, it's still $2 cheaper. Since Cox is no longer taking meal swipes I think it's good for me to have a good amount of dooleys. And I appreciate having the 11 meal swipes per week since I go to DCT roughly twice a day. I was considering the unlimited plan, but it's over $1000 more expensive than plan D and it only comes with $150 dooleys. So if you ran out, the total cost of having the most expensive plan on top of paying for the extra dooleys isn't worth it IMO.",
