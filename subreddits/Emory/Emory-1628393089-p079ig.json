You have to complete both for the Psychology major :)\n\nif you have AP Psych credit, it covers Psych 111\n\nhttp://catalog.college.emory.edu/department-program/concentration.php?YToyOntzOjI6ImlkIjtzOjM6IjYzNSI7czo0OiJ0eXBlIjtzOjU6Ik1ham9yIjt9",

And the professors offered (Kazama especially) are pretty great. I had QTM with Kim and he was super nice guy. The class wasn\u2019t insanely difficult either but I had to study quite a bit for my grade. I went to office hours for help!",
