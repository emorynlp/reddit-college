The following site specifies that full-size refrigerators are not allowed, implying that mini-fridges are probably allowed.\n\n[https://housing.emory.edu/move/move-in-shipping-bring.html](https://housing.emory.edu/move/move-in-shipping-bring.html)\n\nI know about the microfridge rental option, but I'd rather just get a minifridge to keep (cheaper too).",
