  "title:": "Petition to change emory\u2019s fall 2020 grading policy!!!",
  "text": "Lol soo i feel like everyone is having a rough semester... I\u2019ve been seeing other schools starting to change their grading policies for fall 2020. \nSimilar to other institutions, I think Emory should adapt the same optional grading policy offered in spring 2020. \n\nEven having the option to choose what courses we want graded (including GER and major requirements), our quality of life will improve (esp our mental health!) and we promote educational equity to students who have less-than-ideal workspaces at home. \n\nif you\u2019re interested in signing and sharing, here\u2019s the link: \n\nhttp://chng.it/dbKjnZqSNb\n\n\n***EDIT:\nIf you feel particularly strongly about getting this petition passed, please fill out this survey and anonymously share your thoughts/experiences! \nThe more responses we get, the more reasons we can present to Emory\u2019s admin! \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1i3L93K7PO8KZzQswmeogrWo28_O8dxz3builU4o8P-Q/viewform?edit_requested=true",

I have to watch my mentality disabled brother. I attend classes with people who live in China or other parts of Asia and are on zoom at midnight. In no way are our situations indicative of successful learning environments. This is ridiculous, and I think this stubbornness is going to tarnish our school's reputation instead of preserving it. Even some of my professors have stopped lecturing for the full duration of class, leaving us to learn the material on our own. This isn't good for anyone.",

Additionally, caps counselors may be available for \u201cmental health support\u201d but once again that does not change the circumstances which everyone is facing and ultimately their lack of action is just adding more stress to us. Like I have a professor who seriously expects everyone to be in class every time bc he gives at least 2-3 in class quizzes per class, including those who may be on entirely different time zones. His response to their needs was that they should fix their internal clock to be Atlanta\u2019s time so they could keep up with his class. Seriously???",
