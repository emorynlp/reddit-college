  "title:": "Petition about Tuition",
  "text": "I think this one need some recognitions here!\n\nSign the petition for a reduction of tuition.\n\nThe experience at Emory is worthy not only because of its academic excellence but also because of its on-campus vibrant life. In the midst of this pandemic, we could not go back to school or use facilities like libraries (printing, AC, electricity, etc). Hence, it's absurd to ask students to pay a full tuition, especially for those that could not qualify for financial aid or financial support (international students, students with emergent need of fi aid). During this pandemic, everyone suffers for sure but I could have yet found the sympathy as well as the understanding of Emory towards its students!\n\n[Petition!!!!!!](http://chng.it/yHsMvBxrTg)\n\n[http://chng.it/yHsMvBxrTg](http://chng.it/yHsMvBxrTg) ",

Princeton, Williams College has decided to cut 10-15% off their tuition so that they could better support students' families during this time. Emory, with such huge endowment could not?",

That seems like a huge stretch, especially because the move to online has caused way more people to take gap years.",
