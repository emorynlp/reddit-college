  "text": "I\u2019m an Emory grad student... and usually this time in the semester I try to detox/destress by playing pick up basketball. Woodpec used to be my spot, but they don\u2019t allow pick up games currently with covid. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if saac is allowing pick up or if there are any other local courts where a large group of Emory people play pick up?? Any suggestions are helpful.",
