      "text": "I took an upper level Italian language class. It was really chill, not sure how the intro classes are. I\u2019d take Italian if you\u2019re interested in the culture or think it\u2019s a cool language. Honestly, taking Latin might be a little bit more beneficial overall (ex: remembering medical jargon more easily because you know what parts of the word already mean). \n\nItalian isn\u2019t a language like Spanish where everyone uses it. It\u2019d only be helpful to know a little if you plan to travel there or want to work in finance. If you think Italian seems fun though, it\u2019ll probably be easier and better to take that.",
