      "text": "They put that description for ALL summer online courses.  Your syllabus is what the professor wants to do.  With that said, maybe there are syncronous meetings that Bing plans to record as well.  I say attend the syncronous meetings (I don't know what is in the syllabus but maybe there will be LC or clickers or something, please Bing is just good and may find a way to take note of folks who show up). Don't view recordings as an out except for when an instructor is just bad I guess.",
