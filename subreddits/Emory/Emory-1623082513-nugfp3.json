  "text": "Hi, so today I went to register for the courses and of course the website lagged out for me and I was unfortunately only able to register for two courses. A lot of the classes I wanted unfortunately do not seem to have a waitlist and only have the status closed. Does anyone know if I will have the opportunity to potentially put myself on a waitlist or enroll or should I just give up and find different classes? Thanks!",
