  "text": "Does anyone have any recommendations for Continued Writing Courses for Business Majors? I really enjoy writing of all types, and I would love to take a class that taught me more \"businessy\" writing skills\u2014such as email etiquette, technical writing, and other skills of the like. I don't mind taking a harder course if it will teach me how to write well. Anyone have recommendations?",
