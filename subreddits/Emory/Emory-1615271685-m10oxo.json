This year has probably been quite different for them since COVID but honestly I've heard that being an SA in a normal year can be quite fun, your experience is all up to you in the end though - it's what you make of it",

      "text": "I have really enjoyed my experience as an SA. It can be a good amount of work, mostly during move-ins and building setup, but it's a very rewarding experience. I will say your experience will vary largely depending on the chemistry among your staff and your CD. I got pretty lucky with my staff, we all get along just fine and hang out quite frequently. If that kind of dynamic is important to you, keep in mind that it's not really something you have any control over. Though, this is only really super important now because there are no other non-freshman we see other than staff, it's not really relevant during any other time.\n\nBeyond that, regardless of your staff dynamic, you get to build a lot of valuable skills. People skills, dealing with conflict and crisis, creativity, coordinating and managing teams, are all things you will at the very least tap into while you are an SA. For example, creating programs during a pandemic has definitely required some extra creativity. Additionally, walking the line between enforcing whatever policies you have to enforce while also being someone your residents can comfortably talk to (even about things they're not supposed to be doing) will undoubtedly build your people skills, judgment, and empathy imo. SA is really a job that you can put as much work as you want into. Some people just meet the requirements, and that's fine, others put in a lot of work, and that's also fine (maybe because they want RA). Though, this will probably change since it's a paid position now. \n\nHave I ever felt like I was doing free labor and that I was undervalued? Yes, and it could be very frustrating, especially when we were advocating for compensation. Or when the university would change/amend COVID policies every other day. But, overall, positives outweigh the bad",
