      "text": "Honestly the only thing you for sure will need is a computer, everything else varies per person. I personally like taking notes on an iPad. If you prefer paper, you\u2019ll need a few notebooks. Labs will require you to get a lab book, but you\u2019ll get more details on that if you attend one. Honestly there\u2019s nothing really different than what you would have used in high school that is universal, there might be a couple things based on your classes",
