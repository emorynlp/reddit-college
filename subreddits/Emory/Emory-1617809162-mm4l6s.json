  "text": "Hey guys! I am currently a high school senior and will be graduating in just over a month. I applied to 3 colleges (UGA, GT, and Emory) last fall and got accepted into all 3. I am planning on majoring in either business or political science (leaning towards business because it pays much better) although I am also thinking about law school or possibly getting an MBA after I graduate. My financial situation regarding college generally is not super great, as my EFC is a respectable 25k and my parents are not exactly eager or able to put much money towards my education. That means I\u2019m going to have to borrow pretty much the entire cost of college. If Emory is gonna cost me around 18.5-19k a year w/ my current financial aid package vs about 15.7k at GT or 12k at UGA, is it worth the added cost? I have looked into salary stats and all kinds of different info and this decision is proving to be REALLY difficult for me. I\u2019m curious if any of you current/former Emory students have some advice that might help my decision-making process here. Thanks!\n\nAlso, two more questions real quick. Firstly, how does Emory\u2019s business program work? I know it\u2019s a separate school but do they still give need-based aid to undergrads or is that just something I wouldn\u2019t even be able to consider? Second, could I appeal to see if I can get a better aid package? My only real reason for this would be that my dad is a liver transplant recipient and my mom is dealing with a bout of arthritis in her knee. \n\nOne more note - my estimated costs above are excluding transportation and living expenses because I\u2019m not going to borrow money for either of those things. \nThanks again and I\u2019m curious to see what you guys have to say!",

I agree it is the best out of the schools I applied to and the best in GA but I was under the impression it was closer to a top 20 business school. Also, the salary stats I\u2019ve seen for Emory and GT business undergrads look extremely close (both just shy of 70k starting). I don\u2019t mean to start a fight or anything I\u2019m just curious.",

      "text": "If you are set or considering careers like IB, consulting, PE, etc. right after graduation, then Emory is definitely worth it. UGA and Tech don\u2019t have the same pull on Wall St. and you will make your money back within the first year. \n\nOn the flip side, if you aren\u2019t sure you want to go for an \u201celite\u201d finance role right after graduation, I would consider looking at the other schools. Not to mention these spots are still incredibly competitive and you may not even be interested in these roles. Having a benchmark salary that you feel like you need to reach right after graduation (as well as pigeonholing yourself to a few companies and roles that you may or may not enjoy) is stressful to think about constantly and can definitely ruin your mental health. \n\nEmory\u2019s pre-law program is very good (or so I\u2019ve heard) and I\u2019ve also heard that they place very well. Lastly, Emory has a very different social culture than GT and UGA so that is a factor I would also consider. All three of these schools are great choices to have.",
