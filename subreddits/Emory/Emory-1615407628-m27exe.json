      "text": "Advantages: networking; large group of people you share something in common with (that being said, you\u2019re not \u201cpaying for friends,\u201d because being in Greek life does not guarantee that your sisters/brothers will be your friends); philanthropic work and fundraising for organizations you support; fun events/formal; leadership opportunities within the frat/sorority or in larger organizations (I don\u2019t remember what it was called, Panhellenic board I think?); be a part of something larger than yourself and have the opportunity to make a difference on campus and in the community \n\nDisadvantages: very expensive (typically...I remember paying a couple hundred bucks each semester just to be in the sorority, and that doesn\u2019t include T-shirt\u2019s, formal, etc. the first semester is the most expensive, I think I paid $600 that semester); weekly chapter meetings (can range in time from 45 minutes to hours depending on what is being discussed); cattiness and arguments occur regularly (typically immature and resolve quickly, but still); mandatory events (not all are mandatory, but most of ours were; studying for an exam is not an excuse. If you didn\u2019t attend the events you were fined)\n\nSocial life: I feel like I explained it above\n\nWorkload: depends on your course load, if you work or not, how difficult your courses are, and your schedule/study habits before Greek life. We had mandatory study hours we had to log each week, but it was maybe 10 hours per week, so we all get that in a few days, but If you forgot to log it you were in trouble. For me, the mandatory events, chapter meetings, and other responsibilities I had prior to Greek life made my schedule way too packed for my own good. It was a struggle but I made it work. \n\nFinal remarks: it\u2019s great for leadership development and philanthropic opportunities, you have a larger group of people you share something in common with - BUT, you are not paying for friends. And you can end up paying a lot. It is a time commitment but some people don\u2019t mind it. \n\nWould I do it again? Probably not. Since graduating from undergrad, being in a sorority has not helped me in networking aspects, and I spent a lot of money to be in the sorority that I should have saved. It did help me with volunteering hours and philanthropy, and it helped make me a better leader, but I don\u2019t think that outweighs the disadvantages. I hope that helps.",

              "text": "Also, I didn\u2019t go to undergrad at Emory, so I can\u2019t speak on what Emory\u2019s Greek life is like, but I figured it would be similar. That being said, I did go to Emory for grad school and did not get involved with my sorority\u2019s Emory chapter (didn\u2019t have the time plus no desire; also the one time I reached out to them to sell some previous sorority stuff they never responded to me lol). \n\nMembership fees are a doozy, especially the semester you join, but this might not be the case for other campuses and all sororities/fraternities. Be sure to ask current members and do your research! There were a lot of people who would rush, go through the pledging period, and then leave because of the financial strain. \n\nFor the networking part, I don\u2019t think my particular field (I\u2019m in medicine now so I was a bio major in undergrad) would result in me benefiting from the connections I would make through my sorority. If I was in business, marketing, education, or something of the sort, it would probably help more.\n\nEdited because I wanted to add something and  wow I type a lot and it\u2019s kind of hard to read.",

I'm premed and bio and absolutely hate networking, so it's nice to know that people don't have to do a ton of it to be successful. \n\nFrats and sororities aren't my type of crowd I don't think, but interesting to hear abt nonetheless :)",

Additionally, you could look at the Greek life on campus and see what their philanthropies are; the ones associated with my sorority were things I was passionate about and were science oriented so it worked out.",
