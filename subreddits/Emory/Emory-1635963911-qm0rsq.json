  "title:": "What are the hardest core classes for Goizueta BBA?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI was just accepted to the Goizueta BBA program from Oxford and want to plan out my schedule for the Spring sem. I'm taking a couple harder courses for my QSS double major next semester, and thus don't want to overload too many difficult BBA courses at the same time. What would you say are the hardest courses out of the core classes? If you could rank them in difficulty somewhat, that would be amazing.\n\nHere are the core classes for reference:\n\nACT 211 (Managerial Acct) \n\nFIN 320 (Corporate Finance) \n\nOAM 330 (Organization and Mgmt.) \n\nMKT 340 (Marketing Mgmt.) \n\nISOM 351 (Process & Systems Mgmt.) \n\nOAM 331 (Strategic Mgmt)",
