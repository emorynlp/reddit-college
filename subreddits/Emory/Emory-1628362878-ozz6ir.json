I\u2019m interested in the subject but hesitant to take it this fall because it\u2019s only being offered online...\n\nPeople who were on campus last year- does Emory provide quiet (or even proctored) testing locations for online class, or will I have to scramble to find a place to test...",

The only proctoring was if your prof made you take the exam through lockdown browser where your camera is on to watch you take your test. Not sure how it\u2019ll work this semester though.",
