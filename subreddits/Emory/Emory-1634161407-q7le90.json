  "text": "Hi all!\n\nI'm a sophomore student who just got into the b school (yay) and is considering the MSBA program. I'm just wondering if anyone knows how competitive it is to get into the MSBA program as a BBA student - should I expect something like the BBA admissions or something like admission into Emory?",

      "text": "BBA/MSBA from 2020, from my understanding, most BBAs are basically a shoo-in, as long as you talk to Allison and she knows who you are and what your plans are, and do all the requirements. I\u2019ve only known 1 BBA person to get straight up rejected. Idk if the competitiveness has gone up due to the popularity of the program, but I suspect they are more likely to adapt for larger cohorts than reject BBAs cuz money. So you should be fine.",
