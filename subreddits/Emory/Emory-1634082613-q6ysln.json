  "text": "Just had this random idea of a collaborative study guide maker for people to use before exams. The point is instead of sharing a Quizlet set (usually made by one person) or a Google Doc (a bit messy and unorganized with too many people working on it), people could use a more structured and systematic tool?\n\nI know this might not be helpful for every situation, but just let me know why you think it's good/bad!",
