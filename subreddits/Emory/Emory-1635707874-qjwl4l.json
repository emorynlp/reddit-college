      "text": "I'm willing to bet most of them are relatively easy or at least have sufficient grade inflation/ease.  Whether or not they have a high reading or workload depends on the PROFESSOR so showing us a list of courses that fall under this is not that helpful unless we know who is teaching them and if they are even offered frequently.",

That being said, I have a feeling most of these courses will be tailored more towards giving students some perspective and knowledge rather than trying to kill their GPAs. I would definitely expect a decent amount of writing in any of these though.",

          "text": "Yeah the classes were pre-existing and have just been reallocated to this requirement.  What I wonder is whether or not people can like triple dip beyond this GER and a CWR.  Like do they still cross with HSCs or HAPs(I forget?) or did they get pulled out of those categories and isolated into this new GER?  I suspect they just found an assortment of classes that met the goals of the GER and are naturally not thinking about intensity (like this is what originally happened with the CWR.  They used to just let everybody with some writing designate their course a CWR and eventually they had to start regulating and laying specific criteria and assessing whether or not the courses met them.  And some eventually lost their CWR status. I suspect this GER will be altered over time as well). \n\n It is ultimately up to students if they wanna take a more serious professor or course in the area and I suspect most who do choose to will be those who major in the host department.However, humanities/social sciences at Emory is one area where I've seen lots of pleasant surprises like STEM majors and whatnot taking more intensive special topics that fullfill GERs purely out of interest so who knows?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is very interesting.  I didn't think they'd actually go through with this one or thought they would delay it due to COVID and all the weird enrollment patterns (which I bet was also a part of the considerations in terms of what became a part of this GER and what didn't.  You could theoretically help some traditionally low enrollment courses out).",
