      "text": "Someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong but usually 3 hours corresponds to 1 credit. So if you plan to work 9 hours a week, you request 3 credits. This is pretty much up to you to figure out based on your availability. Usually these credits don\u2019t satisfy major requirements but I think they can go towards something in the honors program in the department you are doing research with. Best thing would be to ask your advisor or look on the department website.",

          "text": "idk about other departments but at least in Bio you can't choose how many hours/credits you want it to be. 499 is min 4 credits and i think 399 is 3. workwise it really depends on your lab and PI/mentors, i worked in an informatics lab and i generally had < 6 hours a week + 2 hours of meetings to total 8 hours a week for my lab. still got 4 credits every semester for it. others may find themselves working 20 hours for the same 4 credits (happened to a friend of mine).\n\nin the bio department, 499 will count for an upper level lab elective if you do it for a year, since the 499 program has you write a paper (fall) and present a poster (spring)",

      "text": "What department are you in? It really depends. You usually need to get the research opportunity approved or even set up through your department (e.g. Research in Sociology Experience is for-credit, 2 semesters-elective-counted research). So for me, a year of the RISE program took two electives out of my major reqs for sociology. I would reach out to advisors/professors in your major/intended major to ask how it works.",
