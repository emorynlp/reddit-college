  "text": "I am going into sophomore year and currently have yet to take any math or computer science courses, but I got into programming on my own this summer and took a lot in HS. IF I wanted to switch my major from business to CS, could I still graduate in time assuming things go fine? Perhaps just going for the BA instead of BS would make it easier. Otherwise I could also just do business and minor in CS as a last resort\u2026 I am signed up for calc and CS 170 at Oxford this semester.",

              "text": "Ask them for the whole story though because while they certainly were smart (as you are!), they could have toyed with CS early on and had taken 170/171 and perhaps the associated intermediate maths by sophomore year so that switching to it from something else wasn't exactly the toughest transition.  What you'd need to know is if they literally just started ALL of the requirements as a junior.",
