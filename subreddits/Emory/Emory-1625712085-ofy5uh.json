  "text": "Hello, incoming freshman here. I sent an email a week and a half ago to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions explaining a few circumstances that caused my grades to dip this semester. I haven't heard back from them yet, but I don't know if they normally respond to these types of emails or just take note of them and then move on.\n\nDoes anyone know if I should be expecting a response or if it just takes them a bit to respond? Any help would be appreciated!",
