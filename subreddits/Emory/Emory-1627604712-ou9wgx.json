  "text": "My son is class of 2025. He wants to do nursing. I don't know if this applies to all majors or some or only nursing, but what I read is that for nursing you basically do all your generals, including pre-reqs, in your first two years. Then you do only courses for the major the last two years. \n\nIs there any wiggle room on this? He wants to take 4 years of a language, which would obviously not be possible otherwise.",
