  "text": "Hey guys, throwaway account because my actual username has my first name in it and I don\u2019t want my friends on campus finding my reddit account haha. Basically the question in the title. I\u2019m a very recent ex-christian and it\u2019s been pretty hard on my mental health to see how my family has taken it. It\u2019s also drastically changed how I view the world. Back home I\u2019ve found a group of fellow ex-christians and having that community has been so immensely helpful. I was wondering if anybody knew of a way I could find a similar community on campus now that we\u2019ll be back in the fall. Thanks!",
