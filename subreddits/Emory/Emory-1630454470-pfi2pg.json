Her exams were multiple choice and short answer i think so u do kinda have to pay attention. she tries to be funny in class but comes off as awkward but the class wasn\u2019t difficult at all.",

      "text": "I have her this semester! She's very humorous but I have yet to see what her tests are like. So far I'm really enjoying the class. Idk how much attendance policies matter to you, but she doesn't take attendance or mark points off for being absent or anything. \n\nMy only complaints are that she doesn't give lecture notes or recordings (I'm taking the class online).",
