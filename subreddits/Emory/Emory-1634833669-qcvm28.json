  "text": "Hi all! \n\nDoes anyone here have experience with SPAN 212? I heard from a friend it's basically Spanish Shakespeare and it's really awful, I got placed in it when I tried the Spanish placement test. \n\nI'm interested in branching off somewhere new and trying Portuguese but I read on the SPAN/PORT webpage that profs recommend I take SPAN 212 before starting a PORT class. \n\nI'm just not sure how to feel about this/what to do. Any advice would be incredibly helpful! TIA!",

      "text": "Currently in 212 with Prof. Sierra. Basically we read a new story/poem for every class, answer some comprehension questions about it for hw, and then come to class to discuss. There\u2019s also a group project for the semester where you give a full class length presentation about a Spanish movie (with the whole presentation being given in Spanish). There\u2019s also the occasional grammar lesson. Overall, don\u2019t think the work load is horrible, but it\u2019s definitely more of a literature class than a class to learn the language.",
