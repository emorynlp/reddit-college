  "text": "Hi all! \n\nDoes anyone here have experience with SPAN 212? I heard from a friend it's basically Spanish Shakespeare and it's really awful, I got placed in it when I tried the Spanish placement test. \n\nI'm interested in branching off somewhere new and trying Portuguese but I read on the SPAN/PORT webpage that profs recommend I take SPAN 212 before starting a PORT class. \n\nI'm just not sure how to feel about this/what to do. Any advice would be incredibly helpful! TIA!",
