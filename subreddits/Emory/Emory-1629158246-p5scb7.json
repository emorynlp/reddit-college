      "text": "I don't think that's true (public schools with bigger programs are more likely to offer it to undergraduates, but I doubt they require it).  That course is common in engineering and stand alone engineering science programs though.  For example, let us look at some near peers and then an aspirational peer.\n\nThis is VU's requirements:\n\n[https://as.vanderbilt.edu/physics/undergraduate/courses.php](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/physics/undergraduate/courses.php)\n\nAnd it appears no fluid dynamics (or fluid anything) course was offered between this past spring and nor is it being offered in fall\n\nWUSTL:\n\n[https://bulletin.wustl.edu/undergrad/artsci/physics/#majors](https://bulletin.wustl.edu/undergrad/artsci/physics/#majors)\n\nSame thing with the course offerings\n\nCornell does not require it:\n\n[https://physics.cornell.edu/courses](https://physics.cornell.edu/courses)\n\nAnd only offers the course as a graduate level course\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKing Harvard is also similar:[https://www.physics.harvard.edu/grad/requirements](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/grad/requirements)\n\n(engineering sciences seems to offer a grad course in it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmong non-peers that are STEM focused, we see that Georgia Tech has no such requirement either:\n\nhttps://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/physics-general-bs/#requirementstext",
