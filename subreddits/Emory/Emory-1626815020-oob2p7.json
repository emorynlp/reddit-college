Mine just took too long to come back, like about a fortnight or sth. \nYou can wait a bit longer perhaps, but then I know a lot of people are trying to plan their timetables so knowing which class is gonna be pretty helpful. Maybe try email them Thursday Friday if u still don\u2019t get the results then?",
