  "title:": "Oxford Q&A",
  "text": "An incoming college freshman recently asked me about what it's like at Oxford, my friend and I decided to write a whole doc on some FAQs about the ox experience rather than doing our final assignments because it was 4am and we were bored. \n\nbackground about us (fake names): We're both incoming seniors studying some sort of business-related major. Nina - try hard business student, graduated oxford early, on top of her stuff. // Em - I dont really care about school and i'm just trying to graduate and get a job.\n\n**Typical weekday and weekend schedule? hours of studying per day? Schedule Difference in oxford vs emory?**\u00a0\n\n* Nina: Oh lmao this really varies. Em studies less than I do but she also had more fun so it\u2019s dependent on whatever you want to do. Also how much you want a good GPA. Ox professors are more anal about the details so you have to work a little harder to get an A than in ATL from my experience. However, that being said the professors are a lot more invested in you at Ox so it\u2019s a trade off. Note: if you want leadership roles in ATL you need to interview freshman year and don\u2019t say you\u2019re from Oxford. It\u2019s hard to get leadership roles and get involved that late into the game (when you graduate from Oxford). Going to Ox just requires more foresight and planning than being in ATL but it makes it easier to get internships and research positions early on because you immediately get leadership roles but the real transition that you need to prepare for is when you leave Ox. Don\u2019t just leave ox without a little prep otherwise you\u2019ll be caught with your balls in your hands\n* Em -  I think I heard some oxford classes are actually harder than Emory\u2019s, really just depends.\u00a0smaller classes means more attention from professors if you utilize correctly.\n\n**food, i heard the food is \"healthy\" at oxford but not very good**\n\n* Nina: I just cooked so idk what Lils (the cafeteria) offered\n* Em - yeah that\u2019s basically true. I just lived off of cup ramen. Oxford\u2019s dining hall actually has an online menu that shows what they serve daily, I just looked at it before making a trip to the dining hall and if it looked decent I went, if not I settled for ramen. Sometimes I had cereal for dinner. They usually always have some kind of pizza and burgers for anyone that\u2019s suuuper picky.\u00a0Highly recommend buying an electric pot so you can cook in your room, best decision I ever made. \n\n**dorms, describe general shape. Heard there are 3 good dorms and 2 bad ones at oxford**\n\n* Nina: I lived in the good ones both years. Not bad at all, clean, neat, and amenities still pretty new. Em got the ass dorm freshman year\n* Em - BUY DAMPRIDS (moisture absorber) especially if you live in the bad dorms (JRC and Haygood). Also pretty small, I brought way too much stuff and had a hard time fitting my stuff. The dorms are just typical small college dorms, even though I had the shitty one my first year I got used to it once we bought a dehumidifier \n\n**summer activity? Internship/research opportunities, extra classes?**\n\n* Nina: if you want to get credit counted from a different university other than emory, you need to take classes the year after your freshman year otherwise it doesn\u2019t count with very few exceptions (there\u2019s a whole petition process and it costs money with no guarantees). Also for internship and research opportunities, if you\u2019re bio/stem/premed they post opportunities on the science building walls. Apply to them, plan for recs and ask profs or advisors for timelines of when to prep or apply for research opps. If you\u2019re a freshman business or prelaw student then just apply and see if you can get anything. Chances are you won\u2019t if you\u2019re business cuz they don\u2019t want freshmen so use nepotism if possible or work for some small firm (think your dad\u2019s friend\u2019s small accounting firm or something like that). For prelaw do whatever the fuck you\u2019re interested in they don\u2019t care about your major just your gpa so if you\u2019re passionate about something do it bc you\u2019ll more likely be good at it anyways.\u00a0\n* Em - why are u worrying about this as an underclassman\u00a0\n\n**places to study**\n\n* Nina: student center but it\u2019s kind of noisy (I prefer quiet spaces) so I usually studied in a building that literally doesn\u2019t exist anymore sooooooo maybe your dorm?\n* Em - way better + more than my first year since they built a new student center. There\u2019s actually a good amount of places to study and as you live there you\u2019ll find the ones that work for you (study areas in the dorms, library, student center (louder environment), certain classrooms that are open\u00a0\n\n**club activity**\n\n* Nina: I was involved in Everview Consulting Group and tbh I have no idea what they\u2019re doing on the oxford campus anymore so I have like no suggestions. If you\u2019re business join OxVentures since it leads to EEVM but ngl it\u2019s prolly better if you just apply to ATL\u2019s EEVM straight instead and say you\u2019re ATL not ox when you apply. Just go to the club fair and figure out what will take you wherever you want to go\n* Em - kind of hard because you have to go through an application + interview process for every club my first year i literally got into one it was so sad but second year i got into more and it was litty you just need to be lowkey extroverted and outgoing (even if it\u2019s fake) for the first few weeks. If you r like me and dunno wut u want to do just join the social / cultural clubs it will GREATLYYYY help you not be a hermit.\n\n**transportation**\n\n* Nina: whatever Em said + shuttles aren\u2019t HORRIBLE if you don\u2019t go during popular times aka friday night or saturday + if you take the shuttles back to Ox go back NOT on the last shuttle back cuz if it\u2019s too full they\u2019ll kick you out and you get to fucking lyft back home sucks to fucking suck\n* Em - Schedule everything out. Don\u2019t miss shuttles but always have a back-up plan in case you do (again, befriend people from the main atl campus so you can crash at their place when needed lol) if u have a license sign up for enterprise car rental, literally a life saver. Other than that shuttle + uber/lyft is the only way i spent so much money on that lol also befriend people who have cars!!!!!!! USE THEM (and then pay for their gas)\n\n**entertainment? Heard theres nothing to do at oxford except getting high and drunk in your room, also heard it takes 100 bucks per trip to Atlanta or anywhere to actually go out**\n\n* Nina: Oxford is hella boring.\n* Em - befriend people on main campus or else yeah this is all there is.\u00a0If you decide to go out to atlanta or duluth, always go with a group of people to split costs. I don't think it takes $100 unless you're getting food and doing some activity that costs money.\n\n**graduating oxford in 3 semesters, is it hard? With ap credits? How many extra classes?**\u00a0\n\n* Nina: If you took AP credit that transfers, it\u2019s easy to graduate early if you come in with the max (12 credit hours with AP Lit or Lang included). You do have to plan carefully and they are trying to make it more difficult, but it\u2019s doable. At times you will have to sacrifice interesting classes for classes that hit more than one requirement but it\u2019s fine cuz ATL campus has more options and more interesting classes. However, do plan to take full loads for those three semesters. I took 18 or 19 credits every semester but please keep in mind I took two PE courses and one bogus class that they encourage you to take in case you want to be an orientation leader (Learning to Lead; the class is legit so stupid and easy). Just knock out requirements if you aren\u2019t sure what to major in AND you want to graduate early but if you\u2019re in the business school make sure you graduate early (flat out it\u2019s dumb if you don\u2019t graduate early as a business school student since you\u2019ll be behind the ATL students).\n* Em - if you decide from the get-go to graduate early and plan according should be fine. Talk to your advisor and just take the max amount of credits every semester (of course this is easier said than done)\n\n**possible to work while attending school?**\u00a0\n\n* Nina - yes, work study is pretty easy just don't work at the farm it's literally physical labor\u00a0\n* Em - yes, oxford offers work-study, although i think this is mostly reserved for fasfa students who get financial aid. My second year i worked as a photographer that was separate from the fasfa work study program so I was able to work even though I didn't receive financial aid. I think I also knew some people who worked at places outside of school but you need a car or else it's kind of impossible.\n\n**possible to change majors?**\u00a0\n\n* Nina - ya as long as you change by sophomore year otherwise you\u2019re kinda fucked in the ass if you\u2019re a business school student cuz double majoring aint fun when you\u2019re figuring out how the hell to fit it with all of the goddamn cores but if you\u2019re just a college student you should be fine\n* Em - i changed my major twice in freshman year then switched to business like two weeks before my sophomore year and changed my entire schedule. Definitely better to change asap since business and nursing schools have pre-requisites but it\u2019s super easy to switch around other than that, just need to make sure you can fulfill all major requirements before graduating.\n\n**other differences between oxford and emory?**\n\n* Nina - either you love ox or you hate ox. There\u2019s def pros and cons but honestly if you plan it well ox can be a real asset since people sophomore year don\u2019t have the leadership positions that ox gives away to literally everyone. A leadership role at ox is like a participatory ribbon-- everyone gets one. Main is better for people that want a bigger community and don\u2019t want to think about the transition.\u00a0\n* Em - oxford sux i wish i applied to UCs :\u2019) jk it\u2019s not bad but i personally wanted to go to a big school so i did not like it, however there\u2019s a decent amount of students who love it. Definitely has its upsides & downsides. My biggest issue is that it's more difficult to be involved with Emory main students as an Oxford student (obviously) and if you want to continue being involved with organizations after Oxford you really need to make connections with those who are already there.",

      "text": "After experiencing both Oxford and Emory, I would 100% pick Oxford again if I had to do college all over. I've never developed such close relationships with my professors, and Oxford had a sense of community (since there is basically nothing else to do off campus). I met my best college friends at Oxford. The classes are better as well (especially for Bio, although Chem is a bit better at ATL). The top of Emory's graduating class are Oxford continuees\n\nWhen I transitioned to ATL campus, I didn't feel a sense of community. It felt more like everyone was focused doing their own thing and beefing up their resumes. Also the bio department at ATL sucks. Oxford definitely got stale by the time I graduated, but I miss the sense of community I got there",

          "text": "The bio department on ATL sucks?  What classes and people did YOU take? I'm just saying.  The course options are pretty darned wide (even compared to some peer unis) that unless you are a cookie cutter pre-med (who often DO take some of the worst classes. Things like bchem, physiology, and developmental....eh. I guess the memorizers will enjoy them for a grade but most of those teachers suck or are as dry as you can get) bio major, you probably won't even have the same experience.",
