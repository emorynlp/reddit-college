      "text": "I went through the scholars process this year (though it was moved online due to covid) and had a blast, even though i didn't get the scholarship I still got 25,000 as a liberal arts scholar. pretty damn good concession prize if you ask me, and i'm having a decent time as a first year! I got an email on Feb. 19th saying that I was selected, though i'm sure the dates are flexible. good luck!",
