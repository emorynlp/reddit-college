      "text": "Just wait because different instructors have different variations in terms of the workload, point distribution, etc.  Just know that it'll cover basics of evolution, natural selection, very basic genetics(think standard punnett squares and stuff. Linkage, epistasis, and all that is in 142), general cell biology (transport, organelles and associated processes and the experiments like pulse-chase that monitor them), basic transcription/translation/replication (142 treats in much more detail with regards to regulation and influence on signaling) cancer biology (cell cycle), metabolism (cellular respiration/photosynthesis with a bigger emphasis on the chemistry than AP), and then blend some of this stuff to discuss things like ecology, the carbon cycle, and climate change at the end.   \n\nThis is what they've been doing for the past 2-3 years at least.  They can easily change it as biol 141/142 seems to be the most unstable intro STEM sequence in terms of topic arrangement and coverage.",
