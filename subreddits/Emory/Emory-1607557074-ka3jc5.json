      "text": "I\u2019ve dreamed of going to Emory since I was in middle school. I\u2019ve worked my ass off for the past 4 years to earn a 3.8 UW with 12 APs and all the honors classes my school had to offer and sumbitted a 1490 SAT. (predicted 1500+ for dec. SAT) When i received the rejection letter to Emory my heart sank and I felt numb for a couple of seconds than cried for 30 minutes. I felt like everything I worked so hard for the past 4 years lead to nothing. Everything I did was to help me get into Emory; The countless nights spent studying, the hours poured into extracurriculars and SAT prep, all gone to waste. I\u2019m feeling much better now but It will take me a while to recover my confidence. This rejection will probably make me reconsider a lot of the schools on my list- USC, Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Cornell all look to be far far out of reach. I know I shouldn\u2019t be settling just yet but not getting into a school you poured your entire soul into really hurts.",

          "text": "Rejected. I've also dreamed of going to Emory or Oxford as most of the people around me whether it's my closest friends or family are all in Emory. I had a gpa UW 3.76 and took the hardest IB courses offered at my school - 6 IB courses in the DP program. I had an SAT of 1490 and my ecs were spot on emphasizing how much I loved to support my community. Even during Corona my school continually opened so I did not cheat in any form. \n\nGetting a rejection from Emory really hurts. I've spent countless all nighters worrying about this and getting prepared for the finals. I've done everything I could so far and I deeply empathize with you. I love Emory and I still do. However, at the same time, I know that I've been rejected because..........God has a plan for me. For the past 4 years of high school, my life has been rough and there was never really a rising trend. I prayed to God everyday and night for this opportunity and crying myself to sleep banging my head on my desk to control my sanity. When I saw that I did not see Congratulations, I instantly felt anger, grief, sadness, and the worst feeling of all - loss. I was planning to thank everyone around me friends, teachers, family, but I have let them down. I cried and cried. However, I cried alone - not even in front of my family - and I will not cry in front of them. I will not cry in front of another or show that I am weak because that means I have lost in this game of college. I know some place will see our efforts and someone will understand what we've been through. We will get through this with a real school. Reputation is not everything and the other schools will certainly accept us. It still pains me to believe in this reality but people have been through worse and I don't have a single right in this world to complain that I got rejected. All I can do is move forward and take a gamble. I still love Emory and I sincerely congratulate all the acceptees. Hooray! \n\nI will take this opportunity to widen my perspective and this weakness will be a teacher for me for modesty once again. Thank you everyone here and whether rejected or not, in the end, we will win this game.",

              "text": "Thank you so so much for your kind words! You have no idea how much I appreciate it!! After a day of taking in my rejection I know for a fact I\u2019m done with sulking, coming up with what if scenarios, and certainly done with feeling sad. I\u2019ve accepted the possibility that I might not attend a T30 school and I\u2019ve come to realize that it is totally fine! As you said before where you go for undergrad doesn\u2019t have much bearing on where you end up in the future- I plan on being a dentist so I feel like the school that I can graduate with the least debt is my best option. Nonetheless, I\u2019m still going to give all the colleges I\u2019ve wanted to apply to pre-rejection my best shot, especially since I predict for my December sat to be a good few points higher haha. The first rejection hurts the most, especially if that rejection comes from your dream school but it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ll give up easily. I\u2019ve received admission to ASU, MSU, and Pitt, all with extremely generous merit based scholarships, have applied to UW Seattle(state school), and Tulane (EA), but will still apply to Tufts(possibly ED2), Umich, Georgetown, Carleton College, USC, Cornell, Boston College, UNC Chapel Hill, and Notre Dame. I know these are all reaches but I\u2019d rather get rejected from all of these than live with not ever knowing if I could have gotten in. In the end, it is what it is. Perhaps it was a weakness in my application. Perhaps the admissions officers had a bad lunch. I\u2019ll never know and perhaps that is a good thing. I\u2019ll update everyone come April/May. To everyone else who is in the same boat, we just have to keep trying and pushing through! I believe in all of us to do amazing things-extraordinary thing regardless of the schools we go to. But for now we can all dream a little and try our best.",
