      "text": "Tuition is usually due about a week and a half before the start of school. I think with COVID and the switch around with the start dates and the financial aid recalculation that\u2019s going on, finding any official answer on Emory\u2019s financial website is sort of difficult. I know it\u2019s not a super helpful answer but I would check OPUS for the bill starting around August 5 unless they email or update the website. If you wait until the first day of class to pay you will be charged a late fee.",
