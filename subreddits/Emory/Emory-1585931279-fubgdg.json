  "text": "What is the atmosphere/vibe like at Emory? I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s very work focused and a stressful atmosphere is that true? Could someone give a run down of their experience (anecdotes would be great!) \n\nWhat are faculty/student relations like? What do most students do on week nights and weekend nights? Is social life on campus or not? Are frats big?",

      "text": "It\u2019s def very work focused. Everyone really cares about their success and you\u2019ll see people in the library everyday of the week at all hours. However it\u2019s very manageable usually (depending on what classes you take Ofc). The only time it\u2019s really gotten stressful (for me personally) is during midterm season. So it\u2019s like 3 weeks of normal grinding, then one week where it picks up just fo prep for exams. \n\nStudent teacher relationships are great. The benefit of a smaller school like Emory is that the almost all professors sincerely care about their students\u2019 success. I love talking to my professors at office hours and have learned some crazy stuff about their research and their lives. \n\nThe social life isn\u2019t super party oriented. There are definitely frat parties and apartment parties and all, but cuz we have no sports and we\u2019re so academics focused, there aren\u2019t huge ragers constantly. But if you know the right people or are in Greek life, you\u2019ll always have something to do if you choose. \n\nAtlanta is also a cool city and there\u2019s tons of things to do there on weekends (museums, parks, hikes, restaurants, etc).",

      "text": "There\u2019s a big difference between weekend and weekday imo. Weekdays, everyone is sort of grinding and doing their own thing. People still try to have fun with it but everyone\u2019s generally busy. On the weekend people during the day will try to get work done but will have fun at night. Of course not every single weekend will be super fun, like during finals or midterms,  but generally people find time to relax.\n\nIt\u2019s stressful at times but it emory wouldn\u2019t be such an awesome school if it was super easy.\n\nFrat life is pretty big imo, but clubbing and bars are also pretty big. You can choose to do either and won\u2019t really miss out. It\u2019s the perfect amount of parties where it\u2019s not distracting but also not completely boring. (We could go for a few more though on campus)\n\nStudent teacher relations depend on the class. If you\u2019re in a 100 person lecture like Econ 101, it\u2019s not impossible to get to know the prof really well, but you definitely have to try. On the other hand, one of my classes is 2 people total plus the prof, pretty easy to build a relationship. Emory is undergrad oriented, so you\u2019ll definitely benefit from that as well.",
