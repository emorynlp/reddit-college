  "text": "So I need to fulfill the lab requirement. I would take the BIOL 120 lab course, but since I already have the BIOL 141 credit from the AP bio exam, I'm fairly certain I'm not allowed to take that course. (At least, that's what it says on the course atlas)\n\nI'm thinking of taking the BIOL 141L class instead, but I'm unsure whether that's a good idea or not. I loved biology in high school, but I'm not sure how hard the course will be since I'm not really a STEM person. \n\nWhat are y'all's thoughts?",

      "text": "I'm not a STEM person myself, but I found that both intro biology labs were not that hard. They can be a little time-consuming just by the nature of being a lab, but not anywhere near a chem lab's workload. I think you'll have fun and have an appreciation for some research aspects in biology. You'll get some practice with experimental techniques as well.\n\nIf you liked biology, I don't think you'll have a hard time at all.",

      "text": "I think you CAN still do 120 IF you don't formally use the AP biology credit (because you can only apply 4), but you may want to check with an advisor.  HOWEVER, unlike lecture, 141-L is apparently not that bad and if you indeed loved bio in high school, it probably won't feel that hard to you.  If you think you may enjoy the area, maybe at least try it out.  There is nothing saying that once you get to college, doing anything even a tad bit challenging outside of one's INTENDED (keep an open mind please) major is simply not worthwhile.  You don't have to take that approach (and what if this allows you to discover that a bio BA may be something you end up being interested in).  You can do whatever you want within reason.  \n\nThe instructor will give you a syllabus, likely explain how the lab will work and you can make your decision based upon the information you get.  Like most of the people who say: \"Please just find me the easiest SNT fullfillments\" admit that they are essentially STEM averse which is clearly not the case for you so don't feel weird if you take 141-L. You'll fullfill the requirement and you may even enjoy being among a crowd more likely to have also enjoyed bio in HS.",
