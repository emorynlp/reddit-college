      "text": "Pre covid, most of Cox was normally also open for dinner on weekdays. You can use dooley at the dct technically but it is so overpriced basically no one does it except for those on dooley only upperclassman plans.\n\nRemember that you can add additional dooley dollars mid semester. I'd go with the most meal swipes that you can use. The 100 swipe plan has you paying $18 / per swipe, while the 450 DD plan has \\~$16 per swipe and the 180 swipe plan is \\~$11.50/per swipe. All of these plans are not meant to cover all of your food needs so you'll either need to grocery shop/cook, eat off campus, or buy additional dooley dollars. Therefore, if you think you'll struggle to use 100 swipes, get that plan. But if you think you can easily use 130 or 180 swipes in one semester, getting those plans and then buying extra dooley dollars (or getting food out at Point)  is more economical",
