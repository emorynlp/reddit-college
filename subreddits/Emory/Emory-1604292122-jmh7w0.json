  "text": "Hey y'all - I'm a student across town at Georgia Tech. Some fellow students and I made an internship review platform called [Canary](https://canarystudent.com/) to help students learn what it's like to intern at different companies and avoid bad internships while finding good ones. Thought I'd throw it in here if y'all would find it useful too! The site is [canarystudent.com](https://canarystudent.com). We're growing at Tech and want to open it up to other schools too. Also we're giving out amazon gift cards too if that interests you lol",
