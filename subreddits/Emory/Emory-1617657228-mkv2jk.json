  "text": "Hi guys! I will most likely be beginning at the Oxford campus this coming fall and was wondering what the best classes and who the best professors are at Ox? If it\u2019s important I\u2019m probably going to major in something STEM related (I\u2019m divided between Physics, CS, QSS, and NBB) and go to medical school.",
