The TAs were really supportive, helpful, and engaging. He is open to taking questions and the tests are pretty easy. Then again, I took his class via zoom so the experience might be different from yours (if you plan to take his class).",

      "text": "I didn't go here for undergrad, but several of my classmates have attended Emory undergrad. They all took Abreu for 141/142 and stated that he was good for an intro bio course and did not put them at any disadvantage for MCAT/future bio classes. They also said he was pretty laid-back and his TAs were super helpful and accessible if any questions arose.",

          "text": "I'm a skeptic of anyone having a negative effect on prep for future bio classes because many students only take the memorization oriented upper divisions or more intuitive problem solving focused ones like evolutionary biology.  But we know that historically people like Spell, and then De Roode/Cole for their brief stint did give advantages for the more research intensive upper divisions that required lots of scientific paper reading and critical thinking on exams, like Eisen, Beck's, and some other courses that tended to be less \"straight-forward\"(think physiology,  developmental, and bchem 1, Quave's classes,etc).  \n\nAnd the MCAT, I'm mainly concerned about those who aren't bio or NBB majors especially since they recently changed the 141/142 people curriculum. Other bio majors who know what is good for them will take cell or genetics today(as in after taking the current biol 141/142 renditions). But back then (depending on the cohort you are referring to) the biol curric. was just better no matter who taught it, especially bio 142 (covered lots more biotechnology and experimental molecular genetics).",

                  "text": "Oh yeah they took old bio curric. and they had Abreu during the \"good years\" (he was new and surrounded by rigorous teachers so there wasn't much cost for being a tad more difficult).   They actually had a super strong line up of bio teachers then.  Yeah Emory is always changing stuff up for STEM and the intro bio curric. Is one of the most unstable among the intro. Sequences.  Even when I attended, it went through a couple of phases.\n\nFunny to see downvotes for a relatively harmless comment.  Guess people hate hearing: \"Hey you should take people and classes who do more of X even if they are a little more difficult\". No one who feels they must be over-protective of GPA wants to hear stuff like \"challenging yourself in some areas may actually be helpful\" or \"no, the Covid pre-health cores were not at their normal calibre\" (they weren't). It is what it is though. Emory will just have to keep a 50-55% pre-med success rate because with some of these attitudes and loopholes, it won't improve even as Emory gets even more selective at the undergrad level.",

      "text": "The trick is that some professors are more experienced and have experience with in person teaching whereas Reyes was new and thrown into the frying pan of Covid and online learning his very first year at Emory. I'd keep an open mind about him but I would say that maybe Otoole is a solid choice.\n\n  The in person versions (especially the assessments, but maybe even might have content coverage) of ALL will probably be much more intense than the online versions simply because they are no longer constrained by Canvas/technology when writing assessments AND because there won't be this Covid fatigue (and non-optimal workplaces) among students that more or less pressured them to lessen the intensity (and RMPs during Covid may simply indicate how much each prof. Lessened the intensity of their course vs. Others)\n\n  If pre-grad life sciences or pre-med/pre-pharm(thus taking the MCAT/PCAT which have passage based bio/chem questions that tend to involve higher ordered thinking and problem solving), you need at least decent teaching of content with a decent level and style of rigor.  I think Abreu and Otoole are roughly the same quality(mediocre but caring enough), but Otoole probably at least writes her own assessments and emphasizes the right kind of rigor when she can. Abreu is known to be easy to many but seems to catch lots of people off guard because he often steals assessment items from other sections that some claim they weren't prepared for. Also choosing a professor with only a single section of the course may mean that she can put more effort into helping students(her other class is mostly juniors and sophomores so is likely much more manageable than the 2 sections of bio 141 that Abreu has).\n\nAlso since the syllabi are largely standardized, you may honestly want to tour sections and see who you like.  Just pick one to enroll in when your day comes and go to that one but also find time during early parts of A/D/S(before any serious workload is assigned) to check other instructors out. You may end up liking some of those that weren't recommended by RMP.  Judge for yourself.\n\n Also ask friends in the other sections for their syllabi because there may be subtle differences that may be worthwhile to you. Like some may have graded assignments that help spread the grade out and away from high pressure timed quizzes and exams.  Maybe choose like that because bio profs' quality and even intensity can vary so much from year to year or respond to different pressures.  Like Otoole and Abreu were somewhat recently promoted.  I know at one point(like 5ish years ago and earlier). Abreu was actually much better and was even harder and then suddenly started becoming lazier and easier. Who knows what they'll do post-promotion (senior lecturer status has a bit more perks and security than just lecturer)? And the Covid/online constraints are off now too...",
