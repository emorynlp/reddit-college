      "text": "I'm taking it right now and I really love the class. It emphasizes critical thinking and conceptually understanding key concepts rather than getting caught up in technical details, and establishes lots of foundational knowledge. It also focuses on making the concepts make intuitive sense, which is helpful.\n\nI found the workload pretty reasonable. There were readings and asynchronous videos weekly (which can be a drag sometimes tbh but overall it's ok), and a few group problem sets and quizzes. There wasn't any regularly occurring homework, so it's up to you to make sure you understand each week and go to office hours if needed. I had Dr. McAlister and he's really approachable and friendly.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a good experience and a class definitely worth taking to decide if you want to major in QTM. If you have any other questions, feel free to dm!",
