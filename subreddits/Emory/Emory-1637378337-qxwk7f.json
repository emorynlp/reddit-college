  "text": "This [link](https://forms.gle/iYiqRcii7BquTwaq5) is a survey for a research study in one of my classes where we seek to assess the economic impact of the late 2000s Greek debt crisis on residents of Greece at the time. If this applies to you, it would be much appreciated if you could take the survey and circulate to others who would also be willing to take it \u2013 it's been really hard to get responses, so if you know anyone in this demographic, any circulation would be greatly appreciated (they don't have to be Emory-affiliated). The results are fully anonymous and confidential.\n\nThanks in advance from a student!",

I feel like 60-70% of the people that are white here are Jewish and it\u2019d be so hard to find people that are Greek among the remaining amount.\n\nMaybe you\u2019d have more luck asking students from public universities in areas that have a lot of people with Greek ancestry.",
