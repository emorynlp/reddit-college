  "text": "I\u2019ve been looking at some clubs and going to interest meetings and one in particular recently kind of struck me. It was medicine-related and yet I could tell that the people that were talking didn\u2019t really seem to care at all about what they were doing. It was hard to describe but it seemed like they were only a part of the club to have leadership positions and the lack of passion or interest in the cause their club was behind was pretty palpable.\n\nI\u2019ve seen other clubs at Emory like this too, that either feel the same way or feel *way* too professional. Like again, another medicine-related club seemed overly professional in how they acted and presented and it just felt weird. I don\u2019t know if this is worse or better with clubs in other areas in particular, but so far it seems almost like a third of the clubs at Emory are like that. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, there are plenty of clubs that seem to actually care about what they\u2019re doing and I\u2019m grateful for that, it\u2019s just I didn\u2019t really expect to see a decent amount that seems like they don\u2019t. It\u2019s also totally possible that I could be wrong too and I just had a flawed perception but idk.",

I feel like at least 3 other people have vented to me about this (that I can recall), so your observations are valid (although I'm not so sure about the 1/3 figure lol).\n\nIt's really frustrating, and I'm not sure if you're looking for advice or looking to vent. But here's my unsolicited and uninformed advice: \n\nI see two options: avoid clubs with that vibe or invest significant time and energy into changing the culture of the club (which would probably require getting on the EBoard).",

          "text": "Apparently some of those pre-med magnet orgs can get wild.  I had a good friend who led one back in the dino ages and I still remember when he told me that he had organized a legit volunteering event that involved doctors helping and when the members (basically all pre-meds) arrived, they hijacked it in a manner that kind of drove it to be a large shadowing event.  He was VERY upset (this guy was very serious about service and was a pre-med himself, completing a PhD now in fact).  I have seen weird things from orgs like EURJ too where you can tell when pre-meds ran most of it because many were not interested in its longevity and would show up (and by show up, I even mean get elected to some position) as juniors or seniors who would be able to get it on the CV or resume and then graduate without a transition so the research journal would go completely downhill for like 1-2 years because there was no real handoff.",

      "text": "Yes I warned about that.  Clubs that signal for pre-professionals to join WILL have that feel almost anywhere.  You're honestly more likely to get a more geniune vibe from one of those (can't believe I'm saying this but it is true) business frats/\"Greeks\" or the service \"Greeks\" because it seems they have a bigger range of subscribers.  Most clubs that are ultra specific and even sound like they are targeting those on certain \"tracks\" and aren't part of an academic department end up being resume builder clubs.  You'll have to stay to find the genuine people in them but this isn't an Emory thing. It's the world for you.  \n\n If the incentives are perverse in a way that encourages people to resume stack in a dispassionate way and then be rewarded for it, people will be desperate and look for any opp to do so.  It's kind of like b-school BBA admissions claiming to be \"holistic\" and liking to see students \"challenge\" themselves only to publish their 3.6+ average entering GPA on their website/in their recruiting materials.  That doesn't provide much room for risk or any meaningful challenge. On top of this, they are told that they basically need to already display \"leadership qualities\" as sophomores.  Naturally you are gonna look for clubs that at least allow you to merely claim some leadership role or you gun for a business oriented club to signal specific interest in business.  \n\n\nBasically you're naturally gonna be ultra strategic. Pre-healths face similar pressures that shape their behaviors literally everywhere but especially at elite tier schools so if you are pre-med you are gonna see a lot of things that may rub you (if you consider yourself more genuinely interested than others) the wrong way in clubs that target or even just fit that crowd.   It's just a sad reality.",

          "text": "Well idk, personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything *terribly* wrong with joining a club with the purpose to get an exec position. Like you said, in reality everyone isn\u2019t doing something because they\u2019re passionate about something and it\u2019s really hard to I think. Kind of going on a tangent, but it\u2019s something I noticed from students outside of places like Emory \u2014 a lot of the reasons people go into a certain majors are for reasons like probability instead of genuine interest. The freedom to solely do things we\u2019re truly passionate about is a luxury that few can afford.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel like there\u2019s no reason to act so stiff and to try and actually develop an interest. Like, I don\u2019t know, if I was on the exec board of a golfing club I would still try and act warm and friendly to members and advocate for the sport even if I didn\u2019t really enjoy it myself. I think it\u2019s even easier to do for clubs that are based in humanitarian causes \u2014 I mean, come on, I think it\u2019s easy to be excited about things that are being done for the common good. Even if it\u2019s something like a cancer fundraiser and cancer can be the least of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019re still *helping* people in some capacity. That\u2019s commendable.\n\nIve actually been realizing more and more stuff like this happening too. Guess it\u2019s a part of growing up but personally won\u2019t let it make me become cynical, more so sad that other people have to resort to something like this & aren\u2019t capable of trying to make the best of things.",

              "text": "Now there are some genuinely socially awkward people but you've run into the reality of some people who either don't wanna actually be there or are maybe even a little standoffish/guarded about their club (like perhaps a type of snobbery or cynicism about the intention of newcomers that just so happens to show in their behaviors).  And theoretically it IS easy to get excited about the common good unless you are also told it is something you must do to impress a 3rd party.  Consider learning and how lots of people rather learn (and I mean book/intellectually oriented learning) outside of the pressures of grades and the formalities of the classroom, but then when in coursework and stuff, many no longer want to learn just cause and naturally want to figure out the minimum they need to be able to do to get whatever grade for whatever 3rd party will eventually evaluate them.\n\nThat type of pressure can zap the joy out of learning for even people supposedly great at it (like those who attend Emory and schools like it).  Imagine what happens when a 3rd party evaluator is the primary driving force for you joining a club.  One would hope they aren't jaded, cynical, or even uninterested, but it may very well happen to those who feel like they are sort of just jumping through hoops and I think you deal with an abundance of burnt out students and people at highly selective universities like Emory.  They are just sort of burnt out from whatever they had to do to get to the elite school and to many it is just a dispassionate/numb repeat at a more intense level to get where they are likely being steered towards next.  If you want to read something about what you are likely seeing at Emory, you may want to read \"Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the way to a meaningful Life\".  It isn't the best book or anything in terms of all of the authors ideas, but when you read the anecdotes and alleged quotes, they will read as awfully familiar.  And you can be cynical, that's always fine, but you still have to do what you need to do to make Emory and the world a better place while keeping yourself happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, what you are seeing is kind of like the things I often highlight.   You got people complaining about Emory not having football and wanting to have more \"fun\" and stuff when they can barely bring themselves to enjoy the organizations they join or in some cases lead.  That is sort of why I am convinced that a lot of these \"student life\" issues can be worked out without all this rah rah and D-1 athletics as some quick fix (like these types will find something to complain about.  Like if Emory's fictional big money sports lost or were even just mediocre).  Students really just need to calm down, let loose a bit, and be creative about making Emory a funner, and more enjoyable place to be (including by making some clubs less toxic or more welcoming).  \n\nJust like people are over-relying on these orgs to build a resume (versus say...a personal project), students there always want \"pre-organized fun\" too.  It just always made it a little duller and indeed disingenuous than it had to be.  I never need a ralley and something to cheer for to enjoy myself.  Often a bit of randomness and spontaneity is key to many people's enjoyment, but so many at places like Emory are ultra risk averse and don't wanna be a catalyst for \"fun\" themselves.  It instead must be something pre-existing and sponsored by a \"legit\" sponsor that they can join in on risk free.",
