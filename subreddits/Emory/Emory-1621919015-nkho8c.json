      "text": "If the rest of your classes aren't tough(outside of 203) or if you aren't taking Weinschenk for 203, explore taking biol 250 or 264 over Evol.  Maybe save evol for spring when there may be a better teacher.  The other two are better at covering material that biol 14x was SUPPOSED to cover and in ways more relevant to the MCAT. 250 and 264 are probably not the easiest biol classes but are important and luckily both should contain or review stuff covered in 14x but in a more research and problem solving focused context so at least it won't be all new.",
