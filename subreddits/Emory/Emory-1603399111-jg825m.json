From what I see, his ratings hold up despite that), so of course take him.  Take as many legend/award winning teachers in your pathway as possible (especially given all the retirements taking place lately).",

It makes sense to me, but it means some more gems are likely to go sooner than later. Furthermore, me being the alum spy I am, I notice lots of departments still trying to hire more tenure track faculty during what is supposed to be a hiring freeze.  They have to keep up with retirements as well as things like tenure denials I guess.",
