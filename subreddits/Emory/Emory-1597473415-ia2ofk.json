  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m a rising sophomore and all thru freshman year I never really found a club that I joined. I went along on a few volunteer Emory things but only 2-3 people would show up. I kind of just felt like I couldn\u2019t find a club for me even after exploring on Orgsync; a lot weren\u2019t active and I was overall just confused.\n\nAt this point I think I wanna try out for a business club (I\u2019m not in the b-school). Any recommendations? I\u2019m open to remote options for this fall or things I can join in the spring. However I think I\u2019d like a club that\u2019s really active; I don\u2019t mind a bigger time commitment. Really hope I find something",
