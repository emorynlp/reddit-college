No. Do I care? Absolutely not he was a grreat friend.",

You may as well just write: \"just conform and maybe consider not sharing\" which may or may not be legit advice depending upon the org. Maybe some are more hostile and consider even revealing that as \"forcing\" (which can mean so many things from simple sharing, behavioral expressions that signal, to advocacy for LGBT issues. Seriously, what would it mean to you? If any of these, I don't think OP should feel comfy in whatever space you are alluding to).",
