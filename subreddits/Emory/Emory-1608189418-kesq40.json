      "text": "Well you don\u2019t get to choose your residence hall, it\u2019s all up to luck of the draw. All Res Halls offer the same basic amenities (kitchen, sinks in rooms, common rooms) and all cost the same. Regardless, the above commenter pretty much nailed the descriptions. Newest dorms are Raoul, LSM, Hamilton and Turman on the freshman quad. Dobbs and Alabama are the two oldest (both renovated recently though) but located in the center of campus between the gym, student center, and academic buildings. Dobbs has smaller rooms but great community (Dobbs hall is the best, no cap lol) whereas Alabama has bigger rooms. The Complex (Smith, Thomas and Hopkins) are on the other side of campus near the business school.",

      "text": "Raoul!! Best staff and awesome community!! Anything in the freshman quad is pretty good honestly ( Raoul, LSM, Turman, or Hamilton), but Raoul and LSM are bigger so you'll have more people in your building if that's something you prefer! \n\nI might as well give an overview of the others as well at this point.\n\nComplex - the furthest freshman dorm from the rest of the freshman so be prepared to walk a bit (it's not that far but relatively further) to see ur friends or go to frats. Very much a big dorm, and it's closest to the business school if you've got early morning business classes.\n\nDobbs - super small rooms, but there is a bunch of community formed by everyone hanging out more. Definitely a smaller dorm. Also, it's in the middle of campus so like everything is pretty close! \n\n(EDIT: I completely forgot about Alabama! Also in the middle of campus, super nice rooms, and also a small building with a pretty tight knit community as well! A lot of my friends lived in Alabama and it's a great hall to spend time in because some of the rooms are massive!!)\n\nIn the past, there have been first years in a building called Harris, but I don't think there will be any in the coming years. It's basically the same as Complex though\n\nHope this helps!! \n\nP.S. loyalty to your freshman dorm is encouraged!! #Raoulisthebest",

              "text": "In my opinion, go for the double just because the experience of having a freshman year roommate is not something you want to miss! I personally wasn't close to my freshman year roommate, but he was a solid guy! At the end of the day, you know yourself best, but 99% of first years will have a roommate or that matters to you at all. Plus, it'll widen your social circle by at least a little bit. Some of the people I met through my roommate are my closest friends now.",
