  "text": "I'm an incoming freshman and I literally have no idea how to plan my schedule. I'm planning to major in Economics and Philosophy btw\n\nI have 6 courses on my cart and I'm planning to remove two so that I can have a manageable schedule.\n\nThe 6 courses are:\n\nECON 201 Intermediate Microeconomics E.Saltzman\n\nBIOL 190 Test Tube Babies  S. L'Hernault\n\nPHIL 110 Intro to Logic J.Wahman\n\nPHYS 116 Intro Astronomy Batiste/Bonning\n\nPOLS 220 Modern Political Thought\n\nSPAN 201 Intermediate Spanish I L. Dillman\n\n(I didn't choose the time for ECS101 and HLTH yet)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it a good idea to take two 200-level courses? Or would it be way too difficult? \n\nAlso, what do you think about 8am classes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have 5 on AP English Language, Micro, Macro, Comp Gov, Statistics, and Calc BC. What credits should I use?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!!",

      "text": "The classes being 200 level is NOT a problem and nor does it being 200 level make it difficult.  If you need or are legit interested in them, you can drop phil, the seminar or whatever and take both. Just beware that econ 201 is viewed as challenging by most.  Evaluate classes individually by professor and hard and suggested pre-reqs and not by level.  But generally there can be 100 levels that end up more intense than a 2 or 300 level depending on professor or departmental goals.  201/212 in econ are sort of weeders in econ(because econ 101/112 just get people taking it for fun and as pre-bus pre-reqs vs. 201/212 being filled with those seriously considering an econ. Major)  whereas in STEM and even polsci, 100 levels may be weeder like in the hands of some profs.",

The course will be challenging no matter when you take it and honestly it may help to.take it when your calculus is fresher.  Perhaps drop something else and knock that out.  But if you wanna just cruise in the fall, then do you. Just don't get too comfortable or complacent with not sweating or having to fight for a grade(s).",

      "text": "So I have a really similar academic plan as u (health Econ / philosophy, politics, and law) and I have taken Econ 201 Phil 110 and a slightly different biol 190. Econ 201 is def not a walk in the park but Saltzman is really good at helping you understand the calc. I took Phil 110 over the summer with a different professor and basically this can be a really easy course if it comes naturally to you, or you could struggle. I have heard that if you are worried it might be difficult then Wahman is def the professor to take. If I were to drop one I think Pols 220 would be the one because it is unlikely you will get in that course in the first place. Tbh tho take what you are most interested in and if u have any other questions hmu!",
