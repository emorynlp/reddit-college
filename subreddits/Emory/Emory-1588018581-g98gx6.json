  "text": "Hey!\n\nSo sorry if this topic has been done to death.\n\nI am an Oxford prefrosh from NYC and I really love that Oxford will allow me to escape that 'big city' atmosphere I have started to grow tired of. However, due to that same small size, I was curious as to if there was a party scene and how I could engage with it. \n\nThis doesn't have to be limited to on-campus parties, but also off-campus opportunities. For example, how hard is it to party at the main campus every once in a while? Or what about partying at nearby schools like UGA?\n\nAny information or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Oxford is a dry campus (pretty much everyone is under 21 as freshmen and sophomores) so drinking has to be done secretly. This means smallish gatherings in dorm rooms and drinking rather quickly, but there was plenty of drinking happening on the weekends, no doubt.\n\nThere are definitely parties at main campus on the weekends, and your access to them will largely hinge on if you (or one of your friends) has a car. As freshmen we would tag along with sophomores going to houseparties thrown by the juniors who were sophomores when *they* were freshmen. Then when you're a sophomore, you're taking freshmen along with you to parties hosted by your junior friends, etc.\n\nI'm sure you could go to Athens for a weekend but I don't really remember anyone when I was at Oxford doing so. It would be a ton of fun if you have a fake though. Again, you'd need a car (and a place to crash).",

There was maybe one or two of those \u201cjunior parties\u201d and the dorm parties are 100% loud and proud. music and drinks blasting. There\u2019s a shuttle to and from Ox/Emory that\u2019s pretty reliable and will get you back to campus at 3am. Almost everyone comes back on that shuttle. Very few people stay over at their friends places. \n\ntldr; there\u2019s parties. there\u2019s fun. get a fake",

      "text": "i'm not a huge party person but some of my friends are. you definitely don't need a car, as the shuttle service on the weekends is pretty good. you can look up oxford shuttles if youre curious. having a car makes things easier but definitely is not necessary. there's dorm parties every weekend but that mostly hinges on your friend circle (for example, for me not as much as my friends don't drink often, but my boyfriend's friend group did something every weekend, whether going to a club/just having dorm party.) as someone else remarked if you have a fake you're set, the only thing to worry about is catching the shuttles/transportation. as for off campus i only went to a gtech party once but it was really fun. we just said we were from emory. you can consider joining a frat/sorority as well if that's something you're interested in.\n\nalso note for things like halloween night make sure to get to the shuttle early otherwise they fill up, me and my friends had to call an uber which is usually around 50 dollars",
