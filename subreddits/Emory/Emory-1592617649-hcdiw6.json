I pretty much make it a law to show up before 10:30 am or 90 mins before close and usually manage to avoid waiting for any equipment (except the damn rope attachment). Usually I went at 7/8 am and never waited for anything.\n\nYou\u2019ll grow and probably be satisfied but yeah, its not by any means a powerhouse gym.",
