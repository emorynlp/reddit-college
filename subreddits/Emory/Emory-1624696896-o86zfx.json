      "text": "I emailed ISSS to ask about this and this is their response: \"Currently, the state of Georgia does not require unvaccinated travelers to quarantine, so it should not be an issue. As for at Emory, while you will not have to quarantine, you will have to follow strict testing and safety protocols and have the opportunity to receive a required vaccine upon arrival if you did not have access to an approved vaccine in advance. In the meantime, you will be allowed to move into your residence hall (if applicable), attend orientation and take your in-person classes.\"",
