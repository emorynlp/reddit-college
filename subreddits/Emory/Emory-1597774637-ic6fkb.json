  "text": "Hi, I'm a new student and I'm a little confused about how we can go to the nearby Publix, Walmart, etc.  that I've heard about. From what I know, they're too far to walk to.\n\nI know that there are buses/shuttles that go around campus, and I've never really taken public transportation before. Can someone give a quick run-down about how to take these transit systems?",

      "text": "Download Transloc on your phone and set it to Emory. In the meantime, you can check out this website: [Emory Transloc Shuttles](https://emory.transloc.com/).\n\nLook at Google Maps and see where you want to go. Compare them to the map on the link I just gave you. See a shuttle going on that route? Trace it back to your place and see which stops you need to pass through. Make sure you have a return route as well, even it means taking the same route and having it circle back in a loop (sometimes this is the only way).\n\nReady to go? Go out with your mask and phone, load the Transloc app, and stand near the appropriate stop marked on the app. You can see the actual shuttles moving on the map for when you need to ride them yourself. Wait for it to arrive and pay attention to where you are for each stop.\n\nDo this until you get used to it.",

              "text": "All good, but disclaimer, I have not ridden all the shuttles as I have a car. I used only specific ones. I'm sure there might be that one shuttle that does do that, but as far as I can tell most if not all loop around to their origin until the end of their service hours. So you'll at least get back to where you first rode it.",

You may have to sit there for a while, though, since they are on a schedule and so will not leave that stop until they are supposed to per the schedule. [Look at the routes on this page ](https://transportation.emory.edu/shuttles)\u2014 you probably want the C-Publix route, which looks like it just goes back and forth from the Starvine Deck to Publix. Pretty easy!",
