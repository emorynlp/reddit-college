      "text": "A lot of people do them together during the semester and do just fine even those taking Weinschenk for 203. Summer for physics 14x is fine too (usually Bing still teaches 141 there as well) especially at Emory (but lots of places teach physics well, especially public schools).  Choose based upon your needs and comfort (you know yourself best) not what other people do because both of the options seem popular. For most people, ochem is tough but if the remainder of the schedule is light, it can easily be doable with another pre-med core.\n\n If you are taking both (especially if 203 with Weinschenk) and 1 or more of the remaining courses is kind of rigorous, perhaps the summer option is for you (especially if you found online versions of gchem and gbio the past year a bit \"busy\".) Do Keep in mind that the format of exams and even pace of 203 will probably be tougher than if it were online even with Heemstra(his online exams definitely threw more softballs than his pre-Covid which, in another school's context where there isn't a Weinschenk or Soria level ochem prof..would have been considered on the more difficult side).  Physics 141 with Bing isn't exactly the same calibre but isn't a cakewalk for most either.  Both classes may take more prep and thought than what you are used to (and exams will be weighted much more).",
