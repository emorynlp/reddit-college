      "text": "The business school will limit you unless you are on a connected track (and even then, they may funnel you into classes designed for non-GBS students.  I do think you get access to a limited number of GBS classes for GBS students even if not part of a connected concentration).  I think you can easily access certain nursing and maybe even public health courses later on (which makes sense as they have programs connected to ECAS departments or in Nursing's case, a whole BSN program that admits students from ECAS).\n\nYou best shot for the most access may be the Health Innovation or Human Health Econ/joint major track in Human health though:  [https://humanhealth.emory.edu/degreesandprograms/index.html](https://humanhealth.emory.edu/degreesandprograms/index.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHealth innovation is a legit concentration shared between ECAS and the business school so would be your best access point to GBS.  However, perhaps Human Health/econ would be a better way for you to learn some of this stuff?\n\nIn addition, I have seen STEM majors straight up just double major and get a BBA.  That may be trickier with NBB given the number of requirements and how hierarchical the core requirements are.\n\nMaybe start talking to an advisor or even someone in GBS about how you may go about this.  They definitely look out for folks in GBS and will probably steer you in a good direction.",
