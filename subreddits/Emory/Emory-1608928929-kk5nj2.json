      "text": "With the pandemic, it's important to note that everyone is experiencing limitations - one way or another - on what they could be doing in their social, academic, professional, etc. spheres of life.   \n\n\nI've heard that over-studying aka more than 6 months in advance for the MCAT can cause burnout and hurt more in the long run, so I'd be wary of starting that early on. Obviously, you know yourself so if you feel like going hard for a month and then easing up for 5 (because we will be back in swing of classes, and this is what you should do in order to maximize your academic performance) makes sense - then go ahead and start on that. \n\n  \nWith this all being said, take the break while you have it. Spend time with family if that's applicable. Enjoy old hobbies or find new ones. This is a weird time to be alive, so do what you can to ensure you're in a good head and body space to go into another semester.   \n\n\nPersonally, I'm spending this time volunteering where I can - in person and online. I'm also playing A TON of video games and watching TV. I was away for the semester and now I'm home with my family (I live nearly 1k miles away from Emory) so I'm using this as an opportunity to also just be in the presence of my parents and siblings before I head back.   \n\n\nUltimately, we are really living day by day with this and so please do yourself a service and try to ease up because you don't deserve to be kept under the same productivity/involvement standard that you had pre-Covid when frankly, you can't live up to it right now.",

      "text": "I don't know what year you are (sophomore?).  In case you end up doing the first thing and haven't already, I recommend going here, signing up, and looking at the practice MCAT: [https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/prepare-mcat-exam/free-planning-and-study-resources/](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/prepare-mcat-exam/free-planning-and-study-resources/)\n\nIt isn't just a content based exam.  The passages and the way they (and even some free standing) the content is tested is very critical thinking oriented.  I would certainly let it influence who and what you take in the year leading up to you taking the exam.  Picking up those who give certain styles of exams (more reading, concept and graph intensive than \"straight-forward\") or develop certain skills (like reading and analyzing primary literature) would definitely help and on more than just CARS (the STEM passages/sections are definitely different from how most students are used to being tested in an actual STEM class where simply knowing and having a basic understanding of the content you studied is sufficient because the items are comparatively low level.  The MCAT MCQs are basically asked in a way that only FRQs and short answers tend to be asked on college exams so taking those who give more FRQs and short answers, even if it scares one may fit).",

              "text": "Absolutely.  If you do it now/as a freshmen or during summer after it (I believe you are a freshmen), you get to guage where you are/will be by end of spring and then see where you need to be and how you could get closer to it even before formally studying for the exam.  View it as diagnostic.\n\nThe purpose would be to get y'all to look at it (let me be clear, do not feel pressure to actually answer them correctly when you look at it.  There may be a few you could crack, but just get the lay of the land.  Also don't be overly excited if you just answer a few of the content or \"directly in the passage\" based questions.  Again, a majority will be higher ordered thinking and you are aiming to get used to those types) and its format and ask yourself: \"What types of classes and professors gets me exposure to some of this? Are my current classes and professors at least beginning to help me get here?\" vs. jumping on bandwagons that use logic like the following: \"Avoid Weinschenk or Soria because only chem majors can benefit from that level of rigor\".  That isn't true as their classes prepare students very well for the types of thinking and skills they need for the MCAT (I question people who can't at least muster a B in classes like those) and I think since you have to take certain chem classes for med. school for 4 semesters (as opposed to 2 for bio and physics), professor selection is important because some professors expose students not only to a more similar testing format but to additional content and ways of thinking that are beneficial (luckily 150-202 are kind of standardized, but things get weird with 203-204) to pre-meds who may have to do \"applied memorization\" in med. school, but have to take a very critical thinking and reading intensive MCAT to even get there.\n\nAnd I would hope that anybody who does it definitely considers the types of bio and NBB classes they'd wanna take after freshmen year (hint:  Content overlap should concern you less and even when content is aligned with MCAT topics, skills/competencies are much more important.  You may wanna avoid over-rating some of those pure memorization heavy bio courses people love so much unless you are confident enough to use them for a GPA padder).  By looking at it, you get to course correct early or plan for the future and avoid any delusions of grandeur such as \"If I get an A or B in Emory's bio 14x, human physiology or bio biochem that means I am really prepared for MCAT biology sections\" or \"I was loosey goosey with chem prof. choices but I made A's, gee MCAT score should be fire on the chemical and physical basis of bio section!\".  If you got through key courses with B+ or higher using mostly lower ordered thinking, it doesn't indicate anything and you need to be prepared to basically relearn how to learn the STEM subjects you engaged when you start to formally prep for the exam.\n\n\\*Note that if you do plan to avoid key classes/profs but will end up taking stuff like bio biochem, just seeing the MCAT should motivate you to pick up the slack (and this is possible in any \"easier\" profs course really, but when you take someone because they are easier, you already bias yourself towards doing less so need to be self-aware of what you actually need to get out of a course especially if even the content is MCAT aligned) and perhaps read or engage the subject more than say Escobar or Kelly tells you to.  Even if they don't use a particularly rigorous approach, do additional book problems that are harder than the test problems they gives, ideally those that perhaps focus on experimentation and data analysis and whatnot.  Basically, force yourself to get extra stuff out of biochem while you are formally in the course and have the motivation to study it. One strategy could be to do some MCAT practice materials while in the course it if you already ordered some prep books",
