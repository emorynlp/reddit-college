Upper division labs are mostly in the 300 range like 370L which goes with microbiology, or 341 which is experimental evolution lab, and Beck and Gerardo seem to have rolled out 2 upper division labs as well.",

At Emory, I think it's based on last name alphabetical categories. Google \"Emory Advising\" and click the first link, then scroll down and find the category that best suits you. For instance, \"General Student Advising - Last Name A-E\". Then go ahead and email one of them.",
