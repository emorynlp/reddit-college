  "text": "Hello. I am an senior in an american curriculum international high school, and would really like to go to Emory for college. I am of German and Austrian nationality, but have lived my entire life in the Philippines as a missionary kid. I would like to apply for Emory, but I need scholarships. Can anyone give me some advice as to how scholarships work? Is it possible to receive a full scholarship? I only have 40 people in my high school, so academic advising is not very good...\n\nWhat types of scholarships could I earn?\n\nBy the way I am interested in a psychology and philosophy degree. Is Emory a good school for that?\n\nThank you for your input!",

For things like pre-health or STEM aspirations, if expressed, they may look at specific APs, SAT2s, SAT math.  The overall SAT score doesn't translate that well to success in STEM though certain threshold math scores (a lot of elite schools and Ivies find that 650-700 math is the magic number for general chemistry courses. \n Beyond that, AP scores become differentiators and could arguably compensate in case one is lower) tend to predict chances of doing well in quantitative STEM courses.  Basically, even a person expressing interest in pre-med or STEM would likely get a nuanced reading of their application and academic achievements.  Generally median scores at elite schools are 1450 and higher. Emory is no longer exceptional.  What can be said is that you don't have to have the median to be competitive.  Just avoid the bottom quartile of admits which is where the OP is.",

I whole heartedly believe that my SAT would not have been favorable for me if I was premed but I originally intended mathematics so my scores were favorable. Based on my anecdotal experience, many pre med kids have had higher stats than me and overall better applications than me (subjective of course) but got waitlisted while I was accepted. I truly do think the intended major is a big factor as they do have a need to fill departments",

That is hard to do when the score range of admitted students is as narrow as it is at schools like Emory (and of course many other elites are even more score centric) .Beyond a certain point, they know that they  won't see better performance based on SAT/ACT.  So what you observe has merit, but I think it really is self-selection effects.  You could potentially even see it on a per course section basis.  Like take organic chemistry sections. \n\n Those who take Weinschenk (who writes reading intensive tests that have lots of higher ordered problems) may be enriched for those who are generally better at taking tests because you have to be the type not daunted by or confident in your ability to prepare for low average exams that test more than just the content that was explicitly. taught in class.  It takes a special type to prep. for tests that you know may have surprises or ask you to go beyond what you were taught. A lot of STEM courses do that. Sometimes in good faith and sometimes in bad faith. People who are averse to that sort of thing will steer clear and go to disciplines that are less test heavy or tend to have more \"straight-forward\" (read-fact regurgitation/algorithmic learning) tests when they do.",
