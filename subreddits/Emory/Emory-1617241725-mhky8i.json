  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an admitted student to Emory and I will be touring campus. I wanted to ask if non-current students are allowed to eat in campus dining options and which places are the best. In case we\u2019re not allowed to eat which places nearby should we visit? We\u2019ve been vaccinated and are taking precautions in general btw. Preferred cuisines are Chinese, middle-Eastern, Indian, or Italian. Thank you!",

I just wanted to know some places to eat while I\u2019m visiting tomorrow but also wanted to get a general feel for how the food was. Any recommendations? I\u2019m really excited to visit because I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to visit any college due to the pandemic",
