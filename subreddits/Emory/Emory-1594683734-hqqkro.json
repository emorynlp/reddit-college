  "text": "Does anyone think Emory is going to pull a fast one by bringing us down, making us pay tuition, then when things get out of hand sending us back home. \n\nI\u2019ve got a hunch something of the sorts is going to happen and was curious if anyone else felt the same.\n\nEDIT: These replies are not helping my anxiety and stress hahaha, but I\u2019m glad i\u2019m not the only one with this hunch!\n\nEDIT 2: Here\u2019s a [link](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/coronavirus-college-campus-dorms-parties-classrooms) to a buzzfeed article. The third paragraph states Emory has no idea wtf is going on/going to happen.",

We're paying for access to all the facilities and resources on campus, all things we wouldn't get.",

          "text": "THANK YOU. Emory is FAR from perfect but people\u2019s lives are at stake. Obviously tuition rates are ridiculous anyway but this pandemic is so much bigger than not having access to certain physical resources on campus (though I recognize that for some students living at home is not a viable option, and this should be addressed properly). \n\nUniversities (unfortunately) are businesses at this point - Emory isn\u2019t \u201cpulling a fast one,\u201d they are trying to financially survive as an institution and not have an outbreak on campus. Most universities do not offer discounts for online tuition, and it takes MORE work and preparation to teach well online, though those teaching are paid the same (graduate/non-tenure track instructors are hit particularly hard by this - please consider this!). This is a bad situation for everyone, and I wish being entirely on campus was a truly safe option - but it\u2019s not. \n\nThis is a global reality, and I am tired of seeing some people complaining about not being able to go to the gym or club meetings. If you want someone to blame look at your state and federal governments - their lackluster response to a public health crisis is what should frustrate you the most, not a lack of online tuition discounts.",
