  "text": "I applied for transfer already but I see that Emory opened self-guided tours. I am on the west coast but I would fly out if it will be considered in my application for demonstrated interest (except i dont know how significant of an impact it will have or even if it'll show at all since I already applied). I also would love to visit the campus anyway. Thoughts on this? Thanks!",
