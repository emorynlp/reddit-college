  "text": "Hello Everyone!\nI just matched to Emory through QB, and decided to rank it after doing some research and visiting the stunning campus. It was a bit lower on my list so I feel like I don\u2019t know as much as I do about the schools I ranked higher. So I had a few questions and hope someone can answer!\n\n1. I\u2019ve been in dance and theater for 10 years and want to continue dance. I looked on the website and I don\u2019t see that many dance groups so if anyone\u2019s involved in dance I would love to hear your experience. Specifically hip-hop/contemporary.\n I was also wondering if there are any Kpop dance groups? Also how prevalent is Theater at Emory and how has your experience in theater groups been this far. \n\n2. If anyone is a Neuroscience or Political science major I would love to hear your opinions on Emorys programs and opportunities in this concentration.\n\n3. I currently live outside a city and loveeee going into the city almost everyday. How often to people actually spend time in downtown Atlanta?\n\n4. If you are a Black or Latina woman, please describe your experience on Emorys campus in terms of race relations and microagressions! \n\n5. Is dating culture prominent? I\u2019ve never dated before (on purpose) and I don\u2019t want to feel pressure to start if I\u2019m not ready! \n\n6. What do most people do for fun on campus and is it easy to make friends?\n\n7. If anyone can drop their study abroad experiences below that would be appreciated as well \ud83e\udd70\n\n8. How easy is it to have a job and balance classes? I need to work and was wondering if it\u2019s common to work off campus as well? \n\nThank you! That\u2019s all! I\u2019m really happy to be joining the class of 2025 \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b",

      "text": "&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, congratulations.\n\n1.I want to know which schools ranked higher other than some Ivies given those 2 majors (but especially neuroscience, it is on another level vs. most other programs likely because of its age and the fact that is essentially a purely undergraduate program at Emory) which Emory does much better at the undergrad level than lots of its slightly higher ranked peers (the 12-20 group specifically) lol.  I'll let others answer most items (because some I have never thought about or just don't know), but I will generally say that given your questions, Emory is probably the place to be versus a lot of peer institutions.  It isn't perfect at all, but it is like some other places hardly try in comparison yet get to be ranked higher in USNWR only because they stats whore and have a better yield formula.  I'll just comment on a few things:\n\n[3.](https://3.You) With those majors, you should be busy enough to not be going into the city everyday, but when you want to go (and lots of people do, but sadly some people don't and sort of just stay in the Emory bubble), it is certainly accessible and Atlanta also has nice in town and technically suburban town centers/neighborhoods that are very close to Emory (Decatur, Virginia Highlands, Little 5 points).   Most of these are easily accessible by the 2 MARTA buses that run through Emory or are a cheap Uber/Lyft ride away.  If on a weekday, there are free shuttles that can get you into midtown and downtown financial districts.\n\n I wouldn't ask questions like 6 because it is totally subjective how people define \"fun\" and what types of folks people vibe with.  The best you'll ever get will be anecdotes which may for whatever reason be something different than what happens to you.\n\n8.  I honestly hope you just get a giant need aid package to prevent you from having to do that much more than federal work study because I don't know if you'd want to work if you want to seriously dive in to your academics.  If I were you, I'd consider that you can potentially end up being part of a stipended research program/oppurtunity (and these exist for STEM and social sciences like Polsci).  It probably won't be hard to find a little job, but it will certainly be rough because NBB is very rigorous in terms of course requirements(like NBB 301 alone requires gchem1/2, bio 1/2 and strongly recommends physics as at worst a co-req) and how they are scaffolded, and generally people find that political science major at Emory is more intense than what people expect for a social science major (it definitely leans more into research and methods vs.  sort a merely content based/history of politics than many places, especially in later courses. It is often taught as something that truly emphasizes the \"science\" part of social science).",

      "text": "Hey! I can answer the dance question, as I also did musical theater and i was a competition dancer for most of my life. The dance program is pretty flexible, but there are some great adjunct professors that teach (Tara Myers for Jazz 1-4 is incredible, highly recommend). I'm NOT majoring/minoring in dance but I have taken both Jazz and Hip Hop this year to get out of my dorm and get moving and overall had a blast and made some easy A's. I have some friends on the EDC (Emory Dance Company) which is probably the biggest dance group on campus, and they've put on some great public performances that I'm sure are posted somewhere online.\n\nPeople spend as much time in downtown atlanta as they can - BRING A CAR. If you want to go downtown, Uber's get expensive, and having a car will easily make you a realllly popular person lol. If you can't, find someone who does.\n\nFun, like the previous commenter, is subjective. If you like to drink and party, that's mostly a thursday, friday, saturday thing. If you don't, there's plenty of people who also don't - you just have to find your group and stick with them. It sounds cliche, but join clubs, talk to people on your hall... just try to meet as many people as you can in the first few weeks. \n\nNo one is going to force you to date if you don't want to! Honestly, no one cares about who's dating who unless they're your immediate friends. \n\nTrying to be as honest as I can, emory students feel free to correct me! Also, congratulations on getting in :)",

      "text": "2) I\u2019m a polisci major! But I\u2019m only a first year (also QSN!), so I can\u2019t tell you too much about the opportunities. If you\u2019re specifically interested in like study abroad, the polisci department has a ton of opportunities ranging from regular study abroad to some domestic experiences (at bard or American university), and some international special programs (like the European politics summer program)! As I haven\u2019t been on any of these trips, I can\u2019t tell you how they are, but they sound really interesting and fun! \n\nAlso the head of the department is super nice! I had him (professor staton) as a professor this year and he was super cool and easy to talk to! The class I took this semester (POLS 111) was a little difficult, but this was its first year being taught, and it was completely online. I have an A right now in it though! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more or just seeing if it\u2019s your fit, take the intro course! For me, it just solidified that I wanted to major in polisci, but I know many people that decided polisci wasn\u2019t for them after taking it! And welcome to Emory!",
