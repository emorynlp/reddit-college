I\u2019m not sure how it goes at other schools, but at Emory, if your registration time is June 7th at 12 PM, that means you\u2019re on OPUS, shopping cart ready, at 11:50 AM that day. Most classes fill up super quickly, it\u2019s just how it goes.\n\nDon\u2019t worry though, add/drop/swap will start soon and you should be able to swap into or pick up the courses you\u2019re missing. Just monitor opus.",
