  "text": "The last couple weeks driving to campus I have noticed cop cars pulled over, lights on, sitting on one side of Lullwater Rd, amidst a bunch of temporary \"no stopping for any reason\" signs. Is this a filming thing or an investigation or a detail for a VIP? It seemed very strange to me but I am new to the area/campus.",

The Staircase is also said to be filming in Georgia on the Georgia film and tv website, but I don't see how that would have a second season since it was murder documentary from like 4 years ago.\n\nhttps://www.georgia.org/industries/film-entertainment/georgia-film-tv-production/now-filming-georgia",
