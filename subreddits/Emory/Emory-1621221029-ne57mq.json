  "text": "Hey guys, I've been looking at the elective options on the course atlas and was wondering if any of you guys recommend taking a certain class. I'm a rising senior and I want to make the most of the time I've got left at Emory (not planning on doing grad school) but I'm not sure which classes would be the most worthwhile + most broadly useful in the workforce.\n\nI've already taken 320 (Econometrics) and 405 (Industrial Org), and I'm tentatively thinking of taking ACT 210 (Financial Accounting) and maybe Econ 215 (Stocks & Bonds), but need one more class. Are Forecasting (422), Financial Economics (333), Money & Banking (411), or 410W worth taking? Is it worth taking any finance classes?",

      "text": "I took Economic Forecasting with Dr. Mialon last Fall. I think this class is useful because it requires learning a little bit of STATA to analyze like time series datasets. We had synchronous exams which also required using STATA on the spot to analyze some data. You learn the useful commands during class so nothing was really a surprise. It's more about the type of model you need to use to better fit the data and predict trends that is taught by the theory portion of the class.\n\nI also took Financial Econ with John Kim and the class was okay. I don't remember much but it was very quantitative. If you're interested in finance, this is a class you might want to take. Personally though, I enjoyed ECON 422 more.",
