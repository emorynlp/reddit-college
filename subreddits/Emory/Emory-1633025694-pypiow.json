I always get my favorite dishes from the food court in Great Wall market. Feng Mei has a great Beijing duck and food as well.\n\nAlso I\u2019m sure if you ask some international Chinese students when you get there, they can give you even more recs that aren\u2019t well-known among domestic students",
