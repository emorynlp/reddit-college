  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m doing some research on Emory as I determine whether to apply (I\u2019m a high school senior) so I\u2019d love some input! \n\n1. Is Greek life really prevalent? If I\u2019m not interested in it, will I feel out of place socially at Emory? Same question with the alcohol and drug scene. \n\n2. A lot of reviews I read said that Emory lacks a close knit campus community. Is that true? Are most students focused on preprofessional tracks rather than learning in the moment? \n\n3. How\u2019s the work life balance? Are there a lot of fun activities students can partake in both on and off campus? \n\n4. Could someone clarify Emory\u2019s religious affiliation for me? Am I required to take certain theological courses? \n\nThanks so much!",

      "text": "1. It is if you want it to be, but you won't feel out of place at all. Same goes for alcohol\n\n\n2. It feels like most are on preprofessional tracks and sometimes it hinders learning in the moment. But really, that shouldn't matter to you because everyone has their own priorities. You can make your experience what you want.\n\n\n3. There are definitely opportunities. Join some orgs that you're passionate about and it'll help w/ the work-life balance\n\n\n4. No religious affiliation (at least in my understanding) and definitely no required theology classes. If youre interested in some of the graduating requirements, just search for Emory's GER (general ed requirements)",

Long answer: yes, but it's mostly because we don't have a football team, people can be a little self-absorbed but they aren't super competitive or plain old mean about it. \n\n3. There's lots of things on campus, just don't expect to be able to do stuff in Atlanta proper unless you have a car and/or a lot of Uber money\n\n4. It's Methodist but it's only relevant if you attend religious events or are a grad student doing theology",

I abused the shuttle system or 36 to get to downtown(Grady shuttle pretty much outs you out at GSU which is an area with a crapton to do and is an access point to lots of other stuff because of the 5 points and Peachtree Center train stations) or midtown.  Getting access to in town Atlanta was easy if you know how or are willing to use those.  I don't know how things work with this Covid stuff though.  That is just not something I(I'll admit I am from GA), or even my friends found hard.  \n\nI also remember uber and lyft being relatively cheap in those areas of ATL and the Emory area (would abuse the super cheap pool and line prices from time to timw and often not even get another rider).  But generally MARTA and shuttle system were my friends. May not be like the NE, but it was good enough.",

      "text": "I pretty much agree with the other poster and would add that the pre-professional feel of stuff really more so depends on major and pre-professional track.  Like if you are in a major that has lots of pre-meds, it won't feel different from the tons of other pre-med heavy elite tier universities (including places like Harvard, Duke, JHU, WashU, etc) and you may feel a competitive spirit or see annoying behavior from time to time.  However, if you are in the social sciences or humanities, even though there are lots of pre-laws (and maybe even pre-business folks passing through) you will get more people who just want to learn because pre-law is not tied to a specific set of courses like pre-health tracks.  So people are mainly just trying to enjoy themselves, learn, and perform well enough to keep their grades up (arguably social science and humanities depts probably have a bigger range of students in terms of career aspirations than the life sciences and I think you'll find that almost anywhere) which is not as difficult as STEM because there is much more subjective grading and softer grading in general.  I would say that for such a pre-professional heavy school, Emory may be a tad more 'cerebral' or intellectual leaning than some of its pre-professional heavy closely ranked peers.\n\nYou will find some who are annoying and just desperate for high grades, but an awful lot of others who are willing to work and think hard for solid grades (so some challenging instructors at Emory still remain quite popular and well-respected no matter the academic division.  Students generally respect a great teacher, even if the instructor pushes them to learn material deeply/challenge them for a grade.  It isn't like some schools where students just sort of fall apart from or complain about the difficulty or workload of a course all day).\n\nThat community thing is a matter of opinion and depends on how you define it.  I thought it was okay, but I think it falls apart in upper division years (junior/senior) due to lack of housing and so many moving off-campus.  Now if you define \"tight-knit community\" as something like an LAC or \"unifies around sporting events and has rah rah school spirit\" you may really want to look elsewhere.",

              "text": "Yeah I think that is very true. Some people are too intense for their own good.  If you want to be seriously competitive, they should be smarter and leverage their performance and sociability or at least feign interest and curiousity(without being snobby or disruptive during class to show off. Some students do that via asking \"smart sounding\" questions that are irrelevant for the content being covered for example and it can derail a session or take time from good questions that are relevant) to get the professor on their side vs. petty grade grubbing and other behaviors that usually don't even help A students in the long run (I have heard of high performing students getting lukewarm or even weak rec. letters at Emory due to some things they do).  People need to realize that many professors view students as more than just their performance in that one class and will even look out for and support less \"competitive\" students who show they are serious about learning and maybe building a mentoring relationship. \n\n Pestering professors and constantly complaining about little things can rub everyone the wrong way and bring down the feel of what could be great academic experiences.",

The difference is more down to class size, since Oxford's class sizes are drastically smaller than the Atlanta campus and thus for super popular ones like chem and bio they can run out of space. But, since we're allowed to take 1 course at the Atlanta campus I'm taking chem there.",
