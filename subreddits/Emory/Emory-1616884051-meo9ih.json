  "text": "Hey guys, I was just looking for some suggestions and advice. Do you think it would be worth it to transfer to Emory from GSU from a physics w/ concentration in astronomy major? Basically physics and astronomy major at Emory. Is the program a lot better and/or worth the effort to apply for the transfer? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

It  may also be better for getting a research opp, but if you are going to pay substantially more for Emory, I would say attempt to transfer to Georgia Tech.  If said something in the life sciences, social sciences, and maybe QTM and thought you'd get good financial aid, you would get a different conversation from me.",

I\u2019ve gotten mixed replies from other people on the Georgia Tech vs. Emory conversation, some people have told me that GT has a much better program at a better cost, then I\u2019ve heard that Emory Is more prestigious and would provide more opportunities. Thanks for the input, I\u2019m probably swaying more towards GT now..",

              "text": "What idiots told you the last part about some weird prestige stuff? They clearly don't understand how it works and are going based on what they THINK USNWR UG rankings tell them.  They think about things from a very superficial level and you shouldn't trust them if they are telling you that some irrelevant gap in the overall branding of each will matter when you are dead set on pursuing a STEM degree with STEM (especially all engineering, CS, and physical sciences) being the thing that GT is absolutely renowned for and competes against the very top schools(U.S. and world wide) at both the grad and undergrad level.  \n\nDon't trust people who.obsess over hair splitting gaps in prestige unless you are pursuing something like finance, consulting, or pre-law. STEM is all about the actual and perceived level of training you get and Tech is going to kill most top ranked private research Us. Get new friends lol.",

I\u2019m probably setting my eyes on a GT transfer now so, thanks!",

I did my MS there and when I TAed I noticed that high achievers got LOTS of attention and faculty would just pour effort and attention into them.  If you can do well, you could easily soak up attention and get put on to some great opps that would be far more competitive at highly selective universities like Tech, Emory, or others. If you do well and put yourself out there to profs at GSU, victory will be yours. It's a big place but seems to care about UGs a lot I'll admit.",
