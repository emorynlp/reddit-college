  "text": "I\u2019m taking a pretty rigorous schedule in general so I would like to know what are the FSEMs with less work. I\u2019ve read some comments talk about how the amount of work in the FSEMs vary a lot. I\u2019m interested in Public Health, Philosophy, Politics, Econ, and Bio as potential ones. So an easy FSEM in them would be ideal but any easy FSEM suggestions are appreciated",
