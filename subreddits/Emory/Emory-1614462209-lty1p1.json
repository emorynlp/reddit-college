  "title:": "Off Campus Financial Aid",
  "text": "Hey all, had a question for those off campus.\n\nFor those who lived off campus, how was your experience with financial aid?\n\n1. Did your financial aid adjust to account for you living off campus? If so, did it adjust favorably (you ended up owing less) or did you end up owing the same if you had lived on campus? \n2. Is it possible for them to factor off campus housing into the financial aid package? My assumption is no, but there may be some cases of this happening?\n3. When do they usually do Clairmont housing assignments? \n\nI'm just trying to gauge whether going off campus would be worth it financially. Any responses would be appreciated!",
