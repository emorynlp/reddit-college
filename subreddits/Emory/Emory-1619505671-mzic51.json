  "text": "Hey! Essentially just the question above. I\u2019ve been accepted into the University of Michigan and Oxford at Emory, and I\u2019ve found myself looking at two schools that are nowhere NEAR alike almost at all. This has left me with a big fork in the road, as there are both major pros and cons (from the surface, at least) when it comes to both schools. If you guys have any insight that would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "For me it was between Vanderbilt and Emory. What made the difference was Emory\u2019s chem program which felt leagues ahead of Vandy, and scholarships they gave/ones they offered when you got on campus. I should add that the people I\u2019ve known from Oxford (especially those that fast track and graduate early) are some of the smartest people I\u2019ve known at Emory. It\u2019s a really rigorous environment and I think it probably builds stronger foundations than if you started out on main campus. I\u2019ve heard this thrown around a lot and I think Oxford is sort of being positioned as Emory\u2019s honors college going forward so it\u2019s not a bad choice at all.",

I don't think Oxford students are superior or inferior to ECAS students. There is a tiny bit lower score and GPA threshold for accepted Oxford students, but it's most likely statistically insignificant.",

              "text": "I don't think u/Axonic11 meant that.  Being an \"honors college\" has nothing to do about STUDENTS being inferior or superior.  The curriculum and how courses are run, especially in those initial 2 years is quite a bit different and mirrors other LACs which most serious honors colleges are modelled after (as opposed to medium sized research Us like Emory and its private peers most of which aren't that darned different from large publics in survey courses across divisions).  It is generally very different unless you choose to take the top instructors on main and even those courses are larger so it'll still feel a bit different.  Like hardly no foundation level STEM (or often not even social sciences) lectures on main are going to have serious project based assignments (not even 1) that involve any creativity or anything like that because it becomes too burdensome to grade whereas I've even seen non-INQ courses at Oxford offer or require such assignments.\n\nI always say that Emory is a bit closer to a large LAC type of experience than a lot of its similar sized peers when it comes to things like STEM, but it still is no LAC (despite its marketing).  Just too damned big, but it tries the best it can I guess.  If you saw some other schools, you'd really begin to wonder what the damned rankings are all about.",

                  "text": "My problem with this assessment is that Oxford students are effectively transfers to a very different social environment and otherwise (and transfers often need an adjustment period even from a similar caliber school).  It is also easy to flounder in the b-school (saw plenty of ECAS people do it) because the pre-reqs are kind of a joke now (I remember when they even required up to a calc. 2 equivalent and now they don't).  \n\nSome people can pretty much AP out of everything(and those who have credit can just repeat for a grade) but financial accounting and then screw around in ECAS for 1.5-2 years with the easiest courses possible for gen. eds.  And more people do that than one would like to think (and when you publish that the average College GPA of admits from ECAS is 3.6+ you incentivize this).  These are the people I saw struggle from ECAS (imagine going from light courseload with low workload/thinking intensive courses to 4-5 courses a semester where many demand participation everyday on fairly technical stuff where you can't BS as well as things like case studies and group projects).  \n\nI'm sure this applies to Ox people as well (in addition to getting used to larger class sizes and people you don't know). The b-school will just be a different animal to a decent amount of students.",

If I were you I'd go wherever is the cheapest, you'll have a nice time basically anywhere as long as you work hard. I wouldn't change it.",
