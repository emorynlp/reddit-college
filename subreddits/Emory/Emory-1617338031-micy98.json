  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m currently a high school senior deciding between UT Austin and Emory. \n\nI\u2019m an in-state resident, so UT is a really good and affordable option. However, I\u2019ll be attending College of Liberal Arts although my ultimate plan is going into Human Resources/ Consulting. \n\nAt Emory, I\u2019ll be pursuing a degree in business management. (Oxford campus for the first two years). What I really love about it is its small classroom environment and close knit community. But I\u2019ll have a significant amount of student loan debt (around $120,000) after graduation. \n\nPlease let me know what you think. I love Emory (and understand that this is Emory subreddit), but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the debt. :(",

Generally even those of us on here who love Emory (and as an alum I do), we aren't so prideful/delusional to misguide you and tell you to go into 120k debt to attend it. That would be irresponsible especially given what you plan to do.  UT can serve you better and for a much lower price.",

      "text": "UT Austin is an excellent school and not being in debt after undergrad is fantastic.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to get a full scholarship to attend Emory, and around graduation time a lot of my friends who had been financing their education with loans started getting really nervous about paying them back.  Once I got out of school, many of my friends were making good money, but were not able to enjoy it because they were just trying to pay down loans as quickly as possible.  I have friends now (in my mid-thirties) who are still paying down loans and can't afford to but a house or start a family.  The only people I know who have significant debt, love their jobs, and are not worried about paying their loans back are MD's.  Avoid the loans if you can.\n\nI also saw some mentions that you could take a job in management consulting to pay down your loans after Emory and they would be gone in no time.  I would not assume this option will be available to you (these are very competitive positions), or that you will like management consulting.  I currently work in an adjacent area (medical device and engineering consulting), but its the same business model.  It tends to be an abusive environment with no work life balance.  They love having people who need high salaries to pay down debt and won't quit no matter what.  People are scared to say 'no' to joining project teams because they need the money.  I am not in that position, and have no problem turning down work and capping my weeks at 40 hours.  Many of my colleagues are working 80-90 hour weeks with a 3 year plan to pay down loans and get out of the company.   I am sure if they could go back and do it all over again they would not want to end up at the same point.",

If they have hardly no or little debt, they can easily do whatever the hell they want and explore different things whether they pay that amount of money or not.  I think that freedom and flexibility is important.  Not all people should have to feel this pressure of: \"Well if I can just go into this area for a little while and be cheap, I can pay off this debt hanging over me eventually and then I can do whatever\".  To me that makes little sense when they can immediately start off on the trajectory of doing whatever they want to do.  They don't have to be pigeonholed into orienting themselves towards these stereotypical careers associated with elite private universities and they are honestly very likely to enjoy UT Austin.  The way I see people from elite schools on here talk about it is ultra elitist as if it is like Bumfuck U or something (I saw a conversation on another school's subreddit about pre-med that was ultimately dismissive of its science programs. Little did those stuck up pricks know, that UT Austin's UG STEM programs may be better and more rigorous than theirs).  That's just not true.  It's a place that can easily be done right and turned into a solid career outcome.",

If going to Emory will place them in a box where they don't have as much freedom to pursue whatever career without basically defaulting on that huge loan, they shouldn't do it. It is telling that they plan to pursue something completely different based upon where they go and what type of loan they take out.  That's a problem.",
