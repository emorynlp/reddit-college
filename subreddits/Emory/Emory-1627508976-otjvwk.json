  "text": "Hi, \n\nIncoming freshman here. I know class registration for us is soon, August 9-11. I'm really stressed about not even getting backup classes I wanted. Of course, I've got my major pre-reqs at the top of my list, but I know for a fact they'll have a lot of competition (such as CHEM 150 + CHEM 150L). I've looked at classes in a lot of categories for backups (PSYC, QTM, ARTVIS, yoga, CL, PHIL, SPAN) but a bunch of those classes are also already closed and say \"0 seats.\" \n\nI just need some confirmation + advice on how to navigate here. \"0 seats\" means I should ditch trying to get into those classes this semester, right? Since they're already full?\n\nHow likely is it that I'll be taking mostly classes I'm not really interested in/planning to take during fall semester (and even spring)? What should I do?\n\nTIA",

          "text": "Thanks so much for your input, you seem like the main Emory guru here lol! \n\nCould I ask for your input about credit hours during fall of freshman year? I know the max recommended for freshmen is 17. My current plan is 14 credits, (HLTH, ECS, ENGRD, QTM 100, CHEM 150) but I'm starting to worry if that's too little (my older friend at Emory also suggested to take at least 16 so I'm not overloading during future semesters). But on the flip side, I'm nervous about taking 17 credits especially when I'm already worried about my transition to college after a year at home + online school. If I decided to take 17, I'm thinking about adding PSYC? Or maybe a CL class? What do you suggest?",

              "text": "It is NOT about raw credit hours in this range.  17 is no magically rigorous number of credits.  As of now, there is nothing special about that schedule and you could easily afford a not too intensive 3 hour course in addition to these(chem 150 and QTM 100 are the two more demanding courses) and you should do so to have \"withdrawal protection\".  Another way to 16 would be dropping QTM and exchanging it for bio to ultimately double in bio and chem.  You could also find a seminar and be just fine.",

NRSG 205 (microbio) is, but I can't take NRSG courses until Spring.",

If you didn't have both chem and QTM there, I would have said that you could likely even afford a somewhat challenging 3 hour to get you to 17.   I don't see how bio isn't on the list but that is between you and the nursing school.  Withdrawal protection is you staying full time in case you drop a class. You need at least 12 hours.  If you run into serious trouble in anything with your current 14 hours, you are gonna drop below that if you drop a course outside of Health or ECS 101.",

I also suspect that McGill will have overload capacity this year because she is in a regular auditorium for both sections but nevertheless, I would prioritize a lecture.  Also, I suspect everyone who wants QTM 100 will get a spot eventually so if you want, you could see if any slots are left during the 2nd round. Also do remember that this is a process.

I just selected this section and clicked enroll.
