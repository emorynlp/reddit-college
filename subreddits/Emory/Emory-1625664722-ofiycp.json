I am able to waive the pre reqs for these classes.\n\n\nWould really appreciate your comments!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

      "text": "You should take Business Econ with Stephen Ahn if it's available, opens a lot of doors for ECON and it satisfies that econ requirement for the B school. I'm BBA and Econ too! You will need to take financial accounting though, but it is a difficult class so be careful of your courseload first sem. If you need any more BBA and econ advice lmk, I'm a rising sophomore and I'm happy to help out!\n\nwelcome to emory!",

How many hours would you recon I need to spend on act 210 and Econ 201 respectively each week?\n\nI\u2019m not double majoring in BBA and Econ, instead I\u2019m trying to major in bio and bba or econ (so one or the other). Just want to keep both tracks open in freshmen year haha.",

              "text": "Econ 201 is practically no homework UNTIL you get to the massive paper 3x a semester. He releases the doc with the source material on Thursday and its usually due the following tuesday, so you basically have the weekend. So it's insane crunch mode for a really short time frame and then nothing for 3 weeks - I'm a procrastinator, so that worked fine for me. \n\nACT 210 (I took with barton) is easiest if you keep up with your work - I usually spent an hour prepping and taking the quizzes and an hour on the homework beforehand. One quiz a week, sometimes two that you can take on your own time.",

                          "text": "You may want to ask whether the homework was challenging or when in the semester it became challenging.  Basically ask more specific stuff because otherwise it's super relative.  They already said there is an assignment each week.  Some students, whether the assignments are demanding or not will consider that \"lots of HW\", but many/most won't unless the HW requires a good bit of thought (like most ALEKS HW in gchem may not be that tough and they have a portion due every week).  I wouldn't stress over harsh vs. easy grading because I think all sections of econ 201 target a B average (like a 3.0-3.2) and will adjust grades upwards at the end to get to that average if needed or will just assign as is if higher than 3.0.",
