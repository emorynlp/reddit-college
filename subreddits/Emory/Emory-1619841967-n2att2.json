  "text": "Hey y\u2019all! I\u2019m a recent admitted transfer student and I was just wondering what the class rigor was like at Emory? Is there grade deflation for gen Eds or pre business classes? I was admitted as a soph but was incredibly interested in entering Goizueta, but had seen the curving requirements for classes. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "There\u2019s a business school curve that limits the amount of people who can get each letter grade. \n\nIn my experience, that actually helps curve you up, but I\u2019ve also had friends who have gotten curved down. \n\nB-school classes are not hard but also not easy. There are lots of group projects, so that\u2019s stressful and can mess up your grades a little",

      "text": "That entirely depends on who and what you take.  I don't think most people (especially pre-business folks) have trouble with gen. eds.  There is no pattern though (unless you intentionally choose all easy or all hard. Most people choose a mix or just choose courses flippantly or based upon what their schedule allows like at any other school).  Was there a pattern at your old school? Also those curves aren't that horrible.  A core business or pre-bus course may end up at roughly a B/B+ average with like 1/3 or more getting some sort of A(this is also typical in lower division and core social science courses like political science at Emory).  Really no school has much \"grade deflation\" and Emory is no exception. There are naturally many courses where the professors require you to work and think a decent amount (or even a lot) though.  That just is what it is.\n\nWhat you should more so worry about is whether your peers are similar to or generally stronger than your old school.  This can affect relative performance in some of those business courses (basically you \"may\" have to step it up depending on how hard you are used to working) as well as even some Continued Writing Requirements where if you end up with a strong crowd of writers, many instructor will end up having high expectations for the A range grades (some may not care and could just ultimately give most people an A.  I would say it's like 50:50 chance of either).\n\nThe only \"deflation\" that occurs happens in b-school courses and maybe a couple of econ. courses that tend to be on the easier side and have pretty high (I would say like upper 80s or higher) raw averages on a normal scale.  In those cases, the cut-offs may be moved upward to fit the recommended distribution, but most courses will just automatically fit it from the get go or be below it in which case the cut-offs will be lowered.  Either way, if you do the work and prep for class, you should be able to do well enough.  If we were talking STEM, it would definitely help to come from a school with fairly rigorous STEM courses, but with business/pre-business courses you are pretty much on a level playing field with students (most people have not taken gen eds that give them an advantage in something like financial accounting) as long as you developed a solid work ethic from your previous school.  I don't think but so many business and pre-business courses are made to be intentionally challenging (for Emory students at least) to the point where they yield \"low\" test and assignment averages (say 70s or lower which would usually mean that the course is either too content intensive such that you can't memorize or practice everything/\"keep up\" or that you have to pretty much be able to think outside of the box or extrapolate to solve new/unfamiliar scenarios on the spot when taking an exam or quiz).",
