  "text": "Hey,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpcoming sophomore here, and I am all done taking the prereqs for business school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do want to challenge myself further by taking more b school courses. I do like ISOM, marketing, and international business at the moment. I do want to learn more about real estate as well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny course/professors recommendations or can you talk about what you took after finishing the pre reqs? I just want some insight that's all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I took both econ 101 and 112. Do you think I should take fin201? It says econ101 and 112 OR fin201, so I asked.",

ISOM 450 teaches you mySQL alongside business context: you will find it handy. Look for classes Jesse offer as well, he had this ISOM 499 data viz that was fun, teaches tableau and dashboards.",

Or, use this opportunity to take fun courses in the college/work on a double major if you have one",
