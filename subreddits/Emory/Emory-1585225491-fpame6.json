      "text": "As someone who is taking an Introduction to Fiction Writing class this semester, I absolutely love my class. As you would expect from a writing class, a large proportion of class time is spent writing short stories and scenes in response to prompts given by the professor. Afterwards, students have time to share their short stories with the people in class and give and get feedback. In addition to just writing, the class goes over key concepts on how to improve one's  writing and spends time reading and analyzing great short stories by authors all across the globe. Homework for the class consists of a couple of chapter readings from a Creative Writing book and writing a short story (approx 1500 words in length) each week on a topic discussed in class or in the reading. Near the end of the semester, students have to complete a writing workshop where you write a 2000-25000 word short story and get advice from students and the professor before revising it and having to turn in as a sort of \"final exam\" The pros of taking this class, besides fulfilling a continued writing requirement, is a lot of practice just writing  and the chance to read a lot of good literature. However, since the class involves a lot of in-class writing and reading, the classes are pretty long (3 hours), which might create some scheduling conflicts. Besides class, students also have to attend required reading sessions held outside the classroom where popular writers and playwrights come to present their works at the Emory College.",
