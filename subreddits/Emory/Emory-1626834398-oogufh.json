      "text": "i took envs 130 last yr and they reserved spots for freshmen so i think it'll be ok to get into. Spots do disappear quickly during registration tho so be sure to add it to ur shopping cart beforehand and pick a backup envs class (i also took envs 229 w. dr donaher and would recommend it). envs 130 is easy but a bit of a boring class since u mostly just read the textbook but if u want to major in envs, it's a required class. feel free to message me if u have anymore questions abt envs 130 or signups!",
