      "text": "Considering they\u2019re not allowing most current students to return to campus for the semester, I can\u2019t imagine they are going to host an event where people come in from all over the country just for a day. I would guess they will host some sort of virtual admitted students day instead. However, nothing is certain, so I\u2019d wait for a news announcement from the university about it",

      "text": "I feel like this is something that would depend on vaccine rollout which isn't looking the best right now in terms of being distributed widespread by like March or April (I think admitted student days are then and mostly target RD people).  I wouldn't bet on in person unless something big happens between now and then but minus campus tours and experiencing Emory live and in person I would imagine in person versions of what is available on Emory admissions Youtube.  \n\nThey seem as if they intended to change a lot of stuff since previous years such as increasing faculty engagement with the process (basically doing what Emory should have been doing: Selling its strength, academics) so I have no idea of past years would be as representative of what would happen this year.",

As long as you look like a college student no one will ask questions as to if you actually go to Emory lol - I did it with my twin sister so she could come with me on move in day even though she goes to a completely different college lolll",
