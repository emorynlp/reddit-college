  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm a rising junior and intend on applying for Emory's 4+1 BS/MSPH in Biostatistics. Apparently, I only need to write a single essay for my application (along with the usual letters of recommendation).  \n\nIs it easier to get into these graduate programs than it might be if I applied for a full two year program after graduating? Has anyone who has ever applied for a 4+1 here been rejected?",
