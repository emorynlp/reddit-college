  "text": "I'd like to withdraw from a class/switch to S/U, but it seems that the deadline already passed on October 15th. I see an extended partial withdrawal deadline for November 12th, but am not sure if it's *only* for freshmen and transfers. Does anyone know if I'm still able to withdraw? For context, I'm a sophomore and I'd still be taking 12 credits after withdrawing.",
