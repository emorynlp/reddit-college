I can't speak for the other two schools you listed, though...\n\nWith that said, I have severe Emory withdrawal about once every two weeks.  I need to go back and visit.  I sincerely regret not living life in college to the fullest possible.  In a convoluted sort of way, I'm kind of happy that we have a bit of an inactive board because it makes me think that Emory people are choosing Emory and Atlanta over the Internet.  ",

Let's see if we can get readers to double in a few months? Or is that as wishful thinking as hoping MARTA will add another bus line to campus (says the woman who actually remembers when Emory was served by TWO buses... there I go dating myself again). ",
