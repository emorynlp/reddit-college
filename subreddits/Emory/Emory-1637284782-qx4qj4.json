  "text": "hey! i\u2019m a current first year trying to figure out my schedule. i\u2019m planning on double majoring in chem BA and african studies. registration went pretty horribly and i\u2019m at 14 credits right now. i\u2019m debating boosting to 17 but i can\u2019t figure out if i should or not. right now the plan to get 17 credits is taking BIOL 142+L, CHEM 202+L, AFS 221, AAS 239, and SIRE299R. i did 15 this semester, i have apush and aplang credits, and plan on taking physics and calc 1 over the summer. i\u2019m just not sure if 17 credits is too much or not, especially since bio, chem, aas, and afs would be in the same day",

      "text": "There are lots of people at Emory who take four classes a day; usually it's balanced out by having fewer classes on a different day (i.e. if you have four classes on MW, you might have just one or even no classes on TTh; sounds like that's similar to your case). It typically comes down to personal preference and whether you like taking all your classes one day and having a day off, or if you like spreading classes around a bit. Personally, I try to distribute things around a bit, but that's just me.\n\n17 credits is pretty typical, and what you've described isn't easy by any means, but it's not that out of the ordinary for a typical STEM major (either double majoring in non-STEM or taking GERs). The exception is SIRE 299R, which I'm not very familiar with; though, I imagine your semester might go very differently depending on the exact project you end up working on for that.\n\nAlso, fair warning - summer physics and calc I is a tough load if you don't already have experience with those classes. Humanities and writing classes tend to be more manageable over the summer in my experience.",

              "text": "Not the person you were responding to but I would postponse the standalone HAP course and instead combine it with a future writing course for your African Studies major. HAPW counts for both HAP and the writing GER in one course. Same with HSCW, SNTW, etc.\n\nAnother tidbit if you like languages is that once you fulfill both HAL courses, a third language would count as a HAP.\n\nYou'll probably end up with more HAP or HSC courses with this combo than you'll ever need but double dipping gives you more flexibility later on to take courses outside GERs.",
