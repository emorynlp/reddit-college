      "text": "If you\u2019re talking bout ISOM 350, Prof Gu gave us module quizzes and the exams were exactly like those. I took it online so it may be a little different. I say go over his lecture slides and ensure you know the explanations of what a value may mean. He was more interested in our analysis more than our calculations so we didn\u2019t have to do much excel work on the exams, they were given to us. But knowing the functions and formulas helped a lot. He\u2019s very deliberate in the way he teaches so everything given to you in class and on the module quizzes should be similar to the exam.",
