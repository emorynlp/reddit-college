      "text": "Probably nothing because they'll review or remind students of most of the needed 150 stuff.  But if you really want to, maybe become comfortable drawing Lewis structures and conceptual aspects of different bonding theories, resonance structures (and their relationship to hybridization and geometry of molecules if possible), and if you have the book or know how to search online for resources, you should teach yourself the basics of conformational analysis of smaller organic molecules (learn how to do perspective drawings and Newman projections. Know what lower and higher energy conformers look like).  Learn the basics of isomers such as stereoisomers (enantiomers in particular.  Learn r/S labelling of molecules), constitutional isomers, etc.\n\nThis last part is perhaps less important for 202 (as it is just labeling mostly) but you will need to at least understand the r/S and other spatial concepts in 202 as you learn reactions that change the stereochemistry of carbons and whatnot and you'll definitely be expected to get this stuff in 203 no matter who you take.  Maybe if you have any friend or know someone in the course, you should perhaps ask for the worksheets or problem sets in the latter 1/2 or 1/3 of 150.  A lot of it is like AP but with more conceptual than mathematical framing of topics. Note that it may be really helpful to understand potential energy diagrams of bond breaking/making as well as things like how Coulomb's law is relevant for ionic and covalent bonds as they'll likely harken back to this as they begin introducing students to reactivity and energetics in 202 (they may for example basically ask students to use a structural/coulomb's law oriented argument to explain why ATP reacts to become ADP so easily for example).\n\n\\*Basically be prepared to have to learn things conceptually (including things you may have only learned from a math point of view) and not just mathematically.  I know AP has changed to emphasize more conceptual stuff, but it still sort of separates mathematical chemistry from conceptual stuff (like huge chunks of the AP exam FRQ section is just spent doing rate laws, titration/buffers, and energetics \"plug and chug\" problems with no connection to structure.  The few conceptual/structural problems tend to be isolated).  I don't think you really need to review that 150 material I put above, but I advise that you don't be complacent and anticipate a pure math fest like most gen. chem 2 courses are. Be ready for a different framing of certain concepts with a decent amount of that framing being traditionally organic chemistry 1/2 concepts and reactions which differs from AP. This will be the case no matter which instructor you are taking.",

              "text": "Oh yeah that's right and I think AP usually skips that and it certainly doesn't test it.  That honestly may be the main thing they wanna look at as well as reviewing general structure stuff (I actually don't think AP exams or curricula generally require students to draw molecules just from formulas. They sort of just present them with the structures and then ask them to either do stuff with it or some other questions especially when an organic structure is involved).",

                  "text": "AP doesn't do much structural stuff at all. From what I remember it was almost entirely math and any questions about Lewis structures went up to identifying hybridization and that's it. AP definitely didn't test me on MO theory. As you say, they also didn't require students to draw structures. Line-wedge-dash isn't covered, neither is 3D conformation.\n\nWith that in mind, the content in 202 actually matches AP a lot better since that's where thermodynamics and acid-base equilibria is taught.",

You will always have to do both, just quantitative will not be enough. For example, given 2 acids, you will state which is stronger and to support your answer, you will list and compare the pKa\u2019s (quantitative) as well as draw appropriate structures (usually resonance) and write a paragraph defending why this is the case. Regardless, here are some important topics to know before starting 202. \n\n\nLewis structures\n\n-Resonance\n\n-Line/wedge/dash structures, Newman Projections\n\n-Octet rule (including when the octet can be expanded)\n\n-Hybridization\n\nStereochemistry\n\n-Assigning R and S (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules)\n\n-Enantiomers\n\n-Conformation vs configuration vs constitution and how these apply to isomers\n\nMolecular Orbital Theory\n\n-HOMOs and LUMOs\n\n-Drawing MO diagrams\n\n-Determining which bonds are reactive",
