  "text": "Hey, y'all!\n\nI just got into Emory for law school, and I'm really considering it! Unfortunately, I've never been to Atlanta, so I have no experience with the city. I'll be visiting the city and school in the coming weeks, but I wanted to get an idea as to which neighborhoods Emory grad students typically stay at.\n\nLemme know if any neighborhoods or apartment complexes fit the bill, so I can visit them when I come into town. Also, if you have any recs as far restaurants, bars, nightlife, etc. to check out while in town, please let me know!\n\nThanks, in advance!",

If you will have a car, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out! For food/restaurants, there are plenty of brunch places in ATL along with great coffeeshops! Good food in midtown, Buford Highway, and buckhead areas! ",

Also a lot less undergrads live there, its mostly grad students and professionals, so you could actually get a good night sleep instead of having loud ass neighbors.",

It\u2019s one of the best buses in town. Also, the 36 and 316 lines come through Emory\u2014they both take you to the places you\u2019d most want to go in town. \n\nFor everything else, there\u2019s Uber. Cheap as hell most of the time. \n\nLastly, keep in mind the Emory shuttles. They may open up other possibilities for living. http://transportation.emory.edu/shuttles/\n\n\nAnyway, I think especially if you live near Clifton, a car is really not a necessity. \n\n",

Overpriced for what you get.\n\nEmory Point is also a bit overpriced but it's good if you don't have a car and are willing to spend a bit more. \n\nGables Rocksprings I highly recommend. Very very affordable (as low as $1200/month for a two bedroom), 1.5 miles from the law school which is only a 30 minute walk. Also close to the briarcliff campus where a shuttle picks up and drops off.\n\nHighland Square isn't too bad and about the same distance as Rock Springs. More expensive though.\n\nCampus Crossings Briarcliffe is good if you don't have a car since it's right next to a Kroger and has a shuttle stop right outside.",
