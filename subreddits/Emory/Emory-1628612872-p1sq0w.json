  "text": "I'm an incoming freshman and I registered to take ACT 210 in the fall. I'm planning to switch out of it if I get off the wait-list for MATH 111, but will I have a bad time if I end up taking ACT 210? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my other classes:\n\nJS 190 (3 credits)\n\nFREN 101 (4 credits)\n\nARTHIST 103 (3 credits)\n\nECS 101 (1 credit)\n\nHLTH 100 (1 credit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have the opportunity to switch ACT 210 with ENG389W if needed, but I feel like my schedule would be too humanities/language-focused if I did that (I wouldn't be taking any sort of math/STEM). Does anyone have any advice for me?",

      "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman too but I registered for ACT 210 (section 4 so we could be classmates maybe). I might have also misunderstood your question so sorry if I\u2019m not answering the question correctly.\n\nBut anyway, Atlas says the class is a pre requisite for the business school and is only offered at the school of arts and sciences, which means mostly freshman and sophomores will take it.\n\nAlso, there was a financial accounting class at my high school (not AP though so I have to take it again). Financial accounting was taught as a pretty introductory class so I don\u2019t think it would be overwhelming.",

          "text": "Yeah I heard it's mostly sophomores in the course so I guess it shouldn't be too different in that regard. I was mostly nervous about taking it because of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/i2xn0a/act_210_as_a_freshman_in_the_fall/) and a number of ratemyprofessor reviews saying that the class was difficult & to avoid taking it during your fall freshman semester.\n\nI'm guessing it's not a big deal once you get used to it, but I just don't wanna ruin my first semester by stressing over a super hard class.",
