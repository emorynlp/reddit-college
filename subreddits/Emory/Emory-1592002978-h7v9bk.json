  "text": "I am an international student. I\u2019ll be starting freshman year this year, and as much as I would love to be on campus, I just think it\u2019s safer to be take this semester online also my parents would never let me go if the online option is available this semester. But I do have some concerns that I hope some of you might be able to help me with. I know students who start in campus now will acclimate better to campus life and will be able to form better connections with professors(Something I hate to be missing out on) but would I be missing out extracurricularly too? I plan on applying to med school and I know how tough that is especially for an international student, so I\u2019m just getting a little paranoid honestly. My parents are telling me not to worry since it\u2019s only a semester and I\u2019ll have the rest of the year to pursue other things and build my resum\u00e9 but I\u2019m still a little worried. Do you think I should be legitimately concerned about this?",

              "text": "?????Ideally if you wanna start research, you can do so as late as 4th semester or the summer going into junior year.  The idea is to go in when you are actually ready (right mindset, ready to struggle and fail, have a decent enough content background and analytical thinking skills) so that you can be productive and do a successful honors thesis or publish.  You do not need to rush to do research.  If you are ready to place early or think you'll enjoy that a lot, then gone ahead and go for it, but do not tie it to the \"I really need to do this to get into med. school\" narrative because it isn't really true (it certainly helps for \"some\" med. schools, but not all and it mainly helps when you have a product to show or did conference presentations/disseminated findings from your research in some way).  What you SHOULD be paranoid about is the quality of your pre-med courses (you need a strong MCAT score) and whether or not they will hold up.  I imagine so as long as they have some in-person component (because they've had so long to prepare this time vs. being suddenly upended like in spring 2020) and you choose the right instructors, but otherwise, I don't know.\n\nAnd I pray for y'all that this doesn't bleed into spring because courses like chem 2 are transitory to ochem, and if chem 2 ends up watered down or has to skip topics in its adjustment to a new format (I think this happened in spring 2020.  Specifically some of the ochem content gen. chem 2/chem 202 usually covers was cut it seems, and chem 203 usually assumes students have that knowledge and review it swiftly and at a much higher level because of that), then I expect students to really struggle in ochem versus previous years where the level of the course was optimal.\n\nEither way don't worry about the research thing yet.   Most students EVERYWHERE will be going through the same thing (only those about to start honors research should be concerned and this is being adressed apparently:[http://www.biology.emory.edu/](http://www.biology.emory.edu/) .  You as a freshman have nothing to worry about. Come in, learn at the highest level you can, perform as well as you can, and then start looking for labs)having perhaps more limited than normal options due to some labs not opening back up yet.  The blame will not be placed on you by any 3rd party for this.  They'll get what happened.  For now, if you think want to get involved and have some areas of interest, when you start in the fall, start reaching out and find out who has resumed lab work.  You can also talk to your STEM instructors regarding this because they may know some things about what is happening in research in their respective departments.",

I feel like GA would be in better condition if the reopening didn't happen as soon but then LOTS of other stuff happened and Emory gets lots of students from places that are/were even bigger hot spots.  Here in Utah our counts are low so the university is about to let us go to 2 people per bay (with no restrictions on who it is). I feel bad that such restrictions need to be in place at Emory.  It sort of makes sense though because you wanna maximize time that grad. students and post-docs can spend in lab.  I can tell you that the month or 2 we were basically shut down was a big loss of time and the social distancing now slows things down tremendously.",

                      "text": "The spring semester courses for bio and chem (I don't know what you plan to take or whether it is one or both of those) are most consequential for success in future courses tbh.  Maybe you can see what you learn in the fall and see if it is useful or sticking by trying some of the Kahn Academy MCAT questions on areas you think you covered. That could be a way of holding yourself accountable no matter how the 1st semester classes actually turn out. The earlier you become independent in your learning, the better off you'll be.  \n\nI still imagine classes like bio will keep all the case studies and activities and whatnot and sometimes those are at a solid level.  Hopefully they don't go to a straight lecture, quizzes, and exams sort of format that requires less frequent engagement with the material than the normal format.  Students in classes like that tend to cram and learn less and at lower levels and don't retain that much. Chem may be \"alright\" because most sections were already flipped.  The flipped format is still likely better in person though.",

                              "text": "Note that I generally recommend in class versions if offered (and I think they said maybe about 1/3 of faculty would offer online options.  I don't know what intro. STEM faculty, many of them quite young/middle aged, will choose to do).   The in person social interactions with students may be more limited than normal, but I think people realize how special in person interactions (even if social distanced) with faculty and others can be once you go even half a semester without it.  So I wasn't endorsing you just staying home necessarily.  See if you can get into in-person versions/sections and see what happens.  If you really wanna stay home or whatever, so be it I guess.  Maybe you could aim for in-class versions of your pre-med STEMs and a freshman seminar if you plan to take one in the fall, and online for other things.  But you would get to be on campus so that you can learn it and maybe explore Atlanta.  It'll certainly be interesting. I'll admit that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is also something that could end up positive and more \"magical\" about transitioning from a toned down atmosphere in the fall into what I hope is a more normal one in spring vs. what 2023 freshmen experienced. And you get to go into that funner, more vibrant spring with the less but still important and \"closer\" faculty and social connections you somehow managed to make in spite of Fall.  I don't know, I guess I just see both sides of it with at least a slight inclination to prefer in person (especially if a freshmen) for what you can have it for.",

You should just wait and find out though.  They'll likely offer a mix of different things to allow for social distancing.  The \"basic\" sciences courses would be gchem and gbio.  These classes would still be quite important.  Also without AP, you definitely want to take at least one of those in fall for sure or else you can't take the 2nd portion of those sequences.",
