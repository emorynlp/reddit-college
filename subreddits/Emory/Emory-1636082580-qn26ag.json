      "text": "According to the RMP stuff the other poster put this person eems polarizing, BUT you have wonderful comments with 9 upvotes like this when the only relevant part is whatever is being labelled the \"disorganization\" and I guess a thick skull.  This is how freshmen think:\"**A research course specific to lynchings in Georgia mislabeled as a \"sociology seminar on racial violence**\". A student will complete such menial tasks as transcribing hundreds of newspaper articles in PDF form to Word documents. His atrocious level of disorganization prompted a fiery argument with his T.A. during class. Lesson plans are improvised.\"As a person knowing that freshmen seminars are NOT supposed to be general (and I suspect that freshmen know this too), but are supposed to mirror easier, more accessible versions of small upper division research oriented seminars, I'll try remembering that lynchings in Georgia  because they are so specific are NOT about racial violence. Screw some of these people.  Seriously.  And so few of these rate whatever this specialized QTM course is.  By time you hit a 400 level, students should be relatively independent and expect specificity of topics or skills.I honestly think this syllabus should be more helpful to you as it is very detailed and sets up expectations:[http://sociology.emory.edu/home/documents/syllabi/soc585-franzosi-spring%202021.pdf](http://sociology.emory.edu/home/documents/syllabi/soc585-franzosi-spring%202021.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I had to guess and if the person is actually as described for frosh level seminars or soc., you can't expect to be spoonfed by this guy and independence will help I guess.  At the same time, I hear many upper division QTM hosted or cross-listed courses can be like that.",
