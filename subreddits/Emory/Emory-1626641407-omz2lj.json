  "title:": "Doing quantitative sciences minor with my CS major",
  "text": "So I'm a rising junior majoring in computer science (with an interest in data science), and I'm thinking if it's worth it to do a quantitative sciences minor with my CS major. I will need to take QTM 100, QTM 220, and QTM 250 to complete the minor as I'm thinking of taking QTM 302W and QTM 446W for the writing requirement anyways. Will completing the quantitative sciences minor help me in pursuing a data science career?",

      "text": "Yes, but make sure you focus on the right things with the classes you choose. What you really want to gain is experiences that you can talk about during an interview/list on you\u2019re application. Employers usually don\u2019t care that much about the specifics of you\u2019re degree title, but they will care about your experience. Stuff like final projects that use data science tools can really help you while applying to stuff. There are lots of QTM classes that give you those experiences.",
