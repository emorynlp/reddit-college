  "title:": "Course Recommendations for HAP Credit?",
  "text": "Do any upperclassmen have course recommendations to fulfill the Humanities, Arts, Performance (HAP) credit? I'm an incoming freshman who's planning to study business, and I'm interested in using the HAP credit to explore some new fields. I have a fairly medium workload (I think) for first semester, so I don't mind taking a class that has a decent amount of work as long as it's interesting. From looking at the atlas, a few courses caught my eye: \n\n* Understanding Architecture (Christina Crawford)\n* Topics in Afr American Studies: Race, Place &Political Economy (Jessica Lynn Stewart)\n* Modern Architecture: 1880 - 1945 (Christina Crawford)\n* Photography I (Joel Silverman)\n\nAnyone have strong recommendations for or against any of these courses? Are there other HAP courses that you took and really enjoyed? Thanks in advance!",

A caveat is that this class\u2019 syllabus changes wildly between professors, so depending on who\u2019s teaching it the course experience may be very different.",

              "text": "They certainly aren't \"meant\" for just freshmen but mainly pay attention to pre-reqs and recommended pre-reqs that the instructor may specify in the course description. The humanities don't really follow those course \"level\" hierarchies the same way STEM and social sciences do. For example, History 285s are typically survey classes open to anyone and have no pre-reqs. When Arab-Israeli Conflict was taught, it was listed as a 300 level in history, political science, and Jewish Studies but was really open to everyone and a share of freshmen would take it and do just fine.",
