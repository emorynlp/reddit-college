Im from the East Coast (Northeast) so its far\n2. I heard competition is harsh there. If anyone knows please fill me in!\n\nSo since GPA is important for med school, I'm wondering how difficult Oxford at Emory is for pre-med? I would really appreciate info/advice. Thanks.",

                  "text": "grade distribution targets intro. (or STEM in general) courses at Emory and Berkeley are very similar.  I think their GPAs get dragged down because they a) have way more STEM students proportionally (especially since they have an engineering school), and like other public schools, may have far more large social science and humanities courses which would have a wider and lower grade distribution than say...a small seminar type setting or substantially smaller lecture.  Public schools have inflation as well, it's just slower.  \n\nOx may have been a \"back-door\" into Emory, but I honestly think a lot of main campus people (which is where I started) kick it out of insecurity.  Basically, Oxford makes an easier target than actual peer schools that may be less rigorous or technically less selective than Emory or Oxford.  Like, I don't see many folks targeting hate at UCLA which is less selective than both (and had been even before Ox closed the gap with main) when you actually look at student body quality (and not admit rate which is just a function of application volume).  It's like they just need someone to pick on.  What is even more odd is that Emory is VERY transfer friendly and no one cares about the origins of transfer students (which usually aren't Emory or even Oxford tier colleges selectivity or rigor wise).  Some people just need some type of rivalry or someone to kick.  I remember back in the mid-2000s, SGA cooked up a faux rivalry against WUSTL (which makes more sense to me) that did resonate for a while, but given how many students also entertained going there, this was hard keeping up and people eventually rejected it....and now they are left with kicking an Oxford that is essentially just as selective as main campus now-a-days.",

              "text": "People feel that way because historically, Oxford was a back door into Emory. However, in recent years, Oxford has gotten a lot more competitive to get into and you will see some kids who got into Emory but not Oxford. IMO, you should choose Oxford if you want a liberal arts-esque experience for your first two years. I found that it worked out really well for me. \n\nI heard that the pre-med courses at Oxford are tougher (though this is anecdotal evidence) but because the class sizes are smaller, professors are able to easily find time to help out students and build close relationships with them. Most of the Oxford pre-med kids I know got their med school recommendations from Oxford professors for this reason.",

Don't know (tbh, I think too many of the lecturers can't be bothered especially given the large section sizes)  Math, I don't know (too many sections on main).  Chem, seems main is tougher/solid quality. The thing about the recommendations seems true.  They have a bigger culture of faculty mentoring there whereas on main it seems like it is primarily the most rigorous instructors that many want to avoid that enjoy mentoring or having a direct role in student development which honestly makes sense. \n\nOf course any half way decent instructor with very high demands would put extra effort into ensuring that as many students can meet them as possible.  Instructors with low demands often have low demands precisely because they don't want to interact as much with students.  Basically, they aren't watering things down out of \"kindness\" but are doing so for their own convenience.  Often teachers being \"chill\" or having lax standards doesn't mean they think highly of or care about students despite what RMP comments about such instructors may suggest.  Faculty, like students are willing to put on a show for good evals;\"you don't bother me, and I won't challenge you\".",

      "text": "I started at Oxford and while I cannot speak to the experience you might have at UC Berkeley, I can say that I personally enjoyed my time at Oxford, possibly more than I have at the Atlanta campus.\n\nI think something you should consider is the lifestyle/culture at Oxford & Emory versus UC Berkeley. Oxford is a very small campus and some people find it a bit suffocating at times. Of course, everyone knows that you'll be moving to Atlanta in 2 years (or 1.5 if you graduate early) and can stick it out if they don't like how small it is. As far as competition at Oxford goes, I definitely feel as though there is more of a \"stress culture\" at Oxford than at Emory, but it didn't bother me that much personally; this is something for you to decide. Also, there was rarely ever a curve on biology and chemistry tests, so there wasn't any pressure to out-compete people.\n\nObviously, you know that GPA matters. At the same time, the quality of your education will matter as well, because you will have to take the MCAT, which pulls heavily from those STEM classes and critical thinking skills. At Oxford, the introductory biology sequence is rigorous and I remember feeling at the time that it was way harder than what a 100-level course should be; however, an A/A- is definitely obtainable if you put the work in and you will learn a lot. I'm a biology major and I have found the 2 introductory courses at Oxford to prepare me very well for my upper-level electives, if that matters (I found my genetics course at Emory to be easier than my intro course at Oxford).\n\nIn a way, I was lucky that in addition to the 2 research projects I completed as part of the intro bio sequence at Oxford, I was also able to get into research for credit course my sophomore year as well, which definitely gave me a leg up when I came to Emory looking for a lab position. In my opinion, Oxford professors are very approachable and they want you to succeed. If you do end up choosing Oxford, I think you'll have a relatively easy time building decent connections with your professors because your classes will cap at about 24 students. This could be valuable when you're looking for rec letters.\n\nOverall, I think you have a hard decision to make, but if ever need someone to chat with about Emory/Oxford, feel free to reach out! Good luck :)",

It\u2019s definitely a lot smaller than Berkeley and though I can\u2019t speak fully on it, I think the premed classes are hard but definitely doable. Professors and students are always willing to help and I feel that it\u2019s been a great experience so far. It really depends on what you are looking for, I think if you really value the big school full college experience vibe, then Ox may not be the best choice. But if you think premed is your field and are looking for a good place to succeed, I think Ox has a great community. Obviously take my opinion with a grain of salt, but just throwing another opinion out there.",
