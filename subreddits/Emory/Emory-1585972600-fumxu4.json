  "title:": "UT Austin vs Emory for physics (Help a struggling high school senior decide)",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm struggling to decide between Emory and UT Austin for physics and would appreciate any thoughts. Planning on getting a BS in physics, getting a PhD in physics, and hoping to become a professor at a university so that I can do research/teach. Here are a couple of pros/cons listed below. (Also, how do you bold text?)\n\nEmory vs. UT Austin for physics\n\n__Emory__\n\nPros:\n\n* Atlanta\n* Although in/near a big city, it still has its own campus with a \"campus vibe\"\n* Cheapest option ($4k a year)\n* SIRE research program (I intend to go to grad school for physics so getting involved in research is big)\n* Higher ranked school\n* Outside of Texas\n* The community is a big deal to me at a campus and Emory's selectivity leads me to believe I'll generally find more dedicated students (especially considering its lack of sports/weak party culture) vs. UT Austin auto admit policy\n\nCons:\n\n* **Lower ranked physics program (USNews 71, Niche??? (67+???(unranked after that??) or 308??), CollegeFactual 98)**\n* Lacks school spirit/football team/weak party culture\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UT Austin**\n\nPros:\n\n* **High ranked physics program ( USNews 17, Niche 23, CollegeFactual 51)**\n* Has football team/big party school/school spirit\n\nCons:\n\n* More expensive ( $11k a year)\n* Integrated with Austin, no \"campus feel\"\n* Inside Texas\n* I'd rather not go to my state school\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's probably easy to tell by this post that I'm really trying to convince myself to go to Emory but my **priority is my future and grad school**(this matters much more than \"campus feel\" etc) so if UT Austin puts me on higher ground for applications, I can't ignore that. Also, financials aren't a major concern. Money doesn't mean too much to me, as long as I'm not living on the streets its cool, so loans won't matter + I'm applying to tons of scholarships (25 so far) so I'm hoping I'll be able to knock UT Austins price down to a reasonable amount if it does come to that.",

It's not listed high enough, but if I were to gauge your true desires, the rankings don't really matter as much as your enjoyment in life for the next 4+ years. Other than that, it's how you do in school and how you motivate yourself as an undergrad for research. Also, I like Emory's aid better.\n\nThis is how you **bold** text. Just add ** before and after. Seems like you tried, though.",

      "text": "departmental rankings(other than maybe engineering which has some undergraduate program rankings) are usually measuring relative impact of the research and the graduate program for the programs and may have NOTHING to do with undergraduate instruction and quality, or what you'll experience/gain access to at the school (and even at 71, you will have a ridiculous amount of reseaech options, many interdisciplinary and there will be less competition for it). Many Emory physics majors pursue PhDs and land at the top tier/well funded physics PhD programs and since its smaller/has less majors than other sciences, anyone who does a major gets lots of attention.  \n\nIf Emory is affordable, and you overall prefer it, give it a shot (at least it will be a change from Texas).  If this were places like Chicago, GT, MIT, Michigan,Berkeley, Caltech, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, or maybe even Yale/Columbia, I would sing a different tune especially if they were on the affordable side after aid and all because those places are known for unusually strong UNDERGRADUATE physics programs.  And just to reiterate how little that rank matters for you, I would also have recommended several top tier LACs and naturally, they wouldn't be ranked for physics \n(nonetheless the education at many of them is so strong in STEM subjects that they inspire disproportionate amounts to pursue PhDs) because they do not have grad. programs.\n\nEmory definitely won't hurt your access or preparedness for PhD programs and like you said, you may end up more inspired or motivated by your peers on average (despite Emory math, CS, and physics not having the best grad. rankings, the programs seem to attract a ridiculous amount of braniacs/passionate students and those dead serious about the disciplines and this ends up spilling out of the classroom beyond even just research.  There are also lots of competitions and whatnot that more Emory students have been pursuing and have been successful at).  Either way, you'll be taken care of if you do the best you can and demonstrate a deep enough interest in the subject to take advantage of stuff like those EC/co-currics. and reach out for research opps.  \n\nGaining access to a PhD is more about how you develop at your school of choice and lesser so the school itself, and any decently selective school overall (so including Austin and Emory) will get a bump, especially if you have a good research/experience record before applying (so publications and/or honors thesis).",

There seem to be misunderstandings about how STEM PhD admissions work, what departmental rankings mean, and what/how/which undergraduate institutions \"produce\" candidates for the programs.  They are very common misunderstandings.  \n\nJust remember that you'll likely tailor your app. to a subdiscipline of physics and these grad programs are fairly small, so readers will be able to very holistically assess the application and the actual substance of what you accomplished, and then determine if you fit their program/whether the program offers something to you (as in you should be discussing which research groups match your interests in the PS).",

From what I\u2019ve experienced so far, the physics community that we have here is really quite small. Although Oxford just being a small community in general, I\u2019ve only met one or two other physics majors here. If you deeply value having a community of students who share interests with you, you might be better off at UT Austin. With that being said, the Physics professors here are extremely qualified, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a far stretch at all to say that they\u2019re some of the best professors on campus. I\u2019m not sure how much of this all applies to Atlanta campus, but I\u2019d imagine you\u2019ll have a somewhat easier time finding other physics majors.",

From what I\u2019ve heard, aid reduces each year (I think Fafsa gets a stricter calculation), and if you\u2019re already getting research at Emory, you\u2019re hitting the biggest grad school tick box along with less debt. \n\nAnd trust me, I had the same worries about the social scene at Emory. There\u2019s definitely a bias on reddit, if you want to party, you can. Sports do definitely suck though, I can\u2019t recall seeing a single game besides looking through the window while walking back home from the gym lmao. I\u2019ve seen more sports practices than games. And apparently the entire track team walked off so there\u2019s that as well",

      "text": "Just to drive  home this point about the LACs and thus the lack of predictive info. about undergraduate success that can come from a departmental ranking: [http://www.thecollegesolution.com/the-colleges-where-phds-get-their-start/](http://www.thecollegesolution.com/the-colleges-where-phds-get-their-start/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow many of these places that are \"feeders\" (damned shame I can't find raw data on this.  I saw some like a couple of weeks ago and the data was relatively recent.  Those LACs were over-feeding to all fields) would be unranked or low ranked in something like physics.   But they feed nonetheless.  Arguably, one real correlate is likely the income level and background of the students' parents at some of these schools.  Many LACs have very wealthy student bodies and do not have as robust aid packages that top tier private research universities have begun using to recruit students.  In addition, the parents may be more likely to be academics themselves, so selection effects are certainly at play.  With that said, it just isn't out there to think that places that can put more focus and money into undergraduate education will keep students in the pipeline to pursue PhDs.\n\nThis essay is interesting (and I have read it several times): [http://www.thecollegesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cech\\_article2.pdf](http://www.thecollegesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cech_article2.pdf)\n\nI definitely buy a decent deal of it (LAC grads are over-represented in faculty positions even at top tiers.  Again, these places are un-ranked).  And you sort of see this effect to some degree with Emory's Oxford campus.  For example, this happened a few years ago:[https://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/05/er\\_physics\\_honors/campus.html](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/05/er_physics_honors/campus.html)\n\nNot only are these females, but Oxford College was over-represented among this group (this seemed to be the case with life sciences and chemistry PhDs as well), and note how they ended up all crediting the mentoring and instruction of a single faculty member (trust me, these relationships and inspirations are ultra important). But this just shows it is very much about the mentoring and individual experience you give yourself.  Make it as rich as possible.  Unfortunately rankings(especially if one is trying to use a graduate ranking as a proxy for what happens to undergraduates in the associated program) do very little to predict how easy it is to do that, but decent selectivity and relatively small size may be of help.  So no...it is very unlikely that UT Austin will put you on higher ground for applications to grad. school (that really isn't how it works.\n\nWhat could put you on higher ground is doing well in a good/reputable research group at either, and having a product to show folks because I assure you that merely taking courses and getting good grades in them is not enough to demonstrate interest in or preparedness for PhD level work.  Again, unless the place is home to like a re-vamped or ultra strong UG physics curriculum, the course work at a research university is likely to have very little impact in your development compared to the intellectual work outside of the course that some of the content is the foundation for.  Either of these programs will give you the \"went to a good school\" (no, the adcoms will not consider the rank of the graduate program in your major.  They are mainly considering the overall selectivity of the school as they sometimes believe that it can help them contextualize the grades you earn.  Like, they'll want you to challenge yourself and do rigorous upper division and graduate courses if possible, but will cut some slack on the GPA if they perceive that courses had stiffer competition or maybe even more rigorous demands due to high selectivity) bump, but then what?",
