  "text": "So I'm a freshman and on campus and honestly I'm not having the best time. I wouldn't say im regretting my decision to come here yet, but im scared that ill eventually get there.\n\nOn campus, ive made a total of 0 friends. Ive talked to the people in my dorm a few times but i wouldnt consider them friends. The combination of all zoom classes and limited clubs/activities has also made it virtually impossible to connect with people since I'm a massive introvert and will probably never try to \"force\" friendships.\n\nAnyway to the main point of this post, I also have no idea what to major in. I know I have about a year to decide but that's coming quick and im scared ill be in the same position a year later. I'm interested in STEM and/or business. This semester in taking CS170 and FIN201 to get a feel for each one and hopefully come closer to making a decision. Ive realized i actually enjoy CS but i currently have a 52% and idk if im gonna pass the class. As for FIN201, its alright i have a good grade but its nothing exciting. Besides, the application process for the b school scares me since I have no extracurriculars (want to wait till theyre in person) and because of zoom i barely know my professors so rec letters won't be good. I came in with AP credit for french, so i want to minor in french studies, but I see no point in doing that as a major. \n\nThe highest grade ive gotten in any exam in any class is like a 70, which i thought was fine but there are so many people who are doing better than me. As soon as i got accepted, i thought i just got accepted for \"diversity\" (im a hispanic woman), but that i still deserved my spot. Now, i'm still having major imposter syndrome. the combination of no friends, lacking grade, 0 passion for anything is making me question everything. Why am i in college? why am i HERE? \n\nI feel like i'm running out of time to decide what to do. I havent found my passion and idk if ill find it in a year's time. My grades are mediocrely average and I feel so lost in who to ask for advice. Is there anyone on campus (like an advisor or something) who can give me some guidance as to where to go? can any upperclassmen that started as undecided give me any advice?",

      "text": "I'm going to be very honest with you (as a fellow URM).  You should NEVER rely on introductory courses as a determinant of whether you have a passion at something or will even be good at it, especially when it is freaking Covid and the social apparatuses that go with learning in traditionally challenging courses like  CS 170 are greatly diminished.  You should also be open to experimentation and not limiting yourself to what are likely \"safe\" career paths in CS and business.  For all you know, you may actually find a passion in something completely different and if done well, they can have good returns on investment as well.  I suspect Emory will largely return to in person in the fall if all goes well with this vaccine and nothing weird happens again.\n\nKeep trying, and since you are an introvert (as I kind of am), maybe use the academic networks (which will be in fullswing) to begin to form some associations or friendships.  Either way, this is not the year for anyone, and it is very typical for freshmen to \"struggle\" or be average in academic work especially when something is made intentionally intense like CS 170.  I mean do your best to turn it around this semester if you can, but give yourself some grace for this hellish year and also don't let your struggle in that one course or in some others convince yourself that you don't belong or that you shouldn't try again.  This just isn't the optimal year for college students generally and you took on a challenging course load.  With this whole business stuff, if you take another course and do fine in it but still don't see it as something that can eventually excite as you progress through the curriculum, you need to let it go and try some other things.\n\nThere are many ways to do \"business\" that don't involve a damned BBA so don't bore yourself for 3-4 years.  With CS and whatever else you are doing, DO try to learn as much as you can about your own study habits and what (and maybe even who) you need to perform better going forward, but definitely don't give up and don't be daunted by the idea that \"others are doing better than you\".\n\nWhile high achievers have big egos and are used to being perfect or at the top of their game, a good college should make sure that you face some academic challenge at some point in time.  Again, for many it will be early in their career. View yourself as a work in progress and try to develop yourself.  You don't have to have it already \"made\" yet.  Please give yourself some time.  There is a reason you have until like your 4th semester to declare. Going forward, keep an open mind of what you might like and try to choose good professors (more so than classes with \"good\" titles).  They can liven things up and unveil a passion you perhaps didn't foresee (even if it is in a challenging area).  You do not have to have it all figured out yet so please don't let the Emory ethos put that pressure on you this early.",

      "text": "You did not get in just because diversity. No one get in just because they're a urm, they also have to have the same grades, extracurriculars, etc as everyone else. I'm not a urm but had major imposter syndrome when I first got accepted since my gpa was lower than normally accepted. But what I've ocme to realize this year is everyone is struggling the same as me. Idk if you've gotten a chance to talk to people during class a lot, but I do and there's a lot of times where we'll both be complaining or where they'll explain a concept a bit further I didn't get the first time and I'll explain concepts to them a bit more they didn't grasp the first time. Yeah your grades may not be the best right now but there is time to improve them and subsequent years especially. And on the major thing, although I know my intended major, I went to this honors night event for first years a couple days ago and they'd start off each zoom room with asking us about ourselves with stuff like where we're from and what is our major, and there were sooo many people who said they didn't know know their major yet. Plus some of the speakers who were professors that gave us background on their educations talked about not having a clue what their major freshman year would be either, with some switching majors multiple times. So, you don't have to decide just yet and you're not an outlier that's going to be left behind for not being able to, there's quite a lot in the same position as you",

I empathize a lot with what you are describing and it sucks to go through but you can overcome it I promise.  \n\nI'm a second year and I'm currently in the process of bombing the shit out of all my chem assignments; shit happens. Stem is fucking hard, and I can't speak personally about business but I doubt it's any easier. Give yourself more slack than you would normally with everything being online. You aren't doing anything wrong or messing anything up irreparably. \n\nSeveral of my 3rd year friends have changed their majors this year. You have to pick a major yeah, but you are free to change it (though it just might make it harder if you do). \n\nI struggle with imposter syndrome too. The idea of being a charity case eats at me like you wouldn't believe. But you gotta remind yourself of all the work that you put in to be here, and you deserve to find success.",

I know you say you're introverted, but I do think finding mentors might help you decide what you want to do and beat back imposter syndrome. Ssk an upperclassman you know who is friendly in the CS or Fin departments or just choose a few faculty based on their profiles.  If you email them asking if you could chat for about 30 minutes about majoring in the department / career options, I expect most faculty members will say yes. I know it can be kinda scary to ask, but this is part of their job and most professors genuinely enjoy mentoring students. Getting some support and perspective may help give you some clarity!",

      "text": "A lot of students have already made posts so I'm not sure if you're still reading but I'll add my two cents. \n\nIts important, especially in the upperclassman years, to be in a major that you like and enjoy. Don't get me wrong, doing something that you're good at will get your far but it'll come at the sacrifice of other things like emotional and mental health or an overall feeling of bleh about your college life. So i would follow your passion, because if you are really passionate about the CS major you will find time to study and excel at it. \n\nAlso, I would like to add that while I understand you wanting to wait for in-person extracurriculars I think you should join or partake in a couple online extracurriculars like missing maps or after school tutoring. It looks really good on applications that you didn't let this pandemic slow you down and that you adapted to the new circumstances you were placed in. However, if you still don't want to join anything you should at least \"network\". Not in like a B-school sense but if you are inspired by something or see something really cool don't feel scared about sending an email and building up a rapport. Then, when in person stuff comes back, those people that you built a rapport with will have you at the front of their minds for opportunities.",

It is better to feel a sense of belonging and be confident in your grades than to struggle at an academically rigorous institution. Honestly, the confidence you build in college is one of the most important things you can get. I know people might disagree, but there is a saying in my tribe, that it's better to be the head of a chicken than to be the tail of a Phoenix. It's better to excel at say, somewhere less prestigious than emory than to be the \" tail\". Hope it helps! Don't feel intimidated by the thought of transferring. It's completely normal and since you're a freshman, you still have time. If you miss this window, it might be harder to pick a new place since credits might not transfer and you might delay your graduation time.",
