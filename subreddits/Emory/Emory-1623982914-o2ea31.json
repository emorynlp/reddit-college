  "text": "I\u2019m taking psychology and one of the requirements is we must do 6 credits of research.\n\nThe problem is that only 6 credits of research are offered, so I am forced to do all the studies offered.\n\nOne of the studies is \u201crated-R\u201d where we are expected to be shown images of death, assault, gore, etc. \n\nI am genuinely uncomfortable with this but can\u2019t get out of it because no other studies are being offered. What should I do? If I don\u2019t participate my grade will be taken down a full letter. I\u2019m thinking I tell the researchers I\u2019m doing it for the credit but don\u2019t want to see gory photos?",

They also may have figured that the online/covid is less intense(and I don't know if that is true but I heard that semi-challenging people like Kazama became much less so during online learning and stuff) than in person or something they'd keep everything as if its a semester term course.  Historically 110 seems designed and run more like pre-med weedout STEMs than the stereotype of beginning psych courses so I'm not shocked at the strictness of that despite the time crunch.",

I got 100% in that class without studying at all (I felt a little bad for that but honestly wanted to focus on chem 150). It\u2019s definitely easier w Covid. I think the other professors were a little different\u2014some required papers\u2014and I don\u2019t know if Kazama changed in the spring (don\u2019t think he\u2019s teaching summer) but yeah.\n\nHe\u2019s a really nice guy though. He did it so that students would take what they want from that class without being stressed. Honestly, you could have just looked at the presentation slides/google/speedrun a lecture recording to answer the prompts too. I didn\u2019t because I was interested in the material, but I\u2019m sure some people did.",

      "text": "Hmmm. I\u2019m taking psych 111 right now and I just finished the 6 credit research requirement tonight. I wasn\u2019t involved in any studies related to gory images. It\u2019s probably because there was another study involving memory worth two credits and the deadline to sign up for that was last Monday. Considering that and the fact that you\u2019re allowed to do a research article instead, I don\u2019t think your professor would be able to do anything.\n\nWhat can you do? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to do the reports on research articles. I would email your professor more about that and do so ASAP. Finals are due at the end of next week for me (including for my other psych class) so I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that you\u2019d have another week to do it. Definitely a rough spot to be in though.",
