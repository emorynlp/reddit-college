  "text": "I got pre-enrolled in AAS 190 (Africn Amer Studies: Afrofuturism) two days ago, and it seems like an interesting FSEM, but I'm curious to hear about y'all's experiences in other first-year seminars because a lot of these course descriptions are so ***vague***. \n\nCould you guys please tell me...\n\n1. The first-year seminar you took + instructor\n2. A brief summary of what you did in that class\n3. Your rating out of 10 for how interesting it was (0 being boring and 10 being super interesting) and why\n4. Rating out of 10 for amount of workload (maybe add some details about this)\n5. Any other comments/things you think I should know about the course\n\nThank you so much for your time!",

Analyzed children\u2019s literature and how it reflected cultural aspects, as well as what defines \u201cchildren\u2019s lit\u201d\n3. 6/10 interesting. Some lectures were interesting and gave great insight into the way of the world and social dynamics, whereas others were just repeating the readings. \n4.  2/10 workload. 1 discussion paper per week (300-500 words), a 5 page midterm analysis paper, and a creative final project. Most of our grade was participation and she gave everyone an A\n5. You get all the Jewish holidays off! And there are a LOT of them",

      "text": "I took my sem spring semester but \n1. I took AFS 190 Humanitarianism in Africa with Dr.  Kristin Phillips  \n2. We had a good amount of reading, then lecture and discussion every class. We had quizzes but she really prepared us for them, a group presentation, and a final paper (~7 pages) \n3. 8/10 I really liked Dr. Phillips and It was an eye opening class. I enjoyed most of the readings. I only took points off bc I have social anxiety so discussions and presentations just made me nervous \n4. 4/10 Most of the work is just reading (even tho most students didn\u2019t read and still got A\u2019s in the class) and the quizzes were straight out of the lecture. i\u2019m pretty sure everyone got a 95 or higher on the final paper too \n5. fsem courses really vary in workload.. when i got the syllabus for mine i thought it would have been a lot of work but it really wasn\u2019t",

      "text": "ARTHIST/CL 190 (cross listed) w Dr. Eric Varner. We studied the ancient roman emperors (Augustus, Julius Caesar, Caligula, etc) via ancient texts and the visual record (statues, coins, buildings) left behind. \n\n3. a solid 11. You'd think you could study history and the art separately, but this class taught me you can't. Art needs context, and sometimes the people writing history and the art contradict each other. Bonus point bc he puts his dogs in his lecture slides \"for scale\"\n\n4. a 5-6. the only work you really have is weekly readings, and then just a final paper and presentation. It's VERY chill in my opinion. \n\n5. the class only meets once a week for 3 hrs, but do not let that scare you. I preferred it to my other classes because I could put his readings off if I wanted to. It also let us get in depth into the material. He also gives you a 30 min break so it's really not that bad. Dr. Varner is also very fair to work with and your grade is largely based on how much effort you put in throughout the whole semester.",
