  "text": "Taking isom 350 and fin 201 at the same time (first semester of freshman year)\u2026 how difficult will this be and are either of these classes terrible. I\u2019m not superb at math so I\u2019m a bit nervous about that part especially because I haven\u2019t really taken a real math credit since my jr year of highschool. Also for reference I took 12 credits this semester so I won\u2019t have too many classes.",

      "text": "You should be fine. I took Prof. Gu last semester and he was amazing and made the class pretty easy. You won\u2019t have to be good @ math for ISOM 350, Prof. Gu focuses more on answers rather than the math component. Excel does all the work for you. I wouldn\u2019t be able to speak on FIN 201 but ISOM w/ Prof Gu is gonna be a breeze",

          "text": "Don't be scared before you get in the class.  Just do the best you can.  If you go in with fear, some things become a self-fullfilling prophecy.  Also remember that Emory/college generally is gonna have a lot of resources affiliated with large gateway classes like these.  The only reason you should be afraid is if you already know you are afraid to seek help and use those resources.  But you won't have to do the course alone.  You should make plenty of friends, study buddies and then be able to supplement with stuff like e-pass, TAs, office hours.",
