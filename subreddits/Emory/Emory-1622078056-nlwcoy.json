      "text": "It's definitely possible(with very careful planning), but what do you plan to do with both if anything?  Is it critical to have BOTH degrees or are you just slapping them on there as two labels that will supposedly impress employers?  Can you not just maybe take up to NBB 301 and then take a few electives (perhaps some that have it as a foundation. Also, there are classes like neuroeconomics that may be of interest to you)?  I think my opinion usually leans on the side of don't double major unless you can seriously commit to both.  Like could you theoretically do research or go abroad within the NBB program while pursuing a BBA.  Likewise, would you be able to fully immerse yourself in the professional aspects of the BBA program if you take the NBB major seriously.\n\nIf you will have to half-ass(as in, if you finding yourself ducking and dodging all the best teachers and electives in either or both because they are supposedly \"hard\" because your schedule can't accommodate much challenge per course because it is simply too packed with courses, as I imagine it often will be...you maybe shouldn't do this) either and you don't really plan to use both(for example, lots of people looking into healthcare administration, just do a BBA or even something like Human Health followed by some sort of graduate program.  If you are looking into some type of life sciences STEM entrepreneurship, dabbling and taking research based/problem solving focused NBB and biology courses should suffice without having to major in it.  You just need something that teaches you in a way to inspire you or make you a more creative thinker in STEM and there are a surprising number of STEM courses that can help with that), then I'd pick one and then dabble in the other (that way, you don't have to go crazy planning say...NBB electives and core courses only offered a particular semester such as NBB 201 and 401. You just go up to 301 and/or 302 and choose among electives you like and be done with it.  It would honestly be easier to major in biology with like a BA and then FOCUS on the neuroscience/behavioral bio courses that cross-list with them).",
