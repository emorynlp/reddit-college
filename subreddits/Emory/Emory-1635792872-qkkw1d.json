I know tons of people with low scores (myself included, who did way worse than you) who wrote bomb ass essays and got in that way, Emory really does read them and weights them highly if you can show you're interesting, passionate, and provide something unique to the student body. \n\nI might still report the scores because there is a bit of a stigma around applications without test scores",
