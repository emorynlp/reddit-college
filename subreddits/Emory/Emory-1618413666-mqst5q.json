      "text": "Few and Evans are generally the most sought after. New, clean rooms with a great location. The few classrooms make a good study space too, or the ESC is right there. Highly recommend those. \n\nI\u2019ve heard good things about Clifton towers but I don\u2019t know too much. It\u2019s apartment style so if you like that then it might be a good option. Keep in mind it\u2019s kind of far away, and definitely adds about 10 extra minutes of walking to classes. \n\nHarris is kind of old and meh, but definitely a nice location. \n\nWoodruff generally has pretty big rooms, and they\u2019re suites which might be a bonus if you strongly prefer having your own bathroom. WoodRec is right there too if you\u2019re someone that likes to eat there a bunch. They also have their own gym located in the residence hall so that could also be a bonus. Downsides, like Clifton towers, it\u2019s far away from classes, unless the majority of your classes are in the bio building. Also kind of looks sad, cinderblock walls and all.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t live in Harris unless you like living with brown water coming out of your sink (yes, I asked maintenance to fix it, no, they did not). I probably broke several things in my dorm but wasn\u2019t charged for it because they either knew it was run-down trash or they didn\u2019t want me to sue them for the mold growing in the AC. I can\u2019t prove this, but I did notice after a few months a musty odor coming from the AC that would blow out warm, moist air no matter what temperature I set it at. I lived in a single tho, maybe they treat their doubles better. This was in 2020.",
