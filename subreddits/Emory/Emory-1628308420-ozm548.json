  "text": "Hello, I'm an incoming freshman, and I recently made a post about my freshman schedule. Through the comments, I decided to take CHEM 202z+L instead of 150+L by using my AP Chem credit. However, I am still quite nervous about taking an advanced class. \n\nWhen I did ALEKS, I had 50% \"mastered\" (meaning I knew the content already), and I had to restudy the rest. My AP Chem score was 5, and my SAT Chem score was 760. But those are all from 10th grade (2 years ago). \n\nHow should I prepare for 202z? How much of it is gchem, and how much of it is ochem? There is a lot of information I forgot because I took AP Chemistry in 10th grade, and I want to make sure I'm not completely lost when I get to class. I don't want to get tripped over on problems and lectures that assume I know certain information during class.",

      "text": "The chem dept recommends that if you have AP credit but still do not feel 100% about it, to either start with Chem 150 or wait until spring to take 202. If you still decide to go through with 202z, it might not be a bad idea to do some reviewing in the next two weeks (I suggest Khan academy or just doing some practice AP FRQs).\n\nNot sure abt the ratio bw genchem/ochem but you will learn the equivalent of about a half-semester worth of ochem (through SN1/SN2/E1/E2). That's the part of ochem that a lot of students start to find difficult: reaction mechanisms.",

              "text": "The 202 option is way worse than 202z because 202 assumes you got the conceptual framework(150 has topic overlap with AP, but the conceptual framework in which it is presented is very different.  Much more focus on periodic trends, the potential energy of bonds, 3-D drawings of molecules, stereochemistry/conformation (Newman Projections, configuration labeling)/organic structure foundation from the end of 150 whereas 202z does not.  I think 202 uses a learning assistant problem set as \"review\" and then they just start using structure flippantly throughout the course so you'd have to learn structure at the level very quickly.  202z assumes nothing because you come from freaking AP which the instructor knows didn't emphasize structure much, much less organic structure so it'll slow walk you into structure.  \n\nThe main difference is that instead of doing a sort of mathy module(Gibbs Energy, equilibrium, thermo, and maybe the basics of acid-base math and proton transfer mechanisms) at the beginning of 202 to blend it with some of the structural stuff, 202z builds your structural knowledge and then goes directly into qualitative aspects of organic reactivity/mechanisms.",

      "text": "202z will have a heavier organic focus than standard 202 but will review and integrate key chem 150 concepts.  Most people will be on the same playing field in it because of how much it deviates from a standard introductory chem course. What might help you is a general understanding of bonding, hybridization, and an ability to draw some Lewis structures from a given chemical formula, but don't go crazy if you forgot key math concepts (like some stoic, equilibrium, and the inorganic stuff). If Soria wants to integrate that, he'll just reteach it to you all in whatever context he needs you to know it.   Also, remember that you in the class to learn what is overwhelmingly new material, not show off that you know stuff in 150 or from AP. The AP score just indicates that you have or had enough of an interest in chemistry to work hard in it.  \n\nTrust me that success in Soria's version of 202z will not rely very much on prior knowledge more so an ability and willingness to learn newer stuff and engage more sophisticated problem solving techniques and figure out some high level applications.  With the teacher of the past that didn't test or teach at a particularly high level, it may have been more helpful to sort of know \"stuff\" from your previous experience but even then it would have been of limited help.\n\n The framework of thinking needed to succeed in organic chemistry is simply different from standard gchem courses and things like AP(which mirrors like a standard gchem 2 class with a tiny bit of chem 150 type stuff thrown in).  And usually the way AP and standard gchem is taught (primarily math emphasis with far less emphasis on structural concepts and spatial reasoning and true reactivity) just doesn't flow well into standard ochem classes in terms of an ability set some critical foundation for ochem.  Most people who even did well in Emory's versions (150 and 202) which blend ochem and gchem have to substantially reorient their thinking to deal with chem 203 which is their first encounter with a full blown organic course.  \n\nGive yourself grace and don't feel like you need to immediately \"get it\" during lecture. Some concepts will just be challenging in college, especially with a professor trying to intentionally challenge students.  You work on it outside of class sessions via practice by yourself, with TAs, with your classmates, etc.  You don't need to be a sponge and you not immediately getting something or being able to do a problem probably won't be due to something you were supposed to know in AP (trust me if it is something that simple, you can probably quickly look up the concept and then derive an answer) vs. it just intentionally being somewhat thought-provoking and you should be fine with that.  Get comfortable with it not always feeling easy or comfortable.  That's how you know he is pushing you and you'll eventually develop to be able to solve some pretty tough problems that use fairly challenging and even advanced concepts.  You'll be proud of yourself!  Your best preparation for 202z is to have an open mind and a growth mindset about learning.  Don't freak out if stuff immediately looks a little \"scary\" or unfamiliar. It will be to most no matter what fascades they present in class.",

              "text": "Most people don't remember that stuff because it was poorly taught in AP/standard gchem courses so that is okay!  You can review them or let the book/Soria reteach it in a way that makes sense for organic.  Like in gen. chem, people sometimes just count some electrons and throw some bonds together.  There is little logic behind how they compose Lewis Structures and how they(and things like resonance hybrids) are interpreted, so you may be just learning it in a vacuum.  Like I can tell you that Weinschenk for his 221 (the old ochem at Emory) course used to have this tradition on the first day where he'd write the molecular formula of nitromethane and ask people to draw the Lewis Structure of it.  And maybe 1-3 of each section of 99 would get it right.  Mind you, Weinschenk experiences a selection effect where he receives a higher share of people who got A/A- in gen. chem 1 and 2. And most of those people ended up just fine. I'm sure that today, with the new curric. things are different because organic structure and reactivity is covered in a decent amount of detail, but a person who got AP credit is more akin to someone who got at least like a B/B+ in Emory's old gen. chem 2.  \n\nAgain, you can review it if you want to, but you may just be sort of memorizing how to draw INORGANIC Lewis structures that have like a metal/metalloid center bound to electronegative ligands which isn't that helpful (maybe more helpful for Soria's ochem than others, but still..).  There are very specific conventions for drawing organic molecules that include implicit hydrogens, bond angles, double/triple bonds, etc that are most useful.",
