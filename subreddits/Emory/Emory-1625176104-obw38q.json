  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am an incoming freshman that is planning to take Introduction to CS I in the Fall semester.\n\nHowever, I was told that Introduction to CS I is a very demanding and fast-paced course, and for those without previous coding experience, it can end up being a very tough class.\n\nFor this reason, I would like to ask you all if you could guide me in any way. Should I take Intro to CS I? What should I do?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Yes, take it. They will teach you all you need to know, and you will need to learn how to be good at picking up patterns or thinking outside of the box. If you can't, you need to stay grounded and learn how to ask others for help to brainstorm how to approach the issue (not copy-paste code).\n\nIt is not hard if you can wrap your head around the fact that it will be a separate language based on ideas and math you already (and will) know. You will need to be able to re-express your thoughts in that language to make it do what you want.\n\nTake the course and go through the motions. Only you will know if it's meant for you or if the problem-solving + creation aspect is what you want. Then, as you move on through your courses, research career prospects and imagine yourself doing this type of work for both tedious and meaningful situations to see if it's fulfilling enough for you.",

      "text": "I agree with the above. Just because something is demanding or challenging to a newcomer, doesn't mean you won't be a good fit for the major or field.  Eventually even most people who have experience in HS will be challenged or stumped by certain courses or material.  If it is for you, you'll likely be able to enjoy the things that come easier to you as well as solving problems you find challenging. \n\n Look at the latter and your education as a whole as an opportunity to better yourself and learn new stuff at a good level(you're at Emory so you're very intelligent and can handle it especially if you ask for help and use Emory's resources) vs. Just showing off your previous \"experience\" and how easy something comes to you in situations where the professor obviously isn't trying challenge students with experience but instead is trying to ensure EVERYONE considering the major has a strong enough foundation to succeed after the course.  \n\nAnd remember, they are making that course intentionally challenging to the \"typical\" Emory student (who likely hasn't had significant CS experience despite how well selected Emory is) so if you don't make an A/A- in the first course, please don't take that as a sign that you don't belong or will not develop and improve as you progress.  Just evaluate whether you enjoyed what you learned enough to think it is worth continuing. Just do not not tie your suitability to the ability to immediately do things perfectly or have it come easy at the start.",

      "text": "Take it. I'm a rising junior that had no previous coding experience in .\n\nInto to CS is exactly that- an intro. You learn the basics and as long as you pay attention and put in the time, you're good.\n\nCS is a very time consuming career- not exactly difficult as long as you can change your way of thinking to wrap around computer logic.\n\nI will warn you however: This is not the weed out course. The true weed out course is 235(not sure of number, but it's data structures and algorithms). Once you get over that bump, it's smooth sailing. Even then, get 235 with Prof Michelangelo - he's super kind, always helps, and grades on curve.\n\nRemember that the gpa average in CS (NOT overall) is 3.14- don't beat yourself up if you don't get straight As.\n\nAdvice learnt from my own mistakes: learn how to study. \nAlways do homework and projects before they're due so you can have time and understand what's going on. \nDon't be afraid to ask for help. \nNetwork with your class ASAP- you never know if you can find a job or tutor or project buddies. Sounds shallow but it's the truth.\nLearn to love the pain of coding.",
