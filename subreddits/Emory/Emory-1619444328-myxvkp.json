  "text": "So I understand that Emory is requiring the Covid-19 Vaccine for students coming next year. They also stated that students can be exempt from the vaccine if they have \"medical conditions or strong personal beliefs\" against it. Although I believe in the vaccine I have an autoimmune disease and The CDC says that there is no data currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions. Im not posting this for opinions on if I should get it or not. I was wondering if I am exempted from needing to get it would I still be allowed on campus?",
