  "title:": "Do you feel like you\u2019re in a city when you\u2019re on campus?",
  "text": "Hi everybody, I\u2019m a prospective student and one of the things that I personally want in a school is that I want to \u201cfeel\u201d like I\u2019m in a city when on campus. I\u2019ve done some virtual tours of Emory, and I guess what I\u2019ve seen is, while their address is in Atlanta, it is very much a school with a distinct campus that doesn\u2019t really have a downtown \u201cfeel\u201d think: NYU, Columbia, UPenn, and maybe even Georgetown/Brown. Anyway, I wanted to see what actual Emory students think, so I\u2019ve listed my questions:\n\n1. How connected to Emory to Atlanta? Is it easy to get to downtown areas? Do you need a car on campus? Is there public transportation to/from Atlanta that has stations on/near campus? \n\n2. When your on campus, are there any parts that feel like downtown areas, or do you feel separated from the city at all times? \n\n3. What\u2019s Emory village? Is it like south 40 at WashU? Can you walk there from campus? Does it have skyscrapers (lol I like skyscrapers)? \n\nAlso I have some questions about other parts of life at Emory if that\u2019s okay.\n\n1. Is it easy to intern/shadow/research at the CDC? Is it pretty easy to get opportunities there?\n\n2. Can you do research during freshman year, or is it hard to get involved that early? \n\n3. What are the dorms like? \n\n4. If I were to say that I\u2019m a kid from a rural area who \n\n- wants to experience \u201ccity-life\u201d \n\n- is exploring the idea of going to med-school, but also wants to be involved in political affairs/public health \n\n- is pretty academic oriented (doesn\u2019t really wanna drink in college), but does wanna do some social stuff (but not the jumping on tables uncontrollable house party type stuff) \n\nshould I apply to Emory? \n\n\u2014\n\nThanks so much in advance! I really really appreciate it!",

      "text": "Emory is not in the heart of Atlanta, downtown is about 7 miles (about 20 minutes) from campus.  It's in the busy suburb of Druid Hills. Druid Hills is by no means a city, but it\u2019s not small.\n\n1)  Emory is very connected with the city of Atlanta...a car is helpful, but the MARTA public transport and shuttles are easy to use.  In pre-covid times, Emory would run \"Emory Experience Shuttles\" each weekend to the big events all over Atlanta (music festivals, farmer's markets, parades, etc).  Lots of students have done internships with companies in Atlanta (Delta, Coca-Cola etc)\n\n2) No part of campus feels like you're downtown because...you're not.  You can see the skyscrapers from Emory Point (a retail/apartment complex on the northwest side of campus across from the CDC), but there's no mistaking campus for downtown.\n\n3) Emory Village is a retail area right next to campus.  Lots of restaurants, a drug store, and some other stores.  I'd compare it more to The Loop at WashU (it's been a few years since I've been there so I hope I remember that right).  It's right on the edge of campus, you can walk there.  No skyscrapers, just stores lined up.\n\n4) In the past I've heard it was relatively easy to intern at the CDC...now with covid everything is not happening, CDC included.  I was hoping to do that too smh\n\n5) Plenty of my friends got involved with research freshman year, it's definitely attainable if you put in the work and look for it.\n\n6) The dorms are honestly really nice.  They've all been built or redone in the past 8 years or so, and have AC, big common rooms, kitchens, etc.  See their website for more info.\n\n7) Even though it's not in the heart of downtown, it\u2019s definitely connected to the city.  If you\u2019re looking for true city life, UPenn/NYU may be better bets. The rest of your description seems to match Emory well too...partying definitely exists but it's not the top party school.  Lots of pre-med focused students as well.  Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: took out the perimeter thing\u2026I still don\u2019t quite understand that lol",

      "text": "1. How  connected to Emory to Atlanta? Is it easy to get to downtown areas? Do  you need a car on campus? Is there public transportation to/from Atlanta  that has stations on/near campus?\n\nEmory is 30 minutes away, many options to get there, but there is a physical distance separating the two. You have the train system, shuttles, and ubers all as means to get to the city. Stations are near / on campus. I racked up quite an uber bill first year, a car is definitely a desirable on campus depending on how much oyu go out.\n\n1. When your on campus, are there any parts that feel like downtown areas, or do you feel separated from the city at all times?\n\nEmory does not feel like downtown at all. It is very much a campus in the suburbs. There is definite distinction between in the city and on campus. The two don't really overlap.\n\n1. What\u2019s  Emory village? Is it like south 40 at WashU? Can you walk there from  campus? Does it have skyscrapers (lol I like skyscrapers)?\n\nEmory Village is basically a collection of restaurants and stores that clumped together at the entrance to campus. It's nothing special at all. It's convenient (that CVS has saved me more times than I care to admit), but nothing jaw dropping. You have skyscrapers in the horizon (I used to see the ATL skyline every day when I would walk down the stairs through the glass panes). It's more similar to Rice in that sense. Houston in the background, but definitely accessible.\n\n1. Is it easy to intern/shadow/research at the CDC? Is it pretty easy to get opportunities there?\n\nCDC I'm not sure, but in general very much yes. You're not going to get them thrown on to your lap, you still have to try fairly hard to get good opportunities, but for anyone who wants it, there will be an opportunity. I get emails every week about X company is hiring or Y opportunity is accepting applications (I actually can't keep track of them, it's a problem lmao).\n\n1. Can you do research during freshman year, or is it hard to get involved that early?\n\nVery easy to get involved. Personally have gotten research freshman year. Emory is very used to this and encourages it. \n\n1. What are the dorms like?\n\nDorms are amazing. Anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't seen what a typical state dorm looks like. Not to say they are the best dorms in the world (I personally really liked Drexel's when I visited a friend over there, it was essentially a refurbished condominium).\n\n1. If I were to say that I\u2019m a kid from a rural area who\n\n* wants to experience \u201ccity-life\u201d\n* is exploring the idea of going to med-school, but also wants to be involved in political affairs/public health\n* is  pretty academic oriented (doesn\u2019t really wanna drink in college), but  does wanna do some social stuff (but not the jumping on tables  uncontrollable house party type stuff)\n\nYES! I believe you get the best of both worlds. You'll get to experience a city without any of the fatigue of living in a city. You'll be at one of the best schools for pre-med in the world, that will put you in a great position to spring off into many different career paths. You also are surrounded by kids who focus on academics first but have plenty of fun. (I will say that the frat parties can get wild, but that generally doesn't effect studies at all. Whether people are sitting around discussing politics or flipping KA's house upside down, kids at Emory I find have great control in how much of that they get to experience).\n\nI have no idea how old you are, what you're planning on studying, or what your other options are, but what I will say is if Emory is in your budget, and you're looking for a school with access to a city with plenty of opportunities in medicine and related fields and is academically oriented, Emory is a great place to be.",

      "text": "No, it doesn't feel like a city at all. North Druid Hill is a suburb of Atlanta.\n\n1. Eh. If you have a car it obviously makes things easier. You can take the bus to get to midtown if you'd like, or the Emory-GT shuttle.\n\n2. The campus is like a 30 min drive removed from downtown Atlanta.\n\n3. Drop Google Street view on Emory Village. It's the area south adjacent to campus. There's a couple restaurants and a CVS. Again, Emory is not \"part\" of Atlanta (I know it is legally but anyone who says North Druid Hills feels like a city, has never been to a city)\n\n-----\n\n1. I'll pass on this one, I don't have that information.\n\n2. You can! Most PIs will take sophomores or juniors, but that's a trend not a rule. I know plenty of people who got involved with research early.\n\n3. The dorms are nice. Some are nicer than others, but most of the freshman dorms were renovated less than 10 years ago. All have A/C (it's the South) and they're all clustered together so the freshmen have their own little enclave\n\n4. Again, I'm definitely not the right person to talk to about this, but Emory fits the bill based on what you want in terms of academics. You *can* experience the city of Atlanta no problem, but don't expect campus to have that feel.",

          "text": "It takes you 30 minutes to get downtown? What route do YOU take?! I'm just asking.  Also,  usually we agree but I think New Yorkers have a bias.  Southern cities are NOT like dense northeastern cities (minus Miami). Atlanta's financial districts are impressive for a southern city, but places just outside of it (even areas kind of just outside of the highrise districts) ARE very much in the city of Atlanta and yet are super leafy and low density in comparison to NE (and maybe some MW and West Coast cities). Like Buckhead is clearly Atlanta city limits and is about equidistant from Downtown and Midtown as Druid Hills and Buckhead neighborhoods off of Peachtree have similar density and feel to a Druid Hills.  I would say that Druid hills is definitely not like the CORE of any city, but is like many southern city neighborhoods.  Like it really ain't too different from a Grant Park, VaHigh, or anything that would be considered \"intown neighborhoods\" (Atlanta's city limits is straight up a cul de sac system.  It was not built to be like contemporary cities folks think of).  Those places feel \"suburban\" even with the highrise districts extremely close by.\n\nI feel like Emory should maybe be compared to say a Rice or WUSTL when it comes to distance from a financial district. It of course isn't a Georgia Tech, NYU, Columbia, VU, places like that. Emory isn't what you're looking for if that is a prime criteria, but at the same time I would ask you to think it through a little more in terms of what you're open to.  With all the unstructured time in college, it is easy to get distracted, so having some distance from a financial core can have its advantages (and honestly, Dekalb County, especially the portion where Emory is, is actually higher density than Fulton and there are plenty of places for you to venture out to near by).  So I generally have a different feeling on the \"city\" debate being a southerner, but I'll admit that if that is some hardcore criteria anyone has, then Emory isn't it (but again, a lot Atlanta's best city and suburban venues are well outside of the highrise districts.  The \"fun\" is not monopolized by highrise districts in Atlanta).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Also, if you are lucky maybe Emory will eventually open back up visiting.  It may not be in a financial district but you may very much like it anyway as it fits your other criteria and just has a really nice campus.",

That being said, midtown (near GT) takes like 10-12 minutes to get to with Uber, so if you want to go to Atlanta you can. Also, there are a bunch of shuttles which you can take for free that connect you to places there.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t think anyone here really feels like they\u2019re in the heart of Atlanta, but honestly it\u2019s not far away at all. I kind of like that. I grew up in NYC so its just so much nicer for me having a place that\u2019s more relaxing to study in while also being really close to the center of a major city. Idk though, maybe campus is a lot more vibrant normally but it definitely feels dead sometimes with Covid tbh. I\u2019m a freshman so I wouldn\u2019t know.",
