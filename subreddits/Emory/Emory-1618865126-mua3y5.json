  "text": "So I did not come on campus this year so I am just curious how the housing process works. I think I really want to get a single in Clifton, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a bit of a walk but I don\u2019t really mind. So I\u2019m just curious if I have any choice in selection or if there is a way to more likely get what I want. Thanks!",

      "text": "From what I understand, second-years get to select their housing based on a completely random lottery system. Sometime at the end of April, you'll be assigned a time and you get to log on and choose from what's left. \n\nThere aren't a ton of singles in Clifton, so I don't know if that's your best bet. It really seems like there's only a small smattering of singles across all the sophomore housing, so I'd consider your backup plan. They just emailed out a roommate directory if you want to be prepared.",

          "text": "This comment is correct and also applies to 3rd and 4th year housing. There are not many singles for sophomores and you are more likely to get a double because of the lottery system. Unless you get an early time, you are unlikely to get a single. It is definitely possible to get a single, but you have to get lucky with the time.",
