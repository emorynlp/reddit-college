  "text": "I'm a freshman planning on doing a math BA (with a humanities BA or minor). I have credit for calc BC\u2014scored a 5 and I did a solid (if I may be self-congratulatory) job in the class in high school, but I took it junior year so I've since forgotten many things (honestly, I've been no thoughts head empty for the past 20 or so months). Should I take math 211 or 212 this spring? I'm worried about reviewing calc II (and learning polars...)\n\nTo be honest, math doesn't come to me as naturally, but I'm quite capable with some effort and I enjoyed calculus in high school.\n\nAlso, does anyone have any tips or advice coming into the class?\n\nI plan on taking the lightest course load possible, which would be around 15 hours for me ((127 total - 12 hours transfer credit - 16 hours this semester )/(7 semesters remaining) = a little over 14 credit hours / semester. The number of credits needed to complete my desired BA duo is 72 hours;  I'm taking / have AP credit for 15 of those 72.\n\nThanks so much!",
