  "title:": "Emory or Pepperdine for pre-med",
  "text": "Hello! I am currently a senior in high school! I am still trying to pick a school, and I have to do so by May 1. I am deciding between Emory University and Pepperdine. I intend to major in human biology and anthropology following a pre-med track. My concern with Emory is getting the gpa I need for med school. I get pretty down on myself when I am putting in the work and my grades aren't where they need to be. I don't consider myself naturally smart and my grades are a reflection of the amount of work I put in. I know Emory premeds are very competitive and supper smart so I am worried I may be behind. Then again, I know I am capable and I was accepted for a reason. Pepperdine is definitely the safe choice, but there is little to no health care related work experience near campus. It is in Malibu on the ocean (which I love) and I feel I'd fit in more/have more fun. I love Pepperdine location obviously, but I feel Emory will put me in the best position for med school. I eventually want to spend some portion of my life in California, and California med schools are much harder to get into. I feel as if picking Emory may include giving up my chance to live/study in California. I am also concerned about the conservative/snobbish atmosphere at Pepperinde. Both schools make me happy in a different way and I just don't want to regret my decision. Overall I want a healthy student-life balance. If I go to Emory I will be at Oxford my first two years, graduate with an associate's degree, and finish at the Atlanta campus . I was also considering going to the Oxford campus and then trying to transfer to a California school with more prestige (UCLA, USC, Berkley) once I get the feel for college or if I am not happy at Emory. However, I don't know much about the transfer process.  If anyone has attended either university (Pepperdine or Emory) and has any input please comment. Course suggestions? How hard are classes? Research opportunities? Life outside of school? Professors? Well-being? Overall happiness?",

      "text": "Just go to Pepperdine. Sounds like you\u2019d like it a lot more, and I wouldn\u2019t come into a university with a strong expectation that you\u2019re going to transfer. It really doesn\u2019t matter *that* much where you go to for undergrad if you wanna go to med school.\n\nI\u2019ll comment on your situation about wanting to study in California too though. I\u2019m actually in the same exact situation myself \u2014 I\u2019m premed, and I think it\u2019d be great to go to med school in California as I think I\u2019d want to live there. Here\u2019s the thing though, being a CA resident isn\u2019t going to help you that much. The difference in acceptance rates for OOS and in-state applicants for the med schools at UCI, UCSD, UCLA, and UCSF are all negligible. Only UC Davis and UC Riverside med *strongly* prioritize in-state applicants. Therefore, being a CA resident wouldn\u2019t help you that much anyways, and in turn, going to Pepperdine wouldn\u2019t really make it easier to get into a CA med school (unless you want to get a residency and apply to UC Davis/Riverside).\n\nI felt relief after learning about this since I come from NYC. Another thing I\u2019ve been realizing lately though is that it\u2019s probably bad to EXPECT to end up in a certain state for med school. All those medical schools in California have acceptance rates that range from 3-7%, and its just silly to think that everything will work out and that I\u2019ll end up there. People have struggles getting into even *one* medical school, and there could be so many complications. Like what if get into a school like UCI med but I got into another school in a different state that I just liked more/fit in with better/and was better overall. I wouldn\u2019t give up all of that just to be in California. \n\nEverything could go smoothly and I could end up studying in CA, but I\u2019m not counting on it. Things rarely go as planned in life, and I\u2019m personally shifting my expectations to just be happy ending up at a medical school in a big city. It\u2019s just 4 years of our lives anyways, and people at medical schools go to residencies in all different kinds of states. I think not being able to *fully* control in what state we study at is just a reality many medical/graduate students have to deal with. And honestly, I\u2019m fine with that. I think its worth it.",

              "text": "It just isn't that applicable.  Pre-meds need good grades and a good MCAT and then the required volunteer hours and great/good ECs if they can do that.  They need to go to places (and there are a crap ton) that have great academic support structures (or at my most cynical, I would say a place where you are definitely at the top in terms of student body quality which is pretty impossible at any top tier because the provided student quality incoming metrics are too compressed at the top for differences between students to be predictive in any way.  We'd have to know AP/IB background, if they did other things, etc to tell, but it isn't as obvious as when you have a much more heterogenious student body where you can clearly see more substantial differences in SAT/ACT and GPAs), good pre-health core courses that emphasize the skills the MCAT tests(I think Emory/Ox has the edge here vs. a UCLA or even USC. The smaller size and the amount of resources poured into chemistry and the life science undergraduate programs just makes for a very different experience no matter what you think about \"prestige\")  and not just \"the most prestigious and selective place in my eye\". You have some \"prestigious\" places with super crappy gateway STEM experiences that are large, impersonal and relatively lacking in support infrastructure or don't teach the problem solving and thinking skills(they may teach MCAT content, but so do most schools.  Gateway STEMs have, for the most part, historically been held hostage by the content on the MCAT) you need to do well on the MCAT. \n\n All that needs to be right and looking at a rank in USNWR or your own head/perceptions of \"prestige\" won't help figure that out.  Prestige doesn't matter so much as having a home medical school.  Good home medical schools tend to at least slightly (some significantly) favor their own students and those from these elite undergrads (generally, no matter the prestige level) seem to get into more top tier medical schools, but guess what?  They still need super top notch grades, MCATs, ECs, all that stuff.  The \"prestige\" is not really what is helping them.  The student body was already pre-selected for better test takers so they probably were going to do at least okay on the MCAT. But getting that good score to a stellar score is very much up to the student and what type of courses they take and how much some benefit from being in a research lab (which would help build lots of MCAT skills) if they choose to do that.  The reason why elites generally do better with placement (in terms of getting into at least one medical school) appears to be this MCAT thing.  \n\nThey already test better and the courses \"may\" be more rigorous so a wider range of GPAs seem to earn competitive test scores.  There doesn't appear to be much of a prestige or familiarity advantage beyond the home medical school. You have to do the work for the GPA and get the GPA in the right types of courses and experiences that will get you the score.  This does not directly correlate with prestige. At these calibre of schools, you want to choose the environment and places with the type, level, and style of teaching that is most beneficial for YOU to do all these things.\n\nLike it appears VU(thank them for being so transparent BTW. I wish Emory still had info. like this public) students aren't getting much of an advantage with top tier medical schools and I'm betting if Emory and most elite tier schools (outside of maybe HYPS tier and a couple more) would look very similar.  While getting into ANY medical school may require a lower GPA (if coupled with solid MCAT. If it isn't, it looks really bad because you went to a so called \"top tier\" school and got a mediocre GPA and not so competitive MCAT. It just looks weird to adcoms from what friends have told me and what I have seen from pre-meds I've mentored who had that or GPA/MCAT mismatch where they had high GPA/low MCAT) from these places, you need a higher MCAT (a higher MCAT seems to be an expectation from those coming from these top tiers. \nThe MCATs of applicants are already higher than the national pool overall, but med. schools still primarily take significantly higher MCATs than that already high scoring applicant pool from VU):https://www.vanderbilt.edu/hpao/documents/2020_Annual_Report.pdf\n\n*I mean to me, it seems that there probably wasn't relaxation in standards for students coming from there when folks applied from these top tier medical schools.\n\nHYPS may certainly have an advantage but I am not convinced it is just(or even mostly) prestige because I have seen many of their pre-med STEM core courses: their pre-med STEM cores are SUPER intensive (in terms of intellectual complexity) and very different from those at the UCLA, USC, and even Emory (which has done a lot of things to renovate its curricula in things like chem and bio vs. many of its elite private peers) so they naturally wanna select for students who went through that level of training, did well, and scored high on the MCAT.",
