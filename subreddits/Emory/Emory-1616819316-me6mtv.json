  "title:": "Question about the humanities at emory",
  "text": "Hi!! I was recently admitted to the Atl campus and had a couple questions about the humanities at emory. I am planning on majoring in political science or IR, perhaps philosophy, politics, and law. I\u2019m thinking of the pre law track, but am not 100% sure I want to go to law school. Could anyone tell me what it\u2019s like to major outside of STEM at emory, how much focus these departments get, etc.\nFor a bit of context, I go to a pretty STEM-focused high school and like being surrounded by people who aren\u2019t necessarily studying the same things as me, I just want to know if the humanities programs are strong despite not being what emory is \u201cknown for.\u201d\nThank you!",

      "text": "I\u2019m pre law majoring in PPL and religion. Yes Emory does focus on the health and business pathways a lot, but their humanities is also really good. The departments are great and the professors are world class. The pre law advising office is amazing. There are plenty of resources and the education is just as rigorous as it would be with STEM or business",

      "text": "I'm pursuing History and a joint-major in Classics and Philosophy and have some deep ties to this school, so I think I might be able to offer some insight. In terms of the humanities on Campus, that's kind of a complicated answer. As Oldeagle pointed out earlier, a fair amount has been done on the part of the university to ensure a humanities education befitting a school of our caliber. I can tell you from experience that the departments have no shortage of funding which is good for both maintaining the departments/programs, and providing funding for individual students to take study abroad trips or conduct undergraduate research. Couple this with professors who are among the best in their fields, like Dr. Brown, Dr. Master, Dr. Miller, and Dr. Prude, who are invested in you and your success and you'll easily have a wonderful time. In Summation, you do not need to worry about receiving an \"average\" education here because of our high saturation of STEM and B-School students. In fact, I even find my education here is often more rewarding than what I hear from peers at more humanities driven schools, and you will likely get into any grad-school you want going here, as our students usually are spoiled for choice following their Law/Grad school applications.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that it's perfect. One issue that I find myself struggling with is what others have already pointed out, the actual number of students studying the humanities leaves something to be expected. In terms of major saturations, we cap humanities out at History, which usually sits around 2-4%, a far cry from our typical 15% Business saturation and even higher pre-med student population. While college is what you make of it, and friends can be found in unlikely places, it is an odd feeling being one of the few who are directly pursuing the thing you're most passionate about, and can lead to a sense of alienation when your friends are discussing Biology and Bit-coin. But I don't want to leave you with the sense that you will be starved for extra-curricular discussion, as it is not unheard of for students to show interests in other fields. Some of my most memorable conversations here have been discussing the topic of absolute truth and the intersections of Platonist and Aristotelian Forms with theoretical physics and the Kardashev scale with a physics major, or helping one of my psychology friends make sense of Camus' ennui and Greek Humorism, or even explaining the research I undertook in my freshman year to anyone willing to listen, and people often are.\n\nNow this is just scratching the surface on the landscape of Emory's humanities programs, there is so much I failed to mention, namely university's enumerated goal of increasing the humanities presence on campus in the strategic plan, SGA reducing art-based club funding two years ago, or the reality of sourcing Humanities related opportunities, et cetera. I don't think you should come to Emory next year expecting either the best or the worst experience. The reality of it is that it's not perfect, even Harvard and Haverford have their issues with this field, but I can honestly say that if you put in the effort expected of you, and then some, you will get far more out of Emory than you can imagine.",

      "text": "Is English not a humanities? We're damned sure known for that one. lol.   Also most research universities that are even \"known\" for a couple of humanities programs don't have a lot of people majoring in them. Whether a place becomes known for something usually correlates with how established the graduate programs are in an area because so few people major.  I can tell you that well-done humanities areas at the undergrad level Emory include the English cluster, Religion, history, many of the foreign languages, African American studies, and philosophy.  Emory puts a lot of effort into making UG education in the humanities pretty damned good.  People falsely criticize it for not \"investing\" in it but that isn't actually as true for Emory as it is elsewhere and I feel people say that based on superficial stuff like the facilities (which are actually nicer than most other schools) and how many people major in it vs. STEM (which indeed is relatively low vs. other options, but that mirrors basically research universities. Also usually lower enrollment and smaller class sizes is better for maintaining a meaningful academic rigor and quality. For example, many professors in a decent sized STEM or social science course probably isn't going to want to subject themselves to lots of more open ended or research intensive written assignments or well written exams because it'll take quite the effort to grade)\n\nThey've run off and got a Mellon grant to do this humanities pathways program where they connect students to humanities alum and show the range of careers they can pursue (go on Emory's webpage and type that program in) and I think Emory is the only research U bothering to do that.  Emory also has this program called the Voluntary Core which a lot of more serious students enjoy.  It makes sure you build intellectual community with fellow friends and faculty in the program, learn to write super well, and apparently even offers fellowship/scholarship oppurtunities for upperclassmen who were on the track and stuck to it.  I'll have to come back to put links.",

I took her for 380W, a continued writing class. congrats and welcome to emory!!",
