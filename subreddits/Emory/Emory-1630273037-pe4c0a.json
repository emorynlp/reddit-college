      "text": "i took his class online last semester so it might\u2019ve changed now. but the way the class is structured, unless you get placed in his group, you\u2019re gonna be w/ one of the TAs and it\u2019s really just a discussion group. you do the readings before class and you talk about them during class. his quizzes weren\u2019t hard but they definitely required you to actually know the material. there was only one test the entire course and it was open book. i can\u2019t really speak on his abilities as a professor but he seemed pretty good from what i could tell.",
