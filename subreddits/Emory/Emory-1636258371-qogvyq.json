  "text": "I'm a sophomore thinking about going into the b school and minoring in french at the college. However, someone told me I can't do that and that if I wanted to keep taking french it would have to be for a major. BUT I really don't want to do the major. The classes offered for spring semester have professors with awful reviews on rmp and since I am already losing interest in the language i'm not sure if I can put myself through that.\n\nHowever, since I can't apply to the b school until next semester I feel like I'm wasting a semester. I already completed most of my gers and the b school electives open to students of the college already have a waitlist.\n\nWhat should I do?",
