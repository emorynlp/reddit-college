      "text": "Eh...I don't see how one would make that determination and 204 isn't really a standard organic chemistry course.  It is like an amalgamation of that in context of material sciences and biological chemistry in addition to covering some inorganic concepts (mainly through understanding the symmetry of different organometallic catalysts and how that influences polymerization of different substrates) and key biochemistry 1 concepts in a chemical context.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe curriculum is essentially standardized in terms of the content covered, but the delivery of the content, teaching style, and assessment style may vary dramatically both between both campuses.  Like I can say that people on main like Weinschenk are definitely top notch instructors and I suspect that Heemstra is at least an amazing lecturer.  The former may mirror that Scharf person at Ox that folks say will ask for a lot of critical thinking and harder problem types and applications on assessments (including high stakes exams).  Heemstra may do 1-2 serious higher level or sort of \"stretch\" items as an A/B separator (assuming his 204 works like 203. I've only seen his 203 exams but know  203 and 204 for Weinschenk).\n\nIn addition, another caveat is the different renditions and flavors at main (as in essentially a completely different course than others).  If you take Lynn, he won't lecture much or even well, but is a much more research oriented version likely designed in a way that generates interest for and helps recruitment to his systems chemistry course offered in spring.  For example, his section will have graded p-sets I think along with primary literature reading/presentations, an application style exam (potentially a group exam), and mock NSF proposal assignment.  This rendition is basically like an honors version (much smaller, more varied assessment types, exposure to more authentic problem types and research covered areas) that may kind of be akin to STEM courses at Oxford that have the INQ designation.\n\nThis could be good for students who are pre-grad/pre-MDPhD and can be or want to become more independent in their learning. Again, Lynn is up there in age so can be scattered at times but has designed a very interesting version of the course.  He just won't hand hold and TA support will likely be your go to because it is a truly flipped class.  Lynn sort of had a main role in designing the chemunbound curric. and pushed the active/flipped and group learning (\"learn like scientists learn\") emphasis.  He also sort of designed the 204 and came up with the content and idea of it.   His rendition has lots of potential, but if you sort of want the lecture, quiz, and high stakes exam per module model, choose Weinschenk, Heemstra, or an Oxford option that runs a more standard course.",
