  "text": "Although he seems to be over in Vanderbilt lately, I've noticed how nearly any thread on this subreddit, you will find his comments that range generally from a minimum of 3 paragraphs to a max of around 2-3 pages worth of text. Seriously, it's ridiculous how much he (or she) writes for anything.  [See here](https://www.reddit.com/user/oldeaglenewute2022).\n\nSo whoever you are oldeaglenewute2022, thank you for your very detailed contributions!",

Though I do wonder why I bother with some sub-reddits though, can't save them from themselves and weird ideas about needing ease for every damned thing (seriously, I don't see it as much at Emory, though it certainly exists to a smaller extent.  I just know I rarely see people go out of their way to talk talented students down from pursuing whatever academic path or courseload, and it ain't because Emory is easier).  I found a friend to handle that other one (I'll cut in if I see misinformation though) lol.",
