They actually specially make some to remove the smell of smoke like weed or cigarettes and from what I hear they're pretty effective (can't personally attest though).\n\nNot to say that's a permanent solution at all. If someone can't even crack open a damn window for you, try your best to resolve it or get out if possible.",
