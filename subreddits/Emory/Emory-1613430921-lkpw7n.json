      "text": "There is a scholar lounge in the Math & Science building where you can study/hang out/get free snacks & coffee. As Snoo61500 notes, you get early registration within your class but after those with medical reasons for early registration, so a major advantage but no guarantee as a freshman that you'll get every class you want. You get early housing registration, so you can get basically whatever room type/building you want after your freshman year (this is also a perk for your roommate). There is an annual retreat before spring semester starts for like 4 days, generally to a ocean side resort in a nearby state (AL, SC, ect). You can get summer funding to cover unpaid internships, research opportunities at other universities (all students, scholar or not, can get funding for summer research based at Emory), funding for summer study abroad. There are also just random fun activities scholars can sign up for, paid by the program (things like bike tour, cooking class, museum visit, ect). There are occaisional professional development events and catered dinners that scholars must attend - some people consider a perk, others an annoyance. Hope that helps answer your question!",
