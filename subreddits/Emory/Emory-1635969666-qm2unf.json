      "text": "The Facebook group, but also the Emory website is good too, even though they charge. I\u2019d recommend posting to both places. \n\nAs a mid 20s renter who has to widen my housing search (not in undergrad anymore), I can tell you that the Emory off campus housing website is more legit and more worth my time. If you post photos of the space and leave a phone number, you will get plenty of hits pretty quickly and it will probably make the money worth it.\n\nThe Facebook group has been okay in my experience\u2026 it will be a lot of renters so you will get a lot of immediate hits too, but just be prepared for people being flaky on Facebook\n\nFeel free to dm me",
