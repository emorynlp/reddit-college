[https://housing.emory.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/rates.html](https://housing.emory.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/rates.html)\n\n  \nI lived in Towers and enjoyed it. I especially loved the huge (covered) balcony; I had a hammock strung up on it and spent lots of time on it.\n\nYes there's 2 laundry rooms for the entire building but I never had to wait to use a machine because there's still like 5-10 machines per room.\n\nIs CRC better? If you have some extra cash then absolutely. Notably because laundry in unit and no roommate. But I was happy with Tower - and it was definitly a step up from Hamilton Holmes/freshman dorms.\n\n(Tower's kitchen design is terrible; but CRC's isn't all that much better either; URC's got the best kitchen IMO)",

              "text": "Oh interesting the prices went up. My junior year URC was only $300 more expensive than towers. Guess they adjusted it to be more reflective. Also towers used to be 4,400, so this is an even worse deal now in my opinion as you could find cheaper accommodation off campus with a private room for 4700 per semester, although you would have to deal with utilities",

Benefit of on campus is you don't need to worry about finding a roommate.",

      "text": "I lived in URC and really liked it but I also only lived with one roommate even though there was 4 bedrooms Bc of COVID. Roommates didn\u2019t want to do same room reservation and I gave my apartment to my suite mate...\nWhen I looked into other options I noticed Towers doesn\u2019t have parking, when I called to ask they told me I would have to park in URC or CRC. \nI also heard that the elevators don\u2019t always work so if you\u2019re on one of the top floors you might have to hike. \nOther than that the kitchen for Towers if you\u2019re in the 3 bedroom apartment looks decent. Just a  weird layout but not make-or-break. \nI thought that if you were in 3-BR then you didn\u2019t have to share room, you could just have 3 people but up to a max of 6. If anyone knows more about that would to hear about it. Also what is considered a sucky time slot? At what point is most of URC and CRC taken?",
