      "text": "Took both classes and am also pre-med would honestly recommend both (if you can do it). Overall, if you can only take one class I would do PSYC 110. Both Dr. Kazama and Dr. Kim are great! However, psyc 110 is harder than 111 (memorization heavy) and so maybe would take it not when you are taking harder classes/ 17 credits.",
