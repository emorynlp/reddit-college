  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I don\u2019t know how tough it is to get the classes you want to get. What\u2019s the registration process like? Does everyone log in at the same time or do we get time slots? Do you usually get the classes you want? Can someone please shed some light on how to get the classes you want and general tips for enrolment?",

      "text": "In my experience, it all depends on what classes you're trying to take. \n\nIf you're trying to get into the more popular classes (pre-med or pre-business, for example), it may be hard since you'll have dozens of people competing with you for the same spots.\n\nHowever, if you're looking into a major that isn't as popular or common, then it really shouldn't be too hard. I personally have never had an issue getting the classes and times that I want, but I'm pretty sure that's mostly bc I'm not pursuing a very popular major.\n\nUnless if they've changed things for freshmen, everyone should be logging in at the same time to register. Make sure you are on opus a few minutes before registration starts, or else you may find that many of your classes are taken.\n\nI recommend creating an ideal schedule and a backup schedule. Try to get into all the classes on your ideal schedule, but if that fails, you'll still have the backup classes as an option.",

      "text": "like the other commentor said, if you're doing a popular track/major at emory like pre-med, bschool, most of the stem majors, etc a lot of people don't get the classes they want on the first try. registration basically just opens up at the same time for everyone so it's pretty much a matter of luck and speed and internet speed. just make sure you have backup schedules/classes in mind and that everything you want is in your shopping cart in opus",

          "text": "oh and some tips i guess?:\n- when you have a bunch of classes in your cart, practice clicking on the ones you need in succession. ideally you wanna do this as fast as you can so a few hrs before regis starts i start practicing this a few times to make sure i know exactly where to press + with maximum speed \n- be on the course selection page/shopping cart at 11:59, and refresh the page at 11:59:57-58. it depends on your internet speed obviously and how long opus is going to take to load but usually i refresh the page a few seconds before to account for load time. might get you in just a few seconds faster :) don't refresh too quickly tho, that might slow you down\n- use coursicle to plan out your classes, v easy to use and see visually the differences\n- don't panic when you don't get in to a class you want. USE THE SWAP FUNCTION when signing up for a waitlist and you already have signed up for a class that's at the same time OR if you already have the same class enrolled (just a different section).\n- there's always add/drop/swap period, and it really works! a looot of people are switching classes during this time so if you're still not satisfied with your schedule before a/d/s theres still some hope\n\nhope this helps, my main tips are practicing the actual selection process and afterwards - swap function. i've done registration 3 times now and all 3 times ive (mostly) gotten all the classes i want so i hope it helps you too !!",

      "text": "My first semester was easy, second semester not so much. Most people have already registered for classes, so the website shouldn't lag. As you're a freshman you'll have a lot of entry level courses, which are usually more spacious, so you might not have any problems with registration. The online process is just clicking enroll, so it's not technically difficult either.  \n\nSecond semester enrollment is more difficult since theres more people, and sometimes you get upper level classes.",
