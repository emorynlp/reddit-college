Those areas don\u2019t overlap very much and it would be really difficult for you to graduate on time.",

      "text": "Specifically with those yea. Like the other said, you can only declare two of those officially. But NBB itself is very intensive and time consuming a major, so it would he pretty ambitious. I suggest you map out what your remaining years would need to look like in order to complete all the requirements/ classes you want to take. Then decide if it\u2019s doable to you and if you are willing to make sacrifices to your social life. I assuming it\u2019ll be close to 18\u201321 credits per semester, not not doable, but CS hw just takes so much time.",
