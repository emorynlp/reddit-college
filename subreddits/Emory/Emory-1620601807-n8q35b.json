      "text": "Emory requires all students to have some form of insurance, not necessarily their insurance. but it has to meet certain requirements and not all other insurances meet Emory\u2019s requirements. \n\nI had Emory\u2019s insurance and used it heavily. Student health services (in my experience) has been very good about giving referrals to specialists at Emory healthcare if it\u2019s something out of their scope. And the copays have always been reasonable.\n\nThere\u2019s on campus counseling through caps which is free, but their insurance does cover off-campus counseling (which I used) but there will be a copay for each visit.",
