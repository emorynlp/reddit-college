  "text": "So i just signed up for my Spring semester and I got onto a Waitlist for HIS 239, and fortunately enough I'm 1st on it. However, there's only 10 spots in the class and it's a really good professor so it filled up quick. Also, I want to be on the waitlist for Film 101 which has a waitlist that'll open up next Monday, but then i'd be over the 19 credit limit if I get into both. so my questions are, is it likely I get into HIS, and will OPUS not allow me to be on both WLs? any help is appreciated!",
