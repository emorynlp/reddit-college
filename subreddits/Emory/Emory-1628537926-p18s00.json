  "text": "This one expensive book is required for my Econ class. I looked for the book on z-library (unethical ik) and found the pdf version. I was wondering if teachers usually make students bring the book to class. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just not buy the book. But if they make us bring it, then I guess I have no option but to get the physical copy :( so lmk. Thank you in advance.",
