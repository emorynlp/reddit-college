  "text": "Hello everybody! I'm currently a senior trying to go to graduate school. Emory is my top choice and I wanted to know if anyone currently in the PhD program want to give any insight on how competitive the admission process is. Not any personal detail of course but at least gpa range, how many hours of research, publications, etc you had when you got accepted. \n\nAs for my info I am a hispanic student. Current gpa is 4.0 but so it is most people I know applying to graduate school so I do not think this is a big deal. I do have a lot of research experience, at least more than 1000 hours but unfortunately no publications. Two of them are in progress (1 as a co author) but they will not be finished in time for my application \ud83d\ude14. \n\nThank you!",
