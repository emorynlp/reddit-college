  "text": "How has this degree felt academically? Is it a lot of pressure? Is the math undoable (and for the math that is undoable, Is it actually used?). Is it worth doing over just a pure BBA?\n\nI see there's multivariable calculus in Math 210 - does math that complex actually get used in the rest of the degree/job or is it just \"you tale the class and then you're done with that\"?\n\nThanks for your help!",

      "text": "I'd say it's worth it if you are interested in pursuing a quantitative career.  They skip the math subjects that aren't useful for the rest of your degree/job, so don't worry about that.  Multi isn't much harder than regular calculus honestly, especially the way they teach it in that class.  Imo, the hardest class was Regression Analysis, but that class is also the most useful.",

      "text": "There have been BBAs that have completed BBA and CS (and a CS BS requires even higher math beyond 200 level) double majors so stop worrying about if this combo is \"doable\" because it definitely is.  Please don't conflate engaging challenging course work that you sometimes might not make an A in more often than your BBA peers as \"not doable\". If you are challenged (at least by courses and oppurtunities that are INTENTIONALLY made challenged) by Emory, you'll likely be rewarded and have plenty of post-grad opps.  However, do NOT do this pathway if you not finding academics easy is too uncomfortable for you because you may run into several classes that cause discomfort.  My guess is that even in cases with challenging material and assessments, the grading isn't overly harsh in all of the courses.  The harshest(as in lowest average grade targets, likely B- depending on who you take) grading will likely come from courses hosted in the math department whereas QTM hosted courses I hear are more aligned with the grading targets used in core political science courses (so like a B+ average or median. And if the material and assessments are tough such that the raw scores are \"low\", they'll just curve the grades up so that the center is a B+)\n\nAnd from the looks of it, many upper division electives and 200 level cores definitely use the math.  For example the special topics course \"Analyzing Data in Many Dimensions\" goes out of the way (on top of the standard pre-requisites) to say this in its course description:  \n\n\"Prerequisites: QTM 220 or ECON 320 or knowledge of intro calculus regressions, linear algebra and some exposure to differential equations\"\n\nThat is an instructor including that extra note, so no, they aren't just putting you through that to weed you out of the major or just make it look like other stats and math majors.  Many real data sets are higher than 2-D (For example, think of principal component analysis. I know there is a course that covers that) so thus the need for a little exposure to multi-variable and a lot of the computing concepts likely will involve arrays and use logic more akin to thinking emphasized in linear algebra. If you plan on taking any of the more serious upper divisions (in terms of the amount of math and theoretical knowledge used), chunks of that math will come in handy I'd bet.",
