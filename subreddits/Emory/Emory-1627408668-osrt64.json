  "text": "Hey incoming Freshman at oxford. I am worried to take this Occp because I haven\u2019t taken chemistry in 2 years and forgot everything I know. Does anyone else have the same nerves or did any sophomores feel the same taking the placement test. Also if you place low, do you not take chemistry 150?",

      "text": "It isn't a real placement test. It's purpose is mainly to fill in gaps for beginners as well as teach concepts that won't be emphasized in lecture (like basic stoichiometry and dimensional analysis) because chem 150 is more concept than math based yet that basic math concepts and proficiency will be assumed knowledge in lecture and in lab where more calculations will be necessary.  Basically the \"test\" is really more like a tutorial to get folks ready for 150, and not a barrier to access.  You take the assessment and then it teaches you and gives problems on areas you missed until you can pass the assessment with 100 I guess.",

      "text": "The ALEKS thing is not a placement test. You take a diagnostic assessment to determine how much you know and don\u2019t know, and then aleks makes you learn the topics you don\u2019t know. If you don\u2019t know any of it, that\u2019s fine! It will just be more work to learn the topics. When I did the initial ALEKS assessment, I knew 6% of topics. 6%. I\u2019m now a chemistry major. Whether you get a 0 or 100%, you\u2019ll still take the same chem 150 class, it just depends how much work you\u2019ll need to do.\n\nOn a related note, you need to start that NOW. Especially if your chem background is weak, it will take a while to learn the topics. Just do a few each day and you\u2019ll be set!  ALEKS is no friend to the procrastinator.",
