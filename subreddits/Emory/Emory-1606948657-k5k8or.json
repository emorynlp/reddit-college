      "text": "Congratulations! I hope actual CS people chime in, but I wouldn't worry. Note that most CS programs don't have to be (and just aren't) renowned or particularly good at undergraduate education in CS to ensure you get solid career placement (there are really only a few places that invest tons in their CS UG programs and thus have unusually strong advantages in career placement like Georgia Tech, Urbana-Champagne, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, and Carnegie Mellon, but most CS programs even among top tier schools, especially privates are kind of just mediocre/nothing special quality wise but due to the nature of the field, selectivity, and prestige of the schools will place well as long as the student performs decently and takes on creative projects or professional development opps that make them marketable to employers. Emory doesn't put up any barriers for that).\n\nYou want to learn as much as you can in the coursework I suppose, but you also kind of want to be able to learn languages on your own so that you can participate in competitions or do your own projects. That is what will make you marketable to internships and then employers.  There are many ways to develop skills outside of the departments and many high achieving students at places like Emory partake in those and that is what ultimately makes them competitive for well-paid jobs and good internships.  Just take your studies seriously such that you learn how to apply skills outside of the classroom ASAP.\n\nMy understanding is that CS at Emory is at least rigorous enough to ensure that (what may be an issue is how modern/contemporary the topics/programs covered are, but again, most schools have that issue).  You may also want to consider learning in interdisciplinary contexts or even taking up a 2nd major to open up even more oppurtunities for yourself.  You can be very successful if you learn how to program for different contexts and problems.  Emory is a \"liberal arts university\" so take advantage of that (maybe even consider looking into some of what QTM offers).  Just view it as a quest to put your learning into action by doing more than just CS coursework versus relying on the label of \"CS\" on your degree.\n\nHardly no one even at those top tier CS programs, relies solely(or even primarily) on the purported strength and prestige of the program (I feel like that is an effect that you see with undergraduate business and engineering programs more so than CS).  They make themselves as good and as relevant as possible to employers and my guess is that the most successful placement stories are serious enough to choose electives that have more to do with what internships they want to target or personal projects they want to develop than sort of just using a checkbox approach, mainly just taking popular or easy electives. Tailoring is important for STEM areas like CS where employers may evaluate applicants more on competence(I've heard of some companies having \"exams\" or tasks for you to showcase a skill, so presenting them with As and Bs in whatever isn't enough to earn trust that a student is competent/useful) and experience than grades.",

      "text": "hey I'm doing the CS program at Emory currently, graduating in the spring.\n\nFrom what I know, CS 170 (Intro to CS/Java I) is a difficult class and it's a weed-out class right at the start of the program. (fortunately I AP'ed out of it).\n\n\\-CS 171 (Intro II) is good overall\n\n\\-CS 224 (Discrete Structures) is okay, very logic based but important. I feel like this would be a second weed-out class\n\n\\-CS 255 (Computer Architecture) I loved, but everyone else hated it lol. Very complex but I enjoyed it\n\n\\-CS 253 (Data Structures/Algos) very difficult class, but the most important one for internship hunting. This class will serve as your foundation for Leetcode practice problems and similar interview questions.\n\n\\-Electives - feel free to DM me about those\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is just do Leetcode to prepare for internships, and then fill your resume with relevant CS activities or projects. Last year, I applied to \\~75 positions, got multiple interviews at \\~10, and ended with one offer. \n\nCareer fair is not particularly helpful for CS positions imho, you don't get as many of the 'target' companies because they just go downtown and recruit from GT. But it's still not impossible to get a SWE internship at those big name places from Emory.",

          "text": "I second this post, so I\u2019m just gonna add on to it. Sophomore currently in the thick of it. I have an offer this summer at a big company, and Mentioning Emory definitely got some good looks from the recruiter. I made it through most of the big weed out classes, but tbh the classes seem to only get more difficult, but you also get better so it\u2019s not insane.\n\nThe cs major so far I feel does a really good job giving you a foundation, I fed that I am a better programmer directly because of my CS classes, then the electives go out and allow you to explore. Overall I am very pleased with the department and everyone who I read previously doubting the department must\u2019ve been under different times.\n\nA few gripes that you may have are the number of classes. Getting the classes and particularly the specific profs you want will be quite difficult unless you have ap credit. The other gripe is that you have to be careful for visiting profs. They\u2019re generally not as good as Emory\u2019s actual faculty. Also Emory clubs for cs are pretty weak ngl. They need a revamp or some budget increase cause so far we have not much to show for.\n\nIn terms of tips for being successful, really grind out 170. Make sure you get that base down pact. Go to OH, go to the lab to do the practice quiz every week. That class is your bread and butter for programming, and after that, you can practically learn any language to a solid degree. It\u2019ll be tough, but it\u2019ll be worth it. Be careful not to go too high on the credits, really carve out some space for this. 171 is also a really important class, with that to be honest you can start prepping for interviews and stuff like that. Be careful of cs 224, and math 221 Lin alg, those classes are tough. If you have anymore questions feel free to dm!",

I remember attending and it kind of being a joke where random non-majors would just come and take random classes (not just 170/171, but even those) because very few courses were project based and weren't very demanding vs. what you'd expect at a selective school.  I haven't been hearing that lately (while I'm sure non-majors can still benefit, you can't just go in and not take the courses seriously and do well/get anything from it).  In fact, I am seeing so many people say that even 170 is intense (I think many students dislike that maybe because of expectations that a rising/historically weak department is easier, but it is actually a good sign because that sort of rigor is in line with what actual top tier programs do at the intro. level for courses targeted at potential majors, and it never hurts to somewhat mimic the best programs. Not every department can be QTM and chem and just make up a completely new curric. from peer institutions and expect success).\n\nIt is also probably helpful that in the presidential selectus prospectus, they specifically mentioned further investment in the CS dept and IT infrastructure at Emory as a whole.  They also look like they are currently on a hiring spree (and not just do to retirements or turnover like some depts) which is a another good sign. CS had no lecture track faculty until recently, so I am sure that is having a positive impact on the teaching quality in key courses.",
