              "text": "I'm gonna keep it real.  General Bio is not that rigorous anymore whether in person or virtual. Doubling in these two should be VERY manageable especially if you have any background in STEM AP/IBs and you'll likely put more time into chem. But even without that background you can let the ECCP topic completion times guide your decision.  \n\n  If you are really scared or fear being academically challenged for the first time or even fear that unstructured time you'll have in college will be hard to manage, I get it.  But if you think at all that you are strong enough/used to frequent studying from HS or are willing to learn to, then the gchem/gbio double up pair is the easiest lab science pair you'll have.  Gchem/intro physics would be tough. Ochem/any lab science is at least tougher than gchem/gbio simply because of ochem.\n\nIf you wanna single: Technically chem before bio is better for pre-med and your education but taking bio first is better for IF you are planning on being more than a generic bio major for pre-med purposes. Like if you actually enjoy biology and want to take a variety of electives and upper divisions, taking bio early is good for earlier access to them.",

You know yourself better than I do, but unless you have personal reasons why you don't want to double up bio and chem, most people double up their freshman year. \n\nWhat's your intended major? Doesn't have to be concrete, but it helps to get an idea of what upper level classes you need, so you can prioritize prereq classes. I don't want to say you'll be *behind* if you wait until sophomore year, but again, I wouldn't do it unless you have a good reason.",
