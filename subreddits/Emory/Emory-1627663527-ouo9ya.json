  "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy first semester already seems rigorous with the first 15 credits (full schedule below), but I love performing and spent a lot of time talking to Dr. Bhasin and my potential instructors while I was applying. Adding ensemble (MUS 300R-3) and lessons (MUS 320R-1) would add 3 credits for a total of 18 and would take away roughly 10 hours out of a week. My PRA actually encourages my schedule as described below despite the overload, and I'd be psyched if I can carry through with it. My worry is that it would result in absolute destruction of my social life and free time.\n\nThe full schedule: IDS 190 (3), CHEM 202Z + 202ZL (5), MATH 112Z (3), BIOL 141L (2), HLTH 100 (1), ECS 101 (1), MUS 300R (1), MUS 320R (2)\n\nA few remarks: I don't mind the 8:30 classes; my intended majors are Bio (pre-med) and QSS (Bio); I don't intend to pursue a major/minor in music, but I would like to continue to play through my time here.\n\nSo am I asking for death?",

      "text": "This schedule isn't really death but that combo of majors doesn't make sense (and may be death. There is no need to do a full bio major AND QSS bio.  Just take a few extra bio classes than required for QSS bio if you are interested in them. Med. schools will not be impressed with you simply because you have those two redundant majors) given the classes you listed.  If you have an AB credit and are QSS, you should probably be taking math 210 which is the pre-req for the QSS major (also getting rid of the plain bio major rids you of the whole calculus dilemma.  They prefer math 116 and QSS requires math 210.   \n If you just do the bio QSS, you do 210, linear, and that's it.  You do both, then it is either 112z with clearance from an advisor, 116, 210, and linear. Why bother?) courses and that will make this schedule a bit more intense but the choices are between sucking it up and doing it this semester or doing it next semester in addition to bio 142 with lecture and lab AND chem 203z.  With the QSS major in addition to that pre-med stuff, you need to plan carefully to ensure you don't die later on. Also is 18 actually over-loading? I don't think so.  It's just a credit above the recommended range and many of the more well-prepped and ambitious STEM majors will end up with about 17-19.",

          "text": "Your response has given me a lot to consider; I appreciate it very much. I'll have to check again after this, but I thought that math 112/112z was a prereq for linalg, which is the main reason I'm taking it. If what you say is true, I'll definitely try to take linalg or 116 instead. As for QSS, it was more of something I thought would not take too much effort to tack on, so I'll talk to my advisor to see how to approach it (or, as you mentioned, if it's worth pursuing at all).\n\nI'm glad you think this schedule can work well in terms of workload, and, again, many thanks for your input.",

              "text": "I'm fairly confident that requirement is relaxed for QSS majors taking 210 which is a calc. 2/multi blend with a python lab.   And just do QSS bio alone and add bio electives as you see fit.  It just makes more sense.  QSS alone is pretty intensive so doing QSS bio can afford more flexibility on the bio courses you take beyond 141/142 as well as flexibility to take random and social science oriented QSS electives that may be harder to justify fitting in when you have to take more bio electives for the bio major.  You don't have to do that column stuff for example but you do have to choose one of two tracks.  Luckily both neuro and pop. Bio/ecology are well developed in terms of elective selection. In fact there are even many quantative leaning bio electives in the latter major. But my point is that majors like QTM and Nbb require a bit of planning and you have to be forward looking.",
