Its rly fucking tedious, and the time it takes to complete it depends on how many modules you get assigned. Do rly well on the intro diagnostic test to get less modules. The modules themselves are not too difficult but some of them can be.",

                      "text": "Don't go in with fear about current level of 'strength' in anything.  Keep an open mind about whether or not you'll like or be good at the subject in COLLEGE.  Often people come in not liking or claiming they aren't \"strong\" in a subject in k-12 but the way it is taught in college makes it make more sense.  Like chem 150/202 are sort of designed in a way that will put people with a wide variety of backgrounds on a fairer playing field (some standard AP material blended with a bunch of content and concepts much less emphasized in standard AP and U.S. HS chem. curricula). The point being, you don't have to be the 'strongest' at it right now.  \n\nThe purpose of the course is to make folks learn chemistry in a more meaningful way than they did in HS vs. to just allow people who already have lots of experience to show it off and do well.  View it as a development opportunity where you can get much better(and there are so many support resources associated with the class to help you do your best.  Normally high achievers aren't used to using these and asking for help but do it! Use office hours, learning assistant sessions, e-pass 1 on 1 tutoring, everything. Most of the best students will use the hell out of them. Don't get a B or B- or worse in a class because you didn't bother to take advantage of those when you can get an A or at least a B+). \n\nDon't view your abilities or potential as something that is more or less fixed. Chem 150-204 is known to convert a lot of people into chem majors who feared it before or assumed they weren't particularly good based on HS exposure and performance.",

Maybe just avoid Kindt because his weakness is the more conceptual and organic chem stuff which is...most of 150 and lots of 202 (most people say his quality deteriorates pretty much as soon as the ochem modules of 202 begin).  And yeah, since it is in person, you can get legit study groups, more prof. contact, all of that so you should have a shot at doing well if you just keep up with the work.",
