  "text": "Hello,\n\nWe are looking for more individuals to participate in our EEG/MRI research study. The purpose of this study is to examine how different patterns of lights and sounds affect brain activity.\n\nThis study takes place over two sessions on two separate days at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging (CABI) on the Georgia Tech campus. Participants who completed the study can be **compensated with money ($90) and can get to see an image of their brain like the one below**.\n\nForms to sign up for the study can be found here: [Sensory Effects Study](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mattokaren3_gatech_edu/EivdBtSOd1VBu6iBv64dqK0BH9EZ7DCjPT-_FuzGBnot4g?e=SANjls)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email [singerlab@gatech.edu](mailto:singerlab@gatech.edu)\n\nThanks! -The Singer Lab\n\n[MRI image of the brain](https://preview.redd.it/nn7ft9px21d71.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d6d68087e308929712200c066fd8ecd199ee09)",
