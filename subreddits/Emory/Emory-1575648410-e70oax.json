      "text": "The good: students are fun and open. You\u2019ll get to know everyone else there, and you\u2019ll make lots of friends. Everyone works hard and is extremely bright.\n\nThe bad: living on a tiny campus nearly an hour from any sort of weekend activities sucks. If you\u2019re looking for the \u201ctypical\u201d college weekends of fraternity/sorority events and/or clubbing, Oxford is probably not the place to go as getting to these require a pretty Herculean effort.",

          "text": "This was my experience as well.  I left Oxford with a really great group of friends that I'm still really close with years later.  By the time we graduated we were frustrated by the dry campus and ready to have access to bars and parties, but we still had a blast at Oxford regardless and got into plenty of drunk shenanigans, just low-key.   I had a great time junior and senior year in Atlanta too, but those first two years at Oxford were the best parts of my Emory experience.",
