      "text": "I was ISOM! Loved it, but the selection of classes was definitely smaller than other concentrations, but I know they\u2019ve since expanded the class options to stuff like UX and analytics. I have heard good things about OAM from friends. I was almost MKT, but that core class with Frame completely made me change my mind. I suggest seeing how you feel after the core classes before deciding. The ISOM core is what convinced me to change to ISOM (although I hear the class is less math now).",
