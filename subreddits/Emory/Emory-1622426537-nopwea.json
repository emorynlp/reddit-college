  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI hope y'all are doin' okay! :)\n\nI'm currently a 2nd year student (& Georgian) at UCLA and am deciding whether to join Emory as a transfer student this fall. I've flip-flopped a bit with majors, but am generally interested in International Studies (women's development), Literature, and Psych classes.\n\nI just thought I could list some of my reasons for wanting to transfer and see if you could compare them to your experiences at Emory. I worry about transferring and then finding myself in a similar pickle.\n\n1. Classes don't feel very focused on learning or critical thinking. Instead, a lot of people seem focused only on grades, and professors kind of feed into that mentality.\n2. Hard to engage in discussion/mutual learning with peers in class due to class size. Most classes aren't very interactive and mostly involve being talked at.\n3. Restrictions on being able to explore different classes due to spots reserved for majors and pre-majors, plus lots of pre-reqs.\n4. Obviously, UCLA's a huge school, (& this is by no means representative of everyone) but a lot of folks I've come across seem more interested in maintaining social status/a certain image of themselves than in being \\~themselves\\~\n5. Advising and Career Support are almost non-existent. Hard to find support for independent research/finding internships.\n\nReasons I've been hesitant to commit to Emory or unknowns:\n\n1. UCLA's study abroad opportunities. Getting through UCLA for another year and then spending the last one abroad has been particularly tantalizing. I don't know how doable going abroad as a transfer student at Emory would be (doesn't have to be for a year). Can anyone speak to that?\n2. Being able to take advantage of a quarter in DC. I know Emory has a similar program, but you can only go once you've completed two years at Emory.\n3. Having more flexibility to double major or add a minor bc I don't have to redo any GE's. But then again, I'm not sure the quality of those extra classes would be great.\n4. Having to start over with clubs, making friends, etc.\n5. Housing for transfer students?\n6. What's the post-college getting jobs/getting into grad-school situation like?\n\nI know that's a lot, but I just want to say I really appreciate any and all feedback y'all have. I have to decide by Tuesday, and I've been having a really tough time figuring it out. Just wanted to see what some real Emory students have to say about their experiences.\n\nThank you so much for your time!!",

      "text": "1 .  Based on my experience I think it depends on what people are passionate about. If someone wants to major in NBB, they\u2019ll definitely be interested in learning about stuff in NBB classes besides focusing on getting an A. With other classes people \u201chave\u201d to take they might not have the same enthusiasm.\n\nI honestly feel like professors try to focus on the learning aspect. There isn\u2019t much talk about grades imo, maybe at the very beginning in some intro stem classes (how people can succeed).\n\n2. I feel like there\u2019s a mix of both those kinds of classes. Some are very engaging (almost entirely so where you just learn by doing work with other ppl in class), some are mixed, and some are lecture heavy. I\u2019d say a decent amount has you doing stuff besides just taking notes, but it depends on the class really.\n\n3. Pretty easy to change into any major you want, although idk how the process works for juniors who want to switch into the nursing or b school if they\u2019re already at main.\n\n4. Yeah, I don\u2019t think a lot of people care. Doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the vibe here. I will say maybe some people feel pressure to work hard and do \u201cimpressive\u201d things but that\u2019s it?\n\n5. We have them. I\u2019ve never really used them so can\u2019t comment. I just ask my professors and they help. My advisor is now actually someone who was my professor first sem and he answers everything so great guy.\n\n6. No clue. Don\u2019t get why it should be that hard though. Seems like it\u2019s p easy to get into most Emory study abroad programs, although maybe we don\u2019t have as many as UCLA.\n\n9/10/11. Most sophomores stayed at Emory for 1 semester and then were off campus for a year and a half. I\u2019ve heard that most upperclassmen either have few friends or none at all from Emory. I think everyone will be looking to make new friends in the fall. Junior transfer students can live at Emory-affiliated apartments that have buses that go to main or live in another place altogether. I can\u2019t speak a ton about grad outcomes but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re good \u2014 I think people here go to all sorts of places for grad/med/law schools.\n\nKind of tired rn so sorry if this wasn\u2019t formatted the best. Also, if you decide to come and want to make a friend feel free to PM! I\u2019m always up for meeting/talking to new people :)",

      "text": "I would agree with all your reasons for wanting to come to Emory. I think Emory would satisfy most of these since the college really does stress the liberal arts \"edge\" or \"experience\" \n\nFor your worries about coming, I can't speak to a lot of them since, I personally haven't participated in a study abroad, or the DC quarter thing. I know there is a DC semester for poli sci students but I can't speak to that too since I am not one.  \n\nWhat I can speak to my transfer experience, I transferred as a junior and although it was online I had the chance to take classes in things that I would've never did, a part of that also satisfies the gen ed requirements. Speaking of them, they're A LOT, but the most important ones you want to knock out are the writing and language. Writing is usually three courses, for some transfers is two depending on how many credits you bring in. Furthermore, you can knock out writing courses based on your major requirements, that is if they include a writing course. YOU CAN NOT TEST OUT OF LANGUAGE. I have friends at UVA and they can do this so I am assuming might be the same with UCLA, IT IS NOT THE CASE WITH EMORY. You will need 2 courses for the language req. There is also housing for transfer students, and they are exempt from the 1-year or 2-year housing requirement. There is also a \"Transfer\" course that's optional and you get one credit out of it. \n\nSorry if this was a jumble of words, I hope it helps!!!",
