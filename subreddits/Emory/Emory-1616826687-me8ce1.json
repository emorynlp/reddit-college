  "text": "freshman here, been thinking about majors and stuff lately. i am 89%? certain i'm gonna be going down premed or at least pre-health. i was originally planning on just doing one related major bio nbb chem blah blah but the more i am experiencing classes the more im thinking about need creative breathers because i cannot just be doing all this dryass stem shit for 4 years... anyways my point is, what are some of the pros and cons of majoring in the related major and then double majoring or minoring in a way different arts or humanities? im particularly interested in like film studies or that integrated vis arts one or dance or maybe theater if my introvert ass can handle it\n\nim just wondering about the realistic side of things (viability), workload (although obviously i understand it's gonna differ bw majors), things you would advise against, and like how exactly people plan their schedules to get all their major requirements in..?\n\nsuggestions about other majors/minors are also appreciated, the ones up there are the ones i gravitated towards\n\n.. i do also realize now that i need to actually start talking to advising lol but that is besides the point",

      "text": "While I'm not sure if double majoring or minority would be right or wrong for you, I've always felt that taking at least one or two theatre classes can be helpful for any and everyone. Especially if you're introverted. These classes are great to help with interpersonal skills and can really teach you a lot about yourself. Plus the entire department is great imo. The teachers really care for their students and want to help them better themselves. While there are classes that focus on acting there are actually a really wide variety of classes you can take pertaining to anything from history of drama, to arts administration, to set and costume design, to woodworking and construction.",

      "text": "If you think your current STEM is dry then you need to enhance your professor selection in STEM going forward because you shouldn't be doing medicine if you find it just \"dry\". And it doesn't have to be dry. Maybe choose professors who ask you to do more creative or higher level problem solving. There are many options once you hit intermediates and upper divisions and it will greatly help you.\n\nDespite that, I feel you and double majoring or minoring in a humanities (I don't really know any \"pre-med\" majors or minors at Emory. Even the STEM majors that align with the pre-med core courses are very research leaning when done properly which is probably a good thing considering how bored you are in intro courses which probably are dryer/more straight-forward and memory based) is a really good idea, but YOU have to figure out what you like (and how different something is is totally subjective. Find something that you'll enjoy and has quality mentoring and teaching).  It doesn't have to pair well with whatever STEM major and in fact, it can also be your ONLY major. The STEM pre-reqs and some supplemental courses are enough for you to pursue pre-med. You don't need to take mostly STEM most of the time unless you are perhaps aiming for an MDPhD(where it is likely even more important that you choose STEM professors that actually inspire you).  There are even programs who target humanities oriented students like Mt. Sinai.\n\n*Note that I would even argue that a humanities major may make room for you to take more rigorous instructors who tap into the more creative side of STEM without them being as much of a risk as when someone is juggling a bunch of STEM classes at once due to being a STEM major. You can optimize the quality of learning vs. performance MUCH better that way and honestly even fit a few \"wild\" STEM classes in because you aren't tied primarily committed to major requirements in a single dept.\n\nAlternatively, NBB has such a giant range of electives to choose from that it actually be a solid primary major for those who want to explore more humanities subjects but it does have lots of its own NBB core requirements.",

          "text": "thank you for the advice - i do think my wording was a little extreme haha i do find joy in doing stem, otherwise i dont think i would have even made it to emory, i just think i need an output with something that's not so natural science-focused. i haven't considered just forgoing a natural sciences major altogether but that definitely sounds like something i should consider! i did look at the list of premed req courses and it doesn't seem like theres too much on there anyways. altogether this was good input tysm !!",

              "text": "You and I can be honest.  You could have made good grades in STEM to get into Emory but that doesn't mean you enjoyed it.  In addition, even if you did enjoy then, whether it is still enjoyed in college(let us keep it real and say that many STEM professors at the intro level are intentionally boring you because they think it keeps most students happy. Students won't complain about the level of the course or how it demands things under-developed in most HS STEM curricula if you give a relative \"dry\" course so what you may be experiencing could be real)  and taps into other sides of the brain is up to how you choose professors especially beyond intro. You can even find some ultra interesting people like Eisen who are ultra interdisciplinary and will purposefully tie challenging STEM content to humanities.  You can separate them and/or have them both to spice things up.  You just have to have lots of discretion in course and prof. selection. Don't take a \"I'm just checking stuff off\" approach or even your humanities experience may disappoint.  You honestly may wanna look into IDS/ILA hosted programs and the IDEAS program. To me it sounds like you are looking for alternative forms of intellectual stimulation and those programs do an excellent job facilitating that.",
