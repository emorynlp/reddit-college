  "text": "So far I\u2019d prefer doing these classes my first semester mainly because i\u2019m super undecided about my future major(s) and want to find my rhythm on campus first. I\u2019m not at all trying to get them out of the way because I think I\u2019d have a ton of fun in all of the courses offered, just wanted to see if that would block me out of taking any future classes with prerequisites or if there are any other reasons not to. Thanks \u270c\ufe0f",

      "text": "Think of at least one of the interests you have and pick an intro course or Discovery seminar related to it to at least get your feet wet.  Part of \"finding your rhythm on campus\" should also involve getting a reasonably realistic picture of what the academics will feel like which in your case will be for a relatively light semester.  This way, you don't scramble for certain intro courses that may have less sections in spring than fall AND you'll be at least a little acquainted with the academic intensity of Oxford vs. just sort of screwing around first semester, becoming complacent/over-confident and then being slammed in the spring or later semesters.\n\nWhen people say don't overdo it academically to get acclimated to campus, it doesn't necessarily mean completely blow off first semester and have a total cruise fest.  Part of it means to just explore, bne open minded and don't take too many credit hours or hard classes/professors at once. Also, if you have ANY ideas of what you may wanna learn or major in, chances are you will easily find classes that also fullfill key gen. eds so be mindful of that. Just take a look at the course atlas and see if anything jumps out as interesting in a certain dept and consider it.",
