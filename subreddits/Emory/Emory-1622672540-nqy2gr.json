  "text": "for those of u that are native/fluent/near-fluent in a language offered at emory, did you guys take the higher level classes in that language or just a new language overall? i'm conflicted since i hear that introductory language classes are time-consuming (naturally) but again i don't know just how rigorous higher level classes will be. for ex i'm practically a native korean speaker but it's definitely not perfect (i grew up here) - i took the placement test fall sem, they placed me in 401? so i was like o_o and decided i might take the 40x class later in sophmore or junior year.... but i'm not sure. there's also the element of like learning a new! language vs taking the easier route i guess... thoughts? also open to language suggestions i guess haha",

Maybe you can start at the 4(go to it, get the syllabus, try to guage expectations vs. Your standing) the best you can within that period and then drop down if you need to. Are seats per level so competitive such that you have to get it right the first time or you're stuck?",
