  "text": "I\u2019m interested in the business school and will prob be a finance major.  What companies employ students at the business school? Good connections to firms in NYC? Are the professors good? \n\nDo you get into business school right away? If not, was it relatively easy to do so? \n\nIs there an extensive core curriculum? Were there courses that were mandatory that you felt were completely unnecessary and a waste of time? Comparing to other universities, are there less liberal arts courses in the core curriculum?\n\nHow is the rec center/ gyms at Emory? Large/small? Old/new? \n\nWhat is the social scene at Emory? Are there parties? Events? School spirit? Football games?\n\nLastly, how is the campus feel? Is there a lot of greenery and nice study spaces? Are the structures modern or outdated??",

      "text": ">Is there an extensive core curriculum?\n\nNo, there is no \"core\" curriculum in the form of a list of classes that you have to take. However, we do have GERs which are basically tags attached to a class. You need to take a specific number of classes for each GER. There's also a voluntary core curriculum.\n\n\n>Were there courses that were mandatory that you felt were completely unnecessary and a waste of time?\n\nYes, I think everyone will agree that HLTH 100 is terrible.\n\n\n>Football games?\n\n\\#NeverDefeated. You can go to Georgia Tech or UGA games.\n\n\n>Is there a lot of greenery and nice study spaces?\n\nYes. We literally have a forest.\n\n\n>Are the structures modern or outdated?\n\nMost structures are modern.",
