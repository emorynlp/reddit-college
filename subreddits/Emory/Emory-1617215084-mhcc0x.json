          "text": "It's not \"insulting\" because the station is meant to be a South Asian and Middle Eastern station, not just an Indian station. Beef is a main ingredient for many South Asian dishes such as for Pakistani and Bengali cuisines and allows an opportunity to get halal beef and meat. Also, there are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan (due to the large population in India), so there are a lot of Indians that also eat beef. My beef eating desi friends and I enjoyed the station a lot.  \n\nWhen I was on campus pre-covid, I remember that this MESA (Middle Eastern and South Asian) station usually had 2 main dishes. On the left side, there was a meat based dish containing beef, chicken, lamb, etc. On the right side, there was a vegetarian option with no meat at all, ex. palek paneer.",

You can refer to it as a MESA (Middle Eastern and South Asian) station as abbreviation.\n\nAs a South Asian (or Desi) growing up with Pakistani cuisine, I really enjoyed the food a lot and reminded me of the food I usually eat at home or at Indo-Pakistani restaurants. :D\n\nWhen I was on campus pre-covid, I remember that this MESA (Middle Eastern and South Asian) station usually had 2 main dishes. On the left side, there was a meat based dish containing beef, chicken, lamb, etc. On the right side, there was a vegetarian option with no meat at all, ex. palek paneer.\n\nHowever, they rarely included naan (flatbread) at the station to go along with all of the salan's (curries/gravies).  :(  We were meant to eat them with plain white rice or get creative by finding breakfast bread in the other stations.\n\nAlso, some days, they put way too much salt in the food :(",
