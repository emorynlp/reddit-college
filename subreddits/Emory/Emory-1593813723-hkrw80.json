      "text": "It's the kind of thing where you can find your crowd for pretty much whatever scene you want to be in, but overall things are pretty quiet  compared to most schools. It's a nice balance in my opinion between studiousness and laid-back-ness, i never found it to be cutthroat or uptight but most people take their studies seriously. \n\nIt's college so theres still parties and frats and all that stuff but compared to schools with D1 athletics, Saturdays during football season are pretty quiet. Personally that was what I was looking for but you're not going to get tailgates or a massive party experience.\n\nAt the end of the day though you'll find your own scene based on what you're looking for.",

      "text": "You have frats doing stuff regularly on the weekend if you\u2019re into that. You have Atlanta night life like mags, and other bars and clubs to have fun on the weekend (or weekday lol). And then you have random clubs and sports teams doing stuff as well. Most (think like 90%) of kids will go out and do stuff on the regular, but it\u2019s clear that kids take school seriously. If there\u2019s a big exam or something, people will generally stay in to study. Finals and midterm,s things quiet down big time.\n\nPeople are pretty nice and open. Making friends is really easy if you\u2019re even a little outgoing. People like to work together and it\u2019s not hella competitive (even for classes on a curve). If you wanna party, go greek, but otherwise, you can kinda do whatever you want. It\u2019s really up to you.",
