  "text": "Because of USPS delays, your ballot may not arrive in time if you use the mail. Instead, used a dropbox or do early voting. If you go to [IWillVote.com](https://IWillVote.com), you can find drop-off locations, early voting locations, and Election Day voting locations.\n\nMake sure your vote is counted! This will be a historic election in Georgia and throughout the US.",
