If you can\u2019t afford to pay real money (or don\u2019t want to) you\u2019ll be getting almost all your meals from the DCT or the Emporium, which gets old pretty fast.",

That sounds like an okay variety to me? Again, it isn\u2019t a 5 star restaurant but this is college we\u2019re talking about here.",

Desserts are usually good but they\u2019re not a whole meal. I\u2019ve eaten at other colleges\u2019 cafeterias and Emory food kinda sucks, especially considering how expensive tuition is. You\u2019d think we could get better food for the money we pay lol.",
