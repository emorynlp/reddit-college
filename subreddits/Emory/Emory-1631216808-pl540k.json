  "text": "(Not naming individuals involved).\n\nI reported someone to Title IX TEN MONTHS AGO and nothing has been done by Emory. I submitted close to a dozen screenshots proving what this individual did to me. His only evidence was a letter from his family saying he\u2019s a \u201cnice boy and would never do this\u201d, no screenshots, no actual evidence, and yet Title IX has dragged their feet for TEN FREAKING MONTHS, and still hasn\u2019t brought it to trial. It makes me sick that this individual is walking around campus, knowing what he\u2019s done to me and other girls. Speaking up and having to tell what happened to you over and over again is dehumanizing - talking to student health, title IX, lawyers. I did all of that even though it destroyed my mental health, and he still hasn\u2019t even had to go through so much as a trial. If he hurts another girl, Emory, then you\u2019re to blame.",

I hope you can get some closure and I hope things go better for you. And always remember, companies HR/Title 9 are NEVER your friend.",
