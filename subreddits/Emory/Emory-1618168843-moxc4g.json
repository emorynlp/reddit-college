  "text": "He everyone so I recently began filling the Emory My Housing Web and I\u2019ve come across a few difficulties I was hoping I could get some help with. I know I can contact them by email anytime but I hope I could get all the answers I need from here.\nFirst of all, I paid my deposit and signed the agreement form. When adding emergency contacts I was able to add one (My dad), which he signed because I\u2019m under 18, but I can\u2019t seem to add any more even though the form asks to fill in multiple contacts one at a time. There isn\u2019t a button to add any additional contacts.\nSecondly, when I enter the dining section and look for a meal plan nothing comes up. I made sure to select the fall 2021 term but all I get is a blank page. \nI was just wondering whether these become available in later stages maybe after we\u2019ve been assigned to a dorm room or if I\u2019m facing some sort of technical difficulty.",
