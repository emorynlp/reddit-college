  "text": "I'm an entering freshman at Oxford, moving in tomorrow, and getting some very cold feet. I'm worried that it's such a small campus that will lead to me not making many, if any, friends, and will be stuck eating alone etc. I'm pretty introverted and didn't have a great time at pre orientation back in June because everyone just seemed so extroverted. Any advice or wisdom would be really appreciated. ",

In fact, small campuses often lead to many more opportunities to make friends than larger campuses because you're around the same people so much more often so you're forced to get to know them and possibly eventually like to hang out together.\n\n",

              "text": "But also, just force yourself to be more extroverted. If someone over the next week or two asks if you wanna go do something/wanna hang out, just say yes. Even if there's a reading assignment you want to get started or a paper you have to write that's due in a few days. You're going to be hella tired over the next week or so and just be okay with that. Don't tell someone \"nah I don't wanna hang out/go out to eat. I'm too tired.\" Just suck it up temporarily because you'll be happy in 2/3/4 years that you have best friends as a result of being tired. Keep your door open when you're in your room. People will often just come by from your floor because EVERYONE is trying desperately to make friends.\n\nAlso, everyone tomorrow is nervous, scared, and self-conscious. Literally no one, regardless of how confident and extroverted they are, isn't scared and nervous on their first day of college.",

Like even the geography is off putting because I'm used to the plains of Ohio. And then leaving my girlfriend who I've known since kindergarten sucks too.\n\nBut even though it's a small campus, out of 979 kids there's going to be someone for everyone. And if you haven't checked out the main campus, we should do that sometime, because it's really cool, especially the upper classmen campus where we'll be for our last 2 years.",

Take advantage of that, meet some new people, see who you connect with, and bam you've got some new friends. Even at the universities with 20,000 students most people still form small groups of friends with similar interests or personalities, Oxford will be no different. If you put yourself out there and actively seek to make friends, then you'll find them. \n\nRemember, everyone is in the same boat as you. ",

      "text": "I'm Ox2014 C2016 and I did not enjoy my oxford time because I was horribly depressed and had a concussion the first 6 months. Here's my golden advice.\n\n1. you'll make friends. No one there knows everyone. The first few weeks everyone is open to everyone joining them.\n2. join a bunch of clubs, and then choose which one or two (don't be like me and be the chair of 8 clubs) fit you. you'll make friends that way too.\n3. this is college. no one will judge you for liking the things you like. i liked to sing so i joined an acapella group and it was the best thing to ever happen to me. if you like WOW start a WOW club. If you like juggling join a juggling club.\n4. Make friends with the people in your classes, your dorm, and make an effort to smile at them when you see them. You don't have to go all out. Just be kind.\n5. My five best friends for life, that i've known for 7 years now, all came from oxford (6 from Dooley's Dolls tbqh). If this doesn't happen for you, it's fine. Everyone's college experience is different.\n6. It's okay to eat alone. I did very often. Get to know yourself as well.\n7. Most importantly, if you aren't making friends or enjoying Emory/Oxford, finish out the semester and transfer.\n\nYoull be fine. Trust me.",

Oxford has a really tight-knit community, and after the first month or so you'll find your groove. There's a little of everything for everyone there, whether it's joining the dance team or a sports group, to playing games in the Hotspot, to just hanging out on the quad. Take the time to hear about the organizations, mingle with some of the people hanging out in major hangout spots like the Hotspot lounge, dorm lounges, etc. You really get what you put into the social scene over there.\n\nI went in as a huge introvert, but along the way I found people who enjoyed the things I did and I still talk to them a few years after graduating from Emory. It takes time, and it takes effort, but it's not as scary at Oxford.",

      "text": "Okay so first off, throw your worries about eating alone right out the window because you will be stuck eating alone sometimes unless you\u2019re willing to not eat some days. Even the most popular people in the world have scheduling conflicts or don\u2019t have friends around to eat with 24/7. It\u2019s totaly normal to eat alone in a meal hall, just play on your phone or bring study materials. I promise, no one is going to look at you eating alone and pity you or think you\u2019re weird or something.\n\nAs far as making friends goes, I don\u2019t have that much advice (especially since I know next to nothing about Oxford)? Just put yourself out there. Talk to people next to you in class & in line. Most people are willing to start chatting with a stranger, especially in the beginning of the year. I know it can be hard if you have massive RBF like me, but try to smile or look friendly instead of scowling around. It makes you look more approachable lol.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some freshman meet ups going on, and if Oxford has an activities fair, go up to that and sign up for literally everything that interests you. Clubs are a great way to get involved, and even if you only go to one or two meetings, you might end up meeting somebody.\n\nLiterally just force your Snapchat on people, too, that\u2019s what I did as a freshman. That way you can stay in contact and plan things.",

I personally do not know or care much about these organizations, but I have to read and suspect that the person is upset about the specifics of the hazing practices.   If they know something about the other organizations' practices and sees them in a different light,then the critique may be fair.   But either way, I still do not agree with response like: \"Well others do it too!\" I would recommend not doing that.  I feel as if the same could be said about common practices that actually get folks into legal trouble.  It doesn't make those acts less problematic or illegal.   Instead of responding like that, maybe just sarcastically say: \"Sorry you had a bad experience\" or \"Good luck elsewhere\".  If everyone pretty much gets that Greek and other organizations haze, then that person will have little effect on the org's reputation.  By responding like that and like this, you give the person complaining a lot of ammo and then probably embolden them to expose more stuff or badmouthing.  I would not go out of my way to oppose that one commentator.  ",
