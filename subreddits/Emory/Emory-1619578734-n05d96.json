  "text": "I\u2019m a rising freshman who\u2019s coming to campus for the first time in the fall. I really want a suite and am very confused between Harris and Woodruff. Just for context, I plan on taking a bio class, a Chem class, a soc and rel class. The location is definitely important for me but based off of pictures, Harris looks nicer than woodruff (I\u2019m sorry). What would y\u2019all recommend?\n\nEdit: I'll be a sophomore this fall in case my wording was confusing.",

      "text": "I would also add that I\u2019ve heard iffy things about the air quality/ventilation in some of Emory\u2019s older dorms (especially Harris and Dobbs) from friends. If you\u2019re someone who gets seasonal allergies or has asthma I\u2019d probably recommend Woodruff anyway even though it has cinder block walls. Suites at the top of Woody\u2019s and on the straight and left side of the hallway are larger than the other suites and have massive ceilings though so there\u2019s definitely a huge difference in room quality depending on where in Woody\u2019s you end up staying.",

The freshmen dorms are all pretty nice, but you can put suite as your priority in the housing app and see what happens.",

You guys won't be allowed to dorm here and instead are limited to the actual freshman dorms aka LSM, Raoul, etc.\n\nWoody is aight. Sucks during this year because all my friends are in the actual campus, but I'm here next year too and it'll be nicer more populated. What does suck is it's a 7 min walk to student center and a 15 min walk to the chem building, and you have to cross two roads. Everytime I have to cross clifton and eagle row a part of me dies.",
