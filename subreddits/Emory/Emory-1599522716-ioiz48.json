  "text": "Is it just me or do I feel like clubs aren\u2019t going to be active? I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve tried joining 5 but even then barely anything is going on.\n\nDoes anyone know if any clubs will be active soon or does anyone have any recs for a random, fun club I can join (if I still can) that\u2019s doing things rn? I want to be involved in activities on campus but it feels like I can\u2019t do anything atm.",

      "text": "Tbf, most clubs will only host monthly GBMs + special events maybe once or twice a semester. Also, school just started and most events don\u2019t happen till after labor day once clubs finalize new members or exec boards. I would wait to see how the virtual club life looks. If you want to be more active, find clubs where members are expected to contribute, like volunteering or dance teams, as opposed to clubs where exec does everything.",
