  "text": " I got into Emory and received some merit aid. I usually got As and one B every semester with a large amount of AP classes. This year I am taking all APs and my second semester senior grades will probably end up with 3 As and 3Bs. I was wondering if with this grade drop, will I lose some of the merit aid I got from Emory?",
