  "title:": "Opinion: Emory will change it's plan and close most of campus",
  "text": "Currently, Emory plans to have both online and in-person classes this coming fall semester, with residence halls opening to a limited capacity. As you can see from the course atlas, most classes are online and some subjects (such as LING, CS) are entirely online this semester. However, if we look at [Georgia's current coronavirus performance](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states/georgia), it's not looking great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[yeesh](https://preview.redd.it/f8q4gujehv951.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef3f6530f2e46c71e0af4e45a1f295bb9c977a5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing this to Harvard, for example, which is in [Massachusetts with \\~200 new cases/day](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states/massachusetts) and they're deciding to go totally online. I wouldn't be so hopeful about returning to campus this fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [most recent update on 7/7](http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-update-fall-2020-july-7) shows they're getting ready to potentially change the plan and just want to cover their ass early. You can also kiss your club sports goodbye as PE requirement is gone there's no way they'll allow for sports to happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a side note it would be great to see Emory speak up about the recent ICE and F-1 visa nonsense that's going on.",

I just wish that Emory would keep us more in the loop instead of telling us that they may or may not open when the semester starts in a little more than a month.",

          "text": "My question is whether the ICE decision is going to make them have to stay open. It\u2019s possible that they will keep on campus housing open but shift all classes online (or at least a majority). As of the 8th, we can tell from the emails that Emory is probably thinking about moving online:\n\n- The email from 7/7 to students, faculty, and staff suggest they are trying to foreshadow closing down without us feeling it\u2019s a downside\n\n- The email from 7/8 to faculty about the testing capacity being too low and pausing on boarding for people coming into campus until 7/21\n\n- No set move in date for freshman orientation\n\n- No set move in date for Res Life\n\nI think they are unsure about canceling classes because the others schools in Georgia aren\u2019t and they are afraid of the blowback. The ICE decision is also making things difficult, but the hearings are happening right now so hopefully by next Wednesday the issue will be resolved.",
