  "text": "I am a rising junior at Emory and I had a bad housing time (as well as the people I am living with next year) so we didn't get housing in Clairmont. I guess I'm just wondering should I actively be searching for apartments or should I just wait until we find out whether we are going to be on campus or online? What do yall think/ is anyone in a similar situation?",
