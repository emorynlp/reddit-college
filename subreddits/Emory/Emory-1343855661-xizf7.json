I was darn sure I was pre-med. Took every class I needed. Ended up taking a year off post-BS and then applying instead to a different grad program that was more competitive anyway. See if you can take a general ed requirement or 2 in the major areas you are considering before you declare anything. I thought I wanted psych/bio, but ended up with just psych. Y'know those fetal pig dissections they do in lab? My male ended up with gender reassignment surgery. I did much better in class than anything requiring fine motor skills. ",

I'd say it's definitely worth checking out (they can help you get your classes in order), but my personal experience with it has been average.\n\nBut, don't freak out about pre-med.

Pretty chill but known for douchebaggery\nZbt - jewish fraternity but not as exclusively jewish as aepi. They have one of the nicest houses but it belongs to chi phi which just got denied their return to campus\nAepi - a lot of long island jews. Dont know too much about them\nSignu - fucked up and lost their house a couple years ago but they now have it back. Has some of the lowest gpas among greeks.\u00a0\nBeta theta pi - known for the biggest house and the most hard drugs. Dont be surprised if you're at a beta party and someone pulls out a bag of coke.\u00a0\nPhi delt - pretty chill guys, known for smoking a TON of weed. Probably the most diverse IFC fraternity.\u00a0\nSae - only house with a pool, but its disgusting (and countless people have done nasty/sexual things in it). Pretty chill otherwise.\u00a0\nKappasig - kind of the joke on the row for having all the nerdy hipster guys who didnt get bids to any other fraternity. \u00a0\nKa - has a lot of straight up southern guys. Pretty cool but also pretty jocky.\u00a0\nKappa alpha psi and omega psi phi - black fraternities with less than 10 brothers each. Not much known.\u00a0\nSigep - they have like 15 brothers last i heard? Pretty big nationally but still in baby stages at Emory.\u00a0\nXi kappa - relatively new asian-interest fraternity. Has like 30 brothers which is pretty big for a non IFC fraternity. Not exclusively asian, i personally know an african american kid in xk. They do this cool stroll dance at various emory functions. Their bros seem pretty chill but i dont know much about them.\u00a0",

Also, a lot of people talk bad about the duc, but it's honestly not bad. You get an unlimited amount! The only bad thing is eating there everyday. Try and eat wherever your meal plan is good (public health organic pasta, pizza, etc., zayas, cox, clairmont, or just look at fliers and your LL emails as many events, club meetings, etc have free food (almost all of them). But as a sophomore, I found myself sneaking into the DUC quite often, especially when I was hungover so I can get a variety of food and some good ice tea lol",

When I came in, I really wanted to go into the Bschool, and started taking business classes immediately. That's something I regret though, as I didn't take those fun classes you can only take as a freshman. They were also harder, so I didn't get those easy freshmen classes that ease you into college life. Finally decided I didn't want to do the business school last fall while taking two Bschool classes. As for the perfect time, Sophomore year is honestly perfect. Take your time and explore freshmen year. And yes, I'm very happy with my major.",

Some require as few as 8 classes while some of the science majors (like the BS degree in Physics or Chem) require 15 and most people don't want to take more than 2 science classes per semester.  I've taken as many as 4 science/math classes (plus lab) at once and enjoyed it, but I don't think most people would.",
