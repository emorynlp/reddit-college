      "text": "I looked into this around 2018 and was informed that Emory has a strict policy on drones due to safety and legal reasons. I would reach out to CEPAR: [https://emergency.emory.edu/](https://emergency.emory.edu/) to get some additional information on current policies. (I looked at [policies.emory.edu/](https://policies.emory.edu/)  but my search terms didn't get me anywhere)\n\nWith the hospital's helicopter landing zone, there are restrictions. \n\nAlso, the campus is very close to Peachtree Airport. [Which also provides some restrictions on airspace.](https://www.ajc.com/news/drones-no-fly/)",
