  "text": "Hi all, I'm a possible upcoming student at Emory. As someone who's very social and has a \"live life in the moment\" mindset, I value the social life of a school a bit more than others. I\u2019m set on rushing a fraternity in the Spring. I understand that Greek life at Emory pales in comparison to most other schools, but Emory still remains one of my top choices for academic reasons. \n\nWith that being said, can anyone involved within the social scene at Emory share their experiences with Greek life or gatherings/parties? Are there opportunities for these on a weekly basis, or is it more/less often? How big are these gatherings, how hard do these gatherings go? Are there opportunities to socialize with Georgia Tech or UGA students? Thanks in advance!",

          "text": "I wish 20%-30% = non-existent.....I wouldn't have cared whatsoever.  People need to figure out other ways to have fun social functions and develop traditions without pre-existing structures like that.  Emory students are so notoriously bad on that front (like hoping that one day, sports and Greeklife will suddenly provide some energy that they never did or only did to a limited extent).  Luckily I knew plenty of people that threw C-mont parties, went to ATL clubs, etc who were not connected to Greeklife.  More people need to be more spontaneous and figure stuff out.  There are other places with no or dialed back Greeklife that manage to have pretty interesting and vibrant social functions/party scenes and traditions that aren't tied to it or sports/football. At the end of the day, the students make up the social scene (and this is I'm sure where someone comes in and blames the administration for being too strict or whatever, but there are always ways around that).",
