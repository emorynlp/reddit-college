      "text": "Nobody here will know how competitive ED 2 is until decisions are released. However, we can get an idea by looking at ED 1 and last year's ED 2.\n\nThis year ED 1 applications were up 8%, and the acceptance rate was 38.9%. According to Ivy Coach, acceptance rates were 33% for ED 1 and 13% for ED 2 last year. Given these, I think it might be reasonable to assume that ED 2 will be less competitive this year.\n\nThe decision comes out by Feb 15.",

          "text": "Actually ED1 admit rate went down. Last year the ED1 admit rate was 40.5%. The reason it says 33% on the website is because they\u2019re referring to just Emory Atlanta whereas the 38% for this year is the success rate to any Emory campus for an applicant. Last year the success rate to any campus was 40.5%. The ED2 acceptance rates will depend heavily on the RD pool now which we have no way of knowing. They admitted a slightly higher amount(not rate) this year ED1 because even though a bunch of people have deferred admissions from last year and there was an increase in applications yet they didn\u2019t lower the acceptance rate that much. So they may have less spots available but who knows it really depends on the applicant pool which Emory admissions know would have a total knowledge off. Although historically ED2 has a much lower acceptance rate at Emory",

          "text": "I would never use ED1 to predict the competitiveness of later plans especially if signs are pointing to an increase in app numbers. Given how weak Emory's yield formula is for RD, it may take advantage of the extra volume seen in ED1 to run up the score and have a significant chunk admitted (and basically enrolled) in that plan if it won't really compromise the quality the of the pool.  This is especially the case if they plan to admit quite a bit less (raw numbers AND percentage wise) in one or both of the two other plans which is possible considering all the deferrals and whatnot from last year.  The higher number of ED1 admits could give them a cushion to still fill the class to the desired numbers if they admit less in RD and/or ED2 and the yield is weak.\n\nAlso, \"competitiveness\" is hard to quantify vs. past years unless we know the credentials of past year admits in those specific plans.  Emory has had years where admit rates went up but the statistical credentials of the students were stronger than admitted students in a previous year where the admit rate was at least slightly lower.  There is a lot of blackbox stuff going on as the academic stats Emory ends up publishing for admitted students on its admissions website are of course dominated by RD admits and Emory isn't as transparent about other plans.",
