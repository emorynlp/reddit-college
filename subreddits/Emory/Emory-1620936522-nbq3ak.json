  "text": "does anyone have any experience in taking organic chemistry over the summer? I\u2019m a rising sophomore, and I\u2019ve heard that taking the class online in the summer is easier. Heemstra will be the professor. \n\nWill it be more difficult? Or will it be easier because you only focus on that one class?",

      "text": "The sub will be divided, some will say the quality is diminished as you have less time to absorb the material. This means your MCAT preparation may be affected and your ability to take more advanced courses might require more preparation.\n\nOthers will say it's great for freeing up the schedule for the regular semester as 5 credits is taxing on course loads, that's for sure. This also allows you to take more advanced courses earlier, or if you're not interested in chemistry then work on other requirements.\n\nFinally, there will be a portion that will say medical school admissions will frown upon taking prerequisites over the summer. Perhaps they will, perhaps they won't. Honestly, it is so subjective that I wouldn't even worry about what some adcom from a specific school will or won't think several years down the line. If taking the course makes you more available to get better grades on other courses, screw it. Work on your GPA.\n\nOverall, if you think your course load during spring/fall will be equally taxing, I suggest taking the course over the summer so you can get it out of the way. I took it with Dr. Heemstra and he was more than enough to provide you a good background in orgo.",

      "text": "I generally agree with the other poster, and depending on context, ALL of that stuff is true (except the summer thing seems settled as most of the most elite PHAs are very clear about it and have clauses for it in advising documents likely because they are more honest and have insider knowledge about how med. school adcoms review applications.  Don't abuse it and don't make it obvious you are using it to protect a GPA by lightening your yearly courseload).  PHAs elsewhere don't want their students abusing summer courses and many peer schools have superior placement rates to Emory's and say things that are context dependent (go check out Columbia's advising page- I trust them more so than us: [https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health/premedical\\_curriculum](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health/premedical_curriculum)).  Like you probably don't wanna do summer and then come back during the year and take a really light course load or STEM load.  On the other hand, if it is heavier, then that is generally a good reason (like many QTM and NBB majors could probably benefit from a summer STEM because their courses build upon each other and some like 301 and many 301 based electives rely on the foundation from MULTIPLE intro STEMs so the quicker you can clear those, the better off you'll be).\n\nAs for quality (to me it looks like having a rigorous ochem exposure is more important for the MCAT than even I thought.  Getting used to a mechanism focused course and seeing complex molecules would likely help for some of the harder passages), there is evidence that it drops during summer substantially. Weinschenk tries, but not even his is close to the level it can be during the year(summer lacks student support resources and is just too condensed), and then it was further diminished during the online version in summer 2020.  Having seen Heemstra's fall 2020 online(he is solid enough in person.  He would be a harder prof. at some of Emory's \"near peers\" and maybe near the median or on the low medium side for significantly more elite peers that also have rigorous UG chem departments) material...I wouldn't expect much from his summer version.  And note that this does not mean that you'll find it easy to make the best grade. It still moves fast and it is 203 and many people just don't adjust well to organic chemistry (you're shifting from a significant amount of math based learning to conceptual and many can't handle that well so be careful if you found the latter half of 202 tough).\n\nNo matter what grade you get, I recommend a strong biochem course to compensate and/or some research focused biology courses if you'll get a weaker or more rushed exposure to 203/204.  I think the point that the Columbia (and many others with far more elaborate advising on the academic side vs. Emory PHA) page was making is that you shouldn't make it so blatantly obvious that you are \"working on your GPA\" to the point that med. schools can tell.  They still expect you to at least pretend that you are taking on a rigorous course load during the semester (so even if you wanna slap 3 \"decent\" looking biol courses on paper, but they are actually easy at Emory, that'll count.  And you know what courses I am talking about).",
