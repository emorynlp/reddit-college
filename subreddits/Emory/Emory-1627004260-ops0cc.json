  "text": "I am an incoming freshmen at Emory college.\n\n\nJust wondering. Would it still be a good idea now to go completely online? I\u2019ve been really hesitant to travel to the US, cos of COVID, travel restrictions and everything else. I am really scared leaving my country...\n\n\nHowever, Emory just offers too few online courses now, many courses I want to choose do not have an online option. In addition, everyone seems to want to go on-campus, so I might not make as many friends as i want and face some social issues....\n\n\nSo, would it still be a good idea to go online now? All comments are welcome, many thanks in advance.",

Missing out on orientation etc. and staying at home for your first semester could really affect your social life in the future.",

      "text": "I think it would be a huge mistake to go online. On top of being stressed out by Emory\u2019s academic rigor, you\u2019d probably have a much harder time making friends. This would be even worse because you couldn\u2019t take the classes you really wanted to take, making school feel like a chore. Basically you\u2019d get the bad parts of college without the good stuff to make up for it. Depending on where you live, you might have to deal with significant time zone differences too.\n\nCovid safety shouldn\u2019t be a huge problem. Pretty much everyone at Emory is going to be vaccinated. If you\u2019re worried about air travel, airplanes are actually pretty good with their precautions. \n\nGood luck with your decision!",

      "text": "I am an incoming freshman as well and I will be studying online for the fall semester. I advise that if you can, go on campus! Like others have already said, you'd be able to make friends easily, have access to so many different selections of classes, and really experience the wonders (and struggles lol) of freshman year.\n\nI am going to be studying online for the fall because of transportation and financial issues, but I will be going to Atlanta for the spring. I am not quite fond of the number of available classes for fall sem, but it is what it is. I don't think I will have too much trouble making friends because I already have a few people that I know attending the school. Ultimately,  I guess it is situational. COVID vaccines are required as well and you can always try to avoid large gatherings if you're still iffy about that.\n\nWith that being said, the choice is yours! I hope to see you soon bud :D",

However, if they aren't offering the classes you want to take online, come to campus. They're trying to be as safe as possible getting people vaccinated and keeping masks. Unless all your classes are offered online and you need to save money, coming to campus is your best choice.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a bad idea as Emory is super understanding and has online courses available. I\u2019ve spoken to faculty as well and they have said that there are a few students pursuing the online path this fall. Honestly it\u2019s up to you! I\u2019m mostly doing this because I have no other choice.",

Those experiences for the intros (maybe minus physics and calc) were below par and then the people who took them are about to pay when they do the in person versions in the fall because those courses are likely to return to full intensity.  Like many who took chem 150/202 online are about to have their work cut out for them in 203/204 even more than normal.  Same for those taking intermediate bios (even 'easier' ones because the test weighting is about to change).",
