  "text": "Incoming Freshman! I already got a 4 in AP Lang last year and I know on the website it said that lets you not take ENGRD 101 and that AP Lit covers CPLT 101 but I read somewhere most people don't even end up taking CPLT 101 so I was wondering if I should take it? The test is tmrw morning and I am dreading it bc of how mentally exhausted I am lol",

I would skip the exam tomorrow lol",
