  "text": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an incoming freshman wondering how often Emory students use a computer for completing and storing work. Are assignments usually submitted online? Do most professors let you take notes with a laptop? Should I bother buying a bunch of binders to store graded work, or will it be returned digitally? Thanks :)",

      "text": "Emory uses a platform Canvas for all your classes where professors will post videos, assignments, and grades. It is up to you if you want to organize your classes using binders and notebooks. A lot of students type notes or use ipads. But there are plenty who take handwritten notes. If there are class notes or worksheets, most professors will upload them online on Canvas and some students decide to print them out before class to have a physical paper copy. Most assignments will be turned in online. There are some professor that will absolutely not allow any electronics in classes. So you\u2019ll be taking handwritten notes in those classes. There are very few professors who have those policies but they exist. Note that there is a benefit of handwriting notes and typing up your notes, but it\u2019s all up to you and what works best for your learning style. I like to personally handwrite my notes pen and paper or annotate ppts on my ipad if a professor uploads them before class on canvas. Also, with the pandemic I think a lot more professors will be completely giving out assignments and grading them online through canvas where they can still give your feedback. This includes papers because canvas allows professors to annotate directly online. Not sure if most professors will feel comfortable grading printed out paper copies of essays and giving them out. This is not high school. You wont be completing small paper worksheets and handing them in. These will be done online. The only paper assignments you will probably have are exams. Hope this helps",

      "text": "It really depends on the class and the professor. I would say for the most part papers are submitted through canvas. Allowing laptops/tablets in class will again be up to the professor. Some explicitly say no, others don\u2019t care. I would wait for the first week of classes and see the syllabus. That could give you an idea of what you need. For me, all I needed was a folder for all my classes.",
