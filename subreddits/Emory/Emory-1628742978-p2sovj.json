      "text": "She probably isn't bad but people set low expectations for the intensity of non-quantitative social science courses and she is known to make people work and do decent work even in introductory classes (people don't expect social science intros to work like STEM and social sciences and humanities are generally stereotyped as grade inflated and low workload) Because of that you're gonna see mixed or even some nasty reviews on her.  She simply bucks expectations of what a large social science should feel like. You'll find similar patterns of STEM professors for things like intro biology where the prof. gets mixed reviews for deviating from a memorization oriented course which is what most expect in biology (whereas a chem professor has to do an awful lot to get punished for being \"difficult\" by demanding a decent level of problem solving and critical thinking skills.  People just expect chemistry to be challenging in that specific way). \n\n Same in math, unless the professor is really damned good or exceptional, you'll see many reviews that roast them if they give exams or any type of assessment that emphasizes more conceptual understanding than expected vs. simple ability to do computational problems where you basically repeat methods from HW/pset problems with different numbers.  What I advise (because she is super knowledgeable and a solid lecturer) is for you to sit in the lecture, get the syllabus, and assess if you want to do all of her work and understand that it won't all be graded easily.  If you want to take it, don't treat it how most imagine a college social science to be.",

              "text": "Yeah,always take RMP with a grain of salt. When you assess RMP ratings just keep in mind that college is way bigger than HS and certain depts/divisions come with their own stereotypes that color expectations.  You really have to evaluate them in the context of expectations to see if they are really fair.  Like a red flag for me to think deeper is when they get mixed reviews but most of the comments are complaining about difficulty or grading.\n\nThat's when I really start to dig into context.  But generally, more challenging professors will have more mixed reviews (usually anyone that has like above a 3.7 difficulty and a similar quality rating or higher is probably a very strong instructor because that indicates that students find the challenging environment very much worthwhile with that instructor. However, you'll see these types of ratings as more common in STEM courses tbh) unless they are exceptional teachers and/or exist in the context of a division where students sort of expect to be challenged in certain ways.\n\nOften there can be a lot of coded language in those ratings that hint at the specifics of what a person may not like/did not expect about a class. And you may get an idea of their own expectations and biases (again, the math example, you may see ratings that mention stuff about conceptual questions or that say things like: \"test questions seem harder than homework\" with the latter mainly just meaning that the student expected test questions to directly mirror homework or something.  And while that is a situation that certainly is predictable and makes us feel comfortable about our raw scores and ability to perform in the class, it really isn't sensible to expect faculty at a top tier university to only demand that students regurgitate methods from homework problems.  That's something you expect at less selective schools where many/most students did not master  that level of learning in HS. Hopefully an Emory wouldn't just stop at training us to be high achieving robots, but no doubt that type of demand is easier to meet and our self-esteem is less affected by clearing low bars as one can just pretend they are high because its Emory so it must be demanding enough and you're a high achiever and thus everything is supposed to be easy lol. But seriously, a lot of people do think that way and don't ever question whether their curriculum or course is being watered down despite the student body allegedly being well-prepped and ready for tougher demands and more complexity).\n\nNow, if the ratings constantly refer to bad  lecture quality, organization issues, unprofessional conduct, and things that effect the ability to even learn(again, not to be conflated with: \"makes it really easy and doable to get a high grade and do well\" You will see those comments a lot for some teachers and it'll be glittery but not necessarily gold.  Indeed, take such classes that get an abundance of suchcomments for an easy A if you don't need that area for any courses or exams in the future, but don't expect to learn and retain much or even get excited about material.  There are many profs. that do that who you won't learn much from) and get feedback on material/progress in the course at its most basic level, it is fair to probably just run and avoid without even waiting for a syllabus or chance to attend the class.  For the scenarios I described outside of that, you really just need to figure out your own expectations and biases and whether or not you want to take on certain challenges in certain fields or if you would perhaps just like some simple teaching and assessments because you just need to say...do a Gen. ed in an area you aren't excited about.",

      "text": "as someone who actually took her class\u2026i wouldn\u2019t unless you absolutely have to. i took her freshman seminar last year and it was so bad a ton of people dropped it, there was less than half of us left by the end of the semester. she can come across very passive aggressive and even straight up rude at times. every class she went through a powerpoint at lightning speed, refused to upload them bc \u201cthen you guys wouldn\u2019t come to class\u201d, very little room for discussion or a difference of opinion, harsh grader on the bi-weekly essays (due every class) and took forever to grade them. she didn\u2019t put in the last grades until a couple weeks into the 2nd semester. the class was just overall badly structured and overwhelming especially for a freshman seminar. idk about her actual pols classes but she has that many bad ratings for a reason. i wish i had listened to those and taken a diff fresh sem. if you think you could handle it or ur majoring in poli sci then go for it bc she is very knowledgeable u just have to know what to expect and be ready for a really difficult time.",

          "text": "I think the question should be why was she using a lot of slides for a freshman seminar which IS supposed to be discussion and book or even primary source oriented (especially in something like history/politics)? Either way, not shocked.  Some professors (especially research track) just make more sense for a lecture and I think that is what her U.S. politics course is. Sucks you had that experience though.  From what I've seen online on professional seminars/lectures by her, I'd have to admit that I don't think she seems like seminar(unless maybe a colloquium or upper division research oriented seminar) material either as she does seem a little too awkward/standoffish for discussion oriented classes or scenarios. I Think there is a reason she usually fields questions for a panel vs. Answering questions/being a panelist on the spot herself.",
