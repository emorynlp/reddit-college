  "title:": "Defer due to COVID19? How is the incoming Fall 2020 cohort doing?",
  "text": "Hi, \n\nFall 2020 graduate student acceptance at Emory. I have a few days to make a decision. Does anyone know if I am able to accept my admission and **still** be given the option to defer prior to school starting? I am moving states to attend Emory and I am already employed at a good hospital with job security in my home state. Moving to Georgia during this time makes me a little worried but I am aware that things may be online/not be completely better by Fall 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny information/advice would be appreciated!",
