Or are they just interviewing me because I applied ED?\n\n...Or am I just totally overthinking entirely lol. Also, if anyone happens to have any interview tips that they think are particularly helpful/rarely mentioned, comment!! I'm nervous and would appreciate any advice =)",

      "text": "No. It\u2019s totally random. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re close to getting in. Your interview does have an impact on you getting in but so long as you don\u2019t bomb it it shouldn\u2019t matter too much. I think for most colleges they were even introduced not to use as an additional evaluation metric, but just to give applicants applicants a chance to learn more about the school and to leave a good impression. That\u2019s what I remember reading AOs/alumni interviewers saying my year on r/applyingtocollege. I\u2019d do more research.\n\nThe only school, to my knowledge, where interviews matter significantly is Harvard. Also, the other people who commented have no way of knowing if they were in the cusp of getting in or not or if the interview pushed them over the edge. I know a lot of people my year that got in who also felt the same way without an interview \u2014 that their application was inadequate and they weren\u2019t sure how they got in here. It\u2019s really hard for anyone to judge their own application and attribute one single factor that caused AOs to admit them imo.",

          "text": "Oh Harvard......we all know what their admissions interview was originally used for. Hint: it wasn't ethical.  One has to wonder about some of the elite privates that even today are still a bit more homogenous in terms of ethnic or socioeconomic demographics than peer schools.\n\n\nAs for that last sentence about these people feeling \"inadequate\", wow people need to get over the imposter syndrome (and I know it isn't easy).  The fact is, if Emory wasn't interested in the person (regardless of how strong the application is) at all they probably would not bother to even interview them. Not to mention that even today, Emory's admissions is still probably far more holistic than its peers.\n\n For better or worse (clearly just becoming an SAT/ACT scores whore was a way to move up in the rankings like 5+ years ago whether it actually improved the student body in a meaningful way or not), It gets that students don't have to enter Emory as paper perfect or faux perfect to have an impact or do well in even academically rigorous programs. AOs (whether be several or a couple of advocates) probably saw way more than these \"inadequate\" applicants saw in themselves before an interview.",

Like how would the difficulty of an intro chem class here compare to an intro chem class at somewhere like Georgia Southern or another state university? I wonder if people here that are doing decently would breeze by easily in those environments and get amazing grades without effort.",

                  "text": "Not all departments are created equally at universities and sometimes the harshness of grading at many publics means you would have to try.   Generally outside of more selective (and I am talking like your UGA level selectivity range and up) privates, the courses in many (but not all) STEM areas will be a breeze to most Emory students and kind of mirror an easier Emory instructor in terms of content and assessment depth but with a less competitive student body so many Emory calibre students if they aren't perfect at the less selective state schools would be able to sort of ride the curve. \n\n However, I will say that many even less selective state schools will have some intermediate and advanced/elective STEM courses that will give the Emory tier of elite privates a run for the money because state schools weed out a lot more in the beginning so those courses often end up much smaller than equivalents at even a place like Emory. This means the professors can give more challenging/intellectually provocative assignments because they don't have to worry about the burden of grading too many assignments. \n\n Like if you look over in Emory biology you have some of those premed bandwagon courses like 336 that still are kind of the size and feel of an intro. Just too big and with too little quality control and faculty support (many even less prestigious and up and coming state schools have larger/more robust graduate programs than privates outside of the super elites so faculty have much more access to grad. TA support).  At GSU, I forget if the physiology sequence is small, but since it is connected to their very strong neuro and nursing UG program, they quality control it and it is far more challenging(and in a meaningful way: it mirrors the demands of like Frenzel's rendition of NBB 301 or intro BME courses at Georgia Tech. Very problem solving oriented and case based) than I think any Emory professor's rendition.  \n\nBut public schools are funny.  When they wanna truly invest in undergraduate education in a department, they go all out and even non-honors courses at a school that chooses to invest will not be a far cry from top privates that are serious (and you have many top privates that aren't as aggressive about UG ed. in key STEM areas for example.  Find some of your friends going to elites outside of maybe the T10 USNWR schools and see if you'll find a Weinschenk or Soria level course for ochem or a gchem sequence that mirrors Emory/significantly deviates from AP. It is honestly more likely at a range of publics and LACs. Same in biology/life sciences with regards to having intermediate and advanced courses that emphasize research and primary literature and many places just very recently deciding to try significant active learning in foundation level bio probably with COVID as the precipitating factor.   Emory still has quite a few peers that are overwhelmingly \"just read the book and memorize the slides\" even beyond intro).  \n\nEmory is pretty good, but I am not interested in how it measures up to much less selective state schools (though sadly too many pre-grads and pre-meds at Emory may opt to take professors who teach at that level far too often, usually to their own detriment:  A choice usually not available at T10 privates and more selective publics.  You may have 1-2 tough professors running a section per semester and you have to deal with the hand you are dealt.  At Emory, an awful lot of weird maneuvering takes place because you have like 3-5 people teaching core STEMs, minus physics) so much as how it measures up to T10 privates and publics with strong UG ed. Investment or ultra strong honors colleges (I think of places like UGA, UMD, and UT Austin for honors programs, especially with a STEM arm).  On that front, it and even near peers like WUSTL, JHU, CMU, Rice which may be better than average for top privates not a part of the historic T10, still have work they can do for sure. Unfortunately that work costs lots of money and an even larger pool of dedicated faculty.",
