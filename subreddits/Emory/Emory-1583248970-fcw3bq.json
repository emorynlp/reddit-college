  "text": "Transfer Student here,\n\nNext semester will be my first at Emory and I am beginning in the nursing school. I would really prefer to live on campus do to the ease of getting to long class days and clinical/lab days from campus housing. I have a roommate who is also a transfer entering the nursing school, and I have heard tower is absolutely awful. My selection date is 5/3 at 5:30 and I am slightly worried URC will be gone and CRC is quite pricy. It is just the two of us willing to get a 3-4 person apartment, and I was wondering if tower is truly that bad or if is it nice enough and bearable for a year due to the convenience of the location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside: We also would prefer our own rooms, based on your experience do you think this housing finesse is possible?\n\nEdit: Tower has been secured, here's to hoping it'll be a good year!",

I'm just kinda irked at the likelihood that I will have to room share again, which I mean it's not the end of the world, it's just not preferable. \n\nWhat did you like/find enjoyable about tower?",

                  "text": "A lot of it has to do with the contrast coming from a not so great freshman dorm (I lived in the tower sophomore year). It just seemed a lot more relaxing. Larger room, living space and a nice view that\u2019s not the back of the DUC (ground floor). Bathroom was great (coming from community) and I just felt I had more privacy overall (even when roommate came back). That mixed with gym and community that is Clairmont made the tower so enjoyable to just hang with friends or study when I needed some space. All of that being said I would definitely prefer URC or CRC ( <-not as much as URC) simply do to having your own room (in my opinion tower\u2019s biggest and perhaps only downfall). At the end of the day I do believe that getting your own room is priceless even if it might mean commuting (which really sucks in Atlanta).",

      "text": "It is possible to both get individual rooms (super-singles) in towers, but as these rooms are meant for two it\u2019s actually quiet pricey (100$ more than CRC super-single). As someone who had a supersingle in towers, it\u2019s pretty unbeatable.\n\nMy only gripe with towers was the fact that we didn\u2019t have laundry in the apartment, and that the kitchen wasn\u2019t open plan but having a balcony, open living room, and the convenience of location really outweighed that stuff for me. \n\n Also, it is definitely possible to finesse this when you select your room - just assign yourself to one room and your roommate to the other.",
