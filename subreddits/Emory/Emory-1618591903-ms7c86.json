  "text": "I'm an international student so I'm not very knowledgeable in average costs of health insurance in the US, but the EUSHIP seems very expensive to me (US healthcare am I right). Is EUSHIP a good deal, or should I look for a third-party health insurance for next year? If so, what health insurance companies would you recommend?",

      "text": "Here's the thing. The Emory plan is better than what you can buy on the Marketplace, i.e., third party insurance. However, if your parents have insurance from your employer, then you have to consider the pros and cons.\n\nI have seen some plans being sold abroad to international students. I can't comment on how good they are, or what they cost. However, you should know that Emory has certain minimum standards for what insurance plan you are allowed to have. If your plan doesn't meet it, you are automatically enrolled into the Emory plan. Given these requirements (one of which is that the plan must have a US based administrator and a US based phone number for claims, which should rule out the majority of plans sold abroad), I think you are best off with the Emory plan.\n\nPersonally, I found the Emory plan to be very useful for the 1 year I had it. One of the big things is that the deductible is just $150 and the coinsurance is 90% if you go to an Emory facility. Combined with the rates that Aetna has negotiated with Emory Healthcare, the Emory plan reduced my medical bills from a \"sticker price\" of $8000 to $300 to be paid out of pocket.\n\nEdit: if you get sick, then you first have to go to Student Health, where you don't pay anything.",

      "text": "I'm assuming you're talking about the Emory insurance. As a fellow international student I tell u it's absolutely shit. You pay way too much and get basically nothing assuming you don't injure urself to death. I went for an eye exam once at the Emory hospital and it was 300$. The next place I went too offered me a 50% off my test and I still paid 50$. Most people I know got into their parents insurance plans so I don't know what are the alternatives. Medicare seems like the best and cheapest one but I'm not sure how these thing rlly go but you should for sure look at other alternatives.",
