  "text": "Hi! Has anyone here taken PORT 110 and know what it's like? I've got a background in Spanish from middle and high school, and did pretty well in it once I caught on. My Spanish is a little rusty but I'm confident I can get it back in shape with enough practice. I'm interested in starting Portuguese in the meantime, and a professor recommended I start with 110. \n\nWhat's the class like? How much work is it? Would you recommend? TIA!",
