  "title:": "Need Advice on BBA Courses",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I would love some advice on which profs to take for BBA courses. I won't bullshit you guys - I want an easy A. From your experience, which professors are known to be the easiest A's for the following courses? I can take these courses Spring 2022 or Fall 2023, depending on your answers for ideal profs and depending on who's teaching when.   \n\n\n\\-ACT 211 - Managerial Accounting  \n\\-FIN 320 - Corporate Finance  \n\\-MKT 340 - Marketing  \n\\-ISOM 351 - Process & Systems Management  \n\\-ACT 410- Legal Environment of Business\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much, everyone! Insights on any of these will be much appreciated! :)))",

          "text": "Thx for reminding people.  People forget this.  If the faculty of one of those cores gives ultra easy assessments and the grades are extra high, I suspect it is more likely that final grades will not reflect Emory's standard scale and will instead be much more stringent meaning that students might have to be damned near perfect to make that A and it may be less predictable how they'll curve.  A faculty with medium or semi-difficult assessments (exams , projects, whatever) means that grades at their most stringent will be on the standard Emory scale and probably will be adjusted upwards if the target distribution is missed.  Those situations are more predictable IMO.",
