  "title:": "Looking For a Summer Sublease Near Atlanta?",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nA couple of Georgia Tech college students and I built a student-centric subleasing platform that connects college students called [studentsublease.com](https://studentsublease.com). We currently have over 60 listings available on the platform! If you or anyone you know is looking for a short-term place to live this summer in the Atlanta area, check it out and help us spread the word! Support from fellow students would go a long way. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the site, we\u2019re always open to suggestions. Any questions? Feel free to reach out at [studentsublease.com/contact](https://studentsublease.com/contact). Thank you!",
