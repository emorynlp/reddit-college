  "text": "I'm a philosophy/finance double major. Anyone have any experience with David Marriott in PHIL? (I would take 204W with him). Also- is 19 credits too much? I guess it's really 17 because two of them are Professional Development, which I've heard is like B-school pace. \nThe other classes are french, corp. finance, , philosophy, OAM, and BCOM.
