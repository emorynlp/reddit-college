I also get the feeling that people find their people at oxford and travel up to Emory together and like you said, you were at Emory and friends with oxford people. It\u2019s a more cohesive unit than I understood. Thanks for taking time to chat with me. This has been an incredibly stressful time (and now one of her og rejects is coming back like hey girl and she\u2019s thrown for a loop). I\u2019m just trying to support her decisions but she hates talking to me about it and I think she can\u2019t help me understand bc she doesn\u2019t, and all the googling in the world hasn\u2019t helped me.

Another perk was that we were allowed cars and I was able to go explore Atlanta and go to meetings on the Atlanta campus. I\u2019m not sure if that is still the case as I graduated in 2002. \n\nYou do get an Associate or Arts and moving to the main campus was automatic for me.
