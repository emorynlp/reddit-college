      "text": "It's actually the other way around from my experience!! A lot of the other stuff sounds really cool, but the groups who are doing those activities can only do it for like 3 hours total on one of the days. This might have changed as I did SOAR in 2018, so it has been a while. \n\nThe hiking group also got really close with each other because of the one hike where we had to climb up a mountain, but it was awesome getting up there at the end and camping for the night!! \n\nNo matter what though, I would do SOAR!! just knowing a solid amount of people here before you get to campus is incredibly helpful!!",
