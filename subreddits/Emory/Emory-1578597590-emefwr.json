          "text": "It always depends on how the credits are composed.  I always note how Emory's credit allocations don't make but so much sense and often don't predict the workload or follow much rhyme or reason.  In STEM, there are, for example, now several 2 credit teaching labs that are technically less work than when they were 1 credit before switching to the 3 hour system.  Someone doubling up in chem and biol their first semester will have 10 just between those two and it is hardly justified (8 makes more sense), and they could likely afford to have up to 18 credits as long as the other courses are relatively straight-forward.\n\nI never bat an eye at credit hours until I see the courses and professors someone is taking.  I'd have to see something like 22 or higher to begin worrying before I see the actual schedule.",
