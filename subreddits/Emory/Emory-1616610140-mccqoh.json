  "text": "Jesus christ I have no free time anymore. I am sleep-deprived, depressed and eating like shit because I don\u2019t have time to eat anything except frozen food. And I still come to class unprepared because I didn\u2019t have time to complete the readings or finish watching the lectures. I underloaded last semester and thought that maybe professors would\u2019ve changed their workloads after so many students complained about it being way too stressful. It seems like they haven\u2019t. I genuinely am barely holding on",

Being off campus and super isolated doesn't help either. \n\nSomething that my therapist recommended is to pre-plan 15 or 20 minutes of \"you time\" between your work, where you can go on a walk or listen to music or do something you enjoy.  It doesn't change the amount of work, but it can help you recharge and make you feel a little more in control. \n\nGood luck!  It's understandable that you're overwhelmed, & I hope things get better for you.  Wish I had better advice.",

              "text": "Are these social sciences and humanities courses typically known for high reading and writing load and relatively little formal support outside of the writing center or are you doing STEM or something where there is lots of formal support? I'm just worried that sophomore year is just naturally stressfully (and Ox in something like social sciences and humanities was going to be stressful anyway because of class sizes and the instructors being able to demand more immersion, participation, and work).  I know Covid exacerbates how you feel about the workload, but I have to wonder if it is intentional on the instructors' part.  I do see, from discussions with a few fellow ECAS reditters, that many courses (these people are STEM though) have moved back towards what you would expect during a regular year which would have been a high workload and harder tests (there are exceptions, don't get me wrong), and I have to wonder if that is on purpose to sort of ease students back into what \"normal\" courses would feel like as well as to do some quality control before students are passed off to courses that will be more \"normal\" in the fall that may build upon the foundation in the current courses.  I imagine it sucks but hang in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing to consider is giving yourself grace.  I know you said you are stressed out, but are you doing well in the courses grade wise?  If so, you should have accumulated some room for error or to relax.  I know everyone wants to be and appear perfect all the time at these schools, but maybe you may wanna take the foot off the gas a little (learn how to strategically skim readings or if you in critical thinking and problem solving oriented courses, find ways to focus on the most important parts/broader concepts and problem solving strategies highlighted in the lecture as opposed to writing every little thing down).  I don't know, just think about ways to lower the stress that don't completely cause you to bomb if you are holding on to a strong position now.  You got 2 years left and it would help to keep your mental health in tact so that you do well during them.",
