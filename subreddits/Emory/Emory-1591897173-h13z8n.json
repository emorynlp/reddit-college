  "text": "I did some research and created [a site](https://coda.io/@collegetuition/emory-university-tuition) for visualizing college costs and stats at Emory. After listening to the Numbers Geek podcast, I was curious about how tuition is being used, how much each student costs the university, and revenue generated per student. This sent me down a rabbit hole of visualizing admissions and enrollment data on this page as well. Would love your thoughts!",

      "text": "God knows...likely subsidizing a lot of administrative stuff and other units.  Admittedly instruction is very costly (more than people could imagine, which is why the super elite schools with the endowments 2x+ Emory's can just revamp things as rigid as STEM curricula at the drop of a dime.  They have so much resources that they are easy to mobilize even towards undergraduate educate.  Despite people stereotyping these places as \"not focused on undergraduate education but only research\" people should realize that you can technically be less focused on UG vs. research and still do a better job at UG education than universities with much smaller endowments).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, one thing I would consider is the PER UNIT endowments and spending (which doesn't appear to be broken down here).  Most students at Emory are in ECAS or Oxford College.  I'm pretty sure ECAS nor Oxford \"profit\" as much as anyone thinks because their endowments aren't that high (and neither is GPS) and tuition is very likely to support other units that perhaps do not enroll undergraduates.  Given the per unit endowments of the most populous undergraduate hosting units, Emory is kind of working small miracles when it comes to academic quality (with that said, there is room for plenty of improvement as always and they need to raise the money/endowment of these units and improve financial health if they are to develop new programs or enhance those that have not historically received much investment.  That is really the only way it can ever have a shot of further improving the reputation of its undergraduate programs versus its closer and significantly higher ranked peers.  Without that, its reputation will be propped up by a few impactful and strong programs, but ultimately overshadowed by the healthcare and associated life sciences research infrastructure and reputation).\n\n\\*Very interesting though.",
