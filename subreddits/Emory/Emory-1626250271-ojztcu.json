  "text": "My brother has taken QTM 110 his freshman year and loved it. He suggested I also take the course. He took the class with Kevin McAlister (haha Ik) and told me to take it with a different teacher cuz this teacher does too much reading. My brother loves reading but I am the opposite. However, I\u2019m interested in the class. I was wondering how QTM 110 is with Gregory Sasso? I mean, how much reading assignment? And are they optional or required? \n\nTL;DR: does Gregory Sasso assign lots of reading assignments for QTM 110? If so, are they required? \n\nThank u",
