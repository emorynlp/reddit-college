      "text": "Yes, just plan carefully to ensure that you can actually get the best of both or else there is no point in double majoring and you may as well just do the BBA and fit in some key upper division bios you find useful (I think anything that helps you learn biotechnology and genetics can lead to some interesting pathways if you have a business background) as bio does not block non-majors from taking upper divisions.  If you have the pre-reqs (mostly bio 141/142 only) you are golden!",

      "text": "Yup. Emory has a few colleges (Arts and Sciences, Business, Nursing) and anyone is allowed to double major with one major in the business school and one in arts and sciences (where biology would be). Those majors have absolutely no overlap in classes, so your schedule would be very full, but it would still be very reasonably manageable.",
