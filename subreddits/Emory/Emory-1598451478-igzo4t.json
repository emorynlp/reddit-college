The app will let you ask questions, get advice and share resources with students & upperclassmen in your major/class. Check it out, I'd love some feedback!

The biggest one is that even though you could be anonymous to your fellow users on the platform, you'd have to sign up with your school email with us to use the platform. \n\nFor a list of some of the others check out [this](https://www.joinqwerty.com/blog/honor) blog post. We're also currently working on quite a few more ways to prevent academic dishonesty on the platform, I'd be happy to keep you posted on those as well! I'd also love to hear any recommendations that you may have!",
