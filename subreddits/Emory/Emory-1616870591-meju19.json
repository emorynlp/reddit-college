  "title:": "Is the max University Grant $6000 for independent students?",
  "text": "I received a very low financial aid package and my out of pocket cost is around $39,000 a year with an EFC of 0. And would be around $78,000 for 2 years of my undergrad program. Our adj is around $25,000 as both my spouse and I are college students with a child. And hence I'm an undergraduate, independent transfer student. \n\nI got the max for pell, fseog, and the $850 georgia grant. And $6000 university grant for a total of around $15,000 combined. My spouse is going to graduate this Spring but hasn't landed a job yet so there's no way we can afford Emory at all without further financial aid. \n\nI emailed my financial aid advisor and explained my situation and the only solution is to get private loans because as an independent student the max university grant is $6000. \n\nI asked about the Emory Advantage and they said it's only for dependant student (\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22). When I asked if I can submit an appeal, they replied an independent student cannot appeal because I got the max possible. \n\nI wanted to reach out and ask if there's any independent student who had any success with appeals or recieved a greater amount of university grant?\n\nAt least I can feel proud I got accepted even if I cannot afford to attend but wanted to try my last opportunities.",

My first 2 years was my state university and wanted to transfer for the Emory's nursing program for the last 2 years. \n\nI was accepted but no way to afford the cost of tuition at Emory. I'm in the low income group since both my spouse and I are college students and we barely make anything. \n\nThe way I was informed, married students no matter their financial income won't get much need based aid. I got roughly $15,000 in grants/scholarships and cannot appeal my aid either since I'm not a dependant student :/.",

          "text": "That's true. \n\nEmory was the first to give me an admission offer and I spent quite a long time researching and basically dreamed this was the school for me. \n\nMy parents lives in Atlanta and my spouse also wanted to stay in Atlanta after graduation with our child and there's better job outlook for him here. I was hoping for a better financial aid offer and when I use the net financial aid calculator with my background, it displayed a very affordable cost. It went the opposite direction and I was quite shocked with the difference. Lesson learned that these are highly inaccurate. \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude22. \n\nI received a better offer from a different university in a different state. I guess I just wanted to see if there's any success stories of any appeals/if I recieved the wrong information etc before finally giving up. Most likely 98% chance that I'm going to the cheaper one. 2 years of separation is better than 80k in debt. Aye.\n\nEdit: I tried applying to Ga nursing schools but most of them all required either the Hesi/teas exam and I couldn't take them in time to transfer/application next semester and Emory only required an ACT.",
