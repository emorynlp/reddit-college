      "text": "When I went through, we just had a paper with a written portion and a portion that had a randomly assigned station for us to do experiments on. You could do either portion first during the alotted time.\n\nThe experiment was based on one that was previously done in the semester (stuff like dehydrating, testing for certain reactants, etc.). If you were weak on one experiment, you might get unlucky and get assigned that one. Or you could fly by with measuring shit. You didn't have to do all, just your assigned one.\n\nIt was a while ago but definitely after the switch to the new chemistry curriculum.",

      "text": "I took it in Fall 2019\u2026it was a 2 part exam to be done in the 3 hour block of your lab. There\u2019s a written part and a practical part. These were given to us at the same time and we could divide the 3 hours however we liked (work on one before the other or do them simultaneously)\n\nThe written part was a traditional 30-40 question multiple choice exam focusing on big picture outcomes and analysis of the experiments. \n\nThe practical part will basically ask you to replicate one of the labs you\u2019ve done this semester. Each lab day/time has a different experiment to do\u2026they are supposedly assigned at random however we found that the earlier sections had easier ones and the later sections had harder ones (I had lab on friday and had to do the neutralization equivalent/titrations lab). \n\nIt wasn\u2019t too tough of an exam overall, but definitely stressful",
