Quality and content differ so much between language courses. I'd go with what the person who took the course said (with a grain of salt) and not an amalgamation of second-hand info from others.\n\nLoved Russian, though. Will continue for the second year of it. I'd say if you can't read it, you could get a *slight* headstart whenever. Language learning isn't supposed to be set in stone with formal courses and start/end dates only. It's a lifetime learning process and it doesn't matter whether you start now, as long as you do.",

      "text": "Okay, most of these intros. are just \"busy\" and have a lot of work because they are introductory courses really trying to teach people decently.  They certainly aren't \"high school level\"(at least not vs. a very first language course) and may be as immersive as mid or high level languages in most HSs, however that doesn't make it \"difficult\".  The workload assigned is usually useful in terms of learning and the assessments facilitate learning as well. And often they start only speaking the language ASAP even at the 100 level which will seem scary to some but is also useful.  If you put the time in, you'll learn and make an A as the tons of assesments aren't  particularly complex.\n\nI don't recommend restarting languages you are darn near fluent in because you'll have a higher workload in intro whereas some higher levels will be like standard humanities courses with more serious writing and reading assignments but a slower pace of them because there is no need to drill as hard.\n\nAs for summer. Enjoy your damned summer! And enjoy the course you choose.  This is NOT gchem where they want you to teach yourself some basic chemistry so they don't have to.\n\n\n*Note that if you aren't familiar with Asian languages, that may present its own challenges and learning curve.",
