  "title:": "First Time Using Emory Shuttle",
  "text": "I'm planning on making my first trip to Walmart this upcoming week using the Emory Shuttle and I'm hoping someone can provide clarification or some advice. I'm looking on the website and found the North Dekalb route makes a stop at Walmart so should that be the shuttle I take? When the shuttle loops back from North Dekalb Mall to Woodruff Circle, would it make a stop at Walmart once again so I could ride back to campus?",
