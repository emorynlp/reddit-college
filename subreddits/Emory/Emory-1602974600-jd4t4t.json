  "title:": "Dissatisfaction with Spring Announcement Presentation to Undergraduates Living Off Campus",
  "text": "I can't say I'm too surprised after watching the presentation.  They added no new information and deflected any negative feedback about their plans.  (If you didn't watch it, I think they'll eventually post it on Emory Forward.)  I'm not that experienced on Reddit, so I apologize if this is too ranty and long.\n\n1. One of the questions asked about what improvements they'll make to better our virtual education (like how will they address unsatisfactory classes and dramatically increased workloads).  Instead of answering, they basically just repeated what they said before the Fall semester: \"Our professors took a great course over the summer and are prepared to teach at just the same caliber as in person.\"  Obviously they don't want to acknowledge that some (not all) of the classes have been very difficult because they're too afraid of students asking for reduced tuition.\n2. They only ever seem to mention the Class of 2021 in relation to their commencement plans.  Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful that they're even planning anything (I do have a level of skepticism that they'll even follow through), and I honestly think that they should also be planning a separate in person make-up ceremony for Class of 2020.  But in my opinion, a ceremony doesn't really make up for having your last 1.25 years of college taken away.  Did they even consider having the freshmen for the fall and seniors for the spring like other colleges have?  The answer is probably no because their money is on the line.  (Please note that I am not angry at the students currently living on campus.  I am just disappointed in the administrators' decisions and handling of their decisions.)\n3. In relation to having spring break taken away and the worsened mental health of students, they basically just said: \"We have CAPs! :D\"  Not to knock CAPs because it can be very helpful for some students, but it feels like the administrators just don't want to 'deal' with students' mental health at all.  They could improve student mental health by giving us breaks, improving classes, bringing back the pass/fail policy from spring 2020, and making more of an effort to create a community for students, but I suppose they'd rather not consider these options.\n\nThey talked about other stuff, this is just what really stood out to me.  I would have a lot of understanding for them being in a tough spot if it seemed like they had any compassion for students.  They say that they care about students, but most of their actions have not reflected that.  It really just seems like they want to avoid the negative feedback until we're stuck in the middle of another terrible online semester.  Whatever, I guess... I just can't wait until I never have to give this school another cent.",

      "text": "Like /u/Bitchbasic said, Emory knows they can get away with whatever shit they want as long as they keep testing people. I\u2019ve also had my fair share of bullshit interactions with CAPS and SIS (which is apparently the weird secret department responsible for handling cases where someone reports you for having a mental health crisis). I *wish* they were just incompetent and slow, but they have the power to put people on involuntary leave while not having the power to refer you to a real doctor/therapist or deal with anything more serious than homesickness. \n\nCAPS/SIS is not as bad as Stanford/Ivies using counseling to expel \u201cproblem\u201d students but its still something that does more harm than good IMO. I\u2019m terrified of my RAs because they could sic SIS on me at any time if I don\u2019t look and act perfectly happy.",

Having that last quarter of me senior in HS year taken away was awful, I can\u2019t imagine having my entire college senior year taken away. I really wish they\u2019d reconsider and bring the seniors back for your last semester. It was a money based decision 100%. They didn\u2019t take into consideration your mental wellbeing whatsoever. Seniors should have their final semester on campus",
