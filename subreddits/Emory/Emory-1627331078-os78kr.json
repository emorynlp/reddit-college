  "text": "Hey! I'm an incoming graduate student this Fall and have recently realized that most of the parking decks are full. Specifically, I was hoping to get one close to the school of nursing. Starvine Deck is still available, but it looks kind of far from the nursing school? Anyone have advice on that deck, or any off campus parking options? Thanks in advance!",

Had a similar problem my first year in grad school, and they magically found me a parking pass. \n\nAlternatively, look into shuttle routes. There is (was?) park and ride at the North Dekalb mall, and I think a few other places as well. Good luck!",
