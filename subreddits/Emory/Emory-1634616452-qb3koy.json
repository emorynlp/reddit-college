I believe Emory considers both unweighted and weighted, so if you can get ur SAT up even to like a 1470, you'd be in a really good place\n\nMy advice is to submit bc it falls within the average range. They may think your score is below the range if you don't submit. Good luck!",

I heard that going ED improves your chances of admission, so would it better to stick with ED and submit the score, or go regular decision and retake the SAT?",

I do think ED has a higher acceptance rate (I believe 20ish% for ED 1 and 2 and like 9% for regular, but don't quote me on that)",
