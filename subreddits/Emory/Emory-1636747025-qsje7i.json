I am interested in  Economics and Public policy. Emory has a major called Public Policy Analysis. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to major in Econ and PPA. Also  how should i address this prompt?",

              "text": "Use your judgement.  If you can tie it to the area you are interested in learning about and you think mentioning that will add something (like are you trying to show that you want to go beyond  coursework in your area?) to your explanation, then you should find a way to make it work.  There is no formula of things to include and not to and this is YOUR essay and it is up to you to decide what might be worthwhile to add or elaborate on and how to do so.  Just provide a clear and compelling story or explanation.",
