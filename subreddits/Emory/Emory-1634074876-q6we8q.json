  "text": "As an ED1 applicant, is an ACT score of 32 good enough to submit? I am hoping to improve to atleast a 33 in the upcoming Oct 23 test. However, my ED application will be due prior to the score being released. I have a weighted GPA of 4.24, strong ECs and am out of state. I am applying for the dual degree business/engineering program. Thank you",
