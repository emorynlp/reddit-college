  "text": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at Emory, and I plan to double major in CS and maths. I've seen other posts talking about the CS recruitment, but I am still curious about other factors, such as:\n\n1. Academic atmosphere \n2. Research opportunities\n3. New trends within the department (new programs, growth in size, etc.)\n4. Focus of classes (more theoretical or practical)\n\nIs there any current CS students who have first-hand knowledge about these questions?\n\nThanks so much!",

      "text": "I am also an admitted student who is planning to major in CS. I was accepted to oxford college  (not accepted to the Atlanta campus).\n\n1. How difficult would it be to do a CS major esp considering that oxford college only offers 3 CS courses? Are the Atlanta campus people busy doing general education for freshman year and sophomore year or jumping straight into their major related courses?\n2.  I was thinking of trying to graduate from oxford college at a second semester sophomore to get to Atlanta campus faster and take the higher level CS courses, but would being an oxford admit result in having a to take a heck of a load of major requirement classes as a senior / junior? \n3. Does the CS department at Emory have like a \"de-prioritized and underfunded\" vibe? \n4. How helpful / important is being involved in clubs related to CS? I heard that there are not many clubs related to tech at Emory, and Oxford has none. \n\nThank you for your time!",

          "text": "Not from oxford but\n1. Definitely doable, especially if you consider graduating from oxford early. I would say ~60% of my freshman and sophomore classes are non-major related (I'm double majoring so ~20% of classes in my first 2 years are cs).\n\n2. Again, not from oxford, but I don't think it's much of a problem from what I've heard\n\n3. Yes - but I do think the school is trying a lot harder since my time here (e.g. making cs a department of its own and revamping the major) \n\n4. I definitely see more CS clubs on campus. I don't think it's necessary to join clubs for the purpose of recruiting as long as you show that you're doing side projects outside of class\n\nFeel free to pm",

I would say academic and research opportunities are definitely lacking, but as long as you are proactive and reach out to professors, you will definitely be able to find some. \n\n3. In terms of trends, I would say Emory CS is definitely getting stronger, and I do see more CS related clubs popping up around campus (search on linkedin or Facebook). You should also sign up for the cs major newsletter for related opportunities.\n\n4. Classes are definitely more theoretical than practical, especially with lower level classes\n\nFeel free to pm me",
