  "text": "I live at Clairmont and sometimes I get tired after being on campus all day, but I don\u2019t have time to go back to Clairmont and take a nap in my apartment. I have never seen anyone napping on campus, but I find this weird cause napping in public is usually a pretty common thing on college campuses. Anyone know of any good places to nap on campus where people won\u2019t look at me weird?",
