  "text": "Hey guys, I'm pretty new around here but I did have a brief question\n\nHave any of you had the Emory University Health Insurance (Aetna)? If so, can you give me some insight on how it is? Unfortunately, I've been dealing with some medical problems at home and need to follow up with some physicians in Atlanta. I'll be using this insurance to the maximum. Is it worth it and would expenses become too much?",
