  "text": "So this should totally happen some weekend in September. Since we have so few people I figured maybe we can just post prospective times and places. Emory Village? Josh, wanna organize?\n\nEDIT: Steady Hand's porch seems like a good place to meet for a bit. 1pm?\n\n**EDIT2: So tomorrow is SPC and WMRE's Block Party on eagle row. We should do something around campus next week on Wednesday or Thursday so those without cars can join. All in favor?!**",

And they can just bring their non-redditing friends as well and have something to do.\n\nHowever, if we do do it at Clairmont pool, I think it's better to do it on a weekday, like a Friday. Saturdays and Sundays are usually crowded with non-Emory locals with their children.\n\nBut, if Saturday is the best day then I think it should work out.",

It's where Octane used to be, right? But anyway, if we meet somewhere, I personally would like to meet somewhere a little bit cooler or somewhere with more seats? And we should also think about what we can do with a small number of people in case we wait for people to show up or we just don't have a good turnout rate.",

We could meet at a bar for team trivia... Though that would leave out people without cars who don't want to PM random redditors to get rides.",
