  "text": "I just checked for available rooms in all halls, but there is no single double room left. I didn't go to campus this whole year, so I don't have anyone to ask about this. What's really going on? Sophomores are required to live on campus, but why are there no available rooms left?\n\nBoth my roommate and I are assigned late selection times (tomorrow), and we are in a group of two. How does the waitlist system work, and is it even possible to live on Fevans? :( \n\nThank you.",
