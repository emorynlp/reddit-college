  "text": "In short, the midterm is coming up. The class structure now is basically just an email after class summarizing the material and asking some questions, and some online quizzes. The majority of the grade is still two \"midterms.\"\n\nIs there anything to pay attention for while studying for the midterm? Are the emails extremely important? Is there anything he focuses on a lot, like for example, the experimental procedures? Or should I just study literally everything in my notes and the handouts?",

      "text": "Hi! I took his class a couple years ago and got a 100 on the midterm and an A in the class. I would make sure to really understand all the anatomy stuff and then also make sure to answer/study the 5 questions for all the studies he gives you. It might seem excessive but I don't know how I would have made it through the class without it. And make sure to plan your 1 page handout really well if he is still letting you bring those. I would say to not try to include everything on the handout, just the stuff that you have the most trouble with. And ask him questions! He is really good about explaining stuff if you are struggling, you just have to know what you need help with ahead of time. Good luck!",

          "text": "Thanks for the suggestions. I actually have been doing the 5 questions for most of the studies because I suspected it would be important on the midterm (so my suspicions were correct). For some reason, Prof Edwards is doing the midterm online this year even though we're having in-person classes. Not complaining though!",

      "text": "Go over the studies (memorize them-I assume his class is still cold call mediated coverage of very specific research case studies and data that highlight key concepts) but UNDERSTAND them and what concepts were highlighted because the tests are usually those same studies but with a parameter or more changed and you have to predict whether that would and how it would change the outcomes.  I don't even think a single question was detached from a case study (as in very few free standing questions on definitions/basic concepts). I think it was like 25 questions MMC no partial.\n\nEdit: Above poster basically just reminded me that there WAS some labelling type of questions. These could be freebies if you just go over that",

      "text": "I took one of his classes online and even though it\u2019s open note online, writing notes during lecture is definitely not enough to get an A. I made a study guide answering the 5 questions for each study and a separate study guide for emails. Sometimes his emails overlap with the 5 questions, but other times they don\u2019t. The 5 questions and emails force you to analyze and understand the studies in more depth, which I found to be really helpful in exams. I took two classes with him and got As on all my exams.",
