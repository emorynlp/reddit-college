      "text": "DeKalb Police enforce parking restrictions in the streets near Emory. Risky.\n\nEmory's area at N. DeKalb Mall had a security guard on duty for as long as the shuttles were running when I last used it; COVID changed everything so I'm not sure if this is still true. The bus ride to campus is free; the risk is if you have to stay later than the last bus. Slightly risky.",
