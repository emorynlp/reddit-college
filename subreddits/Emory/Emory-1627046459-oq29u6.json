  "text": "Hey I\u2019m going into my senior year and preparing to ED to Emory as it is currently my first choice but I just want to know about the nightlife there. An older friend of mine toured me around and said she goes out either with a large group or to a party 2-3 times a week and usually does something smaller 1-2 nights a week (so somewhere between 3-5 nights a week depending on workload) which sounds perfect for me. \n\nI\u2019m very social but I\u2019m not a super hard partier so I don\u2019t really like having parties 5 nights a week (my sister goes to Michigan where they party all night and all day and then grind work at any free opportunity and that sounds horrendous)\n\nJust wanted to get a second opinion on this especially bc my friend comes from a high school where huge parties happened multiple times every weekend.",

              "text": "Eh depends on major. Emory students tend to cluster in work very hard but have fun sometimes type of majors.  I imagine a lot more bschool, humanities, and non-quantitative social science majors end up with more time for parties and stuff.\n\n\nAre you doing an easier major that affords lots of time or planning on avoiding more challenging courses? Because even that 3-5 day combo you mention doesn't quite sound normal to me given what majors and classes many Emory students take.   Also seniors tend to make more time for that stuff regardless of major. You can always find something to do but having 3-5 days for smaller parties and larger ones sounds like a schedule that suggests that you may not be getting much out of the academic experience even if you make good grades.\n\nEdit: Nm you're film but still maybe use some of the gen ed requirements to take good but challenging professors that develop writing and argumentation skills and whatnot.  Use some of that extra time for academic and co-curricular exploration as well. Either way all of this is YOUR choice.  Even your sister at Michigan and her friends has a choice. Just because the party scene is available does not mean you have to fully engage it.  These schools are so big and have enough options and you have autonomy to do what you want and want there are multiple ways to use your time without being peer pressured into anything. \n\n If that life style your Michigan people had sounded horrendous, then simply don't do it (even if you were at Michigan, this applies). You should also not feel like you need to replicate your life style in high school.  Again, you could possibly get more out of Emory if you didn't.",

              "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman but the overwhelming consensus is that Emory is a very academic school so while parties are definitely existent it\u2019s like work very hard and play medium. I think like 27% or so of people are in frats which is a little on the lower side but higher than places like NYU because they do different things out there. I\u2019ve grown up around Duke and UNC Chapel Hill and it definitely does not match that vibe lol. Both of those schools are very good academically but their party scene is like the typical D1 school where they go really hard and Emory is nowhere close to that. You can get somewhat close to that if you go to Georgia Tech and attend their stuff.",

                  "text": "It doesn't have to do with how \"good\" places are academically so much as the distribution of students majors and whether there is a catalyst such as D1 sports. Carolina has a wide range of majors including some standard party pathway majors that get good subscription and Duke had made a scene out of D1 basketball and Greeklife.  Consider that Emory has no engineering school but has more people clustered in STEM than places with it and that is even if you don't account for the growth of QTM.   So being \"good\" hardly matters as much as the amount of students taking on the more rigorous options. \n\n  Some D3 liberal arts schools are known to have large drinking and party cultures for example probably because of less clustering into demanding majors and super GPA sensitive tracks (all at the same time).   Emory also doesn't give Latin honors based on GPAs so you get lots of these same people in already intensive majors trying an honors thesis and taking graduate level courses.  Basically Emory sort of designed its programs and recognition systems to be more academically oriented by not just rewarding high grades.",

You hang on to this ranking and prestige crap way too much.  If an Emory student is interested in that scene they have to apply, express interest, and make connections like all those folks from the better connected places.

What I was saying was true to the degree that when there is a lot of competition with a lot of good schools, it makes it harder to get some opportunities.
