  "text": "I took the exam on Friday afternoon and I haven't gotten anything on OPUS. I don't mind waiting a week for the result if it is supposed to take that long, I'm just stressing that I did something wrong. A ballpark estimate of how long it should take would be helpful! I want to make sure I have this all straightened out well before registration.",
