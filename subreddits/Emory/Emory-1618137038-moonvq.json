  "text": "Hi people, I was just wondering if there are so many Korean students. Like every time you walk over the university, you can see almost all the people are Korean or Asian?\n\nIf you're wondering why I'm asking about particularly Korean, it's because I live in korea and am just simply curious.",

This is calculated to be around 20% of the population.",
