It's not as advanced as MATH 211 (Advanced Calculus) but it's a little more advanced than MATH 111 (Calculus I). /s",

              "text": "PHYS 141 is different and is not connected to the major. PHYS 141/142 is algebra-based and satisfies the 1-year for professional schools (e.g., medical school) that need it. You can minor in physics with PHYS 141/142 surprisingly but you'd still need the background in calculus and PHYS 253.\n\nPHYS 151/152 is calculus-based and is required for the major. So take this if you plan on majoring in physics. This also satisfies the 1-year physics requirement for things like medical school, but many people find it harder than algebra-based. For others, they absolutely cannot fathom studying physics without calculus so this makes sense to them.\n\nYou don't need PHYS 141/142 to take 151/152. You just need Calculus I (prerequisite) and II (corequisite).",
