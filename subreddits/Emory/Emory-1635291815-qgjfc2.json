  "text": "hey so basically i'm a freshman and i have early registration. i signed up for all my classes except fsem because they're all listed as closed on opus. my advisor told me to email the prof for permission to take the class and then he'd manually add me to it. i emailed the prof on friday and still haven't gotten a response. it's not that urgent bc since it's a freshman class it won't get filled up or anything for a while\u2026but i just wanna know how long i should wait before sending another email following up. ty!!!",
