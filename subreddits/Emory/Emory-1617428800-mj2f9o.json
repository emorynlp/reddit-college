If you're a freshman and you want to eat at the dining hall, it's completely \"free\" (paid for via tuition lol) every single time. \n\nYou can even swipe in upperclassmen so that they can eat for free too. It's a very common thing for upperclassmen to ask freshmen in line to the dining hall for a swipe-in.\n\nThe dining hall isn't 24 hours though. In fact, it closes pretty early (around 10 PM I think). \n\nThis is what it was like when I was a freshman in 2019. I'm not entirely sure what the DCT procedure is during the pandemic, but I'd imagine it's similar.",
