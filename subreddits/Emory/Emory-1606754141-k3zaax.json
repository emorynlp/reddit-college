  "text": "Ordered a few things that were supposed to get here before break and they didn't. I'm home now and the packages are at Emory. Anyone know if they'll keep them over break or still send them back to the sender? \n\nIf I have to drive back to Atlanta for these to keep them from being shipped back, that's gonna suck. \n\nThanks",
