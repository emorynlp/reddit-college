  "text": "Hey guys, last year as a freshman i got around 36k in total aid which allowed me to go - in that, i appealed for aid and got another 15k cus my mom lost her job during covid. now they removed the extra 15k and so i have 20k aid this year. my mom got a new job and we also refinanced our house so we don't have a mortgage anymore. my question is, should i appeal to get the 15k back? or do you think they could even lower my aid with all the new financial information? thanks!",
