  "text": "I'm a pre-med freshman and have been going through some mental health issues, so my grades have been slipping. I think my cumulative GPA after this semester will be about a 3.5. I know to get into med school, your GPA should be around 3.7+. Should I be looking to take some \"easy\" classes that'll boost my GPA next semester? If any of you guys have had a bad GPA as well, how easy/hard was it for you to recover and how did you do it (tips)?",

      "text": "My girlfriend is going to Med school next fall w/ a 3.4 from Ga Tech & a good MCAT score. You\u2019re fine. Schools expect first year students to have a slightly lower gpa as they adjust to college. There\u2019s a misconception that you need perfect grades to be a doctor. A 3.5 is a totally fine first year average. As long as you show an upward trend in your GPA, you\u2019re more than fine. \n\nStill a lot is riding on the MCAT, so study well in a year or two. No need to be worried. If I had a tip, I\u2019d tell you to consider summer classes (especially a study abroad) that fulfill your requirements- as you typically have a lower work load or (in the case of study abroad classes) they\u2019re just easier on average. It\u2019s a good way to increase your GPA while staying on track (plus the reqs you fulfill in the summer will put you ahead and make fall classes easier).",

              "text": "If you are coming from a top tier school, try to have in the 5 teens (like 512 or 513+).  I think they expect to see a higher MCAT more so than anything if you come from a selective school because they expect you to already test well and they need a signal that the STEM courses YOU took were actually more rigorous than if you went elsewhere such that your MCAT is higher across a bigger range of GPAs.  Note that your 3.5 is fine(you did NOT have a \"bad semester\" unless you maybe got a C in one of the STEMs I guess. Even then...) and most people improve quite a bit.  Take GOOD professors for cores and MCAT relevant classes (I am not talking human phys. Talking more like your cell, genetics, immunology, NBB 301 if applicable), do the best you can, and angle to get a rec. letter from them and remember that these calibre professors look for interest in learning and student development more so than being at or near the top of their class(like someone like a Weinschenk will really go to bat for a fighter that improves and shows they worked hard between two semesters with him even if both semesters were in the B range. He knows his class is a challenge to most).\n\n  Do not panic and start watering down these courses to quickly enhance your GPA. Use easier gen. eds to balance out the core STEMs with those types of professors or maybe even pad the STEM GPA with easier biol classes like biol 241 or something.  But do keep the rigor of those core courses relevant for MCAT prep.  Don't handicap yourself in that department.\n\nYou should ask Emory for its data but I think near peers like VU and WUSTL lead to the same conclusion that I an u/LostWindSpirit have: \nWUSTL:https://prehealth.wustl.edu/matriculation-acceptance-rates\nVU:https://www.vanderbilt.edu/hpao/documents/2020_Annual_Report.pdf\n*Notice the \"jump\" in success of WUSTL students with a 90ish% MCAT+ (like 513-514) that have a 3.4-3.6 (likely mostly in the 3.5s) BCPM GPAs vs. the 3.2-3.4 range.  IF you applied with your current GPA and hit that 5 teens range, you'd have a great shot getting in somewhere as long as you interview well enough.\n\nMost places seem to wanna cherrypick based upon the high MCAT scores that tend to come out of selectives, so if you can have nicely in the 90th percentiles and above a 3.6, you should be competitive for most schools (and the goal is simply to get into a U.S. medical school as most train well enough to get you where you need to go). Do as well as you can grade wise (keep this up/do a little better if you can), but don't do anything that puts you at an MCAT disadvantage (I've seen people weaken their med. school prospects by having a high/3.8+ GPA and then kind of bombing their first MCAT.  Remember that they see ALL the scores.  They'll think a weak MCAT from an Emory student is weird and wonder if you took the academics or your first test seriously which most successful applicants from this tier of school did. Don't make yourself stand out from the pool of students applying from the \"Emories\" in a negative way.)",

A 3.6+ with a good MCAT score is fine too tbh.\n\nMaybe considering taking easier classes if you had issues this semester to adjust better? Or maybe a lighter workload would help? I think good professors are more important though personally, but yeah, it\u2019s a lot more relaxing when a class is easy.\n\nHope you\u2019re able to recover from whatever you\u2019re going through OP and improve your grades.

          "text": "They should maybe take easier gen. eds to help their cumulative GPA, but they should keep rigorous(as in an MCAT relevant type of way) STEM professors for the core pre-med courses.  They can eventually look for a few \"easy\" non-core STEMs to pad the GPA, but I think with the cores at Emory, it seems like having a professor with relevant rigor vs. a more mediocre/easier professor seems to explain a lot of MCAT scores. And more people learn how to study and balance the schedule in later years to handle those courses and perform well.  Ideally what happens is that you take someone like a Weinschenk, Bing, Spell, Eisen, whoever runs a decently rigorous core or relevant of intermediate, get a B+ or higher, get their attention/show that you worked hard or were interested in the material throughout the course, and then are able to ask for rec. letters.\n\n\nY'all need to remember that y'all will need great rec. letters! And often the best professors that aren't easy write the best support letters and not for only those who make an A/A-.  Easy professors know they are easy and will then cherrypick only among As  so folks should be careful.",
