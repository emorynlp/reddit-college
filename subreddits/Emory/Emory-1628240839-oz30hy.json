      "text": "You can do whatever you want!  However, what do you mean by recommended not to?  If you can skip it, then probably don't take it as it'll waste your time (again, med. schools will be just as impressed with an A/A- in bio 142 and some of the easier med. related upper division bios which don't really build off of general bio.  Give up bio 141 and have a fun class there instead if you have AP/IB/A-level/dual enrollment) and may even be riskier grade wise than you expect (no way it'll be like Fall 2020 which was a complete joke, and wasn't even particularly challenging with De Roode because of online/Covid).  If it was because you were recommended not to double in chem and biol given your background or ECCP completion times, then maybe you shouldn't take it and should take chem first. However, you can do whatever you feel like doing whether it is a good decision or not.  Just don't expect to get much from biol 141 with the current teacher line-up and expect it to be harder than last year.",

I don't know about Oxford's placement process but if it was based on OCCP completion or some other process that guages background and it determined you'd struggle in it or something, maybe listen to the recommendation. If it was going off of very little evidence, then ignore it and take it I guess.",

                      "text": "I mean if your HS was rigorous and you have exposure to rigorous STEM courses then you can probably handle chem and bio together because if that is actually all they had to say, then it seems kind of vague.  You should make your own decision here.  If you thought your HS was easy to do well and have limited experience with sort of high level STEM courses, then proceed with caution because Oxford will work you hard in biology especially.  And a lot of the chem 150 classes are pretty much flipped on both campuses so you won't be getting much in the way of comforting lectures and it'll be explicitly about learning (like reading, going over videos, etc) most things outside of class and then practicing a lot in and outside of those class sessions. This requires a lot of independence, and could be a challenging way to learn if you have little prior or recent experience in the areas.  But if you actually do have solid exposure or are willing to work with or embrace all of this, you may be fine.  Just don't expect a cakewalk.",
