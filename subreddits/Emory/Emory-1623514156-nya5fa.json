  "text": "In order to gain a better understanding of the problems patients and physicians face with nebulizer use and administration, we have created surveys asking specific questions regarding their personal experiences. We hope to find a number of people who are willing to be further interviewed. The surveys are linked below:\n\n# [Physician Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsYb8xORbjU8CyqBrzFch52DU5R8VmjuOKaTLut8rf5c6xzw/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n# [Patient/User Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchHH8LxnZCbh69Dt5Yhw-EsACoZuLVOCAe4aB9i4dGMRbvNA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nThank you in advance to those who respond!",
