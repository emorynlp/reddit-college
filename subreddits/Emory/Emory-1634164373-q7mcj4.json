If a S. Dekalb shuttle still exists then it also goes by Decatur Station (though I think you have to pull the stop signal for it).",

      "text": "Emory/cliff shuttles:\nCctma is Decatur station, others mentioned south dekalb\u2026 that route is going the same general route as cctma and I think cctma is more frequent (at least it used to be). These routes are commuter based so I\u2019m not positive about late hours or weekend service. Check the cliff website\n\nMarta: check their website, but as someone mentioned a route goes to Lindbergh station\nRoute 6(I think it\u2019s 6 don\u2019t quote me) goes to Edgewood/candler park and it\u2019s supposedly one of the most reliable routes in metro atlanta. \n\nPersonally, even tho Marta has gotten better in recent years, I would take cliff> Marta especially if I needed to be somewhere quickly and on time. \n\nAlso, be aware that all of these routes would suck during rush hour: cctma (because of Clairmont/n Decatur intersection, Marta 6 and other routes (because of briarcliff road)",

          "text": "36 is their friend if they wanna get to the financial districts fast and they can just go kind of right outside of the Emory marble gate thing (near Glynn memorial) to catch that.  Route doesn't have the most awful (sometimes the highlands area can get rough though) traffic and is somewhat similar to Georgia Tech's (except it doesn't go through Clifton).  Goes to midtown station as its in town destination and Decatur station as its \"suburban\" destination.  The first is a direct shot to midtown (and you can take Gold or Red to the Buckhead area and others to downtown from that station) and the other gets you downtown pretty quickly via rail.\n\nI'm one of its biggest fans and  I rarely saw Emory students try it mainly because so many of us were sold on the 6 (I remember hearing about the damned 6 way too much when I moved in back in pre-historic times) which to me is a very round-a-bout way to get to \"fun\". Even in the suburban context, I think 36 now has the edge because that area near Church Street and Scott/Lawrenceville Highway has been well developed with the Walmart (not its biggest fan but if I'm being cheap...hey) and all the other other restaurants and shops (and I think a Whole foods or Sprouts over there.  To me this beats Briarcliff's closed down wholefoods and the associated shops in the area.  Also along Church-street the Indian market and restaurant area begins! Freaking love that area as a suburban area close to Emory) up there and of course it passes the Clairmont intersection with the Publix.",
