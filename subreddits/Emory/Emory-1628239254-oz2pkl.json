  "text": "I'm a freshman planning on my first year schedule, I knew that math112Z is for the students with IB/AP credits, but is there other difference beyond that?\n(I have IB math credits, but math112Z has a little conflict with my other courses,  so I'm deciding on whether to take math112 instead)\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "They probably aren't very different in math because it doesn't care so much for undergrad teaching vs. Some other STEM depts at Emory.  Typically a z indicates that it is trying to train freshmen who may go on to major in math or something quantitative so they may review some content from the foundational course (math 111 calc. AB) but then go on to expose you to more complex problems or theory than the standard course.  However this one has the same instructors for standard and 112z and I doubt that person would vary much of what they do in 112z vs. 112 except maybe at the beginning.  The advantage of z is community I suppose.\n\n Having those from the same cohort can breed intellectual and social community but based upon the material I've seen from this person's past 112-z, the content and problem types are nothing exciting or different so you won't miss much on that front.",
