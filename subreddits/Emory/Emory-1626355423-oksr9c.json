  "text": "Hey guys I am an incoming freshman on the Oxford campus and I couldn\u2019t find an active Oxford subreddit so I figured posting here would be fine. I just got my housing assignments and got assigned to Bonnell Hall in the JRC. Does anybody know anything about Bonnell? Is it nice? I heard the JRC is moldy in general but the water pressure is nice; is that true? Literally any knowledge about my hall or the building would be appreciated. \n\nAlso, I got my roommate assignment and I\u2019d like to contact them but I can\u2019t find them on any social media. Is there an Emory platform that I can reach out to them on or will this be a move-in face-reveal type situation for us? Thanks!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know anything about Bonnell in the JRC but I do know that there is a Oxford Facebook group and a class of 25 insta page so you might be able to find your roommate by looking at the members on there if you haven\u2019t already. Also Idk if I have the power to add you but there is a Oxford \u201825 group me that has more info about the dorms as well as second year students who can answer questions I think the link to join is also in that Facebook group",

      "text": "In the JRC, more than the hall it depends on the floor you\u2019re at. Bonnell is pretty nice though. If you\u2019re in top Bonnell, it\u2019s a guys only floor and is pretty okay (had a couple of friends there last year and it wasn\u2019t bad). The mold is mostly fixed now though since they repaired everything and got new dehumidifiers so I wouldn\u2019t worry about that.",
