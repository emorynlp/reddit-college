  "text": "Hey guys I\u2019m a rising sophomore thinking of double majoring in AMS and bio on the premed track. My schedule for next semester is pretty hard atm but is it doable? Also can I fit math 250 in this schedule (how difficult is it) and is it worth it to take physics 151 instead of 141? I qualified for AP CS credit but already used 12 credits, so I have some experience in CS. \n\n19 credits: \n\nMath 211 (Multi variable calculus)\n\nPSYC 111 or Easy HSC/HAP or Math 250\n\nCS 170\n\nChem 203 + lab \n\nPhys 141 + lab",

      "text": "Something's gotta give. Two STEM lectures+labs are okay by themselves, but CS 170 is a project-based class with weekly quizzes. If you have to add MATH 211 to that, well, that depends on how much you love math.\n\nThis reminds me of my previous schedule with BIOL/CHEM, CS 171, CS 224, and QTM. Not worth it. If it were up to me, I'd save physics for the summer or later and take something more relaxing. If your CS AP credit was Java-heavy, should have skipped CS 170.\n\nThis schedule is doable if you have the right mindset to do well in all of them, but worth it? Nah.\n\nI'm familiar with full courseloads loaded with STEM and/or humanities. 19 last fall, 22 last spring, 22 this fall. Nobody is really going to care if you overload, I only did it because I want to be done with undergrad. What matters is that you do well. Enjoy your time in college instead.",

      "text": "Consider moving physics. I'm willing to bet you have to compromise on professor quality and rigor per course with that schedule (like don't miss out on Weinschenk for 203/204 if you don't have to. That's an Emory STEM/pre-med experience hallmark!). Also do NOT expect STEM courses to feel like the Covid versions. Many of the standard pre-health cores will be much more intensive than the more relaxed freshman cores you took last year.  \n\nSome of that schedule will need to give for sure. I almost think either CS 170 or math 211 should have been done during Covid when we you were taking the less intensive versions of gchem and gbiol but oh well.  Is there no way that 211 could be moved to spring and something funner or less intensive than  it.  Now if you are open to not being pre-med, have at it but do expect to have to hella manage your time and make social life sacrifices.  \n\nNo matter who you take for these, the in person versions will be at \"full power\"(like even if you have Heemstra for whatever reason for 203, his pre-Covid exams are on another level vs. Covid. Same with Weinschenk. Gchem style learning and study will not suffice and the exams are the overwhelming majority of your grade so there is much less grace and cushion. You have to perform). I mean I am all for meaningfully rigorous in class experiences and schedules but you don't wanna risk being miserable when campus social life and potential development outside of the classroom  will likely be near optimal this upcoming fall. You don't wanna miss out on that. Rearrange your schedule so that maybe you can take top professors for key courses on the pre-med track and the AMS track,  then maybe choose 1 from each to kick to the curb completely (like physics and 211 or physics and 170, something) and leave the schedule or sub in a single course that is just fun.",

      "text": "I have taken CS 171, let me just say that it's not an easy class and it will require more hours per week than you think (I used to do around \\~20 hours weekly to finish quizzes + assignments). I came in with experience in CS as well, having taken a programming class at UC Berkeley and so on. If you really like CS, but as a hobby, I would take the 1 credit hour python class that is offered, it should be easier (Please make sure as I'm not that familiar with the class).",
