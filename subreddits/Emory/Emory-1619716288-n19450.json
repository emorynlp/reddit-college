  "text": "Hello,\n\nI got into both Lehigh and Emory for a 2025 graduation. However, as both are not CS powerhouse schools, I can not figure out which to go to. I am seeing so many different things about Emory. It's good, it's bad, etc etc. So like, in a modern opinion, as I see some expansion is going on , what would you guys honestly say about Emory CS and would you think it is better than Lehigh? I care about understanding code enough to be employable, but I am also willing to put work outside class as I have found interest in the topic. I just want to make sure I know what I am truly getting into because everything seems different. Emory's community also seems like something I would enjoy more than Lehigh.",

      "text": "If the prices are similar I'd recommend going to Emory.  Usually I am more nuanced but it seems you prefer it and there are lots of oppurtunities to leverage skills in CS (BTW, most departments in CS are mediocre as only a few schools have heavily invested in those programs likely due to demand at those places and fate. And sometimes being a \"powerhouse\" only means that it is a research powerhouse.  There are some unknown LACs that I discovered at a High Performance Computing bootcamp at UIUC that pretty much ran the program and a bunch of other stuff in that area.  Certainly these small colleges weren't \"power houses\". It's a field where the course work simply needs to be \"good enough\" to serve as a foundation for application and the involvement of undergraduates in stuff like this is more than sufficient: [https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazon-announces-2020-alexa-prize-winner-emory-university](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazon-announces-2020-alexa-prize-winner-emory-university) This indicates that those who take their education seriously are more than fine!  Plus this also suggests that faculty are actively mentoring and pulling undergraduates into these oppurtunities when they really don't have to at all) in the Atlanta area.\n\nIt looks like the students (grad and undergrad) are pretty damned good to me and are more than managing with whatever they are learning:  [http://www.cs.emory.edu/events/news/#news280](http://www.cs.emory.edu/events/news/#news280)\n\nSo if it is \"bad\", it isn't hindering these people from winning contests, fellowships, etc.  Looks like it very much is what you make of it.  If you just wanna come take some classes and not participate in any of those opps to develop skills, make a personal project, or find a research project, then CS wasn't going to be that great anywhere.  I mean here is an article in the Stanford Daily about the woes of like the most prestigious UG CS program: [https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/19/cs-in-crisis-is-stanford-doing-enough-to-respond-to-capacity-and-inclusion-challenges/](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/19/cs-in-crisis-is-stanford-doing-enough-to-respond-to-capacity-and-inclusion-challenges/)\n\nSo even they are capable of experiencing and recognizing big problems with their relatively amazing(allegedly) program.",

          "text": "Very interesting point about CS school departments. I def want to enjoy the college experience while also seriously focusing on CS, and that is why I am leaning towards Emory. It seriously seems like the program is gaining funding and having an influx of great students to be around (as shown by that link you sent me.) It makes me feel better.\n\nI am just afraid of the classes being \"archaic\" as some have stated in past posts. Do you have any knowledge of this, are the classes they teach outdated? Dude, I am just honestly terrified of not knowing enough to work - but I tend to overthink. Do you do CS, or know anyone who does it, and can give some information about the classes? It honestly seems like everyone here is pre-med or business and I can't find much people to ask LMAO. Thanks for the great insight btw",

              "text": "Most CS UG programs (much like math and physics) are not on the up and up in terms of coursework. You need to get involved in research and take on experiential oppurtunities to get exposed to the latest programs and their applications. You may even wanna consider some QTM courses to see applications. What is more important than them being \"modern\" is that they challenge you to understand and be creative in solving problems and not just memorizing the basic types of programming problems.  You also need to become nimble/adaptable enough to learn new languages and applications.  You can choose professors and courses that develop those aspects, but really what you do outside is how you get more exposure.\n\nAnd the thing about pre-med and pre-business isn't true if you are talking about Emory. It may be true for people on this or any forum. Those paths are so beaten and cookie cutter for the most part that people have overlapping experiences and it is much easier to discuss them.  A CS or other majors outside of the rare powerhouse schools are probably doing their own thing and since they are relatively low risks pathways, there is no reason to panic or constantly discuss how to get through them (like pre-meds have to constantly worry about grades and the MCAT. Pre-business people are likely to constantly worry about grades and internships. CS and other majors go into far more diverse career paths and don't have as much unifying concerns other than becoming good enough for their entry level job)",

          "text": "Why are we bringing \"prestige\" into a conversation about computer science?  Either they can get good at programming and be able to apply and gain experience in it in whatever context or they can't.  They can theoretically do that basically anywhere.  Emory to me seems like a better choice because a) they like it and b) Atlanta is kind of a popping place now-a-days to apply those skills on and especially off-campus (and it may just be a more interesting place for many people generally).  There are many other ways to do this(recommend Emory) than to poo poo on someone for considering a less \"prestigious\" school.",
