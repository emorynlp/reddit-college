  "text": "Hi I have a couple questions about foreign languages and math classes. What is the easiest foreign language? I heard Italian 101 was pretty light but I also heard they made the curriculum harder recently? I took 4 years of latin in high school, but I'm not looking to continue latin (I want to take a language related to latin like Italian or Spanish). Also, how do math 250 (foundations of mathematics), math 212 (differential equations), and math 315 (numerical analysis) compare to each other in terms of difficulty?",
