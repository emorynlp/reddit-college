  "text": "I'm trying to assess whether I would be happy here since it's a big commitment to ED\n\n1. Do people go out to downtown Atlanta pretty often (like the weekends)?\n2. Do you guys have a lot of social interaction with the kids at Georgia Tech? A close friend of mine wants to go there\n3. How's the social life? I never partied in high school but I definitely want to try it out. I don't want to party all the time though lol\n\n4. Is there a lot of activities to do on campus? Do you guys get bored?\n\ncoming from a pre-med by the way",

      "text": "1. Maybe not downtown specifically, but a lot of people go out into the city to do things on weekends.\n\n2. Aside from crashing parties, not really. But if you want to see your friend at Tech it won\u2019t be impossible. There\u2019s a shuttle that runs from Emory to Tech (although it\u2019s not always in service).\n\n3. The people here are nice. Most aren\u2019t hardcore partiers. Emory parties usually aren\u2019t that good, but there are a lot of colleges nearby that you can go to for that. Based on your avatar I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a girl, so it\u2019ll be super easy for you to get into frat parties lol. \n\n4. There\u2019s stuff to do on campus. We have food trucks giving out free stuff pretty often, and of course there\u2019s Dooley After Dark. Joining clubs helps you find fun things as well. I don\u2019t get bored too often, but I\u2019m not a super social person so take that with a grain of salt.",

      "text": "1. There are certainly opportunities to get off campus & visit other parts of Atlanta. As some have stated, this is a lot easier to do if you have your own car or have a friend with a car, but it\u2019s not impossible. Emory has shuttles to GT/Downtown, or you can always get an Uber/Lyft and share with friends. (Keep in mind that freshman aren\u2019t allowed cars, but there are some exceptions.)\n\n2. I think this is very dependent on your friend group/the activities that you do at Emory. There\u2019s not a whole lot of school-organized Emory/GT events, but in different clubs/sports/activities, we often held mixers with our GT counterparts. I wouldn\u2019t expect it, but know that it happens. \n\n3. Not to sound like a broken record, but it really does depend on what you do at Emory and who you hang out with. If you\u2019re interested in partying, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities either through frats, club mixers, going out to clubs/bars, or attending parties at other schools. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to you how much partying you want to do, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily characterize Emory as a \u201cparty school.\u201d \n\n4. There are activities on campus that can fill up your time outside of class. Some of them are hosted by the school such as Dooley after Dark, Wonderful Wednesday\u2019s, Farmers Market, Homecoming, etc. Others you\u2019ll have to seek out on your own such as a club or sport, which will add meetings, practices, events, and/or tournaments to your weeks/weekends. You can also utilize the gym or field space if you\u2019re into athletics/working out. But of course, there will inevitably be times when you\u2019re bored or you need to prioritize studying/doing work outside of class.",

I don\u2019t know anyone who goes to downtown or GT often. Occasionally, they do go, but it\u2019s definitely not often. If you have a car, then that\u2019s a different situation.\n\nAs for social life, I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty chill and relaxed. Everyone is friendly! There are parties here and there but you\u2019ll have to look for them.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say there are a lot of activities here on campus, but it\u2019s definitely there. We have Dooley After Dark which hosts weekly movie nights and food trucks  on Saturday. Most people join clubs and spend their time doing that. It does get a little boring sometimes, but that\u2019s just life.",
