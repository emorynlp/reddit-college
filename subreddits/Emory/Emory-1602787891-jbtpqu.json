Fenves said in their email that the current plan is to bring everybody back in the summer/fall, and [Fauci seems to think that mid to late 2021 is the likely time frame for \"normal\".](https://www.cnet.com/news/dr-anthony-fauci-predicts-life-in-us-might-not-get-back-to-normal-until-late-2021/)\n\nOn the off-chance that there is no vaccine and we are still online, I would just have to suck it up and come back I guess. I do have to get my degree after all. I have an appointment with my OUE advisor to discuss possible academic ramifications but I just wanted to see if others were feeling the same way.",

              "text": "Aren't you pretty far along for a sophomore anyway?  I think you could afford to take a semester off.  If I remember correctly, QTM is included in your majors/minors.  I don't blame you for wanting to preserve quality learning and experiences as much as possible.  It is a major that is training oriented after all so getting stuff out of the coursework is more helpful than not (some majors can merely be \"fill in the blank\" degrees because most students in them don't plan to be employed or continue in said fields. They are just sort of a stepping stone to professional school or a job far outside of the field that merely requires that folks have a bachelors and a decent GPA).  I could be thinking of a suprawalurus or something like that.  EIther way, if I am close to being correct, I definitely don't blame you (plus QTM is the one with all the certificates and other oppurtunities that are probably much better in person. You could go off a semester and teach yourself some stuff or find some paid or unpaid opp).",
