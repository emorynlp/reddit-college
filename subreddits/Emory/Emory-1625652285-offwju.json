  "text": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman, and I was playing around with the classes and what classes I would like to take. I am a little worried this may be one too many classes, even though it looks pretty spread out. Could anyone comment on the workload. Obviously, it's not going to be easy, but is it going to be unnecessarily difficult?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrw7xrvrqr971.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b2e7305c5742f0aeeb3762c4e5123266d98c86\n\nThe HIST 190 is the Churchill and Orwell class with Patrick Allitt (off topic question - How is this seminar? I am deciding between these and a few others - CL 190 with Eric Varner, CPLT 190 with Bracht Branham, POLS 190 with Thomas Lancaster and MUS 190 with Elena Cholakova).\n\nThanks in advance!",

                              "text": "Eh...Soria's lab doesn't quite work like standard chem labs so don't worry about that issue.  Figure out that evening bio lab on your own though.  I personally (when doing 221-Z and bio 141 together) didn't find the evening lab that horrible.  I'd pretty much just do a dinner and then go to it.  On rough parts of the semester with multiple assignments or exams, it technically gave more time throughout today to finish cramming or putting finishing touches on a pre-lab assignment if it came to that because if it was in the middle of the day (2:30-5:30 or whatever), the times running up to it would usually be busy with other classes, office hours, etc right before it.\n\nBut just begin to think about how you'll use your \"free time\" outside of class and make that decision.  Your courses will be at least a tad rigorous and it's likely you'll wanna use various learning resources and whatnot in addition to wanting to just hang out, find clubs, etc.\n\n\\*I only slightly disagree with a poster below.  Your schedule is more like 2.3 STEMs (because bio lab alone isn't that intensive and is manageable as long as you don't forget about it).  Math 112-Z with that professor from what I see from the old course websites available:[http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/\\~ma112z02/index.html](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ma112z02/index.html)\n\nDoesn't look like that are trying to really challenge students.  Looks like some pretty standard problem types that likely mirror practice problems.  Soria's lecture is the one that will be pretty intellectually demanding as I've explained in other threads. Other than that, I don't think your schedule is too special/concerning (Rodl's math 112 and bio lab are basically \"just do what the instructors say and you'll be fine\" type of courses. They aren't asking for much independent or creative thinking tbh,  Bio has some lite version of that when you get to the worms or whatever).  I just think many aren't used to seeing freshman have 3 STEM related things in their schedule, especially a calc. course (which may honestly be less work than QTM 100 which has a lab and separate lab HW).  If this was Oxford, we'd probably be having a different discussion about the bio lab and math 112.  I can appreciate the history seminar and philosophy being there(as balances/different ways of thinking), but you don't need both.  Either way, you'll have a demanding enough schedule with either or both and you'll learn how to think in different ways this semester which is a good thing.\n\n  \nEdit:  I looked up the history seminar you'd be in.  It doesn't have a high workload in terms of the number of things but Dr. Allitt is a top tier instructor who will demand serious participation in class and excellence on the 3 papers.  Great connection to make, and great teacher, but keep up with readings and be able to contribute in class.",

      "text": "Welcome to Emory! My advice: those 8:30 am classes are going to be rough, especially with how spaced apart your philosophy class is to them (I know a lot of high schools start early, but for some reason early college classes just feel 1000x crappier). I\u2019ve never taken those other seminars, but if any of them are at a later time (and the professors don\u2019t have very bad reviews on ratemyprofessor), I would take those instead. You have good times for the labs and I wouldn\u2019t risk switching unless you\u2019re sure you can get into another early lab - I had night labs and they SUCKED because of how late it was. The only con is having them one day before/after the other, since that means their tests will be really close to each other (just a studying logistic). \n\nIn terms of workload, I would try them out first during add-drop-swap week so you can suss out what each will expect from you and what you can reasonably handle. Just by eyeing your schedule, I would drop one of the classes just because you\u2019ve got two labs and chem and calc. You don\u2019t have to take a seminar your first semester, that can be pushed to the second. Philosophy can serve as a nice \u201cbreak\u201d from the science/math courses (I say break in quotations cause I mean more in that it\u2019s a different type of material, not that it will be easier). Unless you\u2019re really into math/science, having straight STEM coursework with no other diversity is going to be rough. The only reason I think the seminar would be the better drop is cause of the time. Monday and Wednesdays will be much easier with just one class in the afternoon, giving you cushion time to rest/catch up with school work.",
