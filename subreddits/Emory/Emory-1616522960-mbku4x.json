  "text": "A new ramen spot just opened up up right next to the Atlanta campus! It\u2019s right across the McDonalds and Publix. Same plaza as Brew and Bird. I saw a sign that they needed some part timers so I thought I\u2019d share it here in case someone was looking for a job!\n\n\nEdit: Just finished eating there. Even if you don\u2019t need the job, definitely go check it out. The ramen there tastes super good! So does their bubble tea! Highly highly recommend. Always nice to support the smaller businesses during these hard times.",
