And are you struggling because content and course is overwhelming ONLY for you, or is it just a relatively low average course that may be scaled in the end?  Also, are there extrenuating circumstances?  I'm not saying this is fair, but some have played the incomplete card and then some politics with sympathetic Deans to maybe get a late withdrawal or straight up have grades removed.  Strange things happen at expensive private schools like Emory with regards to this stuff.",
