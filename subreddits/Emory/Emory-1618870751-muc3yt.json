I\u2019ve only heard of one BBA getting rejected. It\u2019s pretty competitive if you are coming from outside Emory though. I think its like 11% acceptance? Something in the teens.",

But it's absolutely doable to get those kinds of jobs without the MSBA. The MSBA is more technical and more geared towards Data Science or Senior Data Analyst roles, as those positions are starting to require MS at minimum. Do you see yourself coding in your work life? If so, you do need this program. If you would prefer to stay in Excel, you do not need this program.\n\nYou could do what some people did and apply to MSBA senior year, and if you don't land the FT job you want, you can go into MSBA 5th year and then try again.\n\nAlso, your own motivation and willing to work will stand out more than just having a degree. My job hired me cuz of my hackathon projects and projects i did for fun; the degree was just a plus for having an MS.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have more questions.",

              "text": "I did not do the QSS + BBA, so my take may not be 100% accurate.\n\nMy view of the QSS program is that it is better if you want the true statistical background and understanding of research problems. The MSBA did not require us to fully understand, but rather have an awareness of statistics and how it factored in.\n\nThe MSBA is different from the QSS in that the problems we solved were directly related to business. That gap can be hard for some people to shift to, particularly in how do we describe those insights in laymen terms to business people who need the summary in order to make decisions. In essence, the MSBA is much more applied.\n\nThe QSS department also only recently start doing Python classes as opposed to only R. The MSBA includes R, Python, Tableau, and SQL. There are BBA classes that cover Tableau and SQL, but not as intense. You can land analyst roles with both. Data science might be harder as those roles are starting to require MS at minimum, so the MSBA would be helpful there.\n\nIf you like coding, I would recommend supplementing your schedule with some CS classes to give you more advantages/boost your resume if you would like more technical roles.\n\nBonus, the MSBA will waive your GRE so you won't have to take it.\n\nAs for the person below saying the MSBA might be easier, they are definitely wrong lmao. I pulled many long nights for MSBA projects and exams. It's an MS program for a reason.\n\nI will add one more thing, my only regret is this program was not technical enough for me. If I could do it again, I might've waited and applied to an MSA instead that had a higher focus on engineering because I want to do MLE, but that's just me. Or if I could, I wouldve majored in CS in the first place.\n\nIf you have more specific questions, feel free to pm me.",
