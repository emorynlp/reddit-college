  "text": "I've tried looking around on the internet, but I haven't found much at all about the fitness center situation at Emory as the official website is not the best.\n\nAre non-athlete undergrads permitted to use WPEC for free? \n\nIs WPEC a good quality gym (with a good amount of cages, etc.)? \n\nWhat are WPEC's hours?\n\nIs it common for students to workout off-campus, and if they do, where do they go?",

If you're living at claremont then the saac has a gym but it is about 1/10 the size and quality of the woodpec. I think the woodpec is a pretty nice gym although it gets pretty crowded at the beginning of each semester and at peak hours.",

It\u2019s well-equipped, but can get a little crowded at peak times, especially at the beginning of each semester.\n\nEDIT: Not sure about the hours off the top of my head, but it\u2019s open relatively early/late.\n\nNot sure about off campus stuff.",
