      "text": "Unfortunately this probably isn't the right reddit - we're all broke college students too! Realistically, you can apply for federal work-study or try to apply for extra financial aid or external scholarships. \n\nI'm a little confused by \"refuse to pay\" though - can your parents not afford it, or are they completely refusing to fund your college? Dick move if they are, but you definitely could tell your financial aid officers that.",

          "text": "Well i\u2019ll have to explain our circumstances. So my parents invested money into real estate properties they hoped to sell for their retirement. Those assets are their retirement plan but since they\u2019re able to take from the assets at any given moment, the school won\u2019t count them as a retirement plan. This is why the school only offered us 13,000 in aid but my parents simply can\u2019t afford a quarter million dollars to pay for my college, especially when that money is gonna come from their only source of income when they retire. \u201cRefusing to pay\u201d was a poor choice of words on my part because they have been clear on how much they are willing to pay for. If anyone knows a really rich guy who wants to help me out just let me know!",
