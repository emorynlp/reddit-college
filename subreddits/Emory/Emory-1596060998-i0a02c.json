  "text": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman to Oxford. I had a few quick questions about classes if anyone has any insight...\n\n1). I took Spanish through most of high school but want to take some French in college. I don't have any exposure to French at all and so will start with French 101. This might be obvious but how difficult/easy is it for an absolute beginner?\n\n2). I have AP credit (5 on the exam) for AP chemistry, but I took it in my junior year of high school. As a bio major on the premed track, is it a good idea to use the credit and skip ahead to CHEM 202? Or should I take CHEM 150 for a better foundation?\n\n3). I also have AP credit for calculus (4 on the BC exam) from senior year and have no plans on pursuing any more than the required math for Bio/Premed. To the best of my knowledge that's QTM 100 and MATH 116 (life sciences calc). MATH 116 isn't offered at the oxford campus so I'd have to wait till at least my junior year to take it. If I use my credit for MATH 111/112, will it show up on my transcript/ will it be applicable for med school? And is it a good idea regardless?\n\n4). I also was curious on maybe taking Latin, but once again, I've never had any practice in it (my high school didn't offer it). Can I take Latin for HAL credit/ is it a good idea? \n\nThank you in advance for any help! Sorry it's so long!",

As for premed stuff I\u2019m pretty sure you only need math 111 so def use ap credit. Also, I\u2019m not entirely sure but most people choose to take chem 150 even though they have credit for it. Hope that helps!",

      "text": "I took Latin 101/102 last year and loved it but it is definitely not for everybody. The class is relatively easy if you put the time in and keep up with your work but those who didn't had to drop the class because it was too much. I personally did not take Latin in highschool but still got A's both semesters. And the class does fulfill the HAL credit. Only catch, Dr. Bayerle is on Sabbatical this semester and there is a grad student teaching all Latin classes at Oxford. Dr. Bayerle picked him himself and highly recommended him so I'm planning on taking Latin 201 with the grad student but do take that into consideration for yourself.",

      "text": "Your AP calculus credit will appear at the top of your transcript under a section titled \"Test Credits Applied Toward Associate of Arts Program\" as MATH\\_OX 111 and MATH\\_OX 112. While I would definitely talk to an advisor, it appears that most medical schools no longer require calculus at all and instead prefer statistics, which falls under QTM.\n\nAs far as chemistry goes, I don't think not taking CHEM 150 will be a killer if you feel that your chemistry skills are strong. I\u2019m not sure if you could take the OCCP and gauge your memory of chemistry or not, maybe you could email someone about that. With Emory's redesigned chemistry curriculum, there is one unit at the end that I do not think was covered on the AP chem exam, which included isomers (enantiomers, diastereomers, and RS configuration). Other than that, however, you won't be missing much.",
