      "text": "Hey guys, 19C here. I wish all of you recognize that you do have a right to feel this way and that it\u2019s completely ok to process all the internal and external storms at your own pace. I broke down the last semester of my senior year because I couldn\u2019t take any of it anymore; late nights editing a video, synthesizing paper topics, dreading 3 consecutive exams, being behind on a research project, relationship drama, etc. etc. I fought myself just to get out of bed, slap on a fake smile and fake energy for group projects. I would skip a class almost everyday. I ended up with basically no support system because I mistakenly thought most of my peers were vapid, superficial, achievement hunters. I felt no one was talking about stuff that actually mattered. Yet I scraped by and managed to walk at commencement and get that diploma though. \n\nBut I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say weekly CAPS/external therapy, walks in nature (Lullwater is healing), and being lucky in having understanding professors helped ease the sting a bit. Y\u2019all will make it out alive, I swear. If you have a support system where you get to be seen and heard authentically, even better. As dried up as the cliche is, you are indeed not alone, especially when the concept of college/Zoom U for everyone rn is a pathetic shell of its former self.",

      "text": "I'm doing fine but I do have a disclaimer.\n\nI already went through these issues in a condensed form by being in the military. If there's anything I got out of my experience there, it's managing stressful situations and building resilience. I am not bothered by things that most people complain about. Not only that, this is likely the reason why people who don't immediately go to college have a better ground to stand on in terms of resilience, military or not.\n\nPoint is, don't feel bad about being stressed. It's normal! Consider a gap year if you have to so that you can decompress. We are all built differently and we all handle stress differently, but I'm sure you all know already that life is going to be full of stresses. So every second you're not stressed is a lucky second, you need to recognize that in order to enjoy it. We need to stop finding things to complain about and find things to enjoy instead.\n\nHunt the good stuff, everyone.",
