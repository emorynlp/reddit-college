  "text": "I'm  a female high school senior who loves to program and plans to be a CS major.\n\nI have found zilch online about woman in Computer Science at Emory.  This is making me just a bit nervous,  so I'm hoping that there might be some students here that would be willing to share their experiences with the CS department.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!",
