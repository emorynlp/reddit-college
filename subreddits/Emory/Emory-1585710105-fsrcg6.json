  "text": "I\u2019m a current hs senior and am currently torn between committing to Emory with a decent merit scholarship, or committing to UVA, where I\u2019d get in-state tuition (prices are the same). I love Emory for its creative writing and public health departments, overall higher campus diversity, and great location. My biggest hesitation with Emory, however, is what I\u2019ve heard about the social atmosphere. \n\nTo put it plainly, I like to party. I partied in high school and would be disappointed if I didn\u2019t have that kind of experience in college. I also really like to be proud of my school. UVA has great parties, and tons of school spirit. I\u2019ve heard the opposite about Emory.\n\nWhat are your opinions on the social opportunities Emory provides? Are all the complaints about the social life true, and are my concerns legitimate?\n\nEdit: ok I should clarify, I am well-aware that Emory doesn\u2019t have a football team and the party culture would be very different from UVA\u2019s. I just wanted to assess what the Emory party scene is like and how many students participate in it. I don\u2019t care if parties are smaller than they\u2019d be at a D1 school, I knew that going into this. I worked my ass off in high school, there\u2019s nothing wrong with just wanting to party haha",

              "text": "I'm gonna be honest.   I don't know any school that exists where partying is not an option (except for those ultra elite STEM focused universities like: GT, MIT, Caltech, CMU, and Harvey Mudd, and even then, they would have some.  It wouldn't be like the party scenes you see in movies or anything, but they'd have their style of doing things that may be just as interesting and less stereotypical). And my opinion is that you'd kind of have to try to not or flat out not want to do it (and there are more who are like this than many schools for more of a party school reputation) at a place like Emory to be \"unable\" to do so.  I primarily did all mine through various C-mont parties, other college campuses in Atlanta, as well as nearby apartment parties right off of Emory's C-mont campus.  Night Clubs, if you get access, are also your friend.  Music festivals/seasonal events in Atlanta were my friends.  I just never had the problems a lot of people gripe about.  If I wanted to do something, I (and my friends) would go find it and participate and I also made sure to keep diverse friend groups so that I got exposed to a variety of socializing and/or partying scenes (definitely find someone that has ties to UGA.  I'll admit that every once and a while, being part of a college town type of scene on a game day or something can be very fun).  If you try to limit yourself to the Emory bubble as some seem to, you are more likely to be bored, and that just is what it is.\n\nAnd I would also note that all \"strong academic schools\" don't have the same strengths and can feel very different academically despite them being sort of a generic \"strong\".  Like class sizes, access to oppurtunities, etc can vary simply based on the size of the school or how the school has historically run things (like if you were coming into Emory as a STEM major, you may find out that its weeder course sections are MUCH smaller than even private peer institutions, let alone publics, and this does make a big difference in how the courses are delivered and student satisfaction with them. For example, Emory's STEM courses are as difficult or more difficult than some of these peer schools, but you rarely hear/read unsolicited complaints about their rigor or whatever because most feel that the teaching methods and resources give them a fair shot at succeeding).\n\nFor example, you said that you were interested in creative writing.   A much larger school may make you start with comparatively large intro. courses, or at most (even if small) be very generic (like you're learning the basics of writing papers or whatever), whereas a smaller school may get right to focusing on much more analysis (I decided to forgo my AP credit when I went and lucked up and ended up in a freshman writing requirement that had us use the Rare books library to do a couple of our assignments.So the instructor went out of their way to expose freshmen to primary source materials, and this has become a thing across a lot of Emory's freshman seminars in the humanities and social sciences too) or even given students more creative control earlier on.  Not to mention, I know a place like Emory's creative writing program would go much further to involve its students in the intellectual life of the department at much earlier stages in their career (like it has not become uncommon for certain professors to set SOPHOMORES up to be featured at major book festivals and whatnot. And usually they heavily push participation in campus readings by famous writers, and set up associated networking/dinners associated with those events that include undergrads, even younger ones).\n\nThe way \"strength\" manifests itself is just different and varies by the school.  Like with UVA, they are gonna clean Emory's clock in things like political science because even if political science instruction and course options (and EC/co-curricular options) are strong at Emory, UVa has a clear location and networking advantage that they have successfully leveraged.  Analogously, if one wanted to be something like a human health major or environmental science (this over-laps with public health issues a lot) major at Emory.  Not only do they have strong curricula, but you'll be in Atlanta, a center for dealing with these issues.\n\nI'm just saying this because I know most prospective students think about \"academic strength\" mostly in terms of rankings or some sort of vague notion of \"overall prestige\", but these rankings don't give much of a picture of what specific undergraduate programs (or even the overall academic ethos of a school) are like at even similar ranked schools.  They can just be very different.  Like Chicago and Yale are very different. Harvard and Stanford tend to be very different, and sometimes those differences end up mattering despite them all being extremely \"strong\".  And those are similar sized private schools.  A strong private school and a strong public school are likely to be vastly different.  It could be the curricula, or how well the schools/programs of interest leverage their location, a bunch of things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Either way, unless you have to have the \"movie perfect\" sort of party scene at your school choice all the time  vs. a more cerebral/academically oriented student body that finds time to party,(and may sample scenes and events off-campus) when they can (and with your academic interests, you should be able to balance and comfortably explore/access a social scene without as much sacrifice as some majors), Emory could still be viable.  I just don't recommend if you envision your party/social scene to mostly look like American Pie, Animal House, or any of those old movies like that.  I just remember having to try real hard to be bored and remain so....so I never blamed \"Emory\" for my boredom, even though I kind of get that many like the sports centered stuff because it gives a highly visible (and pre-organized...Emory students have this obsession with things, including \"fun\" being pre-organized or just coming to them instead of creating it) and obviously accessible socialization space/platform.  But even without all that, I thought it was easy to find fun trouble.  I think some who complain are just not creative or outgoing enough to do the same.  I would hope someone seriously into partying or whatever would not fall into that category, if you get what I am saying.  I mean, I don't even consider myself the party type and made whatever happen when I wanted.",

                      "text": "I'm not talking about the size of individual parties/events so much as the general ethos of the school.  Tech is big, of course it will have bigger parties.  Rather a similar % of Tech students always find it worth risking their time to go to any party/events vs. Emory or any non-Tech/STEM school student at similarly selective schools is a different question.  It's kind of like: due to size, a place like Tech will have bigger parties on the actual campus, but a higher % of Emory students will party (on campus, off-campus, wherever) and more frequently just due to the wider distribution of academic interests and demands on their time. It may end up being a wash in terms of the atmosphere due to that (like since Tech is bigger, you can probably be in a different world if you just find the party crowd).  But no doubt when key sports are in season, Tech isn't that a bad place to be if you wanna party or whatever. However,  None of these schools can match something like a UGA, and some of the more elite comprehensive public schools though (such as UVa).",

      "text": "Remember, you're probably looking at reddit posts for questions about social life. You're gonna have a biased sample. Take what you see on reddit with a grain of salt.\n\nFrat parties happen pretty much every weekend, and they're pretty big. But there's a good amount of exclusive events that'd you'd have to get involved in greek life to enjoy. If you're looking for on campus partying, just join greek life and you'll be fine. Off campus (i.e. bars, clubs, etc.) There's plenty to do. Mags (local bar) is a go-to nearly every weekend, and there are plenty of places kids take advantage of in Atlanta and is completely accessible outside of Greek Life. If you're still high and dry for not having a football party culture, you can always head over to GTech, but your mileage may vary.\n\nParties get pretty huge, almost everyone goes to them. It's also not that difficult to go to frat parties in comparison to a big D1 school if you're a male. I've heard of people at my local state school needing like 10:1 ratio to get into parties. Emory is very nice that a good ol' 1:1 will get you in. \n\nIf you want dages (darties, day ragers), Emory isn't really the place. Big parties are generally reserved for the weekend since almost all kids will be busy during the weekdays. In terms of school spirit, kids at Emory don't really have sport spirit. People are definitely proud of Emory, but not die hard proud. \n\nIf you're looking for a \"college experience\" of partying hard, going wild and all that, you'll definitely find it at emory. It'll also most definitely be on a completely different level than what you've experienced in high school, just don't expect it to be the only thing in your college experience. There'll be plenty of more nights in a library then in a frat house.",

This was kinda off putting for me at first because there was just nothing. But as soon as it opens up then there is typically a couple parties every weekend for a couple of weeks, and many are just open (like you can just walk in without knowing anyone, but you may need to wait outside a bit if it\u2019s already too crowded).\n\nYou can also go out to local bars, with Mags being the most popular (if you\u2019re planning on doing that, maybe consider getting a fake with some friends before coming). There are a lot of \u201cmags nights\u201d where a ton of students show up there. To be honest, they are more fun at first but you can\u2019t do it too often or it\u2019s just not as fun imo.\n\nOf course the party scene here is nowhere near as large as at UVA, but if you just want to be able to focus on work during the week and then party a bit on the Friday and the weekends then that is available here, although to be completely honest, sometimes it may be a bit hard to find out when stuff is happening. \n\nIt can also be hard a first getting to know people if frats because all the freshman are mostly in freshman courses. But through clubs and club sports (if you want to do a club sport) you\u2019ll meet a lot of people if you try.\n\nIn the end, Emory is a more academically  focused school, but there are still a fair share of partiers here and you\u2019ll find your people.\n\nI wish you luck in your decision!",
