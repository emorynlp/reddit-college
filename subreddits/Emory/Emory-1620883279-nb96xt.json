      "text": "1. People stop asking \"what does everyone else do?\"  This is your education.\n2. What major do you have in mind?  If a STEM, consider advancing towards it.  If not, you should still perhaps advance towards it but you could probably get away with taking a bunch of gen. eds with no direction as well as some humanities and social sciences majors are light on credit hour and total # of courses required.\n3. Who are you taking for organic? That can determine how far you can \"stretch\" the rest of your schedule if you are a STEM major or wanna take more STEM courses.  I recommend Weinschenk, but if you chickened out on that one, you can probably afford more rigorous courses for the rest of your schedule and may be able to afford say...a problem solving oriented intermediate or upper division biology course(even with him you should be able to afford it. But this is more likely IF you took biol and chem profs. that were better at emphasizing problem solving/more rigorous than average. Otherwise, it may be quite the adjustment).\n4. Who did you take for chem and biol? Maybe you should take professors and/or courses that improve the foundation you got in those courses especially if they weren't that rigorous (this especially goes for bio where I've heard \"not good\" things about most of the instructors for 142).\n5. Either way, without knowing what your interests are beyond \"pre-med\" which is obviously not a major, I feel like we can't be that helpful and you shouldn't just follow pre-meds as Emory's success rate into med. school is not as high as peers suggesting that maybe many pre-meds are NOT doing the right things.  Figure out a path that makes sense for you in terms of interest, performance, and gaining MCAT related skills and competencies that may be under-developed by the intro STEMs you just completed.",

      "text": "I really want to echo the other comment. There\u2019s no hard and fast rule for what classes you\u2019re supposed to take but if you are curious about general \u201cpre med\u201d classes that schools expect you to take, you can just search \u201cEmory pre med courses\u201d or something like that in google and it\u2019ll bring you to a pdf that gives classes and ballpark years you should take them in. But seriously, why not just explore what you\u2019re interested in? I doubt med schools want every single person to have taken exactly the same classes and come from exactly the same academic profile. Just a thought.",

                  "text": "I'm going to PM you some MCAT prep materials(have I done that already?) after this, but the problem with Emory's physiology rendition is that it does NOT focus that much on case studies and data analysis in physiological systems (unless you take O'Toole, even then..barely).  It is just a memorization based detail based course and the MCAT covers a limited amount of physiological systems and seems as if it is more likely to test them conceptually in the discreets and then in passage based questions completely reframe them as physics, molecular biology, or chemistry problems because the test wants to test scientific thinking and cover biology in an interdisciplinary way vs. just a set of facts in one particular area of bio.  336 is perhaps an \"okay\" thing to take right before med. school as a physiology primer (and even then, maybe not because many med. schools blend it with pharm or biochemistry in a way that most Emory profs. just don't), but in terms of MCAT style prep is of limited use it seems and the amount of details (vs. concepts) covered is overkilled.  Follow Princeton and JHU's PHA advice and take other stuff like stated for the additional bios here:\n\n[https://hpa.princeton.edu/prehealth-prep/academic-preparation](https://hpa.princeton.edu/prehealth-prep/academic-preparation)\n\n\"Generally, taking more than the minimum required Biology courses is valued. Consider courses with medical relevance, such as Genetics (MOL 342), Immune Systems (EEB 327), Microbiology (MOL 380).\"\n\nJHU also recommends genetics: [https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/preprofadvising/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/08/Guide-One.June-2020.FINAL\\_.pdf](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/preprofadvising/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/08/Guide-One.June-2020.FINAL_.pdf)\n\n\"Although genetics is not required for the MCAT, it is considered an important foundational course in preparation for medical school curricula.\"\n\nNot many schools mention physiology, even those who offer it.\n\nThe only other top tier I found explicitly mentioning physiology is Duke and I am willing to bet most students there just follow the advice of JHU and Princeton so it is just something tacked on.  At Emory, many are NOT taking the types of additional bios recommended at Princeton and are just taking 301, 336, and some other memorization based biology courses and calling it a day.  This is on top of abuse of summer STEM classes(I know many Emory students did this when I went) which likely ends up hurting lots of Emory applicants(see Columbia's note on it.  These notes aren't uncommon at other top tiers with higher success rates and in fact Oxford used to explicitly have such a note. ECAS never did): [https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health/premedical\\_curriculum](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health/premedical_curriculum)\n\nAt Emory, the courses that would best help you deal with the types of MCAT items I am about to send are chemistry/experimental bio focused biochemistry course, research focused cell biology course, a research focused molecular genetics course, maybe immunology, an experimental microbio focused course (Vega, not Campbell), evolutionary biology (at least Emory's version), Beck's 240, epigenetics, a GOOD (one that exposes you to more complex molecules and mechanistic pathways:  IE Weinschenk for 203/204) ochem course, and possibly even NBB 301 (notice how one of the practice things I sent you has a question where they model the neuron as a circuit.  This is covered EXPLICITLY in NBB 301. In addition to this 301 is interdisciplinary and one of the most problem solving focused biology courses that doesn't necessarily integrate primary literature. Fall version doesn't, spring version does). And no, you need not and perhaps shouldn't take all of these, but a hand full will get you a mixture of the content and the SKILLS you need to solve their passage based problems and even some of the more conceptually focused discreets.\n\nEither way, it is better to see for yourself what you need to know/how you need to think for the MCAT.  The more research based biols (and interdisciplinary courses if available), the better you'll probably be going into prep time.",
