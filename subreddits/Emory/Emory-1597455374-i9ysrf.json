      "text": "If you can get one, the basement floor of the library had these really awesome cubbies with desks, a comfy chair, and plenty of built in outlets, all the way in the back to the left of the staircase that goes up to the exhibit area. The basement can get kind of loud but with some headphones and that cubby I was always set. \n\nCox media lab has these AMAZING floor desk areas with a Mac and comfy floor cushions. I like to sit on the floor and I fucking LOVED these, but there are only like 5 and they\u2019re usually taken. \n\nMy friend group would rent out bschool rooms, but one of them was in bschool, those were very nice tho. \n\nThe reading room in the library was my /favorite/ until they took the Macs out. That place is dead silent and feels very \u201cacademic\u201d which helped me get in the mood. \n\nMy best friend was public health and I second the comment above, that library is amazing especially down on the bottom floor with the computer desks!\n\nI graduated in 2019, not sure what\u2019s changed/what will change due to the pandemic :/",

              "text": "I feel like most buildings may end up restricted access.  At this point folks will just need to be slick and follow someone in.  But during normal times, Rollins(especially that area) is accessible to pretty much everyone.   I had no expectations these buildings (whether they were on main or part of a professional school) would be easy to access during Covid.",
