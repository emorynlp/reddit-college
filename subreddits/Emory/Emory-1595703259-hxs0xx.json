  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I have a few questions about communal bathrooms at Emory. I will be living in Hamilton holmes this year. Well first off: How are the communal bathrooms at Emory? (Specifically the ones in Hamilton)\n\n- Are they relatively clean?\n- Should I change in the shower stall or wear a robe to and from my dorm room and change there? What do people usually do? Do people just wrap a towel around and walk to the bathrooms and their dorms?\n- Hamilton has coed floors so has there been any instances where people have tried to invade other people\u2019s privacy?\n- Tips?\n- Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s?\n\nAlso to anyone who has lived in Hamilton holmes freshman year...How are the dorms? I know it\u2019s a small building compared to others but how is the social environment there? How are the study lounges?\n\nThank you!!",

      "text": "Lived in Hamilton my freshman year - the rooms were really big and nice compared to some of the other dorms so I felt very, very lucky! The bathrooms were extremely clean and pretty big too. I visited friends in some of the smaller dorms & lived in a smaller dorm in my sophomore year and trust me when I say this, I really cherished my times at Hamilton! \n\nI would just wear a robe/towel to and from my dorm room and then change in my room. Most people did that, it was never weird or awkward. Bringing clothes and changing in the bathroom was a hassle for me and I didn\u2019t want to get them wet/fling them over the curtains. Also, the year I lived in Hamilton, there were no issues with privacy and never heard of any problems. If it\u2019s a coed floor, the boys will have en suite bathrooms in their rooms and only some girls will have to use the communal bathroom so it keeps the bathroom relatively empty most of the time.\n\nFor tips - always wear bath slippers in the bathroom no matter how clean it looks!! It\u2019s just safer and more hygienic. Carry a nice sturdy caddy with all your stuff and hang it in the shower (I didn\u2019t like my stuff touching the floor).",

Also when you said that guys will have suite bathrooms on floors that are coed do you mean that only girls can use the communal bathrooms or do you mean that the bathroom is not separated by sex and guys can use them as well but usually only the girls will use them??",
