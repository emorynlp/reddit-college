      "text": "Why would it be too early to take 336?  Is there some reasoning you are using?  I guess access to a quality professor may be a consideration. but otherwise it can't harm you.  I personally would take Beck for biol 240 (his tests and style of problems are like MCAT figures/passages in the form of FRQs and often mirror how physiological concepts would be tested if they were put in passage based questions. 336 may be useful for free standing questions if raw physiology ends up tested heavily on your MCAT) or any RESEARCH and experimental bio/problem solving oriented biology classes (I've said what these classes are over and over again.  They either have a separate required discussion section where primary literature is discussed or they are usually a 3-4 hour standard lecture course that explicitly mentions primary literature in the detailed course description) next semester to start developing those skills for the MCAT (MCAT STEM oriented sections are overwhelmingly passage/data figure based which are pulled from the primary literature.  So taking courses that only prep you for free-standing may be sort of a waste).\n\nReading primary lit and getting used to exams that test experimental design and data interpretation in bio/chem can be a boon, especially if they are mostly FRQ.  It is said that in MCAT passages, the ideal is to be able to read the passage and look at figures and then be able to come up with an answer without looking at the choices (Basically many of its MCQ questions are ultimately designed to be answered more like a short answer/FRQ), but you should do whatever the heck you want.  Pre-med is just a set of requirements and you have met most of them (you have physics left).  It is up to you to decide if you want to take classes that just sound \"pre-med like\" and build a raw content foundation or if you also want to develop thinking skills in bio and/or chemistry that could prime you for the MCAT passages.\n\nOn 336:  I do hear decent things about 336 with Jaeger like him still having the legit case study component and may give relatively simple exams so you may be able to learn without having to sweat too much.  Otoole I think has the right idea and tries to make her 336 a little more serious than \"here, memorize these facts and scenarios and regurgitate them on test and quizzes\" (there is of course a lot of memorization and regurgitation, but she tries to work in some data analysis, case studies, and a little primary literature reading), but if you don't anticipate that for a physiology class, you may find her course quite challenging versus if you wait for Cafferty whose 336 rendition is fairly standard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmong other memorization oriented \"pre-med like\"  memory oriented courses (or pre-med recommended/very important classes) that you have access to, bio biochem only requires chem 203 and chem 204 will complement it well so the two may reinforce each other.\n\nAmong research oriented courses, a safe bet is evolutionary biology:  Doesn't seem directly related to medicine but the format of it and its exams is good for MCAT prep (lots of experimental set up type questions, primary literature reading, and thinking across biological disciplines to describe evolution in authentic contexts.  And often they will teach and give problems on things like evolutionary medicine and the mechanisms behind the evolution of disease and response to it), and is pretty easy because of how intuitive a lot of the underlying concepts are as well as the sometimes free grade that is the discussion section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, maybe pick among these and choose some fun, well-taught social sciences, humanies, ILA, or whatever Human Health is to explore and see if you want to major outside of science or even craft your own major (ILA/IDS program).",

              "text": "That is a thought and why I generally think Emory's 336 is over-rated but if you take someone like an Otoole or Jaeger, you may actually get more out of the class than content.  Plus everyone says the exposure to it ends up helpful no matter when you take it.  However, I have also heard the same about organismal with Beck or any evolutionary biology courses (because evol. bio at Emory is one of the only \"regulated\" intermediate or upper division STEMs at Emory that not only covers certain content, but is taught and tested in certain ways no matter who is teaching it.  Beck and Gerardo basically created the course) mirror the MCAT well.\n\nThe MCAT is more about competencies (particularly the higher ordered cognitive skills are tested heavily which is something usually not associated with life sciences courses, but luckily Emory bio, chem, and NBB have a lot of professors and courses who are very serious about this, perhaps more who are than not now-a-days. It's just up to students to get the guts to take a chunk of them versus retreating to what we all know from k-12: life science courses that only require memorization and regurgitation of details) than raw content (usually content from core required pre-med courses at a place like Emory are sufficient to gain that knowledge) which is why I always recommend like research and problem solving focused STEM and other courses regardless of what content they cover.  The honest reason I typically recommend stuff like biol 264, biol 250, and immunology is because I know they'll get fairly strong instructors on a consistent basis  and these courses tend to emphasize the competencies.  I usually recommend biol 240, biol 241, and 336 because I assume people are a) always looking for more easy classes if they are pre-med, yet the former two do serve as at least a gateway to critical and research oriented thinking bio so I figure I can at least encourage them to start there since those courses are not as intense intellectually and b) there is an unjustified 336 (many other schools don't even offer it and have similar selectivity and better med. school entrance numbers than Emory with similar application volume) bandwagon at Emory so I may as well at least suggest people that emphasize more than quizzes, tests and memorization (like I think O'toole has even a little project or something that is a part of her syllabus).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know people say it is helpful and it may be for MED SCHOOL, but I have seen so many cases where I was told how raw physiology was barely tested on a mentee/tutee's MCAT.  And the AAMC practice passages often has them tested in the form of physics, molecular biology and chemistry problems versus raw \"did you memorize all the details of the body system\" problems so 336 is sort of overkill in terms of the amount of detail and the stuff you need to know can be learned on the spot in MCAT prep books. You can instead use coursework to build the problem solving skills needed to tackle passages, which unfortunately for you, since you probably took biol 141/142 online last year, you didn't really get because I hear the courses were VERY watered down in many ways. So many of you should be using upper divisions and intermediate research oriented bio and chems to develop this stuff (this especially applies if you dodged someone like a Weinschenk for chem 203).  Beck's Biol 240 is the happy medium between getting some comparative physiology knowledge and problem solving/research in bio skills.  \n\nPlus I agree with MyKali.  Learning any of what they suggested will be helpful and often those classes at least get you to read more than a standard textbook and get you to discuss material from both a scientific and societal lens so you can always be pre-health, pre-STEM grad, whatever and get a holistic education at Emory without much oppurtunity costs of having to know less science.",

      "text": "ANT 333 or BIOL 315 are pretty interesting. No prereqs needed.\n\nOf course, all the comments here saying to take physiology, immunology, genetics, form & function, and so on are justified. These are detailed science courses that will invariably prepare you to take the MCAT, though some may say they did fine without them. Definitely consider these courses according to your personal knowledge since you already took the intro biology courses.\n\nI recommend exposure to anthropology or just more human evolution/behavior classes in general. Psychology and sociology are deep on individual and societal behavior, so learning the (really) broader strokes of what makes a human... well, human is something to consider. You'll learn a lot about traditional biopsychosocial aspects of health in medical school, but anthropology/evolution is not something that you will be exposed to in detail as you continue into medicine.\n\nAnthropology has its place in shaping any medical professional's ability to take care of a patient or the population in which the patient belongs. Patients are diverse and are a reflection of not just their biology, but also their culture. At least for me, it put into perspective and solidified exactly why I wanted to become a physician.",

          "text": "That thing is ultra minimalist and the OP has completed a decent chunk of it and is probably aware of it.  If OP is serious they may take advice from this instead:    [https://hpa.princeton.edu/prehealth-prep/academic-preparation](https://hpa.princeton.edu/prehealth-prep/academic-preparation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOften schools with much better entry rates than us including closer ranked peers aren't going out of their way to recommend physiology and many more encourage stuff like immunology, genetics, and microbiology (for which I can't recommend with Campbell) even if they offer physiology.  I have no idea what Emory is on, but they have been on it for a long time and it has had limited efficacy in raising success rates and people know my theories behind it so I won't bother taking up space here to repeat it.  It's basically that Emory's PHA encourages Emory students to be and look weaker versus peers from other elite tier pre-med factory schools",
