  "text": " \n\nWe are pleased to announce the Emory Math Directed Reading Program (DRP) is back for the fall semester!\n\nThe DRP pairs motivated undergraduates with graduate student mentors to learn a topic in a small group or one-on-one setting. These topics are typically ones not offered regularly as courses at Emory and vary each semester according to student and mentor interest. This program also provides an excellent setting to get to know a graduate student at Emory and gain insight about their experiences, including mathematics research, grad school applications, and more!\n\n[**Course descriptions for the Fall 2021 semester can be found here**](http://www.math.emory.edu/~ckeyes3/DRP_Fall2021_descriptions.pdf). DRP courses follow a reading course format, with students meeting with their mentor once per week for an hour to discuss what they learned, ask and answer questions, and work on problems together. While some topics recommend you have taken certain courses, all that is required is experience with proofs (e.g. Math 250), and we welcome all applicants who are motivated to learn and engage with the material!\n\n**To apply, please fill out** [**this Google form**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSexbGVlDPt37v3LbFNXjc0_NPreCmvRCxWFUP0BJFoQvleE1A%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7Calexander.james.clifton%40emory.edu%7C5ee12e4f592d4619e13208d9664a4130%7Ce004fb9cb0a4424fbcd0322606d5df38%7C0%7C0%7C637653292598340281%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=E58VdbaKoDLs5KC84DYN4J5x0brH0GmFTZ%2FZEtLV3gA%3D&reserved=0)\u00a0**by Wednesday, September 1 at 5pm ET**. We ask students\u00a0to rank the courses in order of your preference, so be sure to look over their descriptions below before filling out the form. We will make every effort to place students with topics of maximal interest to them.\n\nIf you have questions about the program or suggestions for future topics, please email Chris Keyes at christopher.keyes@emory.edu.",
