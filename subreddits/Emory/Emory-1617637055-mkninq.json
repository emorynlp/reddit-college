  "text": "Hi guys. I was recently admitted to Emory and I'm planning on studying computer science. It's currently my top option because I was waitlisted from a different school that has a really great CS program. I have always planned on studying computer science, but I know Emory isn't really a CS school. I don't know what my experience will be like if I decide to attend in the fall. Any similar experiences or anecdotes would be much appreciated.",

We also had a few people go to Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon as well if I recall correctly.",

              "text": "Definitely smaller than the pre meds and the B school people, but it was sizable and growing by the year when I was there. I really liked my cohort of CS majors, at least in my time it still felt small enough that you knew a good chunk of the people you started with (although I took cs 171z which was the AP computer science follow up course for freshman studying CS, which had a really small class size and I stayed with those people through my 3.5 years so my experience might not translate 100%) as you moved through the degree.\n\nBut overall I think the department had a good culture, at least among the students. I felt like there was a good amount of camaraderie, most of the TA's are fellow undergraduates and the shared computer lab (should you choose to work there) lends itself to a collaborative and social environment.\n\nAt least that was my general experience. If I could go back and do it again I don't think I would do anything particularly differently. But people who graduated more recently or are in school now would have a more accurate picture, particularly in light of what covid has done for things.",
