      "text": "Looks like a pretty manageable schedule and coursework load. Unless the 5:30s are your only option or you prefer evening classes, I dont recommend the large gaps in the your schedule. You will appreciate getting your classes over with in the morning before lunch so you can relax after your classes and then do your extracurriculars in the afternoon and evening. Especially if you\u2019re planning to do work study you will want to have the second half of the day free. Of course it\u2019s preference but honestly not a huge fan of big gaps",
