      "text": "I did the exact same thing freshman year. I missed exactly 3 classes to sleep in because my section was in the morning (at the time, the class was called \u201cPACE\u201d).\n\nI apologized and everything, but they didn\u2019t care. They failed me anyway lol. \n\nAll I had to do to get the \u201cU\u201d on my transcript changed to an \u201cS\u201d was go to one community event (like a basketball game or something) the following semester and write a little report on it.\n\nUltimately, it had zero impact on internships, GPA, or anything like that. Just gave me a story to tell lol.",
