  "text": "Hi there! \n\nFor freshmen, I have had an extra space in my room (my roommate is taking a gap year) since the beginning of the semester. \n\nSince Emory sent an email about potentially having a new roommate, I prefer to have a roommate that I already know than getting a random one. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t settle well with your roommate and want to change your room, shoot me a PM introducing yourself and I\u2019ll do the same!",

Honestly I sometimes wish it had worked out with my roommate\u2014 nothing bad happened, he moved out because he found our room in complex too small\u2014 but things happen for a reason! Hopefully you and your roommate continue to work out alright :)",
