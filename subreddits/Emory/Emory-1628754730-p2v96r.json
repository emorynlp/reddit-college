  "text": "Hello, rising junior here. It seems like my package this year is making me pay 4x what I've paid in the past... and whenever I call/email them they're kinda rude so I'm scared to call. How do I ask for more aid? What do I need to be ready to say??",

      "text": "Please don't let the fact that they may come off as rude deter you from calling them -\\_-  Thousands of dollars are on the line! At least email them so you can initiate dialogue without having to directly confront them I guess. \n\nAssuming your family's income remained constant over the years (or maybe even decreased due to the pandemic), for sure mention that. Try to affably, but firmly, inquire what caused the financial aid to drastically decrease when all other metrics were unchanged. Have a sense of necessity in your emails/words! Keep professional of course, but there's no shame in sounding desperate when put in a situation like this lol.",

One thing you can maybe do right now is check your Student Aid Report on your FAFSA submission this year and compare it to last year's ([https://fafsa.ed.gov/spa/fafsa/#/LOGIN?locale=en\\_US](https://fafsa.ed.gov/spa/fafsa/#/LOGIN?locale=en_US)). Try to check for any major discrepancies.",
