  "title:": "Is the ISOM depth in the Goizueta BBA worth it?",
  "text": "I was just wondering if anyone who had taken Information Systems and Operations Management depth at Goizueta had any advice on whether or not the course was valuable/respectable from an IT lens. I have found new interest in IT and am interested in IT management, but I've heard from people at other schools that taking a non-STEM major leads to mediocre workforce outcomes in the Technology sector. I was planning on taking ISOM and a minor in CS, but I don't see a lot of similar programs to ISOM at other schools so I'm not sure if that plan is even worth it.\n\nI'm also a sophomore graduating from Oxford in the Fall, so I would really have to take on an excessive workload if I wanted to transition to a CS Major. Hence, my curiosity about ISOM. Plus, I know that Emory isn't exactly known for CS, so I'm really struggling to find people to advise me. Any thoughts?",
