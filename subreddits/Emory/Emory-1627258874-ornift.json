  "title:": "Would it be bad to wear expensive clothes on campus?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been really trying to improve myself this summer and one thing I noticed I could do better with is fashion. Last year, I pretty much just bought random clothes and wore whatever I felt like wearing. I kind of just felt like I wasn\u2019t really taking care of myself too.\n\nSo I thought one way to help with this would be to get good clothes. My parents can afford them, but at the end of the day I\u2019d be spending a good amount of money on them. I think price = quality to some extent and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be totally bad to spend some extra money if I meant I would have clothes that\u2019d be more comfortable/made out of better material/look a bit better. \n\nI\u2019m just worried I\u2019d be showing off or kind of look like a douchebag in general. What do you guys think? Would people even care at all? Honestly not sure because I never cared about these things before and could use some input. Thanks.",

      "text": "I wouldn't care. As long as you didn't criticize other people's clothes or call them out if you notice they have a lack of variety in their wardrobe (didn't you wear that last week), since some of us are independent students utilizing 100% financial aid with 0 income (me). Not a lot of money to spend on designer clothing. But otherwise, you're good and it won't be douchey at all.",

      "text": "Agree with everyone else, but for a bit of fashion advice, I will say expensive clothes won\u2019t necessarily be comfortable or fashionable. With designer brands, you are paying a bit extra for quality and most of the extra money for the brand- they\u2019ve got to get their massive marketing budget from somewhere! If you really want to invest in this and you don\u2019t know where to start, hiring a personal stylist (an actual one, not one of the subscription box ones) for a few hours would be a good use of that money. They can give you advice on what to buy and different outfits you can put together, plus they can help you get an idea of what your personal style is. \n\nIf you want to do it yourself, look into some of the men\u2019s online style websites and quizzes (for you, is fashionable a more outdoorsy leather boots and flannel shirts? Or is it wearing slacks and a button down shirt every day? Or is it a simple shirt and jeans with really well-styled hair?). There are also online companies where you take a quiz on what kind of things you like, and they send you a box with clothing they think you would like. There are versions of this where you buy the clothing and versions where you rent the clothing for a month or two. If you have the money, it\u2019s a good way to try out new things you wouldn\u2019t normally pick out yourself. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m a big fan of capsule wardrobes. You can look up more examples of this online, but the idea is basically that you find a set of colors that go well together and style you like, so all of your clothing goes well together, and if you pick out a random shirt and a random pair of pants, you\u2019ll still look put together.",

          "text": "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go all out. I\u2019ve been looking at some fashion guides on Reddit and some ppl on insta & YouTube to get inspiration. It seems like a college wardrobe should be relatively simple, right? Most outfits consisted of a button up shirt/flannel with a t-shirt, pants (long or short), and sneakers. Also sweaters with a t-shirt or button-up shirt were mixed in too for cold weather and accessories could be added (a watch or bracelets + simple, non-flashy, inexpensive necklaces).\n\nFrom my understanding, it\u2019s kind of hard to mess up with how you dress in college so long as you have matching colors and don\u2019t dress with sweats and flip flops all the time. I\u2019m trying to plan out outfits kind of in that style, although I\u2019m only going to have one pair of sneakers and they\u2019re going to be white because I heard they go with everything well? \n\nBut yeah, might be a little simpler because I\u2019m a guy, not sure. Lots of the things you said were helpful though.",

      "text": "I really respect people who care a lot about fashion and Im happy that you\u2019re improving yourself! Yes, you will stand out wearing designer clothes with large logos at Emory. But I see so many students (especially the international kids) wearing expensive designer brands all the time so you wont be alone. Balenciaga, stone island, off white, gucci, Chanel bags, lv purses you name it. And there are a lot of students with great style who do dress up everyday. You can wear whatever you want. Like everyone else said, don\u2019t comment on what other people wear. Not everyone at Emory can afford expensive clothing.",

          "text": "The thing is about expensive designer clothing though... is that the \\*real\\* expensive stuff doesn't have obvious logos. Polo Ralph Lauren is a good example of this where the cheaper the shirt, the bigger the logo.   \n\n\nMy advice is if you are going to buy designer clothes is to get a designer who can steer you into the right direction depending on the message you want to send and the people you want to attract.",

I\u2019m mainly going to be getting clothes with a solid color + a small logo. The only exception to this (idk if it is one though) might be my sneakers.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at a pair of sneakers to get and the one I\u2019m looking is white and has the colors that represent the brand on the sides + a design. It also has the brand name on the heels of the sneakers, although it\u2019s a bit small. Not sure if that\u2019s too much or not \u2014 definitely looks really cool but worried that it\u2019s a little flashy so not sure if I\u2019ll get it.",
