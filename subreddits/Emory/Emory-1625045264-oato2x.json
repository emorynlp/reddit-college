  "title:": "Syllabi Should Be Available on Course Atlas During Registration/ADS",
  "text": "This is just an annoyed rant. Why is it that a student has to join a class, wait for it to begin, physically travel to said class in normal times/wait for Canvas to give them course access in online, *then* see a syllabus just to figure out what a course entails? Half of the time the course description on the Atlas only offers a vague description as well. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be ready prior to the beginning of the semester, which is fine, but by add-drop-swap, one should be out already. Especially during the summer, where ADS is only 3 days, financial aid is contingent on how many credit hours you\u2019re enrolled, and Canvas takes hours to plop someone into a course.\n\nHopefully the professor will respond to a syllabus request by email in time, but we shouldn\u2019t have to do this!",

      "text": "I agree especially for Special Topics courses. Even when ECAS was big on the whole syllabus thing, barely anyone provided theirs on Atlas. I'm sure they had it ready because Canvas had them Day 0, but a lot of professors are just technologically challenged.\n\nYou would think professors would be excited to teach new courses and have everything ready, but nah. An updated syllabus is a good first impression, and a lack of one tells me you might not as be easily accessible when students need you to be. Even an old one as a placeholder is fine (but really if it's an course you teach every year just change the dates).\n\nThe usual intro or premed courses... we get poorly edited ones from previous years which sucks especially when professors leave the old class due dates on there from last year (happened to me just now, confused me for a bit). Now you're just spreading misinformation as the professor yourself.",

          "text": "I feel like you are being too charitable by attributing it to them being technologically challenged because most young/tech savy profs aren't doing it either. I suspect they have an agenda behind their logic not to provide them, but oh well.  And a minority are indeed just lazy. And when it comes to intro STEMs, it is often obvious who puts in effort and who doesn't (and yes sometimes the syllabus detail and quality is an indicator).",

      "text": "Y'all need to advocate to the ECAS dean(Elliott I think?) ,imcoming university provost OR Pamela Scully (student affairs) for a syllabus database(could have all or a few of the most recent offerings per professor. Could mimic Oxford's) or some arrangement like what you described. Seems the administration tried to push the concept during Covid but there was little buy in from faculty. \n\n Also even if there was buy-in, one should probably expect late (relatively close to or at the start of classes) access as some just throw those together.  They probably could release them quickly during normal times if they've taught the courses multiple times and don't plan to make adjustments (but many do make adjustments especially when all this Covid stuff is happening).  And note that it is also possible that many professors want to keep an element of surprise or trial and error to preserve enrollment.\n\n It is notable that you rarely hear these wild conversations about grade distributions and workload at Emory(vs. Some peers) and that is probably because it is less transparent about grading patterns (no median or average per course grades posted anywhere.  No Latin honors by GPA, so people have little idea of GPA %iles beyond who makes Dean's list and maybe graduating GPAs which is when most GPAs are close to their highest) and course structure and requirements vs.  many peer schools.   More students at Emory sort of roll with the punches if they land a decent instructor no matter what the syllabus suggests.  With syllabi more transparent, I'm guessing that good instructor or not, many social science and humanities elective courses that are more demanding would suffer in terms of enrollment because no one would bother showing up in the first place.\n\nPre-screening by allowing access to syllabi could change the dynamic quite a bit at Emory and I can kind of see why faculty and admins would be reluctant.  Changes to enrollment patterns can harm certain departments and then it could also lead to deterioration of the undergrad intellectual climate which is already affected by the very heavy pre-professional career paths many pursue.  \n\nEither way, I get the complaint but this won't change until more people demand these things and clearly not that many are excited about this idea enough to make requests that \"strongly encourage\" faculty to buy in.",
