I\u2019ve been struggling to find a library to study at in Atlanta amidst COVID closing most local libraries and coffee shops! Any information would be greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Seconding chocolate cafe! I went there to study a lot this past year (after they opened the dine-in room) and it\u2019s a very cozy environment. Usually there\u2019s only 3-5 people in there nowadays, most people still get to go. Plus their coffee and food options are the bomb \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nDecatur square has restaurants & cafes with patios open. B-side breakfast/coffee place has a patio open, unsure about interior. Dancing Goats Cafe also has a nice back patio, the one near Ponce has a SUPER nice screen-in patio with cushy seating if you\u2019re willing to drive that far. And the Starbucks on N Decatur RD also has a nice patio open.\n\nAlso I think the Panera near campus does dine-in now...?",

      "text": "I wouldn't waste your time on the libraries, it has been hard enough for current Emory students to get into them for longer than 3 hour regulated appointments. Most coffee shops on campus like Kaldis are shut down for in person dining/studying. Golden drops off campus is good and has great coffee and food!!!!",
