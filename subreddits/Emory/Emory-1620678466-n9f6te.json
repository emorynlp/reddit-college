I know we can't choose dorms but I saw some of the dorms only have single gender or mixed gender floors so I want to choose the option that will give me the best chance of getting a \"good\" dorm (I know that's subjective but just want to hear your opinions).",

      "text": "raoul/lsm, theyre the newest dorms, bigger, etc - usually rated the best. i think theyre both all mixed so maybe pick the mixed option? i dont know how accurate this is but i think the newer dorms tend to have all mixed floors and the older dorms are single/mixed or just single gender? anyone correct me if im wrong tho. regardless you can still end up in a bad dorm lol i picked mixed and i ended up in dobbs (which is what students usually say is the worst dorm). just to be clear tho none of the dorms are really thaaaat bad, just speaking comparatively",

My only complaint was that I swear our bathrooms did not get cleaned at the same rate as other dorms. In Raoul and maybe a few of the others on the freshman quad there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get a suite, which is ideal. But in general most dorms are mixed gender throughout, and they\u2019re all good",
