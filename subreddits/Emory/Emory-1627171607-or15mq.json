  "text": "First I wanted to know how much do you guys spend in a week. I\u2019m negotiating a budget with my parents and they\u2019ve said that 70 dollars a week(this includes everything from groceries, restaurants, miscellaneous purchases, Uber whatever) I think this is about alright but does that seem like a decent amount. Also are your credit cards linked to your parents\u2019 accounts? My parents wanted to do that to track my purchases which is really annoying. \n\nThe second part I wanted to know about was how much free time do y\u2019all get. I\u2019m kinda scared that this summer is the last time I will ever have free time. I\u2019m planning a finance+QSS+(possibly accounting) major. I hopefully get want to break into IB/management consulting so I will do the clubs and whatnot for this. If I were to perform well in this area( like do the necessary things well and get a high gpa) and assuming I have the capabilities of the average student here about how much free time would I have",

      "text": "I get 50 a week, but I also have a part time job so I mostly use the money that I make myself. Venmo also has no labels on what the purchase is, so if you are trying to buy anything \\*interesting\\* you can have a friend buy it for you and Venmo them back. \n\nCollege IS free time. That's the hard part of it - you have tons of time but you have to decide what to do with it! If you double or triple major, of course that'll be hard - but you don't have to do that to break into IB or management consulting (I'm a consulting major myself). Just stay on top of your schoolwork and you should have plenty of time to hang out with friends.",

      "text": "$70 / week is more than enough for a comfortable college life. If your parents want to track where their money is going, it\u2019s not an unreasonable request. \n\nI\u2019m also majoring in business. You will have free time as long as you know your own limits and don\u2019t go overboard with credit hours and too many extracurricular commitments. Just manage your time well and you\u2019ll be good. Most people do have a good amount of free time.",

If you have Dooley Dollars with your meal plan or you don\u2019t mind just eating dining hall food most of the time, I think $50 is a good amount once you settle down and adjust to the semester. I think you\u2019ll have to spend more in the beginning since you might not realize you may have needed something (common for freshmen... like maybe you needed more extension cords).",

      "text": "I pretty much agree with u/decafoatmilklatte that college is basically \"free time\" that needs management if you are to do well.  And what I will say is that individuals regardless of incoming stats and how they compare to others in the student body will receive academics differently usually based upon how well they manage time and how much they enjoy or immerse themselves in their pathway.  What is especially important in a challenging pathway like QSS is a growth mindset.  It looks like the track is just tough and will require heavier courseloads and have many core courses run by professors that are INTENTIONALLY challenging (as in it won't just be the content, they will give assessments, whether they be p-sets, projects, exams, that may stretch your thinking and require something beyond a cookbook/plug and chug or superficial understanding of material) students and are ultimately unavoidable (which is probably for the best in terms of prepping for internships and experiential opps. You wanna be the strongest you can).\n\nYou have to be open to the idea that you'll likely develop as you go through the major and that some of the earlier courses may not be the easiest and you might not make As in all or even most of them even if you manage your time well and study frequently. It'll come down more to how you study and think AND whether you make time to reach out for help and use academic support resources frequently which is something a lot of high achievers from HS never really had to do because the demands of HS courses often being more tame and amenable to cramming for each assessment alone and still performing well.\n\nPoint is, you'll have \"free time\" but expect to use a good bit of it in strategic ways and get ready to give yourself some grace (like maybe as a freshman you'll have that one intensive course like say...a math 210 where it is a choice between sacrificing your social life for an A or maybe keeping it for a B/B+ which is more than enough to indicate a strong foundation for future QSS courses that use 210 material).\n\nAlso 70 dollars or whatever should be more than enough.  If not, maybe find a little on campus job willing to pay you?",

      "text": "As a freshman I got about 100 per month for Ubers, food, supplies and other purchases and was able to maintain under budget the entire time so if you're getting 70 a week you'll be absolutely fine if you're smart about how you spend. Plus freshman meal plans are unlimited swipes so food won't even really be a major thing for you to buy. As far as freetime I'm an NBB major on the Premed track which is generally a more intensive track but I've still had plenty of time to pursue hobbies and when we were on campus spend time with friends/participate in activities and clubs. It's really all about optimizing when your classes are so you can use the gaps for studying and assignments, plus maybe try freeing up Fridays because a 3 day weekend is amazing if you can do it. If you're good with time management and studying habits you'll have lots of time for fun.",

      "text": "definitely open your own bank account and get a debit card. my parents would probably track all my purchases if I didn't already have that going into college. if you're on meal plan most of your expenses will be low but if you go out alot then ubers alone can easily run you like 50 dollars per weekend. \n\nbut anyway, 70/week is probably alright you'll just have to be mindful (e.g. split ubers w as many ppl as possible, don't eat out unnecessarily, etc.)",
