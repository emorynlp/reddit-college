  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019m having a really hard time deciding which school I should go to. I got accepted for Fall 2021 as a Junior transfer for UNC Chapel Hill and Emory University, and was wondering if any of you have any insight on which school might be better for a Biology/Pre-Health student primarily in terms of:\n\n1. Programs / Opportunities\n2. Value of Cost\n3. Community (collaborative or cutthroat?)\n4. Campus / social life\n\nI realize there might be bias towards Emory in this thread, if that\u2019s the case, I really want to hear *why* you might consider Emory a better choice. \n\nI live in NC, so UNC is cheaper (~24k per year) than Emory (~32k per year) for me. While Emory is more expensive by about 7k, I\u2019d be more than willing to go with that if it\u2019s really worth the cost. \n\nPlease help a guy out! I know I can\u2019t really go wrong with either school, but would really love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to share your own experiences too!",

      "text": "Note that I got stuff wrong(skipped the junior part, thought you were a freshman).  I honestly don't see how either of these can really benefit a junior significantly unless you are willing to have a gap year(s) and stay an extra year.  Definitely hard to see how you aren't already mostly developed as a pre-med or bio major right now. I bet most of your pre-reqs are done so neither curriculum can help you. I guess you'd be looking for \"opps\" or whatever to round your time out.  Either are fine so maybe go to CH which is cheaper or if you are at a 4 year uni right now that is cheap, stay there and make it work?",

      "text": "Shouldn't you just pick the cheaper one(though I'm trying to figure out why UNC Chapel Hill is 24k/year for IS. Good lord!)? And both are affiliated with great medical schools, with UNC being cheaper for you.  These are both great, but very different schools and we don't know your values and what you want as an academic experience, social experience or whatever.  Both of these places will get you into medical school if you do well and I am sure neither are \"cut-throat\" (hardly no school is even in STEM), but even gateway STEM courses are smaller and likely more engaging (less pure lecture based and with assignments designed to require or promote group work) at Emory which \"may\" be an advantage if you value that.  However, if you imagine college as sitting in big lecture halls and \"learning\" as the instructor just giving an enthusiastic lecture while you take notes, then I don't see the point of going to Emory because the best teachers (and less and less mediocre ones) don't work that way.\n\nThere are also some curriculum quirks that may or may not entice you at Emory (where UNC Chapel Hill is pretty standard especially at lower divisions). Like chemistry and the math courses students (the thing that people say about every school teaching the same stuff in STEM is just NOT true, even when you compare between top tier schools. UNC Chapel Hill has slightly more rigorously tested versions of the curricula and content you see at most other public schools.  Schools like Emory, WUSTL, and some other top tier privates/publics, and quite a few LACs are trying some very different and maybe even weird things even in key intro STEMs that most places don't) take at Emory are going to be a bit different from many other schools. If you fear rigor or have very rigid expectations (and be honest about your expectations. For example, do you have an expectation that general chemistry will be plug and chug, that all intro bio should be memorization based, that organic chemistry courses are memorization based, etc?  Will you be upset or thrown off  if they don't meet those tropes and expectations?  Because a lot of students are) of what is taught in such courses that may affect how you receive them (and thus perform), maybe pass on Emory because you may get frustrated.\n\nAlso pass on Emory if you only wanna take the easiest gateway pre-med core course professors because it'll offer no added value over anywhere cheaper or even the same price if you dodge all of those instructors.  No sane medical school is gonna give a magical \"prestige bump\" to Emory or UNC Chapel Hill over each other so you'd need to do what you need to do to make a higher MCAT more likely at Emory and that involves sucking it up and learning from the stronger biology, chem, neuro, or whatever instructors where available and none of these instructors are very \"standard\" in how they teach or test vs. many near peers including Chapel Hill.  So if being challenged in an unexpected/unconventional way makes you uncomfortable and fear for your GPA even before stepping on campus such that you would come back to this subreddit later and ask \"who should I take for X? Who is the easiest?\", save the money because Emory can't really serve you better than Chapel Hill or anywhere else that is loaded with good but more standard profs and curricula if you do that.  Only come to Emory if you think these could be more exciting ways to LEARN for YOU (and not just medical schools).\n\nThis assumes you value learning \"just cause\" and really wanna do it at a high level or in a different way even if it is a tad risky for your pre-med aspirations.  If the latter is not the case and you see yourself as just tunnelvision type of pre-med that needs to check the core courses off with a high grade, again, I don't see the point of paying more for Emory.\n\n\\*One thing I DO like about Chapel Hill is that it's biology does offer honors intermediate and lower division courses  however, I think proper professor selection cancels that out at Emory (and some courses, no matter the professor, seem to be run more like an honors version). Advantages for Emory include that it appears (based on the North Carolina biology syllabi I am looking at) that you have the oppurtunity to get much more experience with reading primary literature in biology fields pretty early in your career as a lot of Emory's courses directly integrate or have discussion sections for it.  This is really advantageous to pre-meds (learning to read more than just a textbook in an area is critical for the MCAT which stresses data analysis and bases passages and figures on primary scientific journal articles. The earlier the exposure, the better) and those who may wanna consider research in an area but don't actually know the questions in those fields. Also looks like many intermediate and advanced courses weight the exams less than North Carolina which is a great thing if high stakes exams make you nervous and maybe not so good if you don't like working in a course at a more consistent pace (lots more assignments/non-exam grades in a lot of Emory biol courses. They can be quite \"busy\").\n\nBoth are loaded with \"oppurtunities\" so...I wouldn't bother differentiating there.  Admittedly Atlanta is bigger metro so that can serve as an advantage in some contexts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, go to UNC Chapel Hill if you put a premium on a more \"standard\" social life with giant parties and sports and Greek driven school spirit.  You aren't gonna get that at Emory. Emory and Atlanta has plenty of stuff to do but it isn't going to look and feel like an American Pie or college film (which usually features public schools or rowdier privates). It's more like a more quirky/semi-intellectual/studious place where a chunk of the students lets loose some times, and some others may find nerdier things to do, or are very engaged in service and clubs.  Not a party and rah rah school whatsoever.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your insight! I find this very valuable and I greatly appreciate your time and thoughts on this. \n\nI definitely am leaning towards UNC because it is cheaper and much closer. I guess to answer your question about my expectations of Emory and my values in college education, I don\u2019t fear rigor that much, in fact I find it exciting especially since Emory offers a more unique style of classes from the standard curricula. Although it may be more risky for my gpa, I feel like the experience there would be quite interesting and fun even. In terms of social life, I don\u2019t really mind that Emory isn\u2019t much of a party school. While I enjoy parties, I often rather do my own things which (other than obsessively working out at the gym) can be categorized as service/clubs and nerdier things as you mentioned haha.\n\nI feel like I\u2019d fit in at Emory and they sound like my type of people, but it also works out at UNC because I simply already know a lot of ppl there. I figure thats what makes the decision so tough for me. I guess at that point it does make more sense for me to go with the cheaper option (it\u2019s also much closer to where I live) since both schools\u2014while very different as you mentioned\u2014offer great opportunities, quirks, and experience overall. \n\nThanks again for your input! This really helps.",
