I remember being in French 101 and the instructor being a bit hostile towards a girl who was clearly fluent.  Taking a language on level is not likely to hurt you.  Just take it and place where ever and if you think that placement is in a class that is too much work, drop down a level and not to the absolute lowest level possible.",
