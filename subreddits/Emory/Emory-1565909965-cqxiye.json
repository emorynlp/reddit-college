I'm African American and went there one time and would never go again (not only did they screw up, but tried to sell me their overly expensive products afterwards\n Stuff actually cheaper at CVS).  For anyone African American/Black, I say go to any of the many black barbershops in the Atlanta area (most malls have one, especially the less \"elite\" malls).  You'll probably pay less too.",
