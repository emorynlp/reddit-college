  "text": "so i don\u2019t even know if i\u2019ll get in but i\u2019m really interested in going to emory. the only problem is that it\u2019s like 70k+ a year and i\u2019m 99% sure i won\u2019t get any financial aid. if i\u2019m planning on going to med school too, is the money worth it?? How do other pre med students do it? i\u2019m assuming some get financial aid or REALLY don\u2019t need it. I also haven\u2019t heard too much about scholarships other than the main full rides, is it common to get other smaller scholarships?? how good is the neuroscience and behavioral biology major at Emory for someone interested in being a psychiatrist\n\nEDIT: To students that ARE paying close to the sticker price, what has made it worth it to you?? Are there any specific opportunities or resources that peeked your attention and made you choose Emory rather than a cheaper public school? How have these resources benefited you in your pre-med path?",

Pre-med is too risky a path to throw away money for a 'vibe' at an expensive school. \n\nEdit: Really to go to an elite for STEM, you need to be able to envision yourself doing something other than med. school with the degree and be ensured that the program is rigorous and strong enough to prepare you to succeed in whatever alternative pathway.  Otherwise, if you are a tunnelvision pre-med, you should just find some less selective and cheaper school where you might almost cruise academically without even having to intentionally dodge \"hard\"(within that context) classes and use the time you avoid putting into academics to do volunteering, shadowing, and extra MCAT prep.  Only go (or pay for) to elites if you value learning at a higher level/being trained well for purposes other than simply \"getting\" to the next step.",

                      "text": "The merit aid is going to be very difficult.  There are now many significant but smaller merit aids that students usually sort of get by surprise so not even they are predictable.  And pre-med \"programs\" don't exist at most schools.  You just have an advising committee that is hit or miss at most places and a set of courses med. school require and you have to optimize how you engage the curriculum, those advisors, and craft what you do outside of class. It really is more of a personal journey than you belonging to a \"program\".  NBB is the program.  You should ask how NBB and those core STEM courses that function as requirements are preparing those taking an MCAT (or maybe even an analogous med. school class/environment).  Emory's are pretty damned good IF you want to engage the top tier professors who teach them.  However, these teachers are more challenging than average and that coupled with a relatively well-prepared student body makes taking those people risky for pre-meds unless you really love learning just cause or are open to being imperfect every now and then if it means you gain an MCAT advantage.\n\nIf you envision yourself as a type that maybe wouldn't want to sort of risk it, you should really go to much less selective schools for pre-med.  If you do really well in those contexts, you'll end up fine and since the student bodies are less competitive, you may be showered in attention by faculty in a way that you won't at schools where you are a much smaller fish (you'll have to be more intentional about getting mentoring and using resources at these higher calibre schools).  Basically I think you need more than a vibe and being pre-med to want to pay for an Emory tier school.\n\nAsk yourself: Why an elite/highly selective university beyond the prestige or a vibe? There are so many 4 year schools that will treat high achieving HS students REALLY well.  What resources or type of intellectual environment do you want, and will you actually take advantage of it when you are at an Emory or just sort of try to get by with competitive stats for med. school and your sanity?  I just think Emory is too expensive for the latter.  You have to get something out of it that you can't at many other more accessible and less expensive places to make it truly worthwhile IMO.",

                              "text": "I'm gonna be honest that that relatively small slice of Emory students (Emory does not have as rich of a student body as its peers so most are on significant aid.  Whether it is enough aid for the more middle and upper middle students  is another conversation, but still) probably not gonna be in STEM or even pre-med (you'll get a lot of pre-business people in this group as well as those in humanities and social sciences or pre-laws which aren't the riskiest pathways in the first place) and will also be those who could easily afford to go anywhere and would just choose the highest ranked school they get into regardless of it was strong in their academic areas of interest.  This crowd is well off and well-connected enough that the quality and level of training in their education might not influence their outcomes. I'm just sayin'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I'm generally a highered, especially an elite highered cynic.  I think maybe some of the T10s and a couple of exceptions outside of it are worth sticker price (and maybe some outside of it are worth it if you pursue key areas) but most just aren't and those who can afford sticker price are likely to be prestige and rankings driven  unless they have very specific interests only done well at a few places.  Perhaps the most interesting answers would come from people who had choices or a choice with similar prices (post-discount) and calibre yet still chose Emory.  I could think of many reasons for this crowd in the case that the school became affordable.  Emory and the D-3s I alluded to just have put way more effort into UG STEM education especially in life sciences and it shows.  Not only that, but their efforts also result in teaching/course structures that make the environments in STEM/pre-health crowds less toxic than normal (if you have just lectures and tests, and lack robust support, that will breed a more toxic competitive environment).",

People, especially on a risky track like pre-med, are not gonna really want to pursue a true Emory education if they are paying a crapton.  Most/a huge chunk would go to Emory and become extremely fearful and risk averse to the point where they end up giving themselves an education worth something more akin to far cheaper universities and colleges because they need to do what they believe gaurantees they get to whatever the next step (med. school or whatever allied health school).  If they spend all that money and their only goal was to get into medical school (and nothing else), and they fail to gain admission, they'll end up justifiably bitter and I've seen that happen before.
