      "text": "The email was honestly pretty self explanatory. People were spamming the chat with inappropriate messages/questions, trying to get Pete\u2019s attention. It started off okay but it got pretty annoying later on. They were also pretty hard on the interviewer and made rude comments when they didn\u2019t like the questions the interviewer asked. The panel turned off the chat after a while because of how spammy/inappropriate it got.",
