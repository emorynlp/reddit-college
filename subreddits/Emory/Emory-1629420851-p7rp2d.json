  "text": "Hello! Is Emory a diverse school, similar to say UC Irvine, or UCLA? I found some stats at [https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/emory-university/student-life/diversity/#ethnic\\_diversity](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/emory-university/student-life/diversity/#ethnic_diversity), but I don't know how accurate that is.  I want a school that has a high percentage of diversity, especially minorities.  If anyone attending Emory as an Indian American ethnically (or even Asian American) could share their experience, it would be appreciated.  I live in SF Bay area which is very diverse, and I want to school that is also diverse.",

          "text": "Thank you! My college advisor is recommending ED to Emory because he says it is more prestigious than the UC campuses (besides UCLA  & Berkeley). In your experience would you say that the prestige of Emory is more than that of say UC Irvine, Santa Barbara, San Diego? I am not convinced if Emory is worth the extra money. If I get admitted into say UC Santa Barbara and Emory, I don't know which one I would pick.",

              "text": "You need to assess that on more than prestige and even diversity (and don't get it twisted. For an elite private, Emory has plenty of that).  Given how much top tier OOS publics as well as all privates cost, you need to probably have some idea of your academic interests and whether Emory (or some other private) is a good academic and social fit.  And generally \"prestige\" cannot really be activated until you the student takes advantage of Emory's resources and academic rigor.  If you just wanna go somewhere, have a good time, more easily get high grades to show off to a 3rd party (like a professional school), I recommend paying less to go elsewhere, especially if you are completely undecided on academic interests.\n\nIf you are more interested in a certain type of academic challenge and are willing to take on those challenges (versus viewing them as this inconvenient reality and obstacle that comes along with a \"prestigious\" school) and have a plan to really take the bull by its horns to access the formal structures of Emory (For example, getting legitimate faculty mentoring earlier in your undergraduate career may be much easier at Emory than places with much larger undergraduate.  Different offices may prime you for certain oppurtunities more effectively simply because they have less students to deal with) that sort of make Emory prestigious and foster professional and social development. If you just view it as this shiny highly ranked object you want to be part of and you think you'll be kind of flippant (vs. deliberate) on how to fully leverage Emory, I think it can end up a huge waste of money, so be careful.\n\nWhen you see and hear of all this selectivity and prestige, it always is presented as if the school is doing some magic, but what is often not highlighted is how the students' aggressiveness, interests, and go-getter attitudes coupled with faculty and administrators(sometimes) that are willing to facilitate whatever they desire ultimately generates the outcomes that bring these schools visibility beyond them just drumming up high application volume and high incoming stats via aggressive marketing and communications campaigns.  Make sure that you kind of fit this ethos before applying ED and paying lots for Emory.  There are actually some Emory's prestigious private peers that are more suitable for those that kind of want the \"generic top tier school experience\" with sort of a public school lite type of vibe that will fit (and place just as well in terms of post-grad opps) more students regardless of how important they view their academic pathway.However,  Emory students tend to care a lot more about that academic aspect (and not just grades, though of course most really really care about that too) on average and furthermore, when you compare many of Emory's programs (ones that overlap/exist at each) to some of the near peers I am alluding to, so many seem to be designed for those that are a bit more serious or who don't mind taking on more rigor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of Emory's majors even in some areas outside of STEM are more scaffolded and have more of what would be considered serious/rigorous REQUIREMENTS vs. flexibility that ultimately allows the student to decide whether they want to engage particularly rigorous courses within the major or not.  For example, most neuro majors don't have 4 core courses, one of them being a neurophysiology (that uses gen. bio, gen. chem, and gen. physics all at once.  Can be a very challenging course for many and most people in other neuro programs may never take such a course because it isn't a requirement and is known to be difficult so gets lower enrollment as an elective option even though neurophys is sort of central to really understanding the brain).  Most places don't have a chem curriculum that have first years engage real organic chemistry throughout the introductory sequence.  Most private peers don't have several social science and humanities majors requiring a statistical inference course AND a disciplinary research methods course.  Hell some, for things like sociology and political science may not even require the latter.  Most places don't have a 2 course intro. psychology sequence, and there are more examples.\n\nAnd then also many even \"easier\" majors are now implementing serious capstone requirements now-a-days on top of these oddities.  Emory is more comparable to its D-3 sports peers than anything but a lot of its majors and courses have been designed or redesigned to emphasize research strengths of the departments and are designed as if they are primarily training those who may go to grad. school in the area (even if they are mostly filled with \"pre-X\" people. Again, most schools deal with this by being super flexible and just crossing their fingers that students engage the right level of rigor where Emory kind of forces it).  And then there are things that solidify the intentions of Emory College such as how it never awarded Latin honors based on university (or even major) GPA.  Everyone who wants that has to hit a minimum GPA threshold and then do a thesis and only the quality of the thesis work and research matters in terms of what level of Latin honors you get once in the program.  And on top of this, Emory is one of the few places where these sort of department honors require a graduate level course in most departments offering the honors program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally think these are all good attributes of a school that wants to be more serious about the educational aspect but it creates a social and intellectual/academic environment that just isn't for everyone (again, you can get sort of a generic prestige from so many places that are drastically different).  If you want a more slightly laid back atmosphere, try D-1 near peers that are known more for their social scenes (I'm thinking our USCs, Dartmouths, VUs, UVa's, Chapel Hills, and probably a few more).  I would have to say that maybe places like WUSTL and Emory are aiming to be sort of a hybrid/kind of lower calibre (at this moment at least) version of like a Chicago (research Us with relatively small UG populations so can easily do weird things with major design and curriculum structure) /top tier LAC (same idea but naturally small and always innovative due to intentional focus on teaching undergraduates) and some of those more social scene oriented schools, but they kind of feel a bit more like the former than the latter in many ways.  I personally loved Emory but I would listen to the other commenter and think seriously about your values and what type of learner and person you at least think you are now in this moment.  Don't let your inner self, counselor, or even parents tell you to chase shiny objects \"just cause\".  See if the shiny object still shines after you assess your own needs and values versus what the school offers and what it values.",

There\u2019s also a substantial difference between Emory as a private school. If it\u2019s full price vs staying in state, I definitely recommend staying in state! I never realized how much I missed California until I came back, but you never know until you leave it! One thing that is remarkable about Georgia is how much greener it is than any part of CA, which is still something I miss about Atlanta.",
