  "title:": "Would it be impossible to apply(BSN)?",
  "text": "I\u2019m 26 and was not able to go to college even if I wanted to when I was younger. That being said, I had to drop out, but was able to push through and get my GED and eventually took my SAT(not very good score) hoping that eventually I would be able to attend college\u2026.5 years ago. I was in advance and AP classes, but because of very personal family matters, my grades started dropping and my GPA went from a 3.9 to a 3.3./3.2 . I am now able to start applying to colleges(yay!), but don\u2019t know how to start. I would be the first person in my family to even apply to a college. \n\nLike I said before, I\u2019m 26, and want to pursue a BSN, but it seems impossible to even try to apply to school such as Emory at the moment. I am looking to maybe go to a community college and TRY to transfer later on to get a BSN. \n\nI\u2019m sitting here typing this half hopeful that maybe, even if it\u2019s a 1% chance, I could one day get into Emory. \n\nTo end all this, I would appreciate all the advice you guys have. I have probably close to zero knowledge when it comes to applying to college and much less to a nursing program, and the things that I do know are solely based on self research. \n\nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "Emory is great, but for a field like nursing nothing matters more than your RN. I do not know your financial capabilities but tacking on a huge amount of loans for a nursing degree seems off to me, especially for something that culminates with a standardized test. I would understand wanting to go to Emory for the prestige, but prestige matters squat in RN nursing. When your education is complete, plenty of nurses who work at Emory never attended Emory so it's not like you can't work here when you're done.\n\nSave. Your. Money. Go to a CC with in-state tuition and do well in those prerequisite courses. If you are prepared enough to challenge the RN NCLEX early (not the LPN/LVN), consider finishing an associate's in nursing which will give you an RN.\n\nIf not, finish the prerequsites and apply for the BSN (also in-state public school tuition), which more hospitals are starting to prefer to accompany the RN. Both take the same exam, you just learn more fluff and research with the BSN but it'll be nice to get it done.\n\nPrivate schools like Mercer and Emory sound cool and all, but my girlfriend is going through private school nursing and it's... really nothing special. And Emory costs double what she's paying! She's doing a traditional BSN having already finished another degree. It's the same nursing, you all take the same exam as the rest. Why add more student loans? Take the same NCLEX, get an externship if you have to, get the same job and stay comfortable knowing you finished it with the least amount of student loans as possible.\n\nI am quite familiar with the nursing admissions *process* (not what goes on with the adcoms, but rather what you need to apply and get in). r/StudentNurse can also be helpful.\n\nNote: Do not let your nursing instructors pressure you into going into NP too fast. NP education is not standardized as well as PA education, it's pretty laughable right now because the master's level training is a joke. Work 3-5 years as a BSN-RN first and then if you really want to, go back and get your MSN. But don't do it straight after your BSN. The best NPs are those who worked as RNs for a bit and *know* they can take on the advanced practice that comes with it.",

      "text": "I would take a long, hard look at why you want to come to Emory specifically. As someone who thought I had something to prove to other people by going to some top tier school for my undergraduate degree, the only person you have to convince of your accomplishment is yourself. Emory is **very** expensive, and may not be an ideal setting for people coming in as non-traditional students. I encourage you to find a school that has programs to support and uplift non-traditional students (i.e students who didn't go High school --> college). Those are the programs that will ensure you will be supported AFTER you hand over your money, and will be with you until you get your degree. Proud of you for taking the first steps, you're going to be successful in anything you stay dedicated to achieve!",

Your past is your past and I\u2019m proud of you for putting it behind you looking forward to the future. The nursing school will really care about your first 2 years of undergrad, not really your GED SATs etc, so work hard in class as a stepping stone to the BSN. As always, you can transfer into Emory so don\u2019t be discouraged. And lastly, Emory\u2019s nursing school is number 2 in the country. It is damn hard to get into, and your worth isn\u2019t tied to an acceptance. Keep your options open with GSU, UGA, Southern, etc. Good Luck!",
