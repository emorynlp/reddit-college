  "text": "I know this last minute, however, I thought I would give this opportunity a chance by posting on Reddit. I am a male transfer business student to Emory (20 y/o) and am looking for another person to room with at an apartment near campus. \n\nIf interested or if you know anybody that is interested, please DM me and we can share further information to see if we would be a good fit. \n\nI\u2019m definitely studious (as we all are), but when the day is over I like to chill, hang with friends, and listen music mostly.
