  "title:": "What is a good time to go to WoodPec? (Not Busy)",
  "text": "Basically the title. I haven't been to WoodPec before and I'm wondering what's a good time to workout when it'll be the least busy. I'm a morning person, and was thinking 6:30 am is a good time, but if that's when all the sports kids are there, I won't want to go then. I'm not the most fit and athletic, I just enjoy working out, and I know I'll get anxious and intimidated if it's crowded. Any help is very much appreciated!!\n\nAlso, what floor/section is just general wieght training?",

      "text": "I can\u2019t go right at 6:30 anymore because of my work schedule, but the few times I have\u2026 it is very quiet, you will have most of the equipment to yourself with few people in the gym. Athletics has their own weight room so it won\u2019t interfere with your workout. It\u2019s an awesome time to go and you feel more empowered and ambitious when you wake early",
