  "text": "BACKGROUND INFO:\n\nAP credits available: chem, bio, calc ab & bc, physics c e&m and mech, environ, macro, span lit, eng lit, and eng lang.\n\nUsing my eng lit or lang credit to get rid of FWRT. Might use macro for HSC and span lit for HAL but not entirely sure in case there are better ways to use my AP scores (considering Emory only allows 12 credit hours to be fulfilled with AP).\n\nGoing into premed track but unsure of major. \n\n\n\nDILEMMA:\n\nInitially, I thought of taking BIOL 141 L, CHEM 150 + L, a FSEM, SPAN 212 (interested in studying abroad for a semester or two), ECS, HLTH 100, and maybeee a CWRT? But looking at the premed req I was wondering if, like I mentioned above, there are better ways to use my AP scores to get credit on premed req. I feel pretty confident in my biology knowledge. Not as confident in chem, but I am comfortable with it. In ALEKS, I \"mastered\" 50% and \"learned\" 50%. Still, there's the Emory's CHEM 150 ochem factor, so I might just retake chem. I also have credit for physics and calc, so I do want to think of the possibility of using them to fulfill the PHYS 151 and 152 and MATH 111 in the premed req. \n\nAnother thing I'm concerned about is whether med schools are okay with premeds using AP credit to fulfill med school prereq. I did hear some require students to take upper level classes if they have used AP credit, but I also think I heard the PHA say med schools wouldn't know if we used AP credit since the transcript would record it as if we took the class at Emory. What's the truth in this, and how should I create my schedule?\n\nI would appreciate any tips and advices to guide me!",

      "text": "I may be wrong \u2014 also pre-health and have not gone through the medical school application process \u2014 but I think medical schools may be able to see which courses you used AP credit for. On my transcript I used an AP English credit, so it is listed as a transfer credit.\n\nFrom my knowledge medical schools prefer that you take those core classes like physics at Emory rather than using AP credit (take biol+chem first year though, not physics). I suggest taking physics at Emory because it may help you when the MCAT comes around. Of course you can always self -study but I feel like it\u2019s nice to get that Emory rigor. If I used my AP Physics credit I personally would forget all the physics I learned in HS\u2026so I would have to relearn it either way.\n\nSOME medical schools require two semesters of math (one semester can be statistics/QTM) You will still have to take a Math course even if you use the AP Calc. credit. My reasoning is why limit the medical schools you can apply to just because you refused to take an additional math class",

It's not like you can skip the lab portion and get ahead though, which sucks.\n\nIf it were me, I'd apply the credit and take an easier course that fulfills requirements for something else.",

You can more easily self-study all the material for the MCAT even before you take physics, compared to other prerequisites. The course I would not recommend self-studying is biochemistry for sure, but using AP physics to get out of part of it won't do you any harm at all.\n\nThose that require an entire year of math are the uncommon ones, not \"many.\" Many recognize that calculus isn't high yield for medical student success and require statistics only.",

      "text": "This is gonna be different from other advice, but I say use the chem and bio credits.  This \"ochem factor\" stuff becomes irrelevant, because 202-z will cover that and with far more seriousness than 150 and standard 202.  You may, ya know, see actual applications that are the calibre or higher than those that the MCAT may cover.  You can self-study the math based chem and stuff that you have likely forgotten after AP (and will forget after chem 150/202) for the MCAT or you'll become re-acquainted with it via the lab portion.  Either way, 202-z reviews and integrates the most important aspects of chem 150 and success in it is hardly predicated upon content knowledge of 150 or AP even (202z is NOT merely a follow-up of 150 like standard 202).  It knows it is getting freshmen that have not been exposed to Emory's curriculum and is taught as such)m more so than your ability to really learn to think and solve challenging problems (kind of what the MCAT is about and is something sort of under-developed by chem 150/202 which tend to test students using soft-ball/standard level problem types that you've seen in class, the book, or practice problems, and rarely serious applications where you have to truly learn to improvise and think it through on the spot. \n\nWhat makes 150/202 stand out vs. other schools and several peers is simply differences in content coverage vs. them and lesser so the skills developed.  The skills and problem types ultimately mirror a blend of the standard level gchem and ochem stuff offered elsewhere).  Plus getting to take a chem class with Soria as a freshman will just be a much richer and more memorable experience that isn't really worth passing up. You get to take a rigorous problem solving focused ochem professor that is mentoring and grading freshmen.  Ideally after going through standard 202 if you chose the normal track, you should probably take Weinschenk for chem 203, but even for those who make As in standard 202, Weinschenk (or any standard 203 professor) is risky as the department wants a B- average with standard 150, 202, 203.  With 202-z/203-z, that departmental target is absent and I'm pretty sure those averages go in excess of B+, so you get similar level(203z) or additional(and RELEVANT) rigor (202z) without as much risk to the GPA (like you won't have to be perfect to do well and even if you're average, you'll end up with a very respectable grade in both-202z will have plenty of bonus points and other random cushions, and 203-z has lots of scaling/curving as needed).  There is no magical value in taking chem 150.  I think it is vastly over-rated as some entry point, especially for those who come in with even 1/2 of the knowledge of an AP chem curriculum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have AP bio credit, skip bio 141 lecture (just take the lab) and fill the spot with something fun your first semester that may even be outside of STEM.  Biology has plenty of other \"easy\" upper divisions that will please medical schools like human phys and biochem 1.  These courses may actually be easier than freaking biology 141 tbh because they have no lab and have many professors who almost exclusively demand an ability to memorize and regurgitate material at a low level (biol 141/142 professors at least make some barely successful attempt to build and assess some mid and higher ordered thinking of material).  And you can use them to pad your GPA, learn for the MCAT, whatever.  Ultimately you should end up learning 141 and 142 content at an MCAT level context via taking biol 301, cell biology, and human genetics because the first covers the biochem concepts of 141 in much more depth, and the latter 2 focus on research applications (which is what most MCAT passages will be based upon, a primary research article in these areas and biochemistry) of the material while also covering 141/142 content in far more depth.\n\nYou can probably take physics at Emory, because that is the upper divisions you'd wanna avoid.  Again medical schools have generally become more lenient on AP credit (that recent PHA video you refer to even said this) but usually expect an upper division in exchange for whatever you use it for.  You probably won't want to take one of those in physics, but in chem, if you take 202z/203z, you're basically covered by 204/204-L, and with bio, again there are tons of upper divisions that you should probably take as a pre-med. And maybe you can just use the calc. AB credit in addition to those two?  There is more to the YOUR education and Emory experience (like wouldn't it be cool that instead of boring behind chem 150/150-L and bio 141/141-L, you had Soria for 202z/202z-L, some interesting humanities, social science, or seminar in place of 141 lection, and just 141-L.  You take higher quality courses/courses with fresher content generally and get time to acclimate to the style of thinking and problem solving needed in 202z which alone is more beneficial to START Emory off learning than doing some basic STEM learning, getting complacent, and then being slapped with higher level problem solving as a sophomore or later/worse, on your MCAT) than placating to medical schools as soon as you start and there is nothing here that will make optimizing both difficult.  The AP credits here can get you into \"better\" and more interesting renditions of STEM courses in some places that still keep you in line with med. school requirements in a way that doesn't require you to sweat more later on.\n\nJust another perspective and pathway that a lot of the more successful pre-meds and STEM students end up taking.  It probably won't feel like the easiest entry to Emory and give you that immediate \"I can do it easily because I was exposed to most of this content\" ego high, but it will have some long term benefits that set you up for success in some of the harder courses you may take later as well as setting you up for a smoother MCAT study session (you'll know content and how to solve problems that don't strip away complexity).",

I know they are accelerated versions, but the premed req sheet says premeds have to take CHEM 150, 202, 203, and 204 with labs. Can the \"z\" classes fulfill those reqs without taking the \"standard\" non-z classes? Can 202z and 203z completely replace 202 and 203?\n\nIf I use my AP credits for CHEM 150 + L and BIOL 141, I would be taking 141L and 202z+L in the first semester, right? Then which science classes would I be taking the second semester of freshman year?",

In spring, you'd have chem 203z +L  with McDonald, and then bring in biol 142 lecture in addition to the lab.  So you'd pick up bio lecture.  If you felt comfortable adding something else STEM focused in spring, that is up to you.  But if there is a rigorous professor teaching biol 142, I suggest you take them and perhaps avoid taking an additional STEM course unless it is a freshman seminar (even then I think you should choose a non-STEM seminar).",

Like 203 and 204 (which covers lots of biochem focused content in lecture and lab) are sufficient pre-reqs for chem biochem (chem 340) which is >>>> than bio biochem and you can take that and it'll cover the \"extra\" class.  At other schools where the frosh org sequence is straight up ochem with no overlap with the gchem courses (for example, at Emory this would be equivalent to it being 203z and 204z vs. what it is now, and the old curriculum was like that), they recommend at least one upper division course because those students will only take 2 chemistry courses.  Emory's curriculum makes it so that you'll take at least 3 as a pre-med because 202z technically counts as 202 which is \"gen chem 2\" and would be sufficient evidence that you know \"inorganic\".  Like the few people who took extra on the old curriculum would go back and take 142 if they didn't wanna do advanced chem inorganic or pchem focused courses and that was sufficient. 202/202z is 142's replacement.\n\nBio, eh.....kind of, but you should WANT to take more bio (or bio focused NBB courses) as a pre-med.  Again, I don't think gen bio in its current state is the best prep for the MCAT especially if you end up with \"meh\" instructors both semesters.   You'll likely wanna take physiology (I think it is over-rated but it WILL help for MCAT discreets/non-passage based questions which may test that often), genetics, and cell biology, or even microbiology and evolutionary biology, really anything that has a primary literature discussion section or has frequent reading of primary literature within the lecture component itself (cell biology, epigenetics).",
