I\u2019d be able to pay $1100/month rent MAX (for a multiple bedroom apartment shared with others), is that doable for the apartments around Emory?",

      "text": "You have a lot of choices. \n\nClairmont Reserves and Highland Lake are probably the most popular because they're pretty cheap and close to the Clairmont Shuttle. The quality of the apartments are not so great, however. You're really just paying for the proximity to Clairmont Campus. \n\nEmory Point is nicer, obviously more expensive but still within your price range if you have roommates. There are also nice restaurants and stuff around the apartments.\nGables Montclair is around the same price as Point. It's in a townhouse style so it's the biggest option. There is a shuttle close by and it's like a 10 -15 min walk from Clairmont.\n\nConsidering your price range I'd go with Point or Gables. There are a lot more choices- especially if you have a car- but those are the ones I know about.",
