But if it can then you're definitely free to. I haven't had issues gaming or streaming while here and it definitely does help for relieving some stress. The only issue would be if you don't have wireless capabilities and potentially transporting/storing it depending on how you plan to get to and from home.",

But in terms of lag I very rarely run into issues with it and if I do it is only for a few minutes most of the time. The lag is only slightly increased if it does happen.",

But there are definitely some professors who do not allow students to use electronics in class (these are obviously for in-person classes). Most of my professors have allowed whatever sort of notes we like, but there have been a few who don't allow electronics in class due to believing they may serve as a distraction. I wanna say that writing notes on a tablet (like an iPad with a stylus) would probably be fine, but it would mainly be up to the professor.",

I rarely ever have an issue with my ping going up, if it does it is usually because of something else like me downloading something big in Chrome or Steam updating stuff in the background without me knowing. My ping usually sticks around in that range even when streaming to Twitch at 1080p 60fps, so you shouldn't have any issues with lagging unless the internet is really acting up which is relatively rare.",
