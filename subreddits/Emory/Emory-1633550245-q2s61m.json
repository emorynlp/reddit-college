  "title:": "Interested in Ph.D. chemistry program: Do I have a chance?",
  "text": "I'm interested in applying for the Chemistry Ph.D. program at Emory. My background is in computational chemistry and there are advisors that I would love to work with. Given how competitive the program is, would I even have a chance if I do not have a publication in the \"published \" state? For context, my lab is submitting a paper and it would be under review but not be published by the time the application process closes. \n\nUndergrad: University of Cincinnati\n\nGPA:3.9\n\nResearch: \n\n3 years of research: Genetic engineering, nanoparticle synthesis, and now computational chemistry\n\n2 summer programs with $4500 funding each:\n\na) For the first program I designed the research project myself and it was funded through the undergraduate office of research\n\nb)Second program: Summer program for women in stem through the university. Presented my project at the end\n\nIn total 4 presentations and one publication (through the lab I work: Not a first author) in the process of being submitted\n\n3 years of teaching: Making content for Ochem. One on one tutoring and group tutoring for calculus, general and organic chemistry, and biology and physics\n\nLetters of rec: Pretty decent\n\nSOP/Diversity statement: Decent. I got them checked and got a green light \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "You have more experience than I did and I was accepted to 7 out of 9 programs I applied to. You're almost certainly fine - as /u/Jtronny says, do your due diligence and make sure Emory really is the place you want. But you seem like the kind of person who's on top of this stuff.\n\nI can probably guess which PIs you're interested in - I'm afraid I don't know that much about them but if you have questions about Emory Chem in general, feel free to DM me.",
