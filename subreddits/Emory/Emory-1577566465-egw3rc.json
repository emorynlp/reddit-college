  "text": "Hi!! I\u2019m an Oxford freshman that\u2019s rushing a sorority. I\u2019m kind of nervous to rush because, although I consider myself very sociable, I\u2019m really worried about not getting a bid. I would either like to be in tridelt, theta or kappa. I have 2 friends in tridelt now and I know a couple girls in theta. I\u2019m currently a member of a social club at Oxford.\n\nI just have a couple questions/areas where I could use some advice. For one, what should I expect? What\u2019s the best strategy to use going in? I\u2019d say I have a pretty unique/loud sense of style, should I tone it down for rush? Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi I'm in Greek life at Emory!\n\nWhat to expect: overwhelming amounts of small talk, but hopefully a few good conversations\n\nBest strategy: be yourself, be friendly, talk about yourself while still asking about the sorority and its vibe/values\n\nDon't be scared! Go into it with an open mind, and make sure to give every chapter a chance. You might be surprised! There will also be rough guidelines for outfits. The B's are no longer 'outlawed' from conversation choice, but there are plenty of other things to talk about so I'd focus on that if you can. \n\nBest of luck, I hope it's a positive experience for you!",

      "text": "I'd consider looking into other ways to get connected. Beyond the philosophical problem with 'paying for friendship' here's some really horrendous things that have happened on campus connected to Greek life. The level of hazing and abuse that happens to people joining is really severe. I've heard so many stories of Emory pledges being forced to snort coke or drink till they're sick. That's also not to mention the orchestrated rape of a female pledge that happened a couple years back, organized by frat and sorority leaders in Emory Greek life.\n\nThat's not to say that everyone in Greek is horrible, or snorting coke, or being a perpetrator of sexual abuse. I have plenty of friends in Greek that I like and respect. But if I wanted to find the highest concentration of people on campus that were like that, I also know exactly where I'd look. Ultimately, where your time and money goes affects what people have power and which don't. There's tons of opportunities to connect with people outside of the Greek system. Just definitely make sure you get a full view of what Greek life is all about before you go all in",

          "text": "I\u2019m in a \u201csocial club\u201d at Oxford which is basically our version of greek life; it\u2019s a coed frat/sorority. It\u2019s been some of the most fun Ive ever had in my life, and I love the family I\u2019ve made there so much. I never thought of myself as someone who liked greek life but being in greek life at Oxford has been one of the best experiences of my life. I have been hazed before, got through it fine. I appreciate the warning but I am 100% sure I want to rush and I know I\u2019m definitely the type of person who would want to be in a sorority.",
