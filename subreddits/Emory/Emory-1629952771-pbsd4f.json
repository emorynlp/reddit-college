      "text": "What do you mean by \"bad\".  You mean tough? That isn't necessarily bad (especially since many NBB electives rely on that material and then NBB 401 will have you read primary literature with experiments and data that require you to understand it pretty well.  Doing the simplest problems in the area won't make the knowledge last).  He teaches and tests at about the level of an average 301 professor which can be pretty challenging.  You should expect maybe the 1st two exams (I don't know how many he offers now but it used to be 3 and a not so comprehensive final) to be the most challenging for most as they call on a decent physics 142 foundation.  Expect the exams and learning the material to feel more like classes like gchem, physics, and ochem than a memorization focused biology course or a course like NBB 201 where constant review of notes and flashcards may suffice.  A significant amount of problems will be quantitative and/or involve drawing or interpreting biophysical data/experiments and tests will likely have a very significant free response section to give those problem types.\n\nYou need to study as if you'll be solving problems or applying concepts at a decent level and not just as if you'll be sort of in taking signaling pathways and then being asked to regurgitate or do simple applications on the exam (though there will be some of that for sure, especially on the later exams so definitely memorize some things.  Usually most questions calling on that end up in the MCQ section and a few questions closer to the beginning of the FRQ section. And in later exams, those types of sort detail oriented and descriptive biology questions will occupy a greater share of exams).  I also think attempting the problem sets associated with grad TA help sessions before the actual sessions will help you (again, kind of like in chem and physics).\n\nBut either way, his 301 class is actually fairly standard.  I think he sometimes gets mediocre reviews because Prinz and Sober when they run it tend to be on the easier than average side and people think the latter is normal for NBB 301, but in reality Lui is more reflective of how the course has been run historically.   It was always a crash course in neurophysiology and many of its biophysical mechanisms.  The content alone wasn't going to be easy so if the problems are actually pitched to a high achieving student body, then of course they are going to give a run for the money in a few instances. They aren't going to be the simplest and most straight-forward cases because Emory students can supposedly do more with the material they learn.",
