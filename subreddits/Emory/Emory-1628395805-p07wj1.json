  "text": "Hello :) \n\nI'm an oncoming freshman to the Oxford campus. \n\nI have credit from AP English Language and I can skip the first year writing requirement. However, I took a gap year and would like to become a better writer in general. Would it be advisable to take the class even when I have the credit, or is there some other class that would serve the same purpose. \n\nThank you",

      "text": "You can maybe look to take one of the 200's or 300's level English classes. I took ENG 389W my second semester of freshman year and felt totally fine -- it was manageable and I learned quite a lot (and became a better writer!) from it. Unfortunately, it looks like many of the interesting upper-level English classes have already filled up, so you might need to look around a bit on what's left (try to also read the general RMP ratings of a professor too) or get on a waitlist. You could also potentially take an English course spring semester or even later on in college if you desire. I don't personally think taking ENG 185, which you already have credits for, is the greatest idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Many of the upper-level English classes have already been filled up on the \\*Atlanta\\* campus. Not sure of the situation at Oxford.",
