  "text": "I don\u2019t see a lot of just general posts about Emory here, but I was thinking about this for some time, and it struck a chord with me as a low-income student.\n\nThere are so many amazing students I\u2019ve met here that\u2019ve come from all sorts of high schools, including those that were very underfunded and some which were even unsafe. Yet, Emory takes a chance in these students and admits them to succeed (and does successfully with a ~90% grad rate). \n\nThe median family income here is high, around 130k, but relatively much lower compared to other similarly ranked private schools; for reference, Vanderbilt\u2019s was 204k and WashU\u2019s was 272k as of 2017.\n\nIdk. It just means a lot to me to see a school\u2014our school\u2014actually care and give a chance to many students regardless of their background. It means a lot to me coming from a very underfunded school too.",

      "text": "A 90% grad rate is great (do keep in mind that many are low income but don't qualify for Pell because they may be right above the qualifying line) for that group, but keep holding Emory accountable so that more graduate in 4 (and 6) years and persist and thrive in majors that typically have high attrition without having to steer us (I fall/fell into a couple of disadvantaged groups) towards easier courses or majors.  Just believe in people like me and support us through the hard crap so we can compete in whatever field post-grad.  I think Emory even tries a bit harder than many other places in this arena (especially in areas like STEM where some places in Emory's tier have relatively underdeveloped or/and little support for FG, URM, low income, etc or students in general), but can still do much better considering how low the bar is at other elites.",
