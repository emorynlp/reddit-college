      "text": "They should be the same thing. Did you try actually going through with enrolling in a course, or were you just able to see what's available? My thought is that you'll get stopped by OPUS somewhere along the way if you try to add the course. But if not, maybe you got lucky, and honestly I'd try enrolling for all my courses today to beat the other freshmen to the punch if I were in your shoes. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission, I always say.",
