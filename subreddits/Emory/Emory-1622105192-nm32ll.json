  "text": "I know someone asked this question about general econ electives, but I was wondering specifically about 400-level courses. All of the professors have pretty bad ratings on ratemyprofessor and I don't want an econ course to lower my gpa, since I have to apply to grad school. Thanks!",

      "text": "Do you mean professional (Law? Even MBAs aren't that GPA crazy) or actual grad school? Actual grad schools want to.see you take the tough courses even if you aren't perfect in them and they value research and experiential learning far more than a near perfect GPA.  If you are applying to actual grad school, take whatever you want as long as it is useful and preps you for the subfield you wanna go into and hopefully has someone who teaches decently. Also do NOT frame it as \"the course will lower my GPA\"...I imagine you are too far along into your undergrad career for that.  If a course challenges you, do the best you can.  You have plenty more where that came from in grad. school (also if your GPA is strong right now, one or 2 courses shouldn't do much unless you completely bomb them).",

              "text": "But still don't say that!  It kind of assumes that you're gonna struggle or be defeated if challenged (just do what you gotta do/the best you can and roll with punches. You know this by now) and DO specify what type of \"grad school\" you are going to when asking these questions. It makes a difference.   Even then, med. Schools will likely be more forgiving of imperfection in an upper division econ than their core  requirements or upper division STEMs. Just keep the GPA (especially STEM) competitive. \n\n  Can you not get into Banerjee's special topics course? He damned sure ain't horrible. Maybe try that as they tend to be formatted differently(maybe less tests) even if the subject matter is challenging.  Or I imagine there are some cross listed with history or something.  Try those?",
