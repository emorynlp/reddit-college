      "text": "Eh....204 doesn't align with any book (maybe \"some\" portions of polymer/material science books and some portion of biochemistry/bio-organic texts) even though the 204 instructor may list it as the text.  It is its own madness where maybe some portions of Clayden will be useful.  There are other benefits of a physical copy like if you don't wanna stare at a computer screen all day or want to more easily mark the book up.",
