  "text": "This year, my estimated cost of attendance is 4x what I paid last year. I\u2019m super confused by this given that my FAFSA information did not change by much. Last year I was given a specific grant, however this year I didn\u2019t receive that grant. However last year I was in Oxford so idk tht may be a reason. Should I contact Emory financial aid?",
