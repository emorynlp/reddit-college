  "text": "With the rise of delta (and other variants), I feel like having multiple parties with hundreds attending is just an objectively bad idea. From a university that is supposedly so health-conscious...I feel worried. \n\nI also noticed when I signed into my portal the other day, we had to sign something saying we won't sue if things go back to virtual classes, lol. So clearly they know it's coming back, and we're likely headed back into lockdown. Yet they think this is okay? I don't quite understand it.",

One syllabus even had seating arrangements while also banning food/drinks so no one ever takes their mask off. Same professor also hinted heavily at going back online and added a whole section about it.",

I suspect that would really only happen if there are an insane amount of hospitalizations (versus a vaccinated individual getting whichever Covid strain and having no or fairly mild symptoms that are kind of similar to things that huge numbers people get each year that don't shut schools down) because of pretty severe symptoms.   Hopefully I'm right, but who knows? I think there is some evidence showing that the newer strains can hospitalize younger folks more than others, but then again, when you talk children, most are unvaccinated (for obvious reasons).  It would be interesting to see a large data set for what happens with those who get breakthrough infections in the college age to maybe like 30 y/o category.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus why even put such a dire prediction out there like that? lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean I know the online course rigor/COVID grading is a boon to many but damn! haha",
