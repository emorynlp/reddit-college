I would prefer to be a player over a DM, but I'm open to co-DMing if someone wants to split responsibility. \n\nAnyway, keep me updated if you don't mind. I have a friend at Emory who would likely be interested as well.\n\nI brought dice and 4 5e books to campus. I am happy to play in-person or online with Roll20.",
