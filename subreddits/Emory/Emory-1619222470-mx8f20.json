  "title:": "UC Davis vs Emory (and some questions about Emory and the Oxford college)",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm having a hard time deciding between these colleges so some insight and opinions would be great.\n\nUCD cost of attendance: 5k/year\n\nEmory cost of attendance: 42k/year (21k first year because I'm a spring admit at Oxford college)\n\nI'm not sure what to major in so the fact that students at Emory choose their major in the spring quarter of their sophomore year would be very beneficial for me. If I went to Davis I'd probably be doing Managerial Economics with a computer science double major or minor. So in Emory, I'd probably major in economics or something in the school of business. One thing I feel like a drawback about Emory is going through an admissions process after your first 2 years. How selective is the Goizueta business school and Emory college? Is there a lot of competition for extracurriculars at Oxford or are they easy to get? Thanks!",

Also Emory is a more prestigious school which is pretty important for Finance. I would definitely recommend Emory. The debt doesn\u2019t seem to be insane for the potential payoff",

              "text": "I would disagree IF it were 42k over 4 years but that ain't it.   They can either find another way or explore other options from Davis. Being in Cali is nice for other high paid options and they may also get to network (because UCs are huge) with those who can get them something good. I'm not gonna base my opinion on OP's current tunnelvision(like I worry when a pre-frosh automatically says \"I wanna make sure I do this very specific thing and I have to hedge my bets on the prestige of this place getting me it because I'm paying 160k.  Just not the best position to be in).\n\n If you pay like 160k, then at that point the outcome/track is much more high risk and they almost better stick to those plans and land that position(which is better at the prestigious school but it isn't clear why. For example, BYU historically outplaces places like Emory and some T20-30 schools for WS jobs straight out of undergrad. Does BYU's prestige explain that? Or is there a certain type of connectivity that individual students and families have because they are part of a particular community that is very well off in America?) if they wanna pay it back in a reasonable amount of time.  With 20k total, there is a lot more flexibility with what they can at least explore doing and if they still wanna pursue what they claim, they can do so with much less pressure.",

          "text": "DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GUY.\n\nThis guy is a 'prestige chaser', do not pay 160K for a bachelors degree. Emory is a good school, but it is only widely known on the East Coast. I lived in California for most of my life and never heard of Emory outside of college fairs. Plus the school is in Georgia. While Atlanta is a pretty progressive city, the state as a whole and even some aspects of life in Atlanta, are still 20-30 years behind the times compared to a state like California. \n\nThe UC system is the nations best public university system, and it's not like you're going to UC Merced in the middle of the sticks. You're only 20 mins outside of Sacramento at UC Davis. And it is so goddamn affordable in your case, 5k/yr is nothing! Hell take out a loan and freeroll on the hopes of getting 10K forgiven and you've lowered your cost down to 10k total.\n\nAnd again, I cannot stress this enough, this is for your goddamn Bachelors degree. And you still don't know what you even want to do. Why gamble 160K for a name on a piece of paper, especially if you end up going to graduate school. People are only going to care about the University name on your Master's or PhD.",

              "text": "I agree with everything EXCEPT the pretense that California is this bastion of progressiveness versus other places.  More like some highly problematic form of liberalism (and by that I mean genuinely \"progressive\" pockets but mostly neoliberal policies dominate and things like libertarianism have a big presence in the political scene and runs rampant in places that everyone at \"elite\" schools like Emory tend to celebrate like silicon valley), not to mention how it relatively recently a elected GOP governor(Oh Mr. Arnold).  It is no angelic paradise (and is barely affordable to those that are merely middle class now-a-days and a lot of that is due to bad policy by those across the ideological spectra).\n\nArguably the same things you said about GA could be said about New York and yet  I rarely see anyone one get on their Cali (or wherever) high horse and say those things about it.  If you wanna say that it is an economically wealthy and diverse state and has many major cities that is certainly true and ultra relevant but I wouldn't be highlighting how anything outside of a major city in another state is 30 years behind ALL of Cali.  There are parts of Cali (including near some major cities) that may be significantly behind where major urban centers in a place as wealthy as the U.S. is supposed to be.  Places like L.A. are the blueprint for the style of suburbia (and relative lack of public transportation...surely that can't be considered progressive) you see in major southern metros today and it and its metro also has the severe racism and other problems that we see in such places.  Let us not talk about the \"perfection\" that is the Bay Area.  California is as American as any other damned state and has almost all of its problems (sometimes exxagerated).",

UC Davis is a non-target. The OP indicated an interest in Finance and I was answering to that. Also get off the bs California high horse lmao. California has a lot of good things but nobody cares if it\u2019s more \u201cprogressive\u201d and 20-30 years ahead in that. Could be a bad thing.
