  "text": "I am an intern with the conference this year and I am here to share this opportunity to get academically published in a journal:\n\nThe Religious Studies Student Organization of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee cordially invites undergraduates and select Masters students in your program to participate in the Seventh Annual Religious Studies Research Conference. This year the conference will be held on April 13th, 2019 from 9:00 am until 2:00 pm, at the Hefter Center, on 3271 North Lake Drive.\n\nSelected papers will be published online, on Digital commons, and the student will be given the opportunity to present their research in an academic setting, to work closely with a mentor, and to improve their prospects for employment and further study.\n\nSubmissions from all academic disciplines are welcomed and encouraged, however papers should have an emphasis on religious practice or belief. Presenters should ensure they avoid promoting or belittling any one particular religion. Presenters will also be required to choose a faculty mentor to help direct them in the process of writing the paper and preparing to present it at the Conference. Each paper is allotted 15 minutes for presentation followed by 10 minutes for questions. Participation in the Conference includes complimentary breakfast and lunch for the presenters.\n\nRegistration for the Conference can be done by submitting a three-hundred-word abstract to uwm.rsso.conference@gmail.com. by March 8rd, 2019.\n\nHere is the poster for this years event: https://imgur.com/a/t9bNzCW And our academic journal, which is part of the UWM Digital Commons journal library collection, where past years presentations have been published: https://dc.uwm.edu/rsso/\n\nI am also happy to provide any additional verification to the moderators upon request. This is a great opportunity and I hope to see some of you guys in Milwaukee!\n",
