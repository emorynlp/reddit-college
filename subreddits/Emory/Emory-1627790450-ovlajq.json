  "text": "Hey,\n\nI received the email saying August 1st is the deadline to submit the immunization requirement or there will be a hold on my account. I have all of my physical/shots records and TB testing up to date recently and submitted everything I needed for compliance to the nursing school, but I didn't realize that the University level has a different form I need to fill out.\n\nThe form requires my health care provider to sign it, but I won't be able to get in contact with them until at least 8/2 or 8/3.  Will the hold impact the courses I have already registered for this fall 2021 and/or my enrollment?\n\nHave anyone been in a similar situation and just submitted it a few days past the due date with no problem afterward?",

      "text": "I was in the same boat! I remember the deadline was July 1st but I couldn\u2019t get my TB result till July 14th. I emailed and they said I didn\u2019t need a healthcare provider signature. Since I was born in a different country, I ended up submitting the immunization record from my country (translated to English), Emory TB questionnaire and TB result. Emory approved my immunization requirement :) I didn\u2019t need to fill out the Emory form at all except for the TB page (page 2 or 3 I think)",

I live in Nevada and our state keeps every resident\u2019s vaccination record online so I just sent them that PDF. For TB, I did the same thing. I had an online login to my lab results and I just downloaded that as a pdf and submitted that. They accepted all that :)",
