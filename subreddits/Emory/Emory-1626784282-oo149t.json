      "text": "there are pictures in the parent\u2019s facebook group. ask if they\u2019re in it \n\n\n- good community. knew of some friend groups that were just from complex \n- sinks are the smallest (all the other res halls have sinks with a small countertop around it). \n- separated from the freshman quad dorms\n- AC system is older. not a traditional thermostat\n- close to the business school and woodruff library\n- single gender floors\n- bathroom showers are small compared to Eagle/LSM, Raoul, Turman, etc.\n- good storage space. only dorm with built in closets\n- only dorm with a built in vanity \n- a little confusing to navigate at first (all the floors look the same) but you get used to it\n- i thought complex was really small when people didn\u2019t have roommates last year. i can\u2019t imagine two people living in some of the rooms. (i think it\u2019s still a great dorm however. raoul and LSM set the bar high)\n\noverall the students in complex seemed to enjoy it. the community is something my res hall didnt have",
