  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve recently been accepted into the Oxford campus and Housing Opens on April 1st. I want to know what are the best dorm room buildings at Oxford? I know all rooms are the same but I really want to know bathroom wise and social wise!",

      "text": "I graduated Ox17 and am not sure if anything has been renovated since, but when I was there:\n\n\nFleming - the newest, hardwood floors in most rooms instead of carpet, I think I was in the bathrooms once and they seemed nice. Right next to the small parking lot, which is nice if you can get a space haha. \n\n\nElizer/Murdy - second newest, lived in Elizer my freshman year. Had lots of good study rooms to hang out in and I had a bunch of friends in the building. All around solid building, I think a lot of study rooms got turned into rooms (including oversized triples) after I went to main due to over crowding. Not sure if that's changed. Rooms are somewhat narrow and absolutely everyone lofts their beds for more storage space.\n\n\nJRC - complex of four older buildings that were connected back in 96 when a few of the equestrian Olympic teams used them over the summer. Had a lot of friends here...it has its pros and cons. Pros:great community, super central location to all classroom buildings, dining hall, student centers etc, lots of study rooms. Cons:it is old, there were humidity issues in one of my friend's rooms so bad that she had to get a big ass dehumidifier that filled up every day in some seasons or else her clothes and shoes would mold, only two of the buildings had laundry rooms so you may have to haul all your laundry through the maze (freshmen do get lost lol) of hallways and steep staircases just to fight for a washer or dryer (do not sleep on your laundry in JRC, people will throw your wet clothes on the floor). Thank God I think the bathrooms were renovated recently so they should be nice now, they looked like something out of a horror movie when I was there. I'm not sure if the rooms have been renovated but they were generally cozy as long as they didn't have the humidity swamp problem hahaha. \n\nHaygood - older but was generally nice, lived in the basement triple my sophomore year (biggest room on campus, only three rooms on the whole basement    hall so even though the bathroom was small it was generally empty). Lots of spacious study rooms, right next to the big parking lot, right next to the dining hall, student center, late night grill. I really loved living there. In the spring I did suffer a humidity issue the last month I was there (moldy homework and my bed just felt...damp for like the last week) but I think that was more a basement issue than the whole building. \n\nThere aren't a lot of singles and the ones that exist tend to be reserved for people who need them for medical reasons. \n\n\"Community\" is a bit heard to judge cause it depends on who ends up in the building, RAs, res life, etc... but the campus is so small you can easily just walk to wherever your friends are.",

      "text": "Since community changes every two years I will say that JRC has the most Res life-y community. Claudia is great and she picks good RAs. Old building though so it gets a nummy reputation. \n\nFleming tends to be pretty party heavy, and puts you close to the shuttle for the big weekend rushes. \n\nHaygood is weird and far away from everything but the student center. \n\nElizer and Murdy are kinda the best of everything besides being kinda far but also this is Oxford and you can cross campus in 7 minutes.",
