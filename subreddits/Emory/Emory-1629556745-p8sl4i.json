I\u2019m currently on the wait-list for three other time blocks, and I\u2019m wondering if I need to leave those wait-lists before attempting to enroll in the new section of MATH 111 on Monday? Will I be prevented from registering in the new block if I am on the wait-list for another time of the same class?",

Now what you could possibly do is a swap type of thing with the waitlist where it maybe swaps the section you're in with the section you wanted.  But contact an advisor to confirm.",

      "text": "I don't know about the waitlist thing (I'll look it up when I get home because I think I saw some memo to faculty about its nuances a while ago) but be careful who you choose. Can't tell you which way it'll go but I think one of the new sections has a tenured professor (Roth) and I know on its face that sounds better to freshmen that don't fully understand STEM Ed. At research universities (and have been sold on this questionable idea that it is optimal to only be taught by professors/tenure track faculty vs. Grad students/post-docs, and instructional/lecture track faculty) but could be riskier than grad students (who probably went through a training course and sessions for the course and are more relateable. Roth was kind of just thrown in).  \n\nLike I don't think he's taught anything below like a 250 or 275 in a decade or more and I doubt he would accept the slot unless it was low maintenance to run (as in Garcia and others writing tests, quizzes, and other materials and he is less involved in the process) so he can focus on whatever upper division course and his research.",
