The class pace was very fast, you\u2019ll definitely get lost if you don\u2019t know the concept already. The good thing is that synchronous class wasn\u2019t taking attendance so you can watch it later.\n\nSome of Homework and coding assignments were not easy and took hours to finish. The exam wasn\u2019t too hard if you did all the practice quizzes.\n\nThe cut line of A was set to 96 at first which was insane, but he changed it to 94 later. About 50% of people was A at the end. \n\nOverall, it was not too hard to get an A, but the learning experience wasn\u2019t very good.",
