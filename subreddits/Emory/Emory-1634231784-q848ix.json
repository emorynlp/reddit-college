  "text": "I'm trying to sell my Sandstone (gold) Surface Laptop 3. It's a beautiful computer, touchscreen, updated, comes with the charger, all of that. 8gb. The only caveat is that there's a few thin cracks on the screen that are honestly pretty hard to see and they don't affect the functionality of the computer/touchscreen at all. I seriously forget they're there. I'm trying to sell it asap and if the cracks concern you, I'm more than willing to let you play around on it and test it out. It's a really nice laptop, and I'm sad to be selling it.",
