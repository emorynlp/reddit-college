  "text": "Hello! I am planning to take these two next year, and was wondering how these courses were in your guys' experience. What was the difficulty level for you (in terms of getting a good grade), workload, when did you take these courses (both in the same year?), and what professors do you recommend for these?\n\nAlso is it possible for freshmen to enroll in both of these courses their first year? (I have AP credit so I wont be taking BIO141 lecture, but will be taking lab)",

      "text": "I did the same thing as you (AP Credit for 141 lecture), I honestly recommend it. I took them both freshman year (141L in the fall, 142+L in the spring). Overall it was a good experience. None of them were tough courses, with a little bit of studying getting an A is more than doable. \n\nFor both semesters of lab, Dr Cole is the only instructor. Her labs generally run smoothly. For 142 lecture, the profs change pretty often, but Cole is a good option and Spell is great if you\u2019re looking for something more enriching. I took Dr Cafferty, he was alright.",

      "text": "Of course you can enroll in both in a year and STOP WORRYING ABOUT GRADES (It's too early for that.  Don't try to pre-manufacture it.  Choose a good professor and do the damned work.  There aren't any \"unfairly\" challenging professors for bio or really any of the intro STEMs where working and thinking a decent amount doesn't get you a solid grade).  They will be essentially normalized in these intros.  If you take a professor that challenges you in a meaningful way and they just so happen to have lower course averages than other sections, your section will be adjusted upwards to whatever the department targets as an appropriate course GPA at the end (or they may give EC or bonus points back, whatever). Do not take an instructor that writes exams and quizzes that are jokes and make you feel good because of the raw scores you tend to receive.  The material in these classes are very important if you are pre-med or pre-grad in any natural/life sciences so take the BEST instructor you can, not someone who gives you a false ego high.\n\nAlso, since you have an AP credit, I can almost assure you that nearly every option should be very doable for you even if you select an instructor that does intentionally try to challenge students. You'll perform relatively well, learn a lot, and end up fine. As for professor, try to get someone that is in person that is NOT Abreu (people say he's \"nice\" and stuff, but he seems lazy and not like the type that motivates any meaningful learning. Man apparently can't really even write and grade his own damned test questions properly).  You don't really have a choice for lab (it'll be some post-doc and directed by Cole so choose convenient times). When you take 142, try Spell or Cole if they teach (maybe the Nam guy if he comes back). You're unlikely to be challenged by the lecture courses, but at least choose someone who cares that you actually learn it/re-learn material at an acceptable level, isn't lazy, and tries to have fun.\n\nAlso, the workloads are sort of normalized. Some professors give more graded work but this ultimately helps spread out the grade (so exams aren't weighted so heavily), but often some of the additional assignments are useful. Bio 14x in its current form will be one of the easier intro STEMs you take no matter who you select as instructor.",

      "text": "I'm an Oxford freshman and took then online so it may not be the exact same for 142 especially since we get continuing writing credit for 142 that atl campus doesn't get but I found it easy. I took 141L at Atlanta campus and never had to study, it was very chill. And I hadn't taken AP bio since sophmore year of high school so I was worried 142 (I'm taking it at oxford) would be hard for me since I skipped 141 lecture using the credit but I barely have to study, it's quite easy imo. One of our TAs mentioned when he took it last year in person that he also barely had to study.",

          "text": "Doesn't it depend on who you take and aren't most of Ox's sections workload intensive in comparison to main's (I don't even wanna talk about Covid lab on main.  I'm not shocked it didn't take effort. The mess is in shambles it seems)? So of course you don't have to \"study\" for each individual exam perse if you are more immersed in the material leading up to them (versus a class where there are only exams and you just start cramming before it or whatever).  You've been sufficiently exposed to the material and exam level practice that hopefully you know it by time the exam rolls around.  If you found yourself hardly doing any work in the lecture components at all...that should be concerning (it's one thing if it made you work and learn and it just happened to \"click\" with you so you found it easy/didn't have to do much exam specific prep.  But if everyone generally found it simple at Ox, something isn't right).  Maybe take genetics or cell biology on main to compensate for that.  There are probably other courses as well, but something just sounds off based on your description (and it isn't your fault at all).  It would add up if it was main campus because seems they've intentionally watered down 141/142.",
