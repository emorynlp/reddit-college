I personally think Fossati is a fairly good professor, but the department has grown significantly since I took 170, so there could be others that are better. Generally, the TAs will be able to help you out a lot, so if you can delay taking the course until classes are back in-person, I would do that and take some other GERs or other major courses this semester",

                  "text": "I agree but at the same time I do think anyone majoring in STEM, especially math, physics, CS, or chemistry should view that average as \"typical\" and not \"scary\" or overly challenging.  It means you have to put in a decent amount of work or have some prior knowledge to do very well which should be the case in a STEM class and will be the case for most of them. \n\nThat 75% will likely earn someone a B- or B in the course(I think that is what most STEM intros including CS 170 target) which is fairly standard practice in courses that involve any serious problem solving component.  One should only expect consistently raw 80+ averages from STEM courses where success depends more on memorizing content or merely repeating/regurgitating methods you were shown or did already which are less common at selective schools than other places because we are  supposedly able to or willing to take on the challenge or \"think on our feet\" and make a dent in a few/couple of problems kind of different from what we may have been directly exposed to.  Not everyone does well on those types of items so it usually results in sub 80 averages.\n\n I guess I am just shocked at seeing people express so much fear or frustration about STEM courses with 75 or so averages(especially intros where many are new to college, somewhat challenging exams, whatever) when it is so standard throughout STEM classes. In fact I am kind of suspicious when students express surprise that averages in a STEM class are like that.  It is kind of like \"who and what are you taking for your courses in your STEM major if a raw average of 75 is shocking or rare?\"  \n\nIt makes me wonder if people are somehow doing something to engage a lower level of intensity and rigor than is typical at other high caliber schools(or again, even at Emory) where 75 or lower raw score averages for problem solving focused courses is basically unavoidable in a STEM major.  I just am not getting where these weird expectations of high averages even in problem solving oriented STEM courses are coming from.  I suppose I could understand if it was coming from freshmen but I think I am seeing it from sophomores and upper classmen as well.",

                          "text": "So.at least you are new. Thank goodness! I thought you were another weird upper classmen that expected STEM classes to be easy or have high class averages.  Either way, for now on, expect a 75ish to be normal especially for math classes and whatnot. They'll take that raw average which is a C or something and curve it to a B- or low B when that happens (in something like CS and math, this just a departmental norm for core courses and an 'easier' professor would also target that so instead of a 75, they may end up with 81 so that they don't have to do any adjustments).  You don't have to worry about raw class averages for tests and what not. \n\nDepending upon the level of the course, it may signify what type of challenge or studying the professor is trying to reward but even in the case of intentionally challenging courses, the final grades will usually be fair in the end and not punish students for taking on those demands and not being perfect.  Wanting to do Python is an okay reason, but being scared of a 75 average in a problem solving oriented survey class is really not.  You'll have to get over that if you wanna be a math major and get the level of training you deserve from Emory (in fact, while.there are some joke courses and professors, there really aren't enough throughout that major to avoid courses that have lower raw averages even if you wanted to)  Even pre-meds (I say 'even' because most classes in the pre-health STEM core are usually not as intense as intermediate and upper division maths either from a content point of view or the types of tests and problem sets written by professors) will encounter life sciences, chem, physics, whatever courses that will have that or lower (and most of them DO have experience in these disciplines) and they are currently 1st years.  Usually a 75ish in a survey problem solving focused STEM means that if you stay on top of things and do more than low level understanding of concepts,  you probably beat that average and end up with a B+ or higher. They are very fair so don't be afraid when you hear that going forward.  \n\nIf you hear like 60s and a serious curve, then anticipate a professor that is trying to push students to not just stay on top of stuff, but maybe be able to do significantly more complex applications than exposed to from time to time because they just wanna see what students can do/how they think beyond being obedient.  This is okay and likely good for you if serious about your field/major. Again, they'll adjust/curve up to sort of \"fix\" things and ensure that not everyone gets screwed vs. if they took another section that was more \"straight-forward\".  You'll be okay! Trust me.  You can handle this and there no need to be scared in the future (again, many of the better math instructors will be that way). Just make sure you have schedules that allow you to deal with the different types of classes in a way that optimizes your performance and chance of getting something out of the course.",

Most with no experience won't find it as such, but I do agree that it is probably just a standard weedout/somewhat intensive intro. course and that something is odd about all this squeamishness over 75 or so averages which are so common in STEM even at Emory still (I doubt things have changed that much since I've been there).  Usually courses that had test averages or raw course averages in the 60s or lower (and this is rare for 100 level STEMs and more common for upper divisions and intermediates depending on instructor) were deemed truly challenging by most whereas a gateway STEM course with 75ish averages is just considered typical and \"doable if you just put in the work\" largely because of what you said. They are large and often have students from a wide range of backgrounds and expectations.  \n\nWhen I see like a 200-300 level STEM with 75 or lower, that is typically when I buy that it may be particularly/intentionally challenging because those are usually more selective crowds.  There is something weird going on with the expectations and I don't know what it is and why. I thought people just expected STEMs like CS to be in this range or lower because even if it is relatively 'basic' it is trying to get folks to problem solve and prep them for tasks they may encounter in intermediates/upper divisions if they choose to major, so there will be a decent range of success levels on that sort of thing unless they re-use practice problems verbatim on HW, quizzes, and exams.",

It depends on what makes them up and who is teaching what/how courses are run and what type of demands each course has.  People can take 17 hours of joke stuff. You never know. I assume that isn't the case if you say you are trying to be a math major (as most enter with AP credits and start with some intermediate level maths or honors math when offered). Also word of advice to get on your professors' sides: Avoid asking them the anticipated raw class averages.  Sometimes they don't know and regardless, most just wanna see people get in there and do the best they can.  They'll respect and enjoy mentoring students who sort of just \"do it\" and make a great effort to develop and perform under any conditions/meet the demands whether the mentee/student ends up making an A or not (and be kind to yourself, if CS is technically outside of your main interests and is just part of the major or supplemental, it is okay if you get a less than perfect grade or if you find the course tough). Definitely don't start talking about grades and difficulty of the course with a professor early in the semester Some may take it the wrong way.  \n\nThey like it even when students can at least pretend that they simply wanna learn or engage whatever material at the level it is pitched just cause.  Don't go in and ever immediately signal: \"I'm here to check this box off and get a grade\". You never know who can become your mentor and those outside of your major may make great ones or help you in unanticipated ways. Establish as many good relationships with professors as you can. This involves at least feigning an interest or investment in the course beyond a grade.Try to think beyond each individual course and its final grade or whatever (I know it is hard to think this way when adjusting to college as getting in was more about putting on a show of sorts and trying to manufacture paper based perfection).",
