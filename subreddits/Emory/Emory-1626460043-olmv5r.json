  "text": "I\u2019m interested in auditioning for the EUSO for this upcoming semester, but I\u2019m a little confused as to what the repertoire conditions of the audition are. \n\nThe website states that \u201cnew and returning students may select up to six minutes of audition works from the standard solo, orchestral, and etude repertoire. A single piece with contrasting sections is also an acceptable option.\u201d \n\nDoes this mean that I have to work up 6 minutes of a solo piece, orchestral except, and etude repertoire if I don\u2019t have a single piece with contrasting sections? Also if y\u2019all don\u2019t mind, could you tell me a little bit about your experience in the orchestra? I heard from some people that orchestra took a lot of time, and that\u2019s kinda stressing me out a little",

      "text": "6 min is the max they are looking for, more as a guideline if a long movement of something. If not doing that, do \\~4 min of contrasting etudes and excerpts.  \n\nI was in orchestra all 4 years, graduated 2020. Started as a double major with music, dropped music major but still kept doing ensembles. Its not a lot of time if playing in an ensemble is something you are actually interested in doing. Doing multiple ensembles with the major class requirements and lessons can be a fair bit of time, but you dont need to do everying to still be in the ensembles. Dr. Bhasin can be accomodating of people who are good musicians but are not full music majors. That is one thing that is very good about music at Emory; the faculty is generally understanding that people arnt necessarily looking to do music as a career and have other interests and commitments. If you are a string player, doing just orchestra with some personal practice time, and special rehearsals & concerts, its probably 8 - 10 hours a week over the semester, averaged out. Brass or woodwind is a bit less. If continuing to play music in college is important of you, you can find a way to prioritize this amount of time. Also guaranteed A if you just show up and are at least semi-prepared",
