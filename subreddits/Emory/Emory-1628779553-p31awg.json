      "text": "Start at the link below because unless a student is attached to a career center they can only talk about themselves and their narrow friend group.  Now granted the econ. department \"may\" embellish things for all we know, they look to be mostly honest. For example with the class of 2021, they honestly reported that only 43% received offers which is what you'd expect considering Covid and the uncertainty a lot of employers were likely experiencing.  Also, they never report like 80-100% which makes sense because much of placement is up to students and since econ is a part of ECAS, it shares a career center with like 60-70 other majors versus having a specialized one like GBS.  This means you have to do well and be a more independent go-getter and researcher of careers, internships, etc (and it may help to be open minded about them versus having tunnelvision on very specific careers that everyone has heard of.  Plenty of other jobs pay as well and may offer higher quality work environments than these classic fields glamorized by media and whatnot.  I can tell you many Emory students fail in the \"open-minded\" department and also sort of think that if they just contrive a high GPA via  clever course selection, that jobs and oppurtunities will just come and find them or something.  No, you need to be deliberate about taking courses and doing little personal projects that develop skills a wide variety of employers may want in addition to performing as well as you can).  \n\nConsidering all that, this appears to be solid outcomes, perhaps much better than like a decade ago when the department was known even to ECAS admins and some employers as a little on the grade inflated and 'too easy' side of things for an econ. department at a school as selective as Emory:  [http://economics.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/career-post-grad/econ-major-minor-placement/index.html](http://economics.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/career-post-grad/econ-major-minor-placement/index.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMO they still may have some work to do on that front but it has obviously turned around quite a bit and they've been able to hire new people, create new concentrations and tracks, etc, so they are much healthier than back then.",

              "text": "I don't necessarily agree with that.   It really is mostly about what YOU do. I would say the bba program is just better at ensuring students are aggressive with co and extra curriculars. You can easily do that in econ too if you don't fall into a trap of being sort of flippant about things. It isn't bba level infrastructure but it has a lot of things for UGs to do that'll immerse themselves in the dept and enhance the resume.  Also, the two just emphasize learning from a different perspective and a good intellectual fit may be worthwhile in the end.  Don't be overly pragmatic just yet is what I'm saying",

      "text": "I\u2019m an Econ major. From my experience, Econ majors do a variety of things - from law school to finance to data analytics. Most of the Econ majors did pretty well for themselves - especially the ones who paired Econ with a quantitative major like QTM or Math. \n\nMany Econ majors double major. In my case, I am doing the Econ Math dual major. From my experience, many of the people who went my route did data analytics. I also know people who went into investment banking and management consulting. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a graduate degree but of course, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to go into data science, a graduate degree would be very helpful. If you want to go into high finance, you will not need a graduate degree. I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of Emory Econ majors seem to go to Columbia, Penn, or Duke for a graduate degree\u2026\n\nAgain, starting salary depends on what field an Econ major enters. For investment banking, 120K+ right out of college is common. But I\u2019d say the average is like ~70K.",
