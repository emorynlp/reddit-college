  "text": "Hi everyone, incoming first year here! I\u2019m going to be at the Atlanta campus this next year, and I was wondering if Emory had placement tests. I know Oxford does, and people who are taking Chem 150 need to take smth like but not exactly a placement test, but I was having trouble finding any answers. Could someone help me out? Thanks!",

      "text": "For Chem 150 at Atlanta campus, you must complete the ECCP on ALEKS. It starts with a diagnostic test and then makes you learn all the topics you\u2019ve missed. Especially if your chem background is weak, give yourself a LOT of time to do this. ALEKS is tedious as hell and is not a friend to the procrastinator. You can find more info about the ECCP and how to access it on the chemistry department website.\n\nECCP Info: http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/student-support.html\n\nLanguages also have placement tests, and those can be found on the department\u2019s websites.",
