      "text": "If you play piano, there are a lot of random pianos in places for public use, like in some residence halls.\n\nYou're not supposed to, but you can use the practice rooms if someone isn't in there (most people do this). If someone comes who has scheduled the practice room, you will have to leave though. If you're a non-music major but taking private lessons at Emory, you can use the practice rooms",
