  "text": "It is a 1-unit class. There is no reason for it to have just as much--sometimes even more--reading as my 4-unit Physics or 3-unit English class.\n\nNot to mention, material on assessments is never learned in classes and can only be learned from reading.\n\nI'm all for teaching students about health in an in-depth curriculum. But you CANNOT do so in a class worth as many credits as PACE.",

They probably figure they can get away with more without harming y'all that much even if it is graded.  Imagine if it were 2-4 hours.  I for sure would understand the panicking.",

It\u2019s like an actual course that we have to do long weekly readings for and class.\n\nThey hardly go over any material and the practice test was absurdly specific and complicated (asking about like which macromolecule makes ghrellin. Like this isn\u2019t a Bio or Chem class, that shouldn\u2019t be important. Why do I need to understand that for my everyday health?)\n\nI guess it being low for hours is a blessing and a curse though because as you said, it won\u2019t effect our scores that much. But for the level of work that is requires it\u2019s absurd IMO. They expect us to treat it like any other 3 credit course. I actually have more work in this than some of my other courses.",

                  "text": "Trust me. I know the problem and remember it being that way.  It does sound like they are doing even more specifics because they know there are many future human health majors (not a constituent they had when I had to deal with it eons ago.  But even then it was very annoying) so maybe made it more of a preview for them (many of the other human health courses are nutrition and more STEM based so I think that is possible.) Who knows? It never made sense.  Just put it down as one of the memorable experiences that all Emory students suffered through because it seems to not have changed but so much.    \n\nTricky thing about evaluating credit hours versus workload and comparing courses is that you begin to wonder if it is an indictment of the courses with higher amounts of units with less/little work, the low unit course with lots of work, or both to some extent.",

      "text": "You'll find that often credit hour allocations are somewhat arbitrary and have nothing to do with reading or workload (supposedly it only correlates with contact hours, but I am not convinced). As for reading versus lecture on assessments:  This is unlikely to be the first time you experience this.  The original Health 100 rendition before the one you took/are taking was probably more intensive (I remember we had an additional discussion/breakout session).  I am sure it sucks, but it won't be the first time things don't add up for a class.  For all the STEM people out there, wait for some of the key labs (like if you take a chem lab with Mulford, compare it to say..chem 150 lab with whoever and note how both are 2 credit hours.  Trust me the former will rival some 3 and 4 unit courses).  The variances in credit hour allocation vs. workload will astound you in some cases.\n\nJust put this on the academic portion of a \"things that don't make much sense at Emory\" and keep it moving I guess.",
