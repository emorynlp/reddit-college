  "title:": "For anybody wondering about Emory ATL vs Oxford experience",
  "text": "I attended Oxford my first two years and experienced Emory ATL for almost a year until Covid. I just wanted to share my opinions between the campuses in case anyone is trying to decide between them. I'm trying to speak for the overall student body, meaning these opinions are based not only on my own experiences but from talking to others comparing campuses as well. I guess you could say there might be an Oxford bias since the only ppl who actually know the differences between campuses are Oxford continuees, but I will try to be objective.\n\nPros\n\nOxford's small class sizes means you get to know your classmates and professor better. It's really easy to form a relationship with your prof (Ox professors have a more student centric attitude, at Emory ATL profs are often more focused on their own research or project than their students) and if they like you enough, you'll get leadership, research positions, and recs easily. Not saying it's hard to form a relationship with a professor at ATL, I'm just saying I think it's easier at Oxford.\n\nThere is a better sense of community at Oxford. It felt like people actually  cared about each other (I guess bc it's small and convenient to hangout). My closest college friends were from Oxford, and Oxford friends tend to stick together even after moving campuses. At Emory ATL, it felt like everyone was doing their own thing and it was sort of a depressing environment bc so many people i talked to felt stressed and overworked.\n\nAt  ATL, I was so overworked that if I went to a party or something, I  would have to sacrifice sleep or studying. At Oxford, you can have all 3: sleep, social, and study.\n\nOxford feels easier to ease into as a freshman. Oxford straight from the orientation was welcoming and fun. My first semester at Oxford was great and I wasn't stressed. I've heard of so many Emory ATL freshmen who had a horrible time because they weren't used to the environment and workload.\n\nFree cookies every week at Oxford (for me that was huge lol) and events like petting zoos, bouncy  castle, ferris wheel, foam parties, Dooley's tavern parties, super smash tournaments were awesome because I actually knew a majority of the people there. And for finals week events, EVERYONE would go and because it's a small campus, you know so many people it's just a great time. I never had that feeling of solidarity at Emory ATL. Emory ATL feels like there's little to no school spirit, and most people are just doing their own thing.\n\nIf you're a bio major, Bio at Oxford >>> Bio at Emory (just comparing the 100-200 level classes). Just trust me, any OxAlum bio major would agree.\n\nOSB is really nice and new, and if you're doing bio or chem labs, they are higher quality at Oxford. I remember my orgo lab at Emory ATL felt like I was using old backroom equipment from the 90s (because I was).\n\nThe buildings are often renovated at Oxford. In my 2 years there, I got to experience brand new equipment in OSB, a new residential hall called Fleming, Pierce hall renovations, Greek life building renovations, the new Lills dining hall, renovated library, and a renovated student center. There is also a brand new student center. The buildings are very nice. Now they need to expand the gym and fix JRC.\n\nAcademically, Oxford performs better than Emory ATL campus. Students at the top of  Emory's graduating class every year are disproportionately Oxford continuees. No, it's not because the classes are easier at Oxford, it's because there's little to no distractions so you have a ton of time to study. Historically, Oxford was designed as a Benedictine campus, which means its students are there to shut out the outside world and focus purely on studying the liberal arts. Nowadays, it's not so extreme, but you definitely feel like you have a lot of time to study at Oxford.\n\nOxford produces influential student leaders. [https://www.alumni.emory.edu/\\_includes/documents/sections/awards/100SH-2021.pdf](https://www.alumni.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/awards/100SH-2021.pdf) The 100 senior honorary recognizes outstanding graduating students and alumni leaders, and there are 22 Ox students in the list despite Oxford enrollment being 15% of the Emory undergraduate body. I know this is just one metric for comparison, but I felt like student leaders at Oxford were more involved than at Emory ATL, and that's probably just because of the nature of small campus vs large campus.\n\nCons\n\nOxford is two years, so clubs fluctuate wildly in popularity. Every year, it feels like the campus dynamic could change. Luckily, it was pretty good for my 2 years being there. Also, this means your ECs at Oxford are maximum 2 years commitment.\n\nEmory ATL has more EC opportunities than Oxford in every area. Research, TA, volunteering, clubs, etc. ATL itself has a ton of EC opportunities whereas Covington is a ghost town in comparison, although there is still Piedmont hospital, VolunteerOxford, and a few other EC opportunities. Doesn't mean you can't get quality ECs at Oxford, but your options are more plentiful at ATL. Also, consider that Oxford is a smaller campus, so there is less need for more EC options.\n\nEmory ATL food options are way better. Just facts.\n\nWill reiterate this: Covington is a ghost town compared to Atlanta. Mystic grill and other niche places are interesting for a few visits, but Covington square gets old pretty fast. ATL has alot more going on.\n\nOxford social scene tends to get a little cliquey, so that's a good or bad thing depending on the person.\n\nYou're more likely to meet a prestigious researcher, writer, or artist at Emory ATL than Oxford, although depending on who you are, this might not really matter to you.\n\nMore options for Emory ATL facilities (gym, student health, study areas). I think Emory ATL campus is prettier than Oxford personally, but you should've seen Oxford before Hurricane Irma. The trees were GLORIOUS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall:  If you want a more personal, community based, and relaxed college experience while getting an academic head start in your first 2 years, Oxford is best. If you want more options in terms of ECs, food, facilities, city life, and length of commitment, go for Emory ATL. Neither campus is superior over the other. Both produce immensely  successful students and are great in their own ways.",

      "text": "I need to know why people keep bringing up and pushing this \"top of the class\" stuff as if everyone had the same 4 years or as if GPA is how \"top of the class\" is defined at Emory.  Emory does not award the Latin Honors based on GPA(and even most departmental academic awards don't do that. They tend to be biased towards those who conduct research or have an excellent piece of tangible work). You have to do an honors thesis and that is far more impactful than claiming you had a high GPA however many years on main.  If they are disproportionately earning honors via the thesis (which is true in some departments like physics for sure), THAT is what people should brag about. \n\nUnless people took the same courses with the same professors then GPA comparisons (especially considering how many have a  high GPA, it is like splitting hairs in ways that have no consequences) don't measure much.  Sometimes they may measure course and professor selection strategies better than meaningful achievement or intellectual development.\n\nEither way, I believe everything else but that bio stuff.  I don't see how you compare a few lower division and intermediate courses(and I'll admit those are absolutely done well at Oxford) and professors to a selection of upper divisions and intermediates so large that most people won't take half of the options. Plus, as I always mention, there is a tendency of \"certain crowds\" to avoid the courses that I (and even many who were initially going to avoid them but took anyway) would personally consider excellent/the best.\n\n  For example, there are certain courses that have a very large enrollment (and one isn't even a damned med. school or MCAT pre-req) due to demand that have the dullest and worst professors and I am sure many aren't trying to look for better. They just get the grade in those bandwagon classes, check off the elective requirement box, keep trucking.  It just usually isn't enough to draw any meaningful comparisons or conclusions. To me, the best bio classes tend to have certain characteristics (regardless of professors or content) and they don't tend to be ones that make them anything like lower divisions (even those at Oxford).",

          "text": "Another perspective from an Oxford bio alum (granted, I\u2019m not in med school and didn\u2019t care for which professors prep for the MCAT, like Dr. Beck I\u2019ve heard):\n\nAgreed that you can\u2019t make a fair comparison between the 100-300 level courses between Oxford and Atlanta simply because Oxford people haven\u2019t taken 141 and 142 (or whatever the equivalent is now) in Atlanta. Oxford only has a handful of 200-level courses, like field botany. \n\nIn so many of the intermediate/upper level courses I took in Atlanta, the classes were so large that the professors didn\u2019t even know who I was, except for Dr. Starnes who taught CVA/Bio 205 (she was a gem), but I believe she retired this year. \n\nAt Oxford, none of the classes I took had more than 25 students, and there was much more interaction with the professor. Plus, each class has an SI and a lab TA whom the professor chose from the previous year usually based on the highest grade in the class. Atlanta had all grad TA\u2019s from what I remember, aside from Dr. Starnes who had three undergrad TA\u2019s from the previous year who covered the lecture and the lab. \n\nI found the exams in Atlanta to be more multiple-choice based and involved less critical thinking than the Oxford exams did, probably because of the much larger class size (sometimes 80+) and because professors like Dr. Fritz and Dr. Koelle (newer professor who teaches evolutionary) run labs with grad students. We also never had to use Learning Catalytics at Oxford.",

              "text": "Yep those are the classes  and professors I am talking about and I know Koelle was supposedly awful (even at Duke).  Gerardo(I took her, despite being full professor, excellent and serious teacher!), Arbilly, and Morran are apparently solid for 241, but what I will say is that 241 IS decently designed for an evolutionary biology course vs. most other universities (research intensive). It has the right intent even if people like Koelle's rendition aren't the best. The focus on data and real scenarios is actually not common sadly.  I think Gerardo and Beck designed the course. I respect what they tried but naturally most research heavy professors will find loopholes when they have to teach a significant amount of students.\n\n  And I agree on the other courses being large. I wholesale avoided most of those for that exact reason. I was also a chem major so was in serious problem solving/open ended mode bias. I didn't wanna sit in straight up lectures and do MCQ/completely close ended details oriented exams/quizzes and that is what most of those courses offered sadly. Some of them were quite embarrassing I won't lie (336....wow! The version at GSU is far better. You'd be shocked. Why 336 has TAs and Learning Assistants and \"problem sets\" now-a-days. I don't know. Students can just go look up answers in the book because it is all labelling and detail focused short answers. It looks like a really content intensive HS course more so than an Emory course, but research Us seem to be terrible at teaching that and biochem). The only well run and memorable memorization oriented class I took was with Starnes and I still had issues with it. The smaller and medium sized research oriented courses are the best way to go for both pre-meds AND pre-grads (which is what I was). And even if you had to work and think harder, grades tended to be higher despite everyone worried about what a thinking intensive bio course could do to their GPA. I know for a fact that 336 would play tricks to ensure its ending course GPA was a solid B and then since the course isn't really case or research based, most of the material won't be retained anyway.  I don't see PHAs at other elites \"strongly\" recommend human phys. for pre-meds. They recommend stuff like immunology, cancer bio, and cell biology (maybe micro which I would dodge because....Campbell. But at least it has a discussion section so has some use in terms of learning a little bit of research based microbio)",

                      "text": "I don't know about hate her but she checked out of teaching years ago it seems.  What I remember her for is being too lazy to write different tests for micro and the people in frats exploiting it (she forgot that she used to give them back at one point) so one year they were idiots and a bunch of them took the test in less than 30 minutes and she got mad at them.\n\nThe department is also trying to move further in the direction of things like pbl and cbl (even research faculty are trying to get on board) and she refuses on the basis of \"I don't believe in all of that stuff\". She should just say \"if I do that, I'll have to put in as much effort as y'all will\".  The thing is, even if she wasn't condescending and was really nice, I always warn people that these \"kind\" teachers with low demands and shitty teaching are NOT doing it/being nice because they love students so much. They do it because THEY don't wanna work hard. If you challenge students, you have to put in effort to support them in a lot of ways so that they can rise to the challenge or else they'll roast you in evals.  I think a lot of students see it as:\"well they smile, inflect their voices in lecture, and give ultra predictable tests so they must really like us and respect our difficult and busy plights as students\".  They are actually giving sub-par preparation for things like the MCAT or research (and especially grad school which has hurdles before you can even join a lab or hit candidacy), but the instant gratification of an easier feeling grade obscures that possibility for high achievers.\n\nSo some teachers who even have potential to challenge students in a useful way and maybe even do it well just won't and will just \"play nice\" because it is easier to get better evals by just giving students some garbage to learn or do, and then sound enthasiastic in lecture and keep a smile on their faces when talking to students.  That used to be Campbell.  People have to be careful when they praise these types of teachers in earlier in their careers or be careful not to bash the more rigorous professors who really are putting in the work. They often become bitter later because they didn't wanna teach at that level(or have been scared out of teaching what is technically effectively) but feel trapped because they know it works. I think even Spell has become a bit more jaded over time but at least she tries to keep it rigorous in some meaningful way whether students like it at the time or not. She sticks to what excites her so even in a bad year, she ends up better than Campbell.",

Not to mention the professor was very compassionate and interested in making sure students understood the material and could apply it to the various case studies assigned.\n\nOne last thing, Campbell is a sucker for rules and reported a friend of mine to honor council for two cited sentences in a small writing assignment that sounded too close to the source.

Good to know that I can at least recommend someone for Microbiol. I think she teaches another special topics upper division too so maybe that is good as well (seems the ecology and disease ecology cluster is growing at Emory between bio and environmental science). What is sad when you really think about it is that people like O'Toole, Abreu, and Campbell are LECTURERS that are supposed to be completely dedicated to teaching UGs and now there are like several research faculty (including junior faculty like Vega and Civitello for whom it is risky to teach with rigor) who seem more serious about teaching from what I am hearing.

And this is coming from a premed perspective, so comparing premeds to premeds that's generally what I've heard from students and faculty. Have never seen a statistic to prove it honestly.\n\nWhen I compare the bio departments, I meant comparing just those year 1-2 classes between oxford and ATL because typically you're not gonna be taking many 300-400 level classes as a year 1 or 2, so they're irrelevant to the Ox vs ATL comparison. I compared 141 and 142 by asking ATL bio students what it was like, and it seemed less rigorous in some area, especially the lab. What I mean by OxBio being better is the overall experience of classes. Ask any Oxford student who took zoology and they'll say it's one of the best classes they ever had. What's a good class? One that is hard but enjoyable, so you are motivated to learn and put in more work than you thought you could. A class that pushes you beyond your expectations. Also a class where students are united through a common struggle, and a bond is formed between students and professor.",

It'll be like splitting hairs comparing many of them. Like a 3.95 and a 4.0 are the same in the eyes of most med. schools and the rest of the app would have to differentiate them.  Emory has no award that they can slap on a resume that would differentiate between these two and there a quite a few pre-meds and even pre-grad STEM majors who took on much more intense courseloads than most pre-meds who fall in this range1). I also understand all of that about bio as well.  We discussed it below. Emory bio, like any large bio dept is a mixed bag and since Emory bio majors lean more heavily pre-med than NBB or chem, there is clustering(enrollment levels) in what I consider some of the weakest courses and professors. Some of that isn't their fault because things like biol 301 are a de facto requirement but those other courses people bandwagon to can easily be avoided and replaced with something better. And most ATL biol 14x sections ARE less rigorous than most Ox sections (and so is the content) but it isn't a reflection of the better upper division courses which tend not to get high enrollment levels.",

At ATL, I took evo bio (solid with Morran), human phys (good), bio 264 genetics (meh), bio 301(bad, Abreu taught us a bunch of false things lol..), bio 320 animal behavior (bad), and bio 465 rna biotech (good).

                      "text": "Med. schools love a bunch of other stuff (going based on some really successful pre-meds I've tutored in ochem and mentored when I was there generally) and some are biased towards those who not only have a 3.8/3.85+ GPA but have significant research experiences AND even took more rigorous courses than an average pre-med. Places like Princeton know this which is why they advise students taking extra bio classes to do stuff like cell and immunology and not physiology (I would say few top tiers are recommending that to pre-healths and 1/2 have bio depts that don't offer a 336 equivalent yet they kill Emory in placement. Food for thought especially since Emory 336 is not an emory level course IMO.  At least not when run by Shepherd or Cafferty).\n\n They love numbers but so many(especially the higher ranked ones) love scholarship just as much.  And yes like 1/2 of your classes were jokes.  264 was at least useful even if you say \"meh\" because of the discussion section (which annoys many pre-meds but is kind of what you'll get on an  MCAT).  Same with evol.  Even with a bad professor, the format and discussion section make it good MCAT and pre-grad prep (some MCAT passages are formatted exactly like 241 test questions but are just only MCQ).\n\nHowever the good courses I am talking about prioritize primary literature and experimental either in lecture if only that is available or in lecture AND discussion.  There are also the CURES taught by Beck, Morran, and Gerardo which are probably great and don't jeopardize your GPA. I also recommend people not limit themselves to things that sound \"pre-meddy\" in the course title. Like a lot of the ecology cluster courses are very interdisciplinary and taught well.  I think people are being overly concerned about GPA. Most of these classes grade the same overall. The intellectually easier ones like 336 and 301 are graded based on tests and quizzes whereas others that require more thought spread out the grade away from that stuff.\n\n Like taking Eisen, Civitello, or Vega for stuff shouldn't be viewed as threats especially if you wanna apply to those top research intensive MD programs (some which have very different curricula than other MDs. As in they focus more on those styles of learning than memorization of typical MD programs and I imagine that STEP 1 going pass/fail may encourage more. programs to go that direction). I also hear Deal does a pretty solid version of cell biol which is surprising because his 264 lecture was dull as hell (on top of dull/142 overlapping content). \n\n*My point has been to promote the classes with a serious emphasis on experimental biology and primary literature reading (even more meh classes like evol and 264, but also the 250s, 352s, 347, 247, 455, etc) when possible. They aren't actually overly difficult and train well for MCAT IMO. You'll likely forget the material in memorization based classes anyway because most of those teachers write low level tests that don't encourage retention over time.  Some of the courses I promote have no or very few exams/lower exam weighting even if they make you think a bit more.",

Some aren't aware of the nature of the 2015 changes). Many came from sorry biol 14x sections where they memorized some stuff or problem types and it showed up on the test exactly like they remembered it and they celebrated the instructor for that.  It sends a signal that it is what pre-meds want so they find a way to do that while playing tricks to yield the department desired grade distribution in those particular upper divisions (as long as the tests are mostly fact regurgitation and low level problems for them to repeat most students will declare the teacher and tests as \"fair\" anyway). I mean, y'all just have to demand something different but I don't know if enough students would be down for that sadly. \n\n When you sign up for classes like 336 and 301 most do have pre-conceptions of what they are supposed to be like. But make your money worthwhile and contact Spell or L-hernault and say \"hey I think we should do better here. The MCAT demands that we learn these skills and these heavily enrolled courses don't seem to focus on that.  Can the instructors perhaps be encouraged to consider integrating x, y, z? Or can someone else be asked to teach a section?\" Stuff like that. \n\nBasically pay it forward for the future. More Emory students getting super strong MCATs and placing into med. schools at higher rates and across a bigger range of GPAs enhances the reputation and value of the degree from areas like biol for everyone.  \n\n And biochem is poorly taught at most research Us from what I've seen (maybe a few super elite privates and UCLA have good renditions of metabolic biochem. Others aren't too far off from bio bchem at Emory).  Physiology, no excuses. I've seen MUCH better.  Jaeger used to run a \"decent\" version of it at one point though. \n\nAnd good for 465! And that's fine. I imagine the Ox courses to generally be more immersive (with all having a lab component and things like that). Emory should have more biology courses with a lab option or continue expanding (and advertising) the CUREs they are beginning to offer.",
