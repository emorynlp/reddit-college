You will immediately notice the point you get off of Emory's property bc the roads look busted (especially North Decatur road)\n\n\u2022Emory has a bike shop called the Fixie, which I go to often. They sometimes have free inner tubing and free cement patches for small holes.\n\n\u2022If you really like biking, and are considering it as a way to exercise, then you could try going on one of the PATH trails onfront of clairmont campus (that continues between highland lakes and clairmont reserves apartment complex",

Make sure to get a lock bc yes, some bikes have been stolen:[\n\nYou would at most be saving 5 minutes if you bike to classes. I could give an example? If I am at chem building but I need to go to bio building.  That would make a 10-15 min walk into a 5 min ride (including \"parking\" your bike). Another example? If I am at business school and need to go to visual arts building, that's another 15 min walk turned into a 5-10min ride.\n\nBut hey, walking to classes with friends and catching up through small talk is also fun too. I'd say bikes would be more useful during on-campus years when you get sudden urges to \"leave\" campus and head on out to trails or nearby shopping centers.",
