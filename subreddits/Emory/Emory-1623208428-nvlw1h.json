You need the deans approval from main campus and ox, and you also need availability in the class. Because of this we won't really know if we're able to get the class until the first week of school (mid-late aug). Its tough being an ox student, but I'm glad you realized early on your interest in the class. You still have plenty time :)",

It works out -- you don't need to have your foreign language requirements fulfilled before you leave Oxford, so don't worry about this requirement till later. But I do suggest-- if you're interested in any other language, you should take that instead. Korean is a pain in the :D. The KRN profs love their sookjae.",
