              "text": "Hey there!  All of the shuttles are equipped with ramps.  The drivers are trained and expected to deploy ramps for anyone who requests it.  So, please let our driver know.  If the ramp is not working, we need to know!  The bus should not go into the service with a ramp out of order.  And if you (or anyone) is ever scoffed at by someone for requesting the ramp isn't a kind person.  \n\nBy the way, we can pull data on how often the ramps are used.  It's something I (we) use to determine routes with more requests.  Our shuttles represent a small part of Emory's dedication to the entire community.\n\nLastly, if you want to email me directly (paul.reeves@emory.edu), I will make sure you are put in touch with the best person on our team to help with your journeys on campus.",

Also, no one riding the shuttle gives it a second thought. A guy in a wheelchair used to ride the shuttle home with me every day. I was happy that we had a bus that he could get back and forth to work in.",
