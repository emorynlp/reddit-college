  "text": "Sorry if this is a weird question; I was just wondering how much time y'all spend studying at Emory? I was watching a few videos on YouTube from current students and the vibe I'm getting is Emory places lots of emphasis on academics, which takes away from social life. Obviously I'm going to college to learn and get a degree, but I also want to be able to join clubs, party, and do things outside the classroom. In high school I took lots of APs and honors but everyone at Emory seems so smart and I feel like I'll be spending 90% of my time studying for classes if I end up attending :/\n\nAlso just as a side note, I'll be studying business but any info about the undergrad courses is greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Partying is basically a prerec for B-School. Just call it \"building your network\". \n\nHowever, Emory isn't the biggest party school: look to big state schools or more atheletic schools for that. \n\nHow easy you find general coursework at emory depends heavily on what your HS preparation coming in. Unfortunately, kids often find that hard to assess coming in. Look at where your GPA/SAT/AP stats are compared to emory admitted class generally. If you are in the top quartile, you should find classes v manageable (like a part time job). Middle 50: expect to spend a good amount of your time on classes (like a full time job). Bottom 25: be prepared to take full advantage of emory's academic support resources like the writing center, EPass, office hours, ect. Don't enroll in an extremely ambitious 1st semester work load. \n\nGood luck with your college decision!",

      "text": "You do realize that those Youtubers were studying a decent amount and often admitted procrastinating BECAUSE they socialized and did a bunch of other stuff. You like everyone else will have to learn how to manage your time if you want to get a useful academic and social experience. It isn't whether the \"school\" places a heavy emphasis on academics, it is mainly the students and it is freaking Emory so they do.  It is absolutely a play hard work harder type of environment.  You would get much less out of the type of UG programs it excels in if they were less intense (and you shouldn't pay so much for the same intensity/level of training you would get at cheaper and supposedly less intense schools. Theoretically your degree is supposed to be worth more because you have better training as well as better networks).\n\nEither way, yes Emory students heavily cluster in majors(maybe even more so than some near ranked peer Universities) that require a good amount of effort inside and outside the classroom and most are able to do a decent balance between that and social life but those types of academic pathways aren't gonna be walks in the park.\n\nI do think the measuring yourself vs. the incoming stats IQR is good enough for business pre-reqs and courses but don't expect it to work in STEM classes.  Those courses are often or sometimes hard enough to make even top quartile students struggle. AP/IB and HS calibre will be a difference maker for harder classes (especially in STEM, but even outside of it.  Like many people just haven't had much exposure to certain types and styles of learning and testing in k-12 no matter their SAT/GPA. Some courses are meant to be universally challenging regardless of any of that and the b-school may actually have some professors that run courses like that.  I hear B-law can be very challenging to many for example and it is a requirement afaik.  So a lot of the b-school courses are super straight forward but don't get complacent and expect a lot of group projects and case studies even in easier courses. Again the latter deviates from how most were assessed in k-12 so it may be an adjustment).",

For the STEM classes, I'm guessing you're referring mainly to engineering/comp sci? I'll definitely be taking math courses during undergrad which I don't expect to be easy but I also don't expect those to kill my gpa (it that correct or not really?) It seems like other people on here are saying similar things about the business coursework - not incredibly hard but you still have to put in a decent amount of effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much for all the input :)",

              "text": "How am I supposed to know if they will kill YOUR GPA? I don't know you, your background, and work ethic, or how you like to think. Stuff doesn't just happen to GPAs. You earn it whether the class is made challenging or not.  The default assumption should never be:\"Most classes are not challenging and challenging courses are made to kill my GPA\" at a highly selective college or university. Just assume a course will give you a run for the money and do the best you can under whatever conditions. You may actually benefit from being academically challenged in places you didn't anticipate. It doesn't have to be a completely negative experience if you have to fight for an A or get a B every now and then. Sometimes those may be some of your best courses or professors. Try to have a growth mindset about learning.\n\nAnd yes, natural sciences, math, CS, physical sciences tend to target certain average course GPAs for intro and intermediate courses.  Usually a B- or B or something like that is the target average and that makes sense I guess (only time I disagree is when the instructor gives even more complex material and exams than most instructors at other highly selective universities. Then I feel they should curve more generously but usually to keep things fair within Emory I guess they don't).",

Some more well paid jobs will hold you accountable so you want your courses to develop those skills as much as possible so that when you go through the process of say...readying yourself for case interviews or other challenges, it is much easier.  It's all a balancing act but getting a solid GPA in GBS shouldn't be hard.  Even if you take a harder course or professor for something that interests you, the curves are going to be pretty generous. Curves help when you wanna learn or challenge yourself but can hurt when the course is made too easy (in those cases you have to be perfect and in fact more perfect than other near perfect people. Being in a situation where grade cutoffs are increased b/c everything was so simple vs. them being lowered when things are less so is a much more risky situation IMHO). Basically I am saying that the GBS curve punishes students for when professors make the courses too simple",

I just have a lot of classes to take in short amount of time (transferred in) and have a part time internship in marketing so I do be kinda stressed. However I still go out most, if not all, weekends at least once. Sometimes my grades do reflect that I didn\u2019t study as much but profs tend to be generous with grading, extensions, and curves. Especially if you reach out to them and explain what\u2019s going on. IMO even if you procrastinate and go out you can still manage with school and do fine, but if you really wanna do well on something it\u2019s just about how much you study. There will be weeks when everything is at the same time and it sucks but you\u2019ll likely manage if you got admitted.",

A lighter course load is mainly just supposed to build your confidence (even if it is just a faux ego high based confidence on getting easier grades) and acclimate you to college life which is totally fine.  But you just need to be aware that you will likely have to shift higher in course and work load in latter semesters so things may feel like quite the adjustment.  I've actually seen this in some people who took it relatively easy in the ECAS years because they just wanted the GPA to get in and wanted to kind of have much more social time.  Then the b-school requires more slots in their schedule to be taken up by academics/courses and some struggle to adjust.  Maybe even if you start off super light to screw around and get the ego high/acclimate, be sure to increase it to consistently medium courseloads(or course loads with similar credit hours with 1-2 more challenging professors sprinkled in) before applying.\n\nAgain, this all being a cake walk the whole time may not be the best strategy.  B-school content doesn't seem hard, but will keep you busy with a workload and whatnot, and I think since many professors grade participation and do things like cold calling, you may find it beneficial to take some ECAS courses (could be humanities or social science courses that are smaller and fullfill GERs HSC and/or CWR) where you are more or less forced to participate in discussions regularly just to get used to scenarios where you need to do serious pre-pre before attending a class session (versus just showing up, passively taking some notes, leaving and then studying only when tests and quizzes roll around).",

                      "text": "I think I just meant that you phrased that wrong lol (you're not gonna feel out your limitations by avoiding them).  Either you phrased that limit stuff wrong or you really are trying to talk yourself into reasons to avoid putting yourself in a position where you feel academically challenged.  Trust me, there is really no need to fear Emory especially with how manageable the pre-BBA pre-reqs are. \n\nJust have fun, do your work and learn as much as you can. Unless you are double majoring in BBA and a historically challenging major (like a CS, math, QTM, or life sciences), I wouldn't worry about being overly inundated in academics to the point you can't do social life or clubs.  Emory isn't an old UChicago, or some of those top tier LACs where its goal is to churn out lots of future academics. It pushes students enough so that they care or get something out of the courses. That's all. It believes in work-life balance.  You'll be okay. Trust yourself.",

      "text": "Honestly from what I've experienced so far it totally depends on the which classes you take, the number of credit hours you take, and the number of courses you're involved in. If you're in 18-21 hard credits worth of class with 3-4 clubs then yes, it's gonna be a lot of work. But ultimately it's up to you. I know people who are very happily in 13-15 credits doing 0-1 clubs with plenty of free time. I also know people on the opposite end that I described above. It really is your choice, and you'll learn how to balance the two as you go farther into the semesters.",
