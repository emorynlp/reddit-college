          "text": "I feel that should raise more questions than it answers such as why basically none of them did this and why Emory basically has no type of syllabus database for recent years (there are some departments that have a few like political science or sociology).  Many similar schools have something like that or have successfully encouraged a solid share of faculty to post it alongside their course listing/atlas for students to access.  I imagine it is really helpful to students which is something Emory should be doing Covid or not given its \"Emory undergraduate project\" and whatnot.  Without it, course selection is kind of like a rush to hurry up and figure stuff out during Add/Drop/Swap because you go in with very little insight other than hearsay.  You'd have to wonder why faculty are so resistant (I doubt it's the date being too soon) as I seriously doubt lower enrollment courses benefit from the element of surprise.  If anything, if someone saw a syllabus beforehand, they may be more likely to put certain courses into consideration that were off the radar before.  In addition, faculty that run more challenging or demanding courses than average can perhaps get a more well-selected crowd which helps them teach at the level they desire.",
