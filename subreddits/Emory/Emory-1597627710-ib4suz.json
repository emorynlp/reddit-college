I've interacted with him before and he's a great person.\n\nFor Emory in general, this might help. Theres also the office of LGBT Life, another great resource.\n\n[http://www.lgbt.emory.edu/trans/index.html](http://www.lgbt.emory.edu/trans/index.html)",

      "text": "Ok so disclaimer: I\u2019m a (non-binary)alum that\u2019s been away for a few years so idk if theres some great new trans program on campus but the office of LGBT life on the Atlanta campus hosts a weekly trans discussion/support group, \u201cTransforming Gender\u201d. It doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve announced the student facilitator for 2020 yet, but email them when they do, they\u2019re probably the person with the most on the ground info and they\u2019d be happy to point you in the right direction! I\u2019d see if they will be meeting online this year because of the pandemic, maybe you could join from Oxford?\nhttp://www.lgbt.emory.edu/programs-events/discussion-groups.html",
