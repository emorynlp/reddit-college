  "text": "I am an incoming freshman trying to major in cs and math. Ironically, however, I don\u2019t have a strong math background since I didn\u2019t take precalc in Highschool and barely took algebra II (my school kinda gave everyone an A due to covid). I was wondering if there is an easier, introductory math class I could take before Math 111 (calculus).",

What I\u2019d recommend is that you study pre calc over the summer and try to leave enough time to do a quick preview of Calc 1.",

      "text": "Math 110 is offered during summer.  You can probably handle CS 170/171 your first year, but you need to take 110 during the summer or you need to self-study trig/analysis and learn the behavior and graphs of basic functions.  The math major may be a pain to cram because it is sort of designed as something where a majority enter with AB or BC credit so you'll need to see if you can fit all the requirements in.  CS alone may be doable as you can spread the math reqs. out.  Also though they've made the individual exams and quizzes for math 111 a bit harder than what they used to be, I think the first unit/module reviews a lot of pre-calc before going into serious calculus.  Just take the placement test for math, and it'll offer you placement in 111 and try to learn as much as you can during that module.  You can maybe even contact a professor and ask him to help you self-study for a semester in preparation to take the 111 in the spring. Contact Juan Garcia about this and see what he says:https://www.math.emory.edu/undergraduate/general-information/placement-guide/\n\nOther than that, again you're at Emory.  Math at the level of pre-calc and algebra 2 can easily be self-taught to a solid level and there are so many free/open pdf textbooks in these areas.  I recommend trying that first and seeing how far you get.",

          "text": "I don't know about the 300+(where honestly, most students will/should kind of be able to be independent and teach themselves most things assuming the foundation and intermediate courses were strong enough foundations which was apparently a problem because many of those profs did not really care about developing students. They were into their research, can't teach that well, and of course won't challenge students in any meaningful way because if they teach badly and do that, their evals will get creamed.  And then there is the problem of all the visiting professors they use which have no ties to Emory and thus no commitment to training its undergrads and just teach because it's a requirement to do \"service\" as they do research at Emory) division math classes, but it looks like they are at least trying (recently) to stack lower division and intermediate courses with decent or even good professors.  The only problem with that is that those professors apparently demand a bit more than the bad professors you allude to who would often sort of just demand cookbook math in courses that can either be computational or mix computational with theoretical OR then just emphasize memorization (they'll focus more on students' ability to recite definitions than learn proofs and then derive proofs for new scenarios based on the proofs they learned) in theoretical classes like math 250.  In this environment, if they can't get a respectable grade in math 111, they may end up toast in later classes.",
