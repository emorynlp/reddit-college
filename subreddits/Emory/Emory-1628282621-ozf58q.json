  "text": "I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I work at a grocery store in Atlanta and plan to keep working throughout college because they pay me *extremely* well. The only issue is transportation. I have a car, but Emory does not allow freshmen to keep their cars on campus. The grocery store is a 15-minute drive away. MARTA is not really a great option because it increases the time to 30-40 minutes, and I'm also worried about safety.\n\nIs there any possibility for me to find a place to park my car as a freshman, even off campus, just so that I can get to and from work each week? I'm willing to pay someone if they somehow have a spot. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

          "text": "Just apply for an Emory pass. But if you really can\u2019t get one and are gonna risk it: \n\nHere\u2019s a sneaky person\u2019s insight:\n\n*Clairmont Reserve apts* no gate, they do have parking passes, but I\u2019m gonna be honest they don\u2019t really check if cars have them after 5:30 (when their facilities staff clocks out at 5:30\u2026 they are the ones who \u201cenforce\u201d that but it\u2019s rare bc management overworks the hell out of them) and it\u2019s good until about 9 the next morning. \n\nI lived there last year, and that is the pattern I\u2019ve noticed\u2026 as of last year (when I lived there) they would just put one of those super sticky warning stickers on your window if they noticed your car had been there for a couple of days without moving (again they\u2019re too overworked to usually notice unless it\u2019s obvious). They don\u2019t really tow, ticket or boot cars. However, make a grad student or upperclassman friend who lives there to WARN you when the leasing office is doing  large parking lot projects in the apartments (like construction or a water pipe bursting), because when they have large trucks in the parking lot and need you to move your car\u2026 they will tow you in a heartbeat in those rare occasions. \n\nI only recommend this as a backup option, and given more things will be in-person next year, this could be risky, so it\u2019s only a temporary or last resort option. \n\nHAS WORKED but similar to Clairmont reserve apts, so be careful:\n\n1. the Clifton school @ Clairmont campus (don\u2019t mistake it with the autism center school parking lot at Clairmont bc that is ticketland) \nteachers park in Emory decks to reserve their main lot for parents\u2026 during business hours cars are unmarked (without passes) so your car blends in with the parents\u2019 and babysitters\u2019, just park closer to the bus station not right in front of the school entrance: they won\u2019t enforce you parking there unless you make it SUPER obvious and recurring. \n\n2. The residential streets behind the Starbucks on main campus: Emory road, Oxford road, etc. There is ample street parking, and as an Atlanta native I can tell you Dekalb police (or it might be APD with the reannexing) will not waste time ticketing cars. Very safe in terms of not being towed or booted, however, don\u2019t let residents catch on, they will be the ones to run you off if anyone. \n\nRules here: always park a little farther from the actual campus to not make it so obvious, use different streets/houses/sides of street, NEVER  block anyone\u2019s mailbox or driveway, try and park somewhere that\u2019s not visible to multiple people inside multiple houses. I used to do this for a few hours a day pre-pandemic, it works if you switch it up and are discreet. \n\n\n\nDO NOT, NOT, NOT TRY: hardwood condominiums (they will get you with that sticker), any well marked  official Emory or CDC Parking deck/lot: you will get ticketed QUICK, don\u2019t even think on it.\n\nPROBABLY NOT WORTH THE RISK: \n1. jimmy johns, Panera, cvs, other businesses in Emory village: as tempting as it looks, it will probably would work if you were sneaky and changed it up, but whenever it gets too frequent and popular and word gets out,  the businesses will probably just pay a towing company to come tow cars\u2026 then you have to deal with that hassle. You might  get away with it once or maybe even 100 times before getting towed, but every time you\u2019re there, that\u2019s what your risking. \n\n2. Residential streets off north Decatur road: most of these streets are so close to Emory lots that illegal parking is a problem. If a street has ZERO cars parked on it\u2026 it\u2019s a red flag that you shouldn\u2019t park there. A few streets have street parking and as long as residents don\u2019t catch on you\u2019re probably fine, but there are very few in those particular subdivisions, plus they are pretty far from main campus.\n\n\nFeel free to DM me, but I might find an exception to parking on campus, so you don\u2019t have to exhaust all these options.",
