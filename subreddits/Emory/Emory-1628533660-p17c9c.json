      "text": "The only issue I see with taking 110 and 111 in the same semester would be the research study requirement. Both 110 and 111 require you to participate in 6-8 of the department\u2019s research studies, so taking these classes together would mean you\u2019d have to do up to 16 studies in one semester. This seems like a lot to me. \n\nIn terms of strictly workload, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue at all. 111 is an easy class",
