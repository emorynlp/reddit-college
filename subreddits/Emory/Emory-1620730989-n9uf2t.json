      "text": "Take whatever you want, but I'd recommend staying away from over-rated \"pre-med bandwagon\" courses and teachers like 336, Quave's classes, dev. bio and 240 for now. You should probably try to reinforce what you learned in 141/142.  Cell bio and genetics will help the most with that especially if you took a professor that was more memorozation oriented than problem solving and experimental bio oriented in how they explained and tested material.  Maybe take one of those with ochem (please take Weinschenk for this.  You'll thank yourself later).  Material from those is important for the MCAT and 141/142 is kind of softballing that material now-a-days.  If things like epigenetics are offered in spring or if BECK (not O'Toole) teaches 240 or a upper division lab course, you could take it too.  It's your education.  Don't go by what \"most\" people do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Most\" people (especially other bio pre-meds) may  choose some crappy professors and classes that don't emphasize the skills they need to be building after taking 14x because they either don't know which courses do that and assume that courses that \"feel\" more like the level of 14x but are specialized do so, or they just don't care: They've entered GPA repair and protection mode a little too early and view the problem solving and experimentally focused courses as risky. If you even just did \"okay\" in bio and chem, you should give yourself a chance to learn biology or chemistry in a different way. You may be able to handle and may even enjoy it if you go in with an open mind about how biology and chem are actually supposed to be learned and assessed!  If you really hate or come out fearing them, then you can run back to your memory based classes or even things like Evolutionary bio to pad your GPA/make you feel more comfy, but give them a shot earlier than later as they generally will do more longterm good than harm if you work hard enough to perform solidly in them.",

              "text": "And note that most of the classes I talk about spread a significant portion of the grade away from tests (unlike the bandwagon courses. Usually those are 3 tests, maybe some quizzes, and a final and you get what you get so you better be consistently perfect because they usually aren't challenging enough to warrant a curve), so even if the exams are harder/more thinking and application intensive than you are used to in biology, you can at least partially compensate by doing well on other assignments (I know in genetics, the discussion section contributes a decent chunk of the grade and is kind of a freebie if you take it seriously enough.  I think that they've remade cell bio so that even professors outside of Eisen have additional assignments and whatnot that are more \"low-stakes\" but weigh a decent chunk).  They have safety nets to make trying them out less risky than they would be if they were just test based and plus you'll probably learn more (IF you don't have expectations that everything is just assessed on memorization/exactly what they teach from the slides and book).",
