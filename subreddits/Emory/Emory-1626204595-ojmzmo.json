  "text": "Hi! so i am a freshmen planning on doing the dual degree thing with gtech for industrial engineering.\n\nin HS i mostly focused on physics so I didnt take chem.\n\nHow hard is CHEM 150 if you have no background in it and do u have any advice? which prof do u reccomend ect\n\ni was also thinking of jus finding the textbook of the class somewhere and starting to learn it beforehand or something lol\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I also also didn't have much of a background going in, even the ECCP that you take in the summer didn't help me much, but now I've finished through Chem 204 and gotten way better at it! It's definitely doable, you just need to review the material as it comes and go to the weekly Learning Assistant sessions that are held where they help you work on extra problems. I'd recommend McGill since I found her to be the best at teaching the material for first year chem.",

      "text": "You'll be fine (does not mean it will be easy, but if you have a work ethic and desire to learn it, you should do fine. Just don't go in worrying about your background vs. Others. View it as the chance to build YOUR background up to where they are.  150/202 are never graded on a real curve or anything like that so it is just you versus the material and assessments of it). Chem 150 is designed for those with a minimal or basic background and it may actually be helpful that you don't come in with any complacency or bias.  However, understand that the way chem 150/202 is much more than about \"learning stuff\"(details and general concepts) and is more about problem solving and explaining concepts in the context of new applications or case studies you didn't practice.  Just use the ALEKS thing as your guide and enjoy the ride! You can worry about pre-learning stuff after 202 when you know enough chemistry to say...self-study a little ochem.\n\nAlso if you focused on physics. Then chem 150 might make a lot of sense to you!",

      "text": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s difficult but doable. I didn\u2019t have any experience with chemistry either coming into Emory this year. I had to do like 96 topics on the EECP. I think it can become demoralizing if you compare yourself to other people. There\u2019d be some new topics we had to learn like electronic configurations & Lewis structures and a good amount of people knew how to do them instantly from AP chem. \n\nI think as long as you\u2019re easy on yourself for having to read more/take a little longer to learn it should be fine. I\u2019d take McGill. Very awesome professor. She makes chemistry more fun even though her exams can be tough.",
