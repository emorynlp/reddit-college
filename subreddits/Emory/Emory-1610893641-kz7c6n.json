  "title:": "Applying to Emory, Confused by Music Supplement Request",
  "text": "Hi guys, I'm applying ED2 to Emory University and I got an email from the music director yesterday saying basically \"we saw you had a ton of music on your application and even though you're not applying for the music program could you send some supplemental material that shows off your musical abilities?\" Did anyone else get this email and if so what are you sending them? Do they want what's listed on the \"auditions\" page of the website? Also, I sing and play an instrument, but only the orchestra director emailed me, should I send a recording of both my singing and playing anyway? Thanks for any help in advance.",

      "text": "Received an email from Bhasin when I applied as well, and I was part of EUSO and EWE throughout undergrad.\nI am an instrumentalist, so I just sent a repertoire that I was practicing. The audition on the page is for when you actually audition for the ensembles.\nIf only Bhasin contacted you, I would just send in the instrumental repertoire. Dr. Nelson is the director of choral studies, send in your singing if he reaches out to you.",

Under the \"strings wind and percussion\" part, it says \"Apart from the Merit Scholarship auditions, students may also be invited to submit supplemental recordings as part of their regular application. These may be between 5 and 15 minutes in duration and should be of standard solo repertoire only (no ensemble concert videos).\" Do you think this applies to those of us not auditioning for the music program too? I did email Dr. Bhasin a few hours ago to clarify but that was rather early in Georgia's timezone so I don't expect a response until later.",
