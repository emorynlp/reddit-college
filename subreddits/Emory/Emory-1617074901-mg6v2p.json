You\u2019ll also have many more opportunities in terms of research and hospital access. UCSB is a great school too but Emory edges it out in prestige and opportunity especially for pre-med. I would probably pick Emory over all UC schools for pre-med and probably even business. That said for pre-meds price should be a big consideration. The difference in price doesn\u2019t seem astronomical tbh. Depending on your financial situation Emory seems to be better choice. 13k a year isn\u2019t chump change but neither is it anything too crazy. See if you can negotiate the offer a little more. Basically I\u2019m saying is if I were you I would go to Emory",

              "text": "Would an Emory bio degree \"hold more value\"?  Why do you think that?  I would say that the courses and resources could better prep you for lab work or grad. school IF you take the right courses, but I don't know if it is inherently more valuable.  What I always worry is that since you are trying to do pre-med, you'll end up dodging the courses that prep you best for a research or grad. school experience after undergrad to protect your GPA. If you actually want it to hold more value, I think you would have to go to Emory and not move like a stereotypical pre-med and maybe be an \"in the closet\" pre-med (as in you are a science major first, pre-med 2nd, but you just happen to be a science major that will study/think hard enough to keep a strong GPA no matter what courses/professors you take).\n\nSome of the pathways some pre-meds at Emory take(hint, the borderline applicants and those who are the 40 or so % who don't get in) cause the bio major to lose value IMO.  Their pathways are so stripped down that barring some other significant internship/research experience, they'll leave with very little marketable skills.  So you have to be careful doing a bio major ANYWHERE.  It is your job to power that thing up so that you are left with options in case pre-med either doesn't work out right away, or you decide to take your interest in STEM towards a different career path because you actually prefer the alternative career.  And whatever you do, if you stayed pre-med and went to Emory, don't take the barebones course selection advice Emory's PHA gives.  They clearly assume that students are weak/lazy or something so aren't as \"honest\" as some other top school PHAs.  They seem great for everything else like the details of the application process, getting general mentoring, and volunteering, co-curric, research opps though. If you are going to do Emory, do it right and don't buy into this prestige stuff too much. It has serious limitations.",

                      "text": "Also, random, I am almost inclined to go with u/premeddie19 .  Usually my advice is to NOT go to the highly selective school for a significantly higher cost unless you really think you'd DELIBERATELY do something differently there than what you would at the less selective/cheaper option.  Things like pre-med tend to have much less of a \"prestige\" bump outside of the home medical school (like if you do well enough, Emory med. will happily pick many Emory UGs). What people often perceive as a \"prestige bump\" is a training effect. Like the Ivy/Ivy Plus schools tend to feed their own medical schools (or each other) not only because it makes them look better, but because their pre-med core courses tend to be on some other stuff on average (even vs. the elites below the top 12 or so). They'd want really high stats or evidence of similar level training from those outside that group or maybe even both.\n\n Again, if you don't plan to train/push yourself at those higher levels if possible, and/or really dive into the co-curric./EC oppurtunities (as in ones that Emory may have that UCSB might not) aggressively, it would make more sense to just go to UCSB, pay less, and perhaps get a higher GPA, and maybe even get coronated with opps by faculty that could potentially see you as a stand-out if you perform really well. Basically you have to determine if you really want to be in a more challenging environment and actually take on the challenges offered even at the risk of less \"security\".  Maybe do some more research into both schools and seriously ask yourself what you imagine yourself doing at Emory that you wouldn't at UCSB (like look up different programs  of interest and things they offer undergrads outside of the classroom like study abroad, fellowships, etc. Does anything hook you?).  I just really don't want people running blindly towards shiny objects.",

I'm assuming you are a CA resident and that your fmaily was judge able to pay full tuition. If you'd have to cover Emory's tuition mostly with loans, UCSB may be your better bet. If you can swing either with minimal loans, I'd suggest Emory. I disagree that UCSB courses will be easier thus allowing for a higher GPA. The comparatively much smaller class sizes at Emory means that you can get extra academic support from the professor in \"weed-out\" classes like Intro/orgo chem, intro physics, intro bio, ect, while UC often curve such classes to expect grade distributions. \n\nResearch in biology or specifically in medicine will be easier to come by at Emory.

          "text": "I wanna be clear what I mean by \"easier\".  From what I have seen and heard from those who came from schools around UCSB's selectivity is that the benefit is that you can often sort of ride the curve and end up on the right side if you are in the 75% of students even if a course is more challenging.  At a place like Emory, it is technically tougher because the cohort is more uniformly well prepped. So even if a course's demands are  more \"straight forward\" (which could be easy/medium in an Emory context but yield significantly lower averages if the same course was given elsewhere in which case any curve may end up beneficial for a high achiever that scores say...an unacceptable 80% lol) here probably won't be any curve and you better be damned near perfect for an A.  \n\nIn the case that a course is so challenging to the Emory cohort that it needs curving or lower cutoffs (there are plenty who do this at Emory especially if you take top instructors), the chances of doing super well become more random because the assessments are designed to challenge even those who prepared a lot and do all the mandatory AND optional work associated with the class while also taking advantage of all the resources you alluded to.  To me this makes taking a more challenging professor at Emory rewarding, but much more risky GPA wise.  I think this is especially true for courses at Emory that are medium sized or large and ultimately curve to or target grade averages more similar to public schools (think your Weinschenk's, Sorias, gchem profs, physics profs, and even math 111/116 now-a-days).  \n\nI would tend to agree that less selective (as in significantly less selective) schools at the elective level of STEM courses that are smaller tend to be more similar to analogous courses at places like Emory.  They will have a much more select crowd interested enough to take a niche course and the professors can do things typically not done in lower divisions merely because of the size.  The \"problem\" (as in double edged sword) with an Emory is that you have some pre-med lower division professors(or whole courses) that are sizeable doing things not typical in lower divisions elsewhere, so even with all the support, it'll be rough to lots of people. Like I think of how in gchem 2, no doubt people with IB, or more international training from A levels and whatnot will be advantaged and there are actually a higher than average chunk of students who have that background on top of the AP students.  It's just a more competitive environment.  And it isn't like the pre-med foundation courses are tiered in any significant way to separate those who have the strong backgrounds from those who don't (like a UCSB would). \n\nI think there is a reason many people advise pre-meds to go to schools where they are statistically near the top of the incoming cohort. It is at least a head start even if it isn't a guarantee for success (you still gotta do the work of course).  I tend to leave elite privates and publics out of such discussions because the student bodies are too close to maxed out at that point so things that you can't see in an ACT/SAT test score and GPA/incoming class profile will start to differentiate (AP/IB, research, and the higher concentration of those from the most rigorous high schools, and well off backgrounds) students.",
