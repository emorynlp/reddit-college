  "title:": "I\u2019m thinking about majoring in Engineering or something Environmental, but I hate physics and don\u2019t want to be stuck in a lab. What should I major in?",
  "text": "I really enjoy designing and have taken a few engineering classes at my school. I love the design process and coming up with the general idea, but I hate the math that I have to do for the final product. I also really dislike physics because it doesn\u2019t interest me at all. I enjoy math, but not when it\u2019s applied to other subjects\n\nSo instead I thought about majoring in environmental science, but I don\u2019t want to be stuck doing lab stuff. Biology and the earth is really interesting to me, I also want to be able to improve the earth. The thing is I also still want to be able to design things and be creative. Is there a major that would fit me?",
