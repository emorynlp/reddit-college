Does it have lots of opportunities or not worth it?", "text": ".", "author": "kanav1500", "created": 1619646443, "retrieved": 1632846583, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gwa2vj3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n0poet/be_real_guys_is_mis_management_information_system/gwa2vj3/", "text": "> Is MIS (Management Information system) degree worth it?  \n\nThere is no Easter Bunny.  \nSanta Clause isn't real.  \n\nThere is no magic bucket of high-paying careers on the other end of any particular college degree track.  \n\nEvery university has a different interpretation of what belongs inside an MIS degree program.  \n\nBut they are usually something like this:  \n\n20% General Education.  \n40% Business Administration/Econ.  \n25% Computer Science  \n15% Information Technology.  \n\nThose are useful skills, that employers like to make use of for various job roles.  \nYou have a lot of flexibility in what you want to specialize in by stacking electives in specific directions.  \n\n\n> Does it have lots of opportunities or not worth it?  \n\nYou can't pin this on the degree alone.  \nYou have to do the work to set yourself apart.  \n\nNext door in /r/ITCareerQuestions we see a lot of people coming to ask why they have so much difficulty finding a job with their technical degree.  \n\nMIS, IS, IT, even COmputer Science degree-holders have this problem.  \n\nWe ask to see their (sanitizes, anonymized) resume and discover the problem:  \n\n1. Their resumes look like hot-garbage.  \n - Did a 12 year old write this thing, or a college graduate?  \n - Where are your communications skills and attention to detail that would allow you to submit a garbage resume??? !!!  \n2. They have no practical experiences with technology beyond the classroom.  \n - No internships. No Co-Op employment. No projects. No clubs.  \n\n\nEmployers don't want to hire an individual who just wants the money associated with a technology career.  \n\nWe prefer to hire an individual who is truly interested in technology.  \n\nThey are so much easier to train, and groom for bigger things than someone who hates their job but loves the income.  \n\nIf you put effort into your MIS studies, participate in internships and explore your profession through clubs and the like, you shouldn't have any difficulty landing employment at $75k come graduation, and $100k within 10 years of graduation (often within 5 years).  \n\nIf you do nothing but attend class and get good grades, and play Red Dead Redemption, you're going to have a much tougher time of things.  \n\nIT Help Desks pay $15/hr. You do that for a year or two to move up to PC Support st $20/hr for another year or two. Then you move up to servers, networks or security in a salaried role at $50k or so.  \n\nOr you can pursue a Business Analyst career track, or an Application Developer career track, all with similar progression and compensation if you have no meaningful experiences on your resume.  \n\nSummer Internships pay good money. You should be working hard to get these opportunities, they pay off in huge dividends later.  \n\nAnd don't get me started on why so few students are even aware of Career Development Programs.  \n\nIf you can line yourself up for one of those opportunities, you're on a fast track to success.  \n\n-----  \n\nSome examples of Career Development Programs:  \n\n\n | \n---|\n[Another great list of programs here](https://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/leadership-development-rotational-programs)  |\n. |\n[Microsoft Student Programs](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/ur-lp-united-states)  |\n[Cigna Health Programs](https://jobs.cigna.com/us/en/studentandgraduates)  |\n[Boeing Programs](https://jobs.boeing.com/entry-level)  |\n[General Eletric Programs](https://jobs.gecareers.com/global/en/students)  |\n[Goodyear Programs](https://campus.goodyear.com/opportunities)  |\n[Siemens Programs](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/jobs/search-careers.html)  |\n[GEICO Programs](https://www.geico.com/careers/students-and-grads/leadership-programs/)  |\n[International Paper Programs](http://www.internationalpaper.com/company/regions/north-america/careers/students-recent-graduates/new-graduate-opportunities)  |\n[Harley-Davidson Programs](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/about-us/careers/students-rotational-programs.html)  |\n[Caterpillar Programs](https://www.caterpillar.com/en/careers/career-areas/college/unitedstates/intern-program.html)  |\n[Boston Scientific Programs](http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/careers/students/rotational-programs/technology-leadership-development-program.html)  |\n[BD Career Development Programs](https://www.bd.com/en-us/company/careers/university-relations-and-recruitment/undergraduate-programs/information-technology-leadership-program)|\n[United Health Group Programs](https://careers.unitedhealthgroup.com/early-careers/programs)  |\n[Capital One Programs](https://campus.capitalone.com/full-time-programs)  |\n[Bank of America Programs](https://campus.bankofamerica.com/opportunities.html)  |", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1619691198, "upvotes": 1}, "gw9u56o": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n0poet/be_real_guys_is_mis_management_information_system/gw9u56o/", "text": "And as always, here's u/Va_Network_Nerd", "author": "Ayham_abusalem", "created": 1619682994, "upvotes": 1}, "gw84dui": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n0poet/be_real_guys_is_mis_management_information_system/gw84dui/", "text": "I can\u2019t speak to the differences between MIS and a standard IS program, but I\u2019m graduating soon and the prospects appear to be very promising. \n\nCheck out the IS Job Index from 2019 for more info!\n\n\nhttps://isjobindex.com/", "author": "infjetson", "created": 1619647350, "upvotes": 3}}}
