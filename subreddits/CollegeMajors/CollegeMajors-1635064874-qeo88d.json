  "text": "The whole \n\nCNA to RN\n\nRN to BSN\n\nCNA to BSN\n\nSeems like time consumption, my friend told me just try going from CNA to RN then go for BSN if you want, that seems very long and tiring, even though most nursing courses can transfer to all the degrees if I'm correct. Most courses are like bridge courses if I remember correctly.\n\nWhy not go from community college to BSN easily. Since all the generals and requirements have been met for the BSN and you just focus on the core courses for nursing.\n\nMy friend wants to go from CNA to RN since she's new to the whole nursing field which is good, but for me, I'm still deciding which BS degree to pursue.\n\nI'm already eligible for the BSN but still thinking.",
