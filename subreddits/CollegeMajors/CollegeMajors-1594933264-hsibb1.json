I'm good at science too but I wouldn't say I really enjoy it. \n\nI would like a decent paying career that's stable.\n\nI have considered business before, but my parents don't think my personality is suitable since I'm not super friendly or talkative.\n\nI wouldn't say I realllyyyyy like math, I do enjoy math classes, I understand it, but I can't imagine doing super advanced math.So far my brother is doing CS, the math looks so hard, plus I'm not the best at programming.\nParents always wanted me to be a doctor, but I dont really like science. \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

Don't bother majoring in something you know you won't enjoy.\n\nYou said that you would consider business/accounting...but your parents don't think you would be a good fit. You don't have to be super friendly nor do you have to be talkative to succeed in that specific career. Friendly, yes. Talkative? Not necessarily - you need interpersonal skills. There are different branches of business you can do btw. And don't worry if you don't possess certain traits right now that would benefit your future career - that is what college is for. You grow and you develop these skills.\n\nYou say that you enjoy your math classes. It's OK if you can't imagine yourself doing advanced math and being successful at programming at this moment.\n\nIf you're really stuck maybe browse through YouTube and watch some career videos on general business/different business careers/accounting/CS/etc. I did that a lot and I'm kind of gearing towards the direction that I want.\n\nI know people say that you have time to think about your major, but it doesn't hurt to do some research.\n\nIt's OK, you'll be fine.", "author": "whimsicalcreate", "created": 1594957213, "upvotes": 3}, "fyboaph": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hsibb1/soon_to_be_high_school_senior_that_doesnt_know/fyboaph/", "text": "What about accounting?
