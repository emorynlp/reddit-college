What\u2019s a major I could pursue that allows me to have a versatile career path in the future and also good pay. I have interests in biotech and the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare, and marketing. Edit : I would be going into my new school as a business major, but I am considering double majoring or doing a combined major if my school allows that ( I mostly have credits for business courses), and if my school does allow me to do a combined major I will comfier finance + data science, or if I can not double major then I would probably try to minor in cs or healthcare.", "author": "LeftAd1747", "created": 1612580142, "retrieved": 1632847018, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gm71cye": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ldoa5r/versatile_majors/gm71cye/", "text": "Computer science is a good bet, IMO, because it can be applied to many different fields, especially bioinformatics and healthcare software, which might align with your interests. I know a good amount of CS majors at my school who went into finance or data science as well.  I do think in general more 'technical' majors tend to be more versatile, since a computer science major or engineer will have an easier time getting into management/finance/business positions than the other way around. Plus, you have a nice, decent paying fallback option if you don't know where to go from there. But ultimately it's up to you, and if you think you would dislike computer science or engineering then it might not be a good idea. I would recommend against becoming a doctor unless you have a very strong calling for that career, since it requires 10+ years of schooling, and med school can be very competitive.
