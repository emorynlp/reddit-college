I also know quite a few liberal arts majors who have stable white-collar jobs with health insurance and a retirement plan. I have such a job and I have colleagues who majored in psychology, anthropology, English, communications, wildlife biology, creative writing, political science, business, kinesiology, international relations, religious studies, and African-American studies. I don't know anyone on welfare. \n\nIn my experience, as long as you get work or work-adjacent experience outside the classroom (jobs, internships, research assistantships, volunteer work, leadership positions in student organizations, whatever), a liberal arts degree is not some kind of kiss of death. Sure, if you have a BA in anthropology it's unlikely you'll have an anthropology-related job, because most anthropology-related jobs a) require a graduate degree and b) are very scarce even for people with PhDs, but that doesn't mean you'll, like, die alone in a cardboard box. \n\nReddit loves to reduce this discussion into \"either you're a rich happy engineer or you're a poor miserable English major,\" when there are plenty of middle-class people with non-STEM degrees. I mean, I don't recommend taking on a bunch of debt to get a degree in painting, but if you know you'd be miserable as a CS major or other \"practical\" major, and you just want to get a degree in something because (whatever your reasons are), then go to community college, apply for financial aid and scholarships, transfer to a school you can afford, and don't neglect your professional development outside the classroom. Which also means major in something you can manage that won't completely consume your life and leave you with no time/energy to do professional development stuff. \n\nAlso bear in mind that simply picking an \"employable\" major does not guarantee that you will be employable in that field. Obviously, you have to actually complete the degree, which might not happen if you pick a major that you hate or that is just a really bad fit for your strengths. I know someone who tried to major in physics, was so stressed out that she ended up in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer, switched her major to sociology, and is fine now. If I had tried to major in engineering and couldn't or wouldn't change my major, I would not now be an engineer, I would have either flunked out of college or dropped out before I could flunk out. Even if I had somehow made it through, I would be competing for jobs against people who actually liked engineering and were good at it.", "author": "ultimate_ampersand", "created": 1607988524, "upvotes": 6}, "gfsn3rp": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kcs9w8/does_every_major_succeed_or_some_really_end_up/gfsn3rp/", "text": "Like dont put your self through debt and all that stuff but if you or your parents can fund it then you should go ahead and do whatever major that is the most interesting to you. Getting a job isn't a good measure of success imo and I've seen people who were happier before being considered \"successful\".
