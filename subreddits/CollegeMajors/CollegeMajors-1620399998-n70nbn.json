I'm also interested in economics. I would like to one day be and Economic Theologian. So I would like to major in both Economics and Theology but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in all religions. Like yes I'm a Christian but I would love to study Buddhist Theology and Islamic Theology and Zoroastrian Theology I truly have a burning passion for religious studies and economics. So based on what I have said should I major in Economics and Theology or Economics and Religious Studies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. All the people worried about my finances 1. It's none of your business. 2. I'm trying to start my own Religion & Spirituality publishing business and I own a small town Ice Cream Shop so I'm fine financially. Also is there a way to become a part-time professor like I don't want to be a full-time professor because I would like to write books and research papers on religion but I also dream of teaching.", "author": "JoylessDeer", "created": 1620399998, "retrieved": 1632846565, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyjdq0r": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n70nbn/i_want_to_study_theology_but/gyjdq0r/", "text": "I don't say this to knock your dreams, but in all seriousness, I don't even know what an economic theologian is.
