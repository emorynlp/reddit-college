I\u2019d recommend accounting, finance, or mis for concentrations. The others are good too but I think these three are the strongest in my opinion. \n\nIf you want more specialized knowledge, you could see if you can double major with something like cs or statistics. I\u2019m actually doing mis and statistics because having some type of business background does help when you\u2019re in the field and you need that knowledge to be able to apply what you learn in analytics from my stats courses. This is just an example though. In the end it\u2019s up to you and how you feel what your strengths and interests are.", "author": "twin0912", "created": 1602221486, "upvotes": 8}}}
