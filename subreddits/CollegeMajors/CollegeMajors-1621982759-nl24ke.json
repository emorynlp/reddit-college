At first i wanted to double major in accounting and economics oriented in finance and metrics because there is no finance bachelor's degree in this country or at least not in a public university. My passion in life is finance but i did my research and i found an alternative in the fintech industry so im thinking to double major in economics oriented in metrics and finance and CS to be more well rounded in both finance and tech. I'll study finance on my own and focus on CS. I already know what kind of jobs are in fintech and corporate finance but i would really like a recomendation for CS, books and courses. Is it a good double major? Or i'm just loosing my time? I'm planning to start CS next year and i am already studying programming languages and algorithm on my own.", "author": "Far-Lengthiness-3042", "created": 1621982759, "retrieved": 1632957433, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzptqh5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nl24ke/economics_and_computer_science/gzptqh5/", "text": "I'm not well-versed in CS, but I think that it should be a good double major. Economics involves a lot of modeling and raw data, and CS should be compatible with that, especially since it's in demand. I'm sorry, I can't recommend CS books and courses. But it sounds like you're on the right track :)", "author": "wistful_eunoia", "created": 1622171888, "upvotes": 2}}}
