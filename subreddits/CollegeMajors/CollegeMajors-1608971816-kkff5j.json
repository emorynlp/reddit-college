I'm also looking for one, but here is what I got from searching around, an actual grad correcting me may be useful tho\n\nFinance: great pay, competitive, a lot of math. Jobs include finance analyst, investment banker, etc\n\nAccounting: also good job market, also linked with math. Jobs include accountant, obviously\n\nManagement: too broad, generally not a good choice\n\nEntrepreneurship: not so different than management\n\nMarketing: I don't really know about this actually, but I heard it's still a better choice compared with management. Good for unleashing creativity I guess, but not as lucrative as finance, and if you're more introverted maybe you could lean more towards digital marketing, and be a digital marketing strategist\n\nMIS: also a pretty good choice, basically a business degree with some tech on the side. Jobs include business analyst, project manager, etc\n\nAs far as I know, the ones that would interact less with people would be finance or accounting, but there's math involved. Take my words with a grain of salt tho, as I haven't taken those majors yet", "author": "complexinferiority", "created": 1609527438, "upvotes": 1}}}
