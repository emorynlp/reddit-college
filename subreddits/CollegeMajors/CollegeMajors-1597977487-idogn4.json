I already know I want to be in the law, politics, crime, government, and possibly education field. I really want to become a lawyer, but I\u2019m also interested in becoming a superintendent, working in a gov department, becoming some kind of detective/agent, forensic psychologist, legislator, and possibly some kind of manager (ex: Human Resources manager).\n\nI just have no idea what to Major in. I love debating, politics and history as well. I was considering majoring in history, but I\u2019m not sure if there would be a better choice. I\u2019m so stuck that I\u2019m even considering double majoring. Any suggestions? I\u2019m not really into STEM degrees. The only kind of STEM I like I science, but only certain kinds\n\nI know there\u2019s not a major that will fit all of these professions into one, but can people give me multiple majors suggestions that would aim toward at least one of my interests?
