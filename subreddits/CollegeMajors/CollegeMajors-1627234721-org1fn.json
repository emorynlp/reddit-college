  "text": "So recently I switched out of computer engineering because it was too difficult for me and time consuming. I was wondering if majoring in political science is an easy major for me. I'm not looking for anything math heavy but a liberal arts major that won't include complex formulas and equations. Any political science majors here that can provide me a synopsis on their curriculum and the level of difficulty.",

Honestly i just want my degree and to get it over it. It might sound stupid in the grand of things but i don't regret anything because i'm on track to graduating on time anyways.",

Computer science is such a difficult subject and it felt like a burden on my chest studying it. Political science has been a walk in the park for me so far and it just consists of writing papers about arbitrary things.",

That\u2019s a great career.  If you research and pass the civil\nService exam I don\u2019t see how your parents would fault you.  You have direction and a plan.  Good luck!!",
