I want a major that will get me a good job, and will have many different career paths. I want a degree that will get me good pay too. At least $65,000+. I know that might be hard to get, but I\u2019m willing to do it. I know the STEM careers are in demand, but I\u2019m not really good with STEM, except for the science field. Specifically biology. I want a degree that can pay well, but that I\u2019ll also enjoy, and will have a good job outcome.\n\nMy future plan is to become a lawyer. I\u2019m thinking about becoming a real estate, estates, educational, or mental health/disability/health lawyer. So, it may be useful to get a degree that ties into that. I do have a list of majors I\u2019m considering, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re good for what I\u2019m seeking. I like helping people, gaining knowledge, and challenging myself. I want a major that can lead to a respected career that can be high-achieving (that\u2019s hard to get with only a bachelor, I know). I\u2019m really interested in crime, history, law, politics, sociology, and psychology, but those aren\u2019t good degrees to pursue, so I\u2019m stuck.\n\nAny recommendations would be helpful. I want a degree that I can fall back on in case becoming a lawyer doesn\u2019t work out.", "author": "OkFondant0", "created": 1590614283, "retrieved": 1632957914, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fvpqogm": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/grskry/having_trouble_picking_a_major/fvpqogm/", "text": "I\u2019d suggest a social work degree as it\u2019s a stable field (at least where I\u2019m from) and has a decent pay while also including some of your interests.

I know someone suggested this but economics or statistics can be pretty well paying too.\n\nI saw that you don\u2019t like STEM except for bio so maybe something in health?", "author": "angelic_angelx", "created": 1592889210, "upvotes": 1}, "fs1h56s": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/grskry/having_trouble_picking_a_major/fs1h56s/", "text": "careerexplorer.com it takes 30 mins- 1 hour.

Don't major in something unviable like Poli Sci, find out you don't want to do law and are then stuck with a useless degree.\n\nAll you have stated is \"I want a high demand, well paying job\" which would entail some form of engineering, computer science, or Actuarial science. If you don't think you have what it takes for that then go into Accounting or nursing.\n\nOne thing that google searching \"I want to become a lawyer\" or  \"How much does a lawyer make\" doesn't tell you is that the big firms that give those stereotypical *large* lawyer salaries only hire from T14 law schools. It's not just about getting accepted into law school it's about getting accepted into the *right* law school. Going to a T50 or T100 law program will still cost upwards of over $100k in debt but won't qualify you for those large salaries and career growth opportunities. So, unless you can comfortably rely on getting into a top law program or somehow get a full ride at some lesser school then it can often times not be worth the amount of debt your would acquire.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1590618794, "upvotes": 3}, "fs0vtvb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/grskry/having_trouble_picking_a_major/fs0vtvb/", "text": "Be careful with STEM.
