There's a projected job growth of 9% in my state and I feel like the degree would be versatile. However, Mass Communications seems more tangible and in touch with my creative side. I've looked at the coursework, and both seem interesting.

You will need to do a lot to compete against other sociology majors. If you study something more difficult like engineering it will be easier to get a job, but if you study sociology it will be easy to study but harder to get a job.\n\nDont let anyone tell you that you wont be able to get a job. There are so many jobs I've encountered where there is no designated major. Recruiter, project manager, program manager, technical project manager, anywhere in human resources, and so many more. At my job there is a profession called Content Provider. There are so many jobs like that. You can major in anything and apply.
