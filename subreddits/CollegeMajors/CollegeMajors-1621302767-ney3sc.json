I recently finished one of the videos that was included in my schools \"Senior Goodbye Video\". It was pretty much just a recap of the year as well as the events/sports that have happened etc... If you could rate the video for me that would be awesome. I'm not sure if I can go anywhere around video editing though, I'm still debating if its a career path that will suit me financially in the future but its one that I would dream of. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg2fg5rRaQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg2fg5rRaQ4)\n\nIn your honest opinion, is there any career out there that would fit me? My unrealistic dream currently is to travel the world, or film for sports. Whenever I make a perfect video in my eyes, its like finally fitting the last piece of a puzzle that contains 1000 other pieces. I also wouldn't aim for producing for such like movies etc... Commercials aren't pleasing to me either.", "author": "Jordan093", "created": 1621302767, "retrieved": 1632958542, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
