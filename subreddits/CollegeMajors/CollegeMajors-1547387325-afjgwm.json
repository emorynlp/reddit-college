I am having difficulties picking and staying with a major as a prospective college freshman. Recently, I thought that an environmental science major would be the best option to make a difference in the world, but I don\u2019t think that I actually have a true interest in the sciences. My true interest is helping people internationally and learning about different cultures. I was thinking about either public policy or some kind of economics with a specialization in development. However, I am really not sure. I have considered majors from architecture all the way to engineering. A few questions I have are:\n\n1. What is your general opinion?\n2. Do you know if anyone in public policy or the economic development realm?\n3. Do you have any suggestions for majors that would fit my interests? \n\nThanks for your help!
