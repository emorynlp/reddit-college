  "text": "Hello! I am having difficulties picking and staying with a major as a prospective college freshman. Recently, I thought that an environmental science major would be the best option to make a difference in the world, but I don\u2019t think that I actually have a true interest in the sciences. My true interest is helping people internationally and learning about different cultures. I was thinking about either public policy or some kind of economics with a specialization in development. However, I am really not sure. I have considered majors from architecture all the way to engineering. A few questions I have are:\n\n1. What is your general opinion?\n2. Do you know if anyone in public policy or the economic development realm?\n3. Do you have any suggestions for majors that would fit my interests? \n\nThanks for your help! ",

                      "text": "Perhaps an economics major would be your best bet. They\u2019re very fine degree on their own, and can place you in scores of financially sound positions. It\u2019s stable, and can give you some grounding before you attempt to delve into Economic Development. Perhaps pairing it with an Anthropology Minor would suit your interests regarding studying cultures. They could pair together quite nicely. \n\nAlthough I\u2019m no export, I\u2019d think that graduate school is likely required to get into a major position in International Aid, but there\u2019s certainly ways you can fluff up your resume during your bachelors. Make ample use of internships, and look for programs that take you out of the country (If that\u2019s where you wish to make changes). I\u2019d definitely research this more, but I think Economics paired with Anthropology/ Social Science/ Social Work would be your best bet for your bachelors.",
