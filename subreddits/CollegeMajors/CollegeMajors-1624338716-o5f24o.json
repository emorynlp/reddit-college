I'll be starting my junior year of college in a couple months, so if I'm going to change my major or minor then now is the time to do it. I'm currently majoring is psychology but because of covid/remote learning and other reasons, I have become sick of school and would like to start working after I get my bachelor's (most careers in psychology require at least a master's degree).\n\nI've always liked nature and would probably enjoy a career where I get to work in nature frequently; I'm just having trouble deciding what major to choose. I am considering Environmental Studies, Geography, or Archaeology (all BA). I am also open to jobs that deal with forestry, cartography, photogrammetry, or surveying. I would like to do something that deals with conservation, but that is just a preference. I go to Kent State University if that helps. Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR: I'm having trouble deciding between environmental studies, geography or archaeology and need to decide ASAP.", "author": "blazing_sarcasm", "created": 1624338716, "retrieved": 1632957560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
