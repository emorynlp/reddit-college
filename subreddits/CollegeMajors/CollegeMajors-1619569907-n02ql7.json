I already decided I was just going to crank out my general courses at JC and transfer but I still haven't decided on a major.\n\nI am not really a STEM enthusiast as much as I am into history, music, languages, etc... but I don't really care if I am happy. I just want to live comfortably without living paycheck to paycheck. I know STEM is the future and I should get a degree in something like computer science or engineering but I don't think I would do well.\n\nWhat majors would suit someone who is clueless when it comes to STEM related subjects (but is willing to learn) and can speak publicly.", "author": "Certain-Working5588", "created": 1619569907, "retrieved": 1632957573, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gw4dkd5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n02ql7/idk_what_to_do/gw4dkd5/", "text": "if you're gung ho about STEM, jobs involving sales engineering might be appealing. My friend was a civil engineer but then transitioned into sales engineering, and makes good money but does more client facing stuff and helps sell the product. IT might be a good choice, fewer math requirements than CS but still leads to some decent career paths. Some business majors have good job prospects and pay, like accounting, finance (depending on how prestigious your school is), supply chain management. Nursing is a good choice. Hopefully those give you some ideas.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1619572617, "upvotes": 3}}}
