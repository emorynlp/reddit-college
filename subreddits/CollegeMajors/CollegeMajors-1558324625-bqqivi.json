I can\u2019t say I know too much about average career pathways or security in communications, but it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to combine curriculum wise. \n\nThat being said, do you have interest in anthropological careers if given the opportunity? Success in anthropology very much depends on geographic location and the subfield you\u2019re planning to focus on. Even so, I feel that you can be successful anywhere with adequate preparation, so I\u2019d still recommend going for it even if you\u2019re in a smaller job pool. \n\nMay I ask what area of Anthropology you are interested in? My experience is in archaeology, but I\u2019ve been exposed to all facets of anthropology, so I should be able to give you some advice any which way.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1558371874, "upvotes": 1}}}
