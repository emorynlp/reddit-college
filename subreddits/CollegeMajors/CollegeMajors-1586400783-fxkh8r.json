Please help", "text": "Hi I'm a high school graduate going to college this August. I really can't find a right major for me so I thought someone here could help. \n\nWhat interests me: Being creative. Just creating anything in general. I do a lot of photo works, digital art but I don't see myself making a career out of it and more of a hobby in life and I'm fine with it. \n\nWhat I'm good at: Maths and Physics. I've always been naturally good at these subjects since as long as I can remember and I love these subjects. \n\nSo all my high school life I thought Architectural Engineering( Art+ Engineering) was a good fit for me. I didn't want to do just Architecture because it's only art focused and I don't want to do only that. But after all the research I've done, I don't really see myself doing Arch E. too. It's just having to work under people all my life ( Arch E needs to work under Civil E all the time) and no freedom in doing my own startup that I hate about it now. Also studying Arch E doesn't have many job prospects and is very tedious and doesn't allow students to be creative rather just get the assigned work done all his/her life. I 'd like to major in something that will give me freedom to do my own startup when I feel like I don't want to work under other people ( I hate that) if that makes sense. \n\nSo what I'd want to do is a major which has freedom. Freedom as in countless career prospects, freedom of not working under other people and sometimes maybe work from home too. Not to forget: I'd like to be creative all my life. I really am struggling with this now. I'm a good student and I do well in and outside classroom. I've got a full scholarship to study at a good engineering college in USA ( I'm from southeast Asia, btw)and that's where i'll be going in August. I have 4 months before my class starts so I really need to figure it out. \n\nOther fields that interests me: Software Engineering ( I've loved Computer Science in high school and was always good at it too plus the freedom- the kind of freedom I talked about earlier), Mech E ( again just creating things), Aerospace E\n\nI know this was a long and boring read but can someone please help me on what I should do ? Considering what I think I want to do in life.  \n\nThanks for reading.", "author": null, "created": 1586400783, "retrieved": 1632957951, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fn5vj0f": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/fxkh8r/cant_decide_what_to_major_in_please_help/fn5vj0f/", "text": "Hi there, I'm a design major. I've dabbled in Mechanical Engineering and Arch in high school. I'm not going to tell you what you should do, but with potentially wanting to run your own company, being good at math and physics, and wanting to stay creative, I can think of two majors: Industrial Design and Architectural Design. You're leaning away from arch, but it might deserve another thought. I'm close with a lot people who are going through arch design as undergrads and grads; they have to communicate with engineers so they need to know the technical language as well. Maybe see if other schools can offer you an architecture major that fits you better than the one you're looking at.\r\n\r\nWhat I really think you should look into is Industrial Design, and I'm not just saying that because it's my major lol. There are many types of industrial design. Some lean more towards designing aesthetically, some gear towards mechanical engineering. Lots in the middle. Quite a few Industrial Designers also start their own firms. You do anything from designing products, to environments, to creating concepts for futuristic movies, designing a better way to experience something (UI/UX might be right up your alley too). Take a peak around IDSA.org, Core77.com, and look at industrial design (or product design) on Pintrest. If you're interested, message me and I can tell you more about it. \r\n\r\nAside from all this, I did community college to buy myself more time. It saved me. So did talking to a counselor. See if you can find other majors in the same realm as what you're looking at. Spend hours doing it, you're bound to find something that peaks your interest. Best of luck to you!", "author": "baconbuddy95", "created": 1586677373, "upvotes": 1}}}
