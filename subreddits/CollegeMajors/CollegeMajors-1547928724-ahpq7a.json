What concentrations should I look for, and which should I avoid?\n\nI'm looking to transfer to a four year school after I get my A.S. in Business after the spring 2019 semester. My local state college offers a B.A., would it be worth it to pay more and drive a bit further to go to my (more prestigious) state university and get a B.S.? \n\n\nWhat if I'm looking to get a master's afterwards?", "author": null, "created": 1547928724, "retrieved": 1632957521, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eety56j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ahpq7a/bs_business_admin_vs_ba_business_admin/eety56j/", "text": "Neither unless you go to a top 10-15 School.  \"Accounting or MIS?\" is the proper question.

You honestly don\u2019t even need a business oriented degree to gain admission to an MBA program, and many people take this opportunity to change their fields. Just be sure to obtain a very solid GPA in the bachelors you choose, as that matters more than if it\u2019s a BS or BA. Most people say 3.0+ for most Graduate programs, 3.5+ for selective ones.\n\nThat being said, there\u2019s usually not a whole lot of difference between a BA and a BS in the same field. There certainly can be differences, such as the gen ed requirements and other extra classes, but they should all have the same core courses. They are from different schools however, so they may have more difference than I\u2019ve mentioned, so be sure to compare the course requirements between them. \n\nNow, the BS may give you a slightly better impression to employers, but if your goals are graduate school, it doesn\u2019t matter too much if it\u2019s a BA or a BS. I\u2019d personally go with the degree that you feel more comfortable with course wise, as your GPA is king for graduate programs. \n\nYou mentioned that the BS will cost more, so it\u2019s important to know how much more. Graduate school can be very expensive, so I wouldn\u2019t break the bank for your bachelors if it\u2019s just for the Science title instead of Arts. \n\n", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1548107112, "upvotes": 4}}}
