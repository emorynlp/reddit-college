Most programs require you go through at least Calculus 3, so if your math skills are good you shouldn't have a problem. \n\nIf you are unsure I would HIGHLY recommend doing community college over going to a state school and doing all of your generals. For example, it would suck if you are paying full price for each semester and are halfway into a science degree when you find out Economics is your passion.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1588792949, "upvotes": 1}, "fpmyyw5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ge9n3w/i_literally_have_no_idea_what_i_want_to_college/fpmyyw5/", "text": "How are your math skills?
