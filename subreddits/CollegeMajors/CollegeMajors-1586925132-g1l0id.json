I plan on going to a two-year college to get a more practical and a hands-on experience, and while going for at least two internships while I am in school. I plan to use my internships to focus strictly on going to, PR, Marketing and or Advertising. Then I want to go into a four-year university to study Professional Communications that focuses primarily on those who want to go into, Marketing, PR, Advertising, Journalism, Web-based communications, and Corporal Communications. Do you think I am making the right decision?

As long as you can utilize college to network with others and gain real-world experience, it is definitely a marketable major. It is also helpful if you can spend a summer in a big city (unless you live near one), since cities are where most communications/PR jobs are.", "author": "raisedincali", "created": 1586925910, "upvotes": 1}}}
