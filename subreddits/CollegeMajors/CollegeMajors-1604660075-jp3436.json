Well, at least that was the DESIRE, to keep pushing myself to study in a purely academic way instead of just understanding the concepts and moving on.\n\n3 years pass and I realize that grades are not as important as it seemed.\n\nI hope that with this online study period happening more and more students will realize it 100%, no need to stress yourself to get the highest points when in reality is good enough to study just \"To get it\" and moving on, this is the main purpose of studying, to get yourself with the necessary knowledge that you're able to explain which in turn will help you to get the career you want.\n\nTrust me, if you study for understanding the concepts, and not stressing over each assignment, the grades will be good enough without pushing it to be that way.\n\nDo you really think that doing online studies, makes you focused only on turning in the assignments?", "author": "NikitaRetro80", "created": 1604660075, "retrieved": 1632847148, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 22, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
