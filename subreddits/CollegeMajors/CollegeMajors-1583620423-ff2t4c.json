  "text": "I\u2019m a 21 year old going back to school in the fall and interested in engineering. I\u2019m wondering what degree of engineering would be the most useful for the future. It doesn\u2019t have to be just one field of engineering, multiple fields is great. I think engineering as a whole is an interesting career field/discipline and looking to get more insight.",

A specific interest in chemistry is not required.\n\nI should note that the coursework is difficult by engineering standards, which is saying something.",
