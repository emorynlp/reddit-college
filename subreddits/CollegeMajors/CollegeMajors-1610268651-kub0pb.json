However, I'd like to have a better idea of what I want to do (so that I end up taking the right classes senior year/choosing the right college for me).\n\nIt was in 7th grade that I decided I'd grow up to become a choir director because choir was the only thing I had. I wasn't athletic, I didn't like any particular subject more than another, and I wasn't involved in any other activities. I've constantly changed my mind about this over the years, of course, but I've always come back to it. The choir room is my second home, and I like the idea of having my own one day. I should also mention that I'm in the top choir, the audition-only after-school choir, and the spring musical (this year, I'm the student director!). It's safe to say that I'm pretty serious about it.\n\nHowever, I also love to read. Even before I found my love of books, I was a grammar nerd\u2014I get to pick out my birthday present from my parents every year, and when I was 13 or 14, my choice was a hoodie that simply said \" *You're \" (which is just one small example, but since it's 2:30 in the morning, it's all I got rn). I think that it would be really cool to make a career out of this love (the thought is definitely more exciting to me than music, which is saying something), but I don't really know what I'd study. I obviously thought of linguistics because it is, by definition, the study of language, but I'm not exactly sure if that's the right fit for me. I've also considered English, but I will embarrassingly admit that my love of reading has yet to extend to books that aren't targeted towards young adults and that Sparknotes has saved my English grade on more than one occasion. I'm definitely more open to reading other books, especially as I've started to read classics for school, but still. I did take a journalism class last year and write for my school's newspaper, but it wasn't something I enjoyed. I was thinking that I could possibly proofread/edit novels or something, but like I said, I don't really have a clue if that's a good idea. \n\nAnyways, I have a meeting with my counselor in 2 weeks to choose my schedule for senior year, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. I want to pick classes that will help me prepare for college/my future career, but I can't really do that without knowing what I want to do. \n\nAny and all thoughts are appreciated! I know that this post is a mess, but like I said, it's almost 3 am, and I'm panicking about the future.", "author": "starjumper28", "created": 1610268651, "retrieved": 1632957455, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gitbdkb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kub0pb/insight_on_choosing_a_major/gitbdkb/", "text": "Some colleges offer an undergraduate degree in music education. Even if the music part doesn't work out, the \"education\" part is still kind of versatile/transferable -- lots of jobs that aren't specifically teaching jobs involve training people or explaining things to people. I know a music major who's now a corporate trainer and teaches employees new skill sets. If you double-major in English, your pedagogical training could help prepare you to be an English teacher.\n\nIf you want to find out if you'd enjoy copyediting, try taking on small volunteer projects -- proofreading your friends' or siblings' essays for English class or college application essays, for example. Or fanfiction writers are always looking for volunteer \"beta readers,\" which can focus on spelling/grammar (sometimes it focuses on content). Especially once you get to college, there are a lot of students looking for someone to proofread their papers. Once you've gained some experience and references, you could start charging. Especially for college papers, you will probably need to become familiar with various citation styles (MLA, APA, Chicago) -- often what people want proofreaders to do is check that they've cited things correctly. \n\nA lot of people do copyediting as a side gig, so conceivably you could do both choir-directing and copyediting. \n\nI have a degree in linguistics. Does it have some stuff that's relevant to copyediting? Yes, but that's not the main focus (though I'm pretty sure it's also not the main focus of most English literature degrees!). Also, just fyi, the culture of linguistics as a discipline is really different from English department \"I can't stand when people misuse apostrophes\" culture. Linguistics culture is more like, \"Huh, variation in apostrophe use is really interesting! Let's see if we can find any patterns there!\" (if they talk about apostrophes at all; most linguists don't care much about apostrophes). \n\nHowever, if you want a degree that is language-related and will make people take you more seriously as a copyeditor but doesn't involve reading classic literature, linguistics definitely fits the bill. People will often be like \"oh you study linguistics, you must be really good at grammar\" even though everyone in linguistics semi-jokes that linguistics has actually made their grammar worse. (This is because linguistics students are frequently exposed to semi-grammatical or subtly ungrammatical sentences as examples to illustrate various phenomena, and hearing so many ungrammatical sentences starts to screw with your perception of what's grammatical and what's not.)\n\nSome examples of stuff we studied in my linguistics program:\n\n* Why is the plural of goose \"geese\"?\n\n* Which muscle do you use to make the \"oo\" sound?\n\n* How is the T in \"top\" different from the T in \"stop\"? \n\n* At a very abstract theoretical level, what happens to a sentence when you turn an active-voice clause into a passive one? \n\n* How do you express possession in Navajo?  \n\n* Do all languages have subordinate clauses? Do they all have verbs? Do they all have syllables? \n\n* What's the difference, syntactically and semantically, between \"eating ice cream with a spoon,\" \"eating ice cream with a friend,\" and \"eating ice cream with sprinkles\"? \n\n* Why does a certain Arabic prefix behave one way in some words and a different way in other words?", "author": "ultimate_ampersand", "created": 1610321886, "upvotes": 2}, "girzjn5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kub0pb/insight_on_choosing_a_major/girzjn5/", "text": "Hey OP, don\u2019t feel bad about not liking books outside YA!
