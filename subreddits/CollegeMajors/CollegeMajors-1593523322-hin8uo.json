The reason for this is because I don't have much ideas about majors and their respective jobs. \n\nDescribing myself, I am an average(somewhat above) student. I like Mathematics and Writing. I do Parliamentary Debating for ECs which has got me interested into Philosophy, Economics, Social Issues and International relations. I also have a deep admiration for nature.  Though I don't have a clear picture of what I want to be in the future, I intuitively think I like the profession as a professor(just guessing, and might not choose this because teachers are often underpaid) \n\nI am from a poor South Asian country though, and chances that I might not get into a liberal arts college, and I might have to work in my own country has been an obstacle because the majors I choose also should be rewarding in terms of money because I have a huge responsibility to lift my family out of poverty. \n\nTherefore, it would be great if you suggested me majors that might suit me, and would be rewarding. Your suggestions would help me widen my perspective and research. It would be helpful if you also described how the major is, what is it like studying and the future aspects of that major i.e money and the kind of jobs I'll likely get.\n\nThank you :)", "author": "Plankton6", "created": 1593523322, "retrieved": 1632957864, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fwia82t": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hin8uo/how_to_choose_a_major/fwia82t/", "text": "You didn't specifically say where you are planning on applying to school. I am not sure what job prospects of different fields are where you live or how the university systems that you wish to apply to work, so keep in mind that I am writing from an American perspective. \n\nThe fact that you like mathematics is good, as many people are turned away from rewarding programs because of it. Some of the fields of study you might be interested in could be accounting, mathematics, information technology, management information systems, economics, or some combination thereof. Some of these programs (such as accounting) require more education after an undergraduate degree, but all of them have an average mid-career salary that is at least 75kUSD/year here. \n\nWhile philosophy, social issues, international relations, etc. are definitely interesting topics and good things to value, they are not well known for their quantity of job opportunities for new graduates. If the school you end up attending allows you to pick minors or something like that, I would recommend you pick one of those as the minor or a second major. Another useful program you might like is technical writing, but I don't think that would be good as a major on its own. \n\nIf you would like to do more localized research, see what programs the schools you are considering have and then search online to see what the prospects are in the place you'd like to live, and then once you have your options narrowed down you can ask students who studied a similar program what it was like.", "author": "aegisa", "created": 1593545688, "upvotes": 2}}}
