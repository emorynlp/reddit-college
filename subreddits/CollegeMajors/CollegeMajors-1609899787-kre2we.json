  "text": "Right now I am currently debating on what to major in. I'm a sophomore in college and I'm currently interested in possible pursuing either finance, business information systems, or maybe even civil engineering. I was a CS major, but I didn't really like the logical side of thinking that CS requires. As a kid I liked to build things (bridges, etc) and whatnot and I think I still enjoy that to some extent today, but I'm also not sure if I would enjoy the other parts of civil engineering. Sometimes I think that doing something in business would be interesting, but then I just second guess myself, partly because most of my business class work is just boring. Any experience, advice, or other major ideas is appreciated!",

      "text": "You should plan to take a few different courses  that seem remotely interesting and see what you enjoy in an actual classroom environment. You can do any of the things you listed to some extent and see what you feel attracted to. On another note, if you're still interested in CS but just don't like the logic, what about computer engineering? I think there's less logic in that route, but you might want to verify that on your own.",
