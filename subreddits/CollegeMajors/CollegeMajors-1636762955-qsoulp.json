  "text": "Hello, I guess I\u2019m quite unsure on who to ask but my point is I have 3 career choices I\u2019m stuck in between and I\u2019ll present how I stand on each and why I\u2019m iffy. [ in advance I appreciate anyone who has read this ]\n\n1.) Construction Management: this major is a very safe choice for me because the jobs are endless and I know I\u2019ll make money, although the male dominated field is a bit intimidating to me which is what holds me back. I\u2019m pretty sure I could adapt to the work but idk if down the line I\u2019ll feel comfortable with my choice besides financially.\n\n2.) School Counselor: I know the school setting and I think I\u2019ll be comfortable coming here to work everyday although idk how the pay is but I\u2019m pretty sure I can survive.\n\n3.) Urban Planner: This career seemed cool because city development and how people interact with cities is interesting overall, I\u2019ve talked to an actually urban planner and got a glimpse of the career it\u2019s not as glamorous until your at a higher level which I understand but it\u2019s still cool what holds me back is that there\u2019s limited work positions\n\nIf you have any advice for me or simply advice for college in general I would appreciate it .",

      "text": "From an equally if not more confused beginning student: do what you love. I know it\u2019s cliche but after months if not years of loosing sleep over this question I finally said fuck it and took a risk, I chose geology. I used to worry about how much money I\u2019d make bc obviously none of us want to struggle but my mom explained it and it clicked. It\u2019s better to work a job you love instead of one you hate that pays well, if you love the job you\u2019ll grow and expand and build your way up since you\u2019ll likely spend years in the field, if you hate the job however you\u2019ll eventually get tired and quit without getting anywhere important. I\u2019ve been trying to finally broaden my thinking since I don\u2019t want to regret not going after what I wanted earlier in life. I know most of us don\u2019t have the luxury to explore all career paths but Id like to think no decision is ever permanent",
