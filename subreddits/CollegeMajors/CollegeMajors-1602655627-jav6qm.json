And maybe go to pharmacy school if I wanted to go beyond a bachelor's.\n\nAny advice would really appreciate it", "author": "Ronmck1", "created": 1602655627, "retrieved": 1632956884, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"g8sj4hr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jav6qm/what_should_i_major_in/g8sj4hr/", "text": "I get STEM majors asking us question like this all the time (I run a career counseling business). First off, good on you for wanting to be strategic in how you choose your major. Too many students aren\u2019t doing that, and it\u2019s an expensive mistake. \n\nTo answer your question, I recommend this: conduct as many informational interviews as you can. If you\u2019re serious about biomedical engineering, and working in the medical field as an engineer, network with your faculty members who teach courses in those fields. They almost always know professionals in the industry you can meet and learn about the actual opportunities from.\n\nIn our experience, meeting and interviewing and, most importantly, learning from experts in the actual industry are more advantageous than making a grand plan on our own. \n\nGood luck man! And feel free to reach out if you\u2019d like to be pointed in the direction of some free resources to help you settle on a decision.", "author": "AreteOdyssey", "created": 1602680774, "upvotes": 1}}}
