These requirements could be very different at your university, but generally you may have to learn and apply relaticely high level math for biochemistry.", "author": "Christhomps", "created": 1567275423, "upvotes": 1}, "eylae2m": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/cvcq52/should_i_major_in_biochemistry_im_terrible_at/eylae2m/", "text": "Even if you\u2019re not the best at math if you\u2019re willing to put in the work and have the attitude that you can get better you will be fine... worst case scenario maybe the math involved in biochem will be too much for you and you will still have time to transfer to a different, less math intensive major.", "author": "puffy-jacket", "created": 1567179921, "upvotes": 1}, "ey47fbn": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/cvcq52/should_i_major_in_biochemistry_im_terrible_at/ey47fbn/", "text": "620 isn\u2019t bad at all.
