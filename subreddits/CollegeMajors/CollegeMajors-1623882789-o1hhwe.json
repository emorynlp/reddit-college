The jobs that I want to do are becoming a sports medicine physician, a physical therapist, a physician assistant, a firefighter, or a real estate appraiser and agent at the same time. There are so many options in life. I want a fulfilling career. I have just completed all my associates credits and my counselor told me I need to pick my major. I would like to get into medical school eventually but my GPA is only a 2.93 right now (currently finishing my associates degree) 2 years into college. I have significantly improved and have gotten only A's for the past two semesters. I'm not sure if it is feasible to get my GPA up to a 3.5/3.6 by the end of my bachelors degree (2 more years of school) but I am going to try. To do this I do not want to major in Biology or Chemistry as I know it will be a lot harder for me to raise my GPA in those majors. Furthermore, if I do not get accepted into medical school, there is not much I can do with a biology/chemistry major, at least not jobs that I would enjoy. I am definitely going to minor in Spanish but I am struggling with picking my major. Based on what I said above, what do you guys think, which major I should pick for the career lifestyles I want ? Thank you for your help I greatly appreciate it, Have a good day !", "author": "Turbulent_Mention973", "created": 1623882789, "retrieved": 1632958047, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h21fjtf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o1hhwe/which_major_do_you_think_is_the_best_option_for_me/h21fjtf/", "text": "This isn\u2019t my area, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I would suggest looking up MCAT scores by major. The highest scorers come from biomedical engineering, physics, electrical engineering, economics, and neuroscience. Sciences may make it harder for you to raise your GPA, but you\u2019ll need that foundation to do well on the MCAT and the beginning of your med school program.", "author": "slouchingbethlehem", "created": 1623894313, "upvotes": 3}}}
