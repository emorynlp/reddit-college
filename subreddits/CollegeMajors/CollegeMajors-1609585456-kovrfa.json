To begin, as if right now, I want to attend college in Tokyo, I have already started the application process, so I am pretty set on studying abroad. My initial major was Psychology. It was something I was interested in, why? I don't know, I thought I would be able to read people's minds or something, however, I took an Introduction to Psychology class and I didn't like it, it didn't grasp my attention, so I want to change it. There are only a select few majors in the university I want to attend and International Affairs is what interests me the most. I have done some research, and I understand that it has to do a lot with foreign politics, economics, and cultures, understanding them, and familiarizing yourself with them. I know it is a very broad subject and it doesn't land a specific job. I like to travel and meet people. I'd like to do things to help out communities on a political spectrum or just in small ways. I guess my goal with a degree in International Affairs is to be knowledgeable and have connections so that I may meet political advisors? And such. I want to be an influential figure. I know I wrote a lot but I guess I need help in understanding international affairs and where it can take a person. Or advice on anything else that can help pursue my intentions.
