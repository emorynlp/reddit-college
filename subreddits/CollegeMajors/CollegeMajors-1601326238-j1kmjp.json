  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a high school senior that lives in California and I\u2019ve decided that I want to go to college in-state. Although I\u2019m not totally sure that I want to pursue a career in marketing, I\u2019m interested in trying it out. I have done a fair amount of research and have found that internships matter a lot more than the degree itself. Also, not many schools in California offer a marketing program. \n\nSo what should I major in? Should I just try to get a regular business administration degree and work from there? Is there another business-related major I should look into? What are my options?",
