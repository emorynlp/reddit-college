Now, I have always loved animals and wanted to work with them since I was a kid. I idolized Steve Irwin and other animal lovers. So when it came time to choose a major I obviously picked that.\n\nNow I am having second thoughts, the statistics for biology majors as far as salary and job outlook don't seem to fall in line with what I want my life to look like in 20 years. I also have an interest in finance and have considered switching to that, stock markets and money itself have grown to be quite an interest of mine and the 9-5 white collar city life appeal to me much more than odd hours and being on the road in   the wilderness doing research. Finance statistically is much more appealing, besides the math which I dislike. \n\nDoes anyone have some insight into this? I'm 18 and pretty much doing this college thing by myself with my own money and no one to guide me. I figure this is a normal process to doubt your life path but I am at an impasse.", "author": "Fienderino", "created": 1559454844, "retrieved": 1632848185, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f0gumoo": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bvudi0/torn_between_true_passion_and_money/f0gumoo/", "text": "Finance especially the higher paying side of finance ain\u2019t a 9-5 just so you know!!!", "author": "shayskates33", "created": 1568606543, "upvotes": 1}, "eqttpow": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bvudi0/torn_between_true_passion_and_money/eqttpow/", "text": "This is the biggest misconception when people decide majors of \"money vs passion.\" The whole pick something you love/passion about is all bs and non-sense.

My best friend was a bio major got no where with it. I highly suggest you switch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was doing business major first then switched CSC myself. I do recommend a business degree over a bio degree for sure. You can also go to your schools like job fares and events.

I've been surprised at some of the job options that I didn't realize were possible for my major. So maybe do a search with the biology degree and specialization and see what's there for you. Consider graduate programs in biology too and what jobs that opens up. Look at the entry level salary in the location you want to work and find out what the average salary is after 5-10 years. Then do the same for careers available with a degree in finance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on my limited knowledge and having a brother, a very close friend and a nephew with degrees in finance, I'd say job prospects, income and lifestyle is EXCELLENT. My nephew just graduated at 22 years old in finance and is making over 100k a year in his 1st job. He did go to a very prestigious UC though, and did an internship with my brother, experience in the field will help when job hunting after graduating. My friend is a stockbroker, loves her job, lives a very comfortable lifestyle and even gets paid to travel to cool locations. My brother is now a CEO, I'm not sure what job he started out in after he graduated. And you will do just fine with just your B.A and an internship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhereas with biology I believe that in order for you to have the most job security and income potential, you will need a graduate degree of some sort. All the biology majors I know have post undergrad plans like med school or or a masters or PhD. Would you like to work in a lab doing research as opposed to field work? Like the other poster said, your career advisor at your college will be the most helpful in this decision. If I had to pick one for you (I'm not an expert and I don't know you so take this with a grain of salt) I'd pick finance. I would for me except it would bore me to tears. If you have an interest you're ahead of the other students who are in it for the money. It's a stable, lucrative degree. If you chose biology you will have to work harder to make it work for you.", "author": "Ivegotthatboomboom", "created": 1559514840, "upvotes": 3}, "epth5dg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bvudi0/torn_between_true_passion_and_money/epth5dg/", "text": "Definitely talk to your career advisor.
