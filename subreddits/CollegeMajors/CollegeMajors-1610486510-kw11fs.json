I\u2019ve always been obsessed with everything design related. I discovered stop motion animations for myself when I was 5 and made more and more complex short films as I grew up. I always drew, I\u2019m currently in an arts school. I thought of app ideas and made sketches of the web pages, created the layouts of the app and all lol. I was always into rescuing homeless animals, and as I saw poor areas often, they were booming with sick, homeless animals. I devised a system of a self sufficient animal shelter, made blue prints of the building, made tons of web pages to solidify the ideas and make it easy to use. I did all of this shiz in elementary. And I loved creating little towns out of cardboard and materials around the house. I also designed t-shirts. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing alot of thinking and realized that I am going to major in design. I\u2019m thinking of doing product design. I am not sure exactly what to major in. Art? Design? If anyone in these majors has advice it would be duly appreciated!!", "author": "MademoiselleMimieu", "created": 1610486510, "retrieved": 1632957592, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gjavfw5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kw11fs/major_related_to_design/gjavfw5/", "text": "Jesus, you kinda fit yourself into a allot of creative fields there. Which actually is a good thing. Now you just gotta find the one you enjoy the most. \n\nAnyways, my personal advice to you is to make sure you properly read the syllabus/course descriptions for each major you may think of applying to. I'm a Graphic Designer but I ended up pursuing a degree in advertising (since it has many similar elements in it and was in the general direction of what I wanted to do career wise). \n\n**TLDR; Product Design, UX/UI Design or Architecture is probably your best bet based on the activities your described.**", "author": "whar_zone69", "created": 1610677993, "upvotes": 2}, "gj1mkqw": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kw11fs/major_related_to_design/gj1mkqw/", "text": "Architecture!
