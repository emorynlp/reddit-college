I am currently enrolled as a freshman, trying to get through our first semester. It's midterms week already. Through this semester I realized, the reasons why I chose this course lies under mainly my father's decision. Lately, I've talked to them, saying I really want to transfer to a state university, with different course. My mom is okay with it but my father is insisting for me to finish this course even though I am not happy and excelling at all. I need advice. Thank you.", "author": "saechwi", "created": 1604455172, "retrieved": 1632847153, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
