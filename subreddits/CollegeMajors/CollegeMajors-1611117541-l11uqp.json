So math is all the same. You just have to be consistent and do all the homework's and practice problems. Gradually working on it day by day and then it becomes really easy. Most people hate math because they don't want to do the homeworks/practice problems consistently, but if you do it then it become really easy. The best part is here now. Once you figure out how to do well in math once, then all the other maths will also become easy. You will have learned the studying pattern or how much effort needed to put in to pass and what ultimately works for you. Also, you don't have to be \"good at math\" to pass or take comp science. You can just be good enough to pass even. You can be bad at math but do well in your CS classes and be just fine.
