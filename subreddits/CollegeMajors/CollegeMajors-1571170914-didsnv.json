I'm much older than you and still have this problem and am paying a student loan off for a waste of a college degree. (BAJ, if you want to know.) Maybe consider a trade at first if you want work and money first? Keep looking at the job industry projections for the next 50 years and use that as a guide.",

              "text": "If your intent is a good paycheck and writing about helping people, then yes. A waste because at it's best, you're just a mouthpiece for a corporate agenda that doesn't care about people at a lower range annual income than most of your peers. It's been 10+ years and I still havent paid that school loan down. It's a degree, so that in itself is better than nothing but there's nothing lucrative about journalism that you can't get from reading about the ethics and AP Style rules on your own time. Now, if you do specialized writing, like in science or tech, there's more money and a better potential to do focused social work. But a basic journalism degree is spinning your wheels.\n\nCollege takes time you only get once. If you get a throw away degree as your first shot, going back to correct that later in life is much harder than doing it right the first time. I'm speaking as someone doing that right now and it sucks going back to get a better degree. Sucks more than when I was in my 20s with barely any responsibility. My advice is focus on developing a skill that is projected by the department of labor (if you're in the US) to be in demand for years to come and build around that.",

I'm considering pursuing a Journalism major because I live in a city that has a major news publication who will basically hand you an internship if you enroll in the local university. I've heard having this type of benefit can really put you out there and get you noticed in the market, but I'm wondering what your personal thoughts on this are. I love writing and editing, but I'm hesitant to get a major I regret. I'm a college sophomore btw.",

                      "text": "That's a very good question. The tl;dr answer is it's always better to have a degree in the long run. No matter what it's in. \n\nIn for experience vs. degree: \nA great example on how this shakes out. I worked for a TV station in market 3 after school. Took a pay cut from working at a college TV Dept to the station. Made the jump for the experience and on a promise of a raise. I went from 32k annum to 23k. It was a hell of a sacrifice but it seemed like the right thing to do. A year into my time there they hired a younger lady with zero journalism degree at 48k... and still no raise for me. I was pissed. Rightly so. I ended up leaving the abusive station and doing indie film. I think she eventually left too. She was too nice for such a bitter bunch of old misogynist men. These days my degree has me at a living wage rate (not in anything remotely journalism, mind you) and the young lady with no education is not doing as well. She got lucky, then. In the long run it didn't stay that way for her. Too bad, to because she is a good person and worker.\n\nThat being said, this is one anecdote so your results may vary. Though, unlikely.\n\nInternships:\nA promise of an internship is not generally the best way to choose a program as I bet that news outlet wouldn't say no to cheap/free labor from anywhere under the guise of \"education\". Hell, you could probably approach them now and ask if they'd let you intern. Honestly, a decent internship should pay something, btw. They don't all offer minimum wage+ but I've found my best experiences came from paying entities. It's truly about office ethics in this topic. \n\nA little more on internships and places that pay. All internships look great on your resume but the ones that paid me ended up giving me much more in quality contacts and future employment opportunities later on whereas the non-paying internships looked at me, and all the other interns, as expendable and inconsequential. If a place doesn't pay that's a sign of a toxic work place, in general. And one thing I really want to drive home with you that all journalism schools *incorrectly* teach is you gotta put up with toxicity and abuse to \"pay your dues.\" That is complete and utter bullshit. Beware of toxic work environments. Just because you're green does not mean you owe anyone your self worth. \n\nI think ultimately you're asking about experience over education. Sounds like you're in school so you're on the right track. My first foray into journalism was my friends and I started our own online news source which propelled me into PA work via a local university with PBS. My advice here is get your education and also don't let anyone gate keep your opportunities. If you want to intern, take a part-time job, ect. just do it. The ability to show you mean business and are unwilling to take no for an answer speaks more volume than working with an internship coordinator if/when you get there. \n\nGood luck!",
