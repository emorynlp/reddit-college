I showed my parents today my ideas so that they could help me choose which one makes sense, and my mom does not agree with any of them. She says their okay, but not the best.\n\n  \nHer idea is for me to get a bachelors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or basically a broad subject, and then get a masters in a specialty within that subject. For example, she stated that I could major in biology, then get a masters in botany or zoology. Or I could major in chemistry and then go into toxicology / forensic science.\n\nShe believes that in this time, a bachelors will not land you any worthwhile job (considering the above majors), and that a masters is necessary to find a good paying job. I do partially agree, in that getting a masters will increase your pay no matter your major. But I don't think the way of getting a masters is focusing on those broad subjects. I tried asking her if doing a BA/MA in economics would fit it, but she doesn't agree.\n\nIs she correct? Should I major in biology/chem/physics, or can I major in what I was looking at?\n\nAdditionally, I should mention that I have absolutely no interest in majoring in bio/math/chem/physics, but she says that sometimes you have to sacrifice and find the middle for what you want to do and what will be worthwhile. I however just cannot see myself majoring in ANYTHING that she suggested. How do I convince her to see it my way, or should I really follow what she was suggesting?", "author": "ap7125", "created": 1612578653, "retrieved": 1632956785, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"gmraot6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ldnuid/how_do_i_convince_my_mom_that_her_idea_for/gmraot6/", "text": "I guarantee that a bachelors in economics will get you better jobs than a masters in zoology, LOL\n\n\nDon't listen to her bro, she has no idea what she's talking about.", "author": "Atsena", "created": 1612914335, "upvotes": 3}, "gm6x8r3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ldnuid/how_do_i_convince_my_mom_that_her_idea_for/gm6x8r3/", "text": "Major in what you want to major in.
