(x-post r/findapath)", "text": " Not sure if this is the right sub, if it would be better suited elsewhere please lmk! Anyways, I am a college student, about to enter my sophomore year, and I don't have a major although I have a general idea of what I would like to have in a career.\n\nMy strongest skills are with writing, math, and performing any detail oriented tasks (as opposed to abstract ideas).\n\nMy priorities for a future career are (in order): work life balance, demand, and pay (ideally making at least $60k but I live in a lower COL area so less is completely doable)\n\nI am interested in a job within the finance field and am essentially stuck between a few options:\n\n1. Accounting. Accounting appeals to me because personal finance and financial planning are passions of mine. I also like the idea of a healthy work life balance and the demand. However my Googling suggests that accountants aren't particularly satisfied with their jobs.\n2. Financial planning. My university does not offer this program so it would end up being the most costly option because my financial aid package covers all of my schooling for undergrad, even if it were to take me more than 4 years. The biggest appeal for me is that it appears to be quite easy to take this job remotely, which could be beneficial because it could allow me to be a SAHM/WFHM far down the line.\n3. Data science. This is honestly the most appealing career because it has a good salary, high demand, and high satisfaction ratings. My university offers this program as a major, a minor, and as a masters or concentration for another masters degree.\n\nMy only worry is that, since I am 2 semesters in to college and my 3rd semester is just beginning, it would cause me to graduate later than expected if I were to either declare a data science major or a double major. Would that reflect poorly or disadvantage me in any way?\n\nThe classes I am taking this semester all fully support the finance major and I am still on track to graduate on time. I could fit data science in as a minor pretty easily, but I wonder if this would be enough to break into the field after graduating? Or would I be better of taking on a double major and graduating a year later than I am supposed to? Eventually I do plan on returning to grad school as well, but my hope is to get 2-4 years of work in before I go back for a master's degree.\n\nThank you so much for any insight you can give me! If there's anything I failed to mention pls ask and I'll gladly answer.", "author": "JohnPhillipSocks", "created": 1598158450, "retrieved": 1632958100, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
