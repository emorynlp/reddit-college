Right now I am majoring in Environmental Science and specializing in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution. I'm planning on minoring in Global Health. I want to work with diseases and viruses in the laboratory hopefully. So I guess what I'm asking is are the major and minor I'm in now good in order to enter into the field of studying disease or should I switch to another major like microbiology or biochem?", "author": "ghoul_whip1", "created": 1589529498, "retrieved": 1632847726, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fsbfuy2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gk4xqt/what_should_i_major_in_to_study_diseases_and/fsbfuy2/", "text": "Biomedical science", "author": "mysterioushade", "created": 1590855679, "upvotes": 1}, "fqqbmk1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gk4xqt/what_should_i_major_in_to_study_diseases_and/fqqbmk1/", "text": "Microbiology and biochem are good.
