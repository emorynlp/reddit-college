  "text": "So I don't know exactly what I want to major in and I guess I need some guidance into majors to look into. Right now I am majoring in Environmental Science and specializing in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution. I'm planning on minoring in Global Health. I want to work with diseases and viruses in the laboratory hopefully. So I guess what I'm asking is are the major and minor I'm in now good in order to enter into the field of studying disease or should I switch to another major like microbiology or biochem?",
