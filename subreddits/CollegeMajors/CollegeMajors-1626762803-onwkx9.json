  "text": "hi! so i am a sophomore in college just doing my general education classes because i don't have much of an idea what career i want! \n\ni have recently found myself liking careers dealing with design. i just want a career that can let me be creative and express myself or something artistically. i have finally found something (or an idea of what i want) specifically! i want to be able to have creative direction for musicians. i want to deal with advertising, or music video, or album making. but i am unsure of what exactly that career path would be? i am mostly interested in designing albums (cds, cassettes, vinyls, etc). what could i go to college for to be able to design for things like this? what career(s) should i specifically look into for what i want? i am also looking for smaller careers in music that people don't normally think about!!",

      "text": "if you\u2019re thinking about designing album covers and all that, you should major in graphic design. \n\ni\u2019m not well versed in the music world, but i know people get commissioned to do merchandise for tours and album releases. i think [kel lauren](https://kellauren.design/) does videos on this! \n\nalso maybe about creative directing and promoting albums, you should check out the marketing side of things. i know musicians tends to have their own visions on how they wanna do their album release aesthetic and there\u2019s a whole team of publicist, designers, PR, and marketing people helping to make that happen",
