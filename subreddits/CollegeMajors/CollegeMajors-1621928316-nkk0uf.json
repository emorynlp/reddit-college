  "text": "my major is currently psychology, but I have to change it due to not having enough classes to be a psych major. I just got my AA at a community college and I'm transferring to a 4 year this fall. Not sure what I want to major in. I really like working with people and I LOVE numbers, and figuring shit out. NI had no idea what economics was this time last year, I took the class as a filler and ended up \"falling in love\" with it and so I'm for sure changing my major to econ but I want 2 degrees even though I'm unsure if I can handle the load \ud83d\ude05I plan on taking summer courses as well.",
