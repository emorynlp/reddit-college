Lately, I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do in the future. I want to go to college, get a degree, but I don't know which field suits me the best. I have an aptitude for  language learning, I love to communicate with people, learn about other people's cultures. I am good at History, but not passionate enough to choose it as my major. I want a stable job that can be interesting to pursue and pay a little more than enough.
