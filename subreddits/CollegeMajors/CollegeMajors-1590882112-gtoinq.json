My institution has a list of all the majors that students typically pair with history. Do you have a plan for what you want to do after graduation?  That can help you decide on which major to pick, but here are some that are common:\n\nAnthropology, Geography, Criminals Justice, Classics, Economics, Political Science, Environmental Science, American Indian Studies, Education, Philosophy, any language major, any major that pertains to law, etc.\n\n\nReally, any major could really fit with history, but these are the ones I feel are complimented by  a history major. International relations would fit perfectly too, so it depends on what you want out of your time in college.\n\nThe list formatting isn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019m on mobile and it won\u2019t format in a more appealing way.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1590885923, "upvotes": 1}}}
