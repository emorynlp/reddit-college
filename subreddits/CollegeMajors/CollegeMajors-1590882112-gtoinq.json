Do you have a plan for what you want to do after graduation?  That can help you decide on which major to pick, but here are some that are common:\n\nAnthropology, Geography, Criminals Justice, Classics, Economics, Political Science, Environmental Science, American Indian Studies, Education, Philosophy, any language major, any major that pertains to law, etc.\n\n\nReally, any major could really fit with history, but these are the ones I feel are complimented by  a history major. International relations would fit perfectly too, so it depends on what you want out of your time in college.\n\nThe list formatting isn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019m on mobile and it won\u2019t format in a more appealing way.",

Were the people that told you that history or international relations graduates? Talk to the departments themselves and alumni, they usually have recommendations for how to succeed after college with their degrees. \n\nAs for making $70,000 a year, that is quite a lot to be making right out of college with almost any major if you decide not to be a lawyer.

However, I\u2019m in a similar field that has similar prospects. As long as you have a plan for what you want to do after college and actively prepare for it, you\u2019ll be successful.\n\nYou could try asking the r/history subreddit, but personally, reddit isn\u2019t a good way to get helpful personalized advice. People live in different job markets, some people didn\u2019t think about the future, and some people are just depressing, so experiences vary. What you should do is to try to find a history major group from your University. This could be a club, a Facebook group, anything! From there, you can then ask around about the major and get help from current students and alumni. You could also check your history department\u2019s website, as some universities post alumni stories. You could also just ask the department itself, as they\u2019re usually composed of history alumni.",
