Information technology & administrative management). I do community management and social media work. I nearly finished out a film minor and art minor. I did get a creative writing minor. That's actually probably the most helpful with all my degrees and my hobbies too. Streaming on Twitch and creating content for seven years. I had an advisor advise me to take journalism but I wish I would have got into marketing. Not that I am mad at the person or anything like that. I have so many passions it's hard to choose you what your gonna do.",
