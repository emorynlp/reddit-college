[18 M]", "text": "I'm 18 and just graduated high school and I'm currently enrolled at a pretty well known art school as a film/filmmaking major. 6 months ago if you asked me if I was making the right choice I would've without hesitation said, \"Absolutely!\". However, I've recently had a change of heart and am wondering if I should switch my major to something else, likely something not in the arts. One thing that I've heavily considered is studying computer science instead.\n\nSo I guess I should explain why I don't want to major in film: I don't like the idea of not making a decent amount of money, working a ton of hours and being in student loan debt. It's pretty well known that people that work in the film industry don't make a decent amount of money unless they become very successful, and that scares me. I want to be able to pay off my student loans fairly quickly and it doesn't seem like that's possible given the median salary of film majors (after graduating). I want to be able to pay my bills, live in a nice house and hopefully one day support a family, but it doesn't feel like being a worker in the film industry will allow me to do so.\n\nBut at the same time, I love film. I love writing screenplays, taking pictures, watching movies and pretty much everything a film junkie is into. I'll admit in the last few months I've taken a but of a step away from all of it, but I still love it. However, I don't think I have what it takes to make it big in the industry. Should I be more confident? Probably. Could I be having some kind of Imposter Syndrome. Likely yes. Like I said, I love film, but I don't know if following my passion and doing what I love is worth not living comfortable finically. Another question I ask fearfully myself is, \"If film was something I did every day, would I begin to dislike it over time?\"\n\nSo if I were to switch my major, I'd likely have to leave the college/art school I'm currently enrolled in because I'd likely study something outside of the arts. Something I've started to look into is computer science and I've even started to each myself how to code. I'm not entirely sure if I like it yet but I think it's something I might like. I think I've always been good with tech and also I like solving problems and I know that's a big component of coding/programming. I also like the fact that programers are in very high demand right now and it pays pretty well. Some people that I know that are programmers have pretty flexible work hours, vacation days and they can even work from home if they want (Although right now I think I've had enough of working from home. Thanks COVID.)\n\nThe biggest part of this dilemma of mine is financial. I don't want to be in a lot of college debt and struggle to pay it off. If I were to go through with being a film major I could always go to another school that doesn't cost as much as the school I'm currently supposed to go to. But at the same time, I know I wouldn't make a good amount of money in the film industry. I would like to be able to pay my bills, have a nice house, support a family and even drive a nice car (I know that sounds materialistic).\n\nSo something I've considered is deferring my enrollment to the art school I'm currently going to, and going to my local community college for a semester to give myself more time to think about what path I want to take. I hope that if I were to go to community college for a semester I could take some film classes and computer science classes at the same time. I've even thought about that maybe if I go to another school that I could major in computer science and minor in film or even vice versa.\n\nI'm fighting the urge to just say screw it and go to the college I'm currently enrolled in because I want to start my college experience now, I love the area that the school is in and I want to be independent but I know that isn't really responsible and that when I go off to school, I should be going for the right major.\n\nSo should I follow my passion now? Or should I give myself some time to think about it and maybe find something else to study that I could be passionate about?\n\nRight now to me I think it's either I go to art school now and study film/filmmaking or go to my community college for a semester and give myself time to think about what I want to do.\n\nIf anyone has any type of advice that'd be great. I know this is a decision I have to make for myself because it's my life, but I would still appreciate any input.\n\nThanks!\n\n(P.S.
