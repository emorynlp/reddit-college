Currently, I am double majoring in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics, with a Computer Science minor. I have been thinking about what to major in for awhile and I am not quite sure what would be best. I also have no clue what job I want to do but I want something with a good work/life balance and lifestyle, as well as a comfortable salary that can help me live upper middle class by mid-career. My ideas right now are:\n\n* Keep my MIS/Business Analytics double major + CS minor\n* MIS/Finance double major\n* MIS/Accounting double major\n* Finance/Business Analytics double major\n\nI am worried that a finance major will not be too good since I am not at a target or semi-target school. Any advice or other combination ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!", "author": "jaked72", "created": 1632533659, "retrieved": 1632958001, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he6fsxe": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/puwz5n/business_major_combinations/he6fsxe/", "text": "I've heard the same thing about finance majors at none target schools. I am not a finance guy myself, but my intuition tells me that it probably is a riskier play than your other options, unless you have some connections that I'm not aware of.\n\nI think most of these combinations could be good choices. The question is though, what do you find interesting? I think accounting might be the \"safest\" choice here, but that is really irrelevant if you find a particular subject way more interesting or if there's a specific career you want...", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1632540993, "upvotes": 2}}}
