      "text": "It's a fun degree to persue. To me it was very interesting and easy. \n\nThere just aren't many jobs that want to hire an econ grad. If it says econ it usually says business/finance and other degrees as well. \n\nEcon is a super broad degree that doesn't specifically get you into one job/industry easily. \n\nIf you want quick easy job hunts look at STEM degrees.",

      "text": "You can get a good job with any degree, including economics, if you\u2019re smart about getting experience and job-specific skills. Internships (either paid or part-time for college credit) help a lot! \n\nI know an econ major who\u2019s killing it in marketing. Financial analyst, credit analyst, research analyst, etc. could also be great job options if you build the right skills/experience alongside your degree. For these jobs, an econ degree will be viewed positively. Look up entry level job openings in these fields in your area and see what skills/experience they require, then find a way to get it before you graduate.",
