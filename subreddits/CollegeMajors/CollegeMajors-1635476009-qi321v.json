  "text": "I really need help on pathway suggestions and major suggestions. \n\neducation context:\n\ncurrent education: ib dp 1 (year 11)\nHLs : math aa psych business management\nSLs: english a, physics, my home language can\u2019t say sorry \n\nuniversity aspirations: in canada. A few on my list would be: UBC, Mcgill, UOFT, Mcmasters, Western, Carleton.. if any good uni program pop after reading this, do suggest \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nThing is with me is that I am highly conflicted and passionless.\n\nI have interest in Media and Psychology programs and if I\u2019m being honest, more so with media programs.\n\nBut at the same time, I think Psychology lays out a clearer path and perhaps more stable in that sense. But it takes a long time, typically you need a master degree to have a shot at a well-paying job from what I hear. And I bet it\u2019s harder for me as an international student to become a licensed psychologist.\n\nSo then on the other hand, I\u2019m thinking of a double major degree. I\u2019m thinking of pairing any of these majors with a math related major as a dual degree or as a minor to perhaps yeah, give myself a back up considering math-related degrees are known to be quite in demand so I just think that that would serve me well again as an international student that wants to stay. Plus, I\u2019m quite good in maths. So it\u2019s not like really going to be a push for me or anything. \n\nFinally, I think of co op programs with either a Media communications sort of program or psychology because these are my interests as I\u2019ve mentioned and with co op programs, I have the opportunity to work while studying, thus gaining work experience that would be much needed for further job applications after graduation.\n\n\nBut then overall, all these pathways are just.. I\u2019m not sure you know? It would be just much more simpler if I had a flicker of an idea what I wanted to do.\n\nAll I know for certain is that I want to study and work there. Which is a bullshit thing to be certain of I guess..since of course most international students want to stay so I\u2019m just another one in that bunch. But I guess for now, I would love to just have some..direction you know? It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re an over thinker with anxiety and always need to plan things but you have no direction lol it\u2019s like \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nif this provides any kind of context or could help with suggestions\n\nmedia related: in my free time, I enjoy watching movies, dramas- sometimes analyzing the acting but mostly mentally lol so that\u2019s pretty useless to know but yeah i find myself doing that a lot and i have natural interest in the entertainment industry so I often thought about being a director or something in the industry but i have no confidence so that sucks lol\n\nmath related: i\u2019m not those math geeks that do math in their free time no, but i wouldn\u2019t mind doing them like solving math problems while listening to music or something you know? I do enjoy it when I get to do it and not give in to my laziness\n\nfor psychology: i also have natural interest in psychology and I do well in the courses actually it\u2019s always been the \u201cif i don\u2019t know what i wanna do imma just fuck it and go with psychology\u201d option",
