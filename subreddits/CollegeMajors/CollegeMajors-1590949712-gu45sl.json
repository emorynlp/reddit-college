Thing is, college for me is more of an investment than a expirience so I'd like to find out what I'd be alright in. I'm a analytical person who knows how to investigate and put effort into my research. I'm very good at looking things through a objective, analytical eye and my linguistics are also on par with it. What I lack in is perspective, and I can't look at things from different angles which means I'd be a terrible architect. I have a pretty broad interest range and I'd like to major in something that involves critical-thinking and problem solving. \nI did some tests online and some research and most of my interests are not exactly tied together that well in order to come to a full circle. I'm into tech, econ, politics, business, psychology (always good for reading people) and languages. And being flexible in this day and age helps out a lot. So what would you recommend to someone who can research, doesn't find math troubling, likes tech, lab work and wants to find out how people tick?", "author": "MetAtaFuneral", "created": 1590949712, "retrieved": 1632958118, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fshecq1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gu45sl/help_out_someone_undecided/fshecq1/", "text": "Consider computer science. One of the cool things about the major is that it can be applied to so many different areas. Using python or R for data analysis can help you understand political trends, you can make apps or websites that fulfill different business needs, etc. It's really a great major for people with really broad interests. If you do major in CS, a double major would really help hi light this, and I know people who majored in CS and Econ and got jobs in fin tech, or people who studied CS and biology and went into bioinformatics, etc. My personal suggestion, but I'm sure many other majors out there would be great, too.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1590976028, "upvotes": 1}, "fsg2f8q": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gu45sl/help_out_someone_undecided/fsg2f8q/", "text": "Double Major in Mathematics and Economics or Sociology \n\nOr Major in Mathematics and Double Minor in Economics and Sociology.\n\nOr figure out a combination of these three subjects.", "author": "DetectiveTacoX", "created": 1590950209, "upvotes": 1}}}
