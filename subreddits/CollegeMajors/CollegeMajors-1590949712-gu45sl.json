  "text": "Fresh out of high school, and I have no idea what I'd like to major in. Thing is, college for me is more of an investment than a expirience so I'd like to find out what I'd be alright in. I'm a analytical person who knows how to investigate and put effort into my research. I'm very good at looking things through a objective, analytical eye and my linguistics are also on par with it. What I lack in is perspective, and I can't look at things from different angles which means I'd be a terrible architect. I have a pretty broad interest range and I'd like to major in something that involves critical-thinking and problem solving. \nI did some tests online and some research and most of my interests are not exactly tied together that well in order to come to a full circle. I'm into tech, econ, politics, business, psychology (always good for reading people) and languages. And being flexible in this day and age helps out a lot. So what would you recommend to someone who can research, doesn't find math troubling, likes tech, lab work and wants to find out how people tick?",

      "text": "Consider computer science. One of the cool things about the major is that it can be applied to so many different areas. Using python or R for data analysis can help you understand political trends, you can make apps or websites that fulfill different business needs, etc. It's really a great major for people with really broad interests. If you do major in CS, a double major would really help hi light this, and I know people who majored in CS and Econ and got jobs in fin tech, or people who studied CS and biology and went into bioinformatics, etc. My personal suggestion, but I'm sure many other majors out there would be great, too.",

          "text": "Yeah you're not the first one to offer me that suggestion and a lot of people already told me that it's pretty amazing. Everything from the job growth to the satisfaction with it, though my question is if it has anything to do with perspective and things like that? Nothing you can't push through right? Though I'm biased since I had first hand expirience when it comes to mechanics and mechanical drawing, and I barely managed to pass. That's the thing that bothers me most since it differs from every college.  Considering I've been teaching myself the basics for Python and I really doubt I'll have any issue when it comes to the intro classes. What do you think about IT or ICT?",

              "text": "well, it's obviously up to you, and IT and ICT are both fine majors in terms of employability as long as you put in the effort. But the great thing about computer science is that it lets you build new things. IT and ICT are both businessy type degrees, where you're mostly going to learn how to set up technology for a business, and you'll probably do some coding, but not like in a CS degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think CS is very much about perspective. It's hard, but tends to not be quite as hard conceptually as some math concepts or physics (at least in my experience, this can differ for everyone). The hard part about CS is that it can be really frustrating, just trying to get your shit to work and trying to understand where you even begin sometimes. But a lot of it is still very much a matter of perspective. It can be intimidating, but then there are people who embrace the work level and challenge in these classes, and then there are the people who don't have the drive or interest and end up doing poorly, cheating, or failing out. It really depends. I wouldn't do it as a major if you're not interested, but the nature of the work is very different from other subjects in school, so I think that it's hard to predict whether someone will like it or not, and everyone should give it a try IMO.",
