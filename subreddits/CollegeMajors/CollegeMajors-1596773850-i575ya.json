At first when deciding what major to pursue, i was thinking either bio or chem but then i found out about biochem and thought it was a good idea and stuck with that. In ninth grade normal Bio I had a B, A, and an A for each trimester. In tenth grade I took normal chem and had a B, B, and a B in each trimester. In 11th grade, I took AP Chem and had 2 C's and an A in the last term (trimester) during the pandemic. When i say C's i mean like a 79, nothing too low. Looking back, I can say that I really liked AP Chem and found it fun/enjoyable somehow although I struggled a lot. I'm going to be taking AP Bio senior year. I have the intention of med school in the future. When discussing it with my parents, they said I should choose an easier major like Biology, but I am really not sure.", "author": "Traditional_Skin2003", "created": 1596773850, "retrieved": 1632956792, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g270qav": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i575ya/should_i_major_in_biochemistry_or_biology/g270qav/", "text": "I was in a similar spot and am now a biochem major, and biochemistry more of chemistry major with an emphasis on biological systems, the difference with a chem major being that you take a biochemistry sequence and some labs related to biochemistry, and probably don't have as many math and physics support requirements as chemistry majors, you still take physical chemistry thought. At my university and Schools I looked at, biochem takes the harder physics for scientist and engineers sequence as well as more math than biology majors.", "author": "trans-2butene", "created": 1597912490, "upvotes": 1}, "g0no5ua": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i575ya/should_i_major_in_biochemistry_or_biology/g0no5ua/", "text": "Depends more what you want to focus on.

If you're good with organic chemistry and understanding reactions, you can go with biochem.\n But biology gives you a much wider scope as it covers more topics. But from what I have seen, a biology major isn't easy is any way. I haven't studied it but the difficulty rises in the fact that biochemistry is a bit more understanding based while (I think, I don't know) biology is more memory based. Biochemistry does have a lot of stuff to remember but it's a weird mix of understanding and memory.", "author": "mekhhhzz", "created": 1596781923, "upvotes": 2}}}
