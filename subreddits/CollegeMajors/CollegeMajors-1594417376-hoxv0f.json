Over this summer I changed my major from business admin to construction management. I chose construction management because i've always loved and been interested in real estate and everything that has to do with houses. I decided i want to be involved in the process somehow, which is why i chose cm.**  \n**I am kind of having second thoughts about this major and considering real estate development or urban planning. My biggest problem with real estate development is that only two schools in california offer it: ucsd (72% acceptance rate to the major, 54% to the school) and usc (3% acceptance rate to the majors, 24% to the school) and im already doubting if ill even get accepted to those schools. As for urban planning, I don't know if it'll be the right major for me because i want to focus only on houses and buildings and not on social issues.**  \n**From what I've researched and read, i think real estate development is my career goal but i also like and am fine with sticking to construction management**  \n**Here are my thoughts and options:**  \n**Just construction management**  \n**Construction management to real estate development**  \n**Urban planning undergrad real estate development masters**  \n**real estate development undergrad**  \n\n\n**Which route should I take? or are there any majors or careers I haven't considered? (i don't want to do just be a real estate agent and i don't want a bachelors in real estate)**  \n**Any advice or information would be really appreciated.**", "author": "alexoval", "created": 1594417376, "retrieved": 1632847649, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
