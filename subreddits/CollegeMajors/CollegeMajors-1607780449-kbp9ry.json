  "title:": "Should I stay or leave the bio major? I need help sorting out my thoughts",
  "text": "My first post (sorry it's long):\n\nI am a freshman in uni; just finished my first quarter at uni. \n\nI hated it. I hated almost every moment of it.\n\nI chose to be a bio major because I excelled in subjects regarding human anatomy. I loved learning about the human body and it led to me wanting to be a doctor. But that's it. I don't care about any other aspect. Furthermore, I never learned basic biology or chemistry in high school (godawful teachers) and didn't think to self-teach myself.\n\nNow the present: I failed both of my intro classes to biology and chemistry. I've never seen some of these topics before and I struggled to stay afloat. I've never felt so stupid and helpless. I was even assigned to be in a support class for chemistry and it got me nowhere! Nothing in the major seemed interesting to me. And I didn't help myself either. I studied at the last minute, I slept through/skipped some lectures, I looked up answers and relied on others to answer - I am very immature and I'm ashamed of it. Either way, every day was grating and I dreaded going to classes.\n\nI don't know if I should stay. I don't know if I was just discouraged because I didn't understand the topics or if my lack of passion was really why I couldn't bring myself to try. As much as I want to become a doctor, if I'm like this (passionless, lazy, and immature), I don't think it's worth it for me. But I can't seem to be able to let go of my passion for the human body (I easily aced classes that involved that topic and I really am interested in it). I don't know what to feel or what I'm feeling. I've been burnt out for the past weeks, lost, and alone.\n\nI want to change majors, but I'm hesitant. I've got other things I enjoy a lot more, but there aren't as many job opportunities in the major I'm considering. Another reason I think I need to stay is that there are more job opportunities available with a  biology degree.\n\nSo, should I stay and learn to love my major if it means encountering my favorite subject? Should I leave and find something I'm more likely to put effort into and am more passionate about?  Is university the not right thing for me at the moment considering how immature I am?\n\nI know that I will get nowhere in life with my lifestyle, and there is almost no way I will get into medical school (I don't even know if I want to anymore). I want to force myself to become a better person and make something of myself. If you have any words of wisdom, I would love to hear them.\n\nTL;DR: I am not passionate about the biology major but I love human anatomy. Should I leave or stay?",

Explore some other classes next quarter to see if that's something you like, as a freshman you have some time to explore your interests.",

I don\u2019t think I am prepared for the rigor of university yet",

Personally what i would do if i were you is go back to community college and take a ton of classes and see what you enjoy. Dont be paying thousands to go to university when you dont know what you want to study. Also watch that video as well, it lays out a method to decide what degree you would love",
