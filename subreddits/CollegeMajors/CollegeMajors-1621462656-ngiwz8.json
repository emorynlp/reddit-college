(such as oversaturation, low-wage, the pressure to keep creating something new).\n\nAre my troubles something that all college majors face? or is it unique to this major?\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add that in this specific major, I work so much that it is actually detrimental to my health, I dont have enough time to exercise and I have to skip sleep alot. Is this normal in other majors too?", "author": "meowwmeowwmeow", "created": 1621462656, "retrieved": 1632846544, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyxi92f": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ngiwz8/is_it_normal_to_regret_these_things_about_your/gyxi92f/", "text": "Yes that is really normal.
