I am currently enrolled to the University of North Texas to start off my freshman year very soon! I've always known I'm a big math nerd, and I enjoy doing math whenever I can. My plan is get a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics since I already have an Associates of Arts. No I do not plan on being a teacher, so I guess the teacher certification is not a thought for me... however I'm very open to pretty much anything else. The program states I need to have a minor (no specifications) that is not statistics.  \n\n\nBasically what I'm asking is what do you guys think a minor would work best with a BA in Mathematics given that I am not interested in teaching at all? How could that minor help me out?", "author": "_Pantomime", "created": 1564099412, "retrieved": 1632957987, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"euyrabb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/chvkx1/what_would_be_the_minor_that_is_most_beneficial/euyrabb/", "text": "Along with the other comment, I think computer science would be a really nice compliment as well.
