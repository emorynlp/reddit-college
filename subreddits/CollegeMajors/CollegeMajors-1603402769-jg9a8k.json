I really hate biology on the other hand, overall although studying physics is what I enjoy the most, as a career I don\u2019t think physics is what I\u2019d want. I\u2019m really interested in medicine as a whole, and not pharmacy per say, but more researching and the manufacture of medicine. What medicine related majors have the least biology skill required? I\u2019m looking for a career in the manufacture of medicine that includes a lot of chemistry and math rather than biology.

I\u2019d second the vote for an engineering field \u2014 if not biomedical engineering, then one of the fields that bleeds into it. Consider mechanical engineering if you just like physics and are open to manufacturing medical devices, chemical engineering if you decide you really do want to manufacture medicine and don\u2019t mind spending a lot of time in a wet lab with test tubes. Even then, if you want to do anything medical related, you\u2019ll probably have to suffer through at least a couple of biology classes.", "author": "Lily9879", "created": 1603443070, "upvotes": 2}, "g9ptame": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jg9a8k/college_majors_related_to_medicine/g9ptame/", "text": "Chemical engineering?", "author": "pinnipedenthusiast", "created": 1603418689, "upvotes": 1}}}
