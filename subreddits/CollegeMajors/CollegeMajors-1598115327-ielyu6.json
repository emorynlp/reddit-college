I live both topics very much and do not want to minor, just double major.\n\nI chose film studies because I feel it would be interesting to go into some sort of film therapy if there is one, and if there isn\u2019t one, then create one. I also enjoy making short films and the entertainment industry in general and would like to experience it more one day.\n\n\nI am fascinated with many subjects and I want to accomplish many things in my life. My main goal is to work in a lab, testing theories, and to create new technologies. However, I\u2019m not taking new iPhones and computers. I want to create crazy things like new communication devices so you\u2019re able to understand animals better, or even mind reading devices. I\u2019d love to try and tie in the human brain with these technologies because both things have always interested me. I figured psychology was the best fit for this but is there another major that would pertain better to my goal?", "author": "Jess2344", "created": 1598115327, "retrieved": 1632955862, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"g2hsrsc": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ielyu6/is_my_college_major_right_for_what_i_want_to/g2hsrsc/", "text": "No, you would need to go into electrical engineering with possibly a double major in Computer Science to even begin to scratch the surface with what you are doing. \n\nFor your first goal you would need a PhD at minimum in psychology to even attempt any form of therapy.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1598117209, "upvotes": 1}, "g2hphfk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ielyu6/is_my_college_major_right_for_what_i_want_to/g2hphfk/", "text": "Well if you want to create those devices I\u2019d say engineering (esp. computer, electronic or electrical) would be a good bet.", "author": "CarrawayLights", "created": 1598115704, "upvotes": 2}}}
