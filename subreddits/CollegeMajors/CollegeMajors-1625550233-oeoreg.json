      "text": "Well, you have to have an idea of what you want to do. Take it from someone who picked a major they didn't love and ended up working in the field they wanted and not their intended major. You have to have some sort of idea of what career you would like before. With the skills you describe I would suggest a business administration degree. You could concentrate on accounting, finance, or management. Depends on what you see yourself doing most. Accounting/finance would require more of an \"office 9-5\" vibe. While a management concentration could translate into more career options depending on where you would like to work. Hospitality, healthcare, banking, etc. This could provide you with a more hands-on job.",

              "text": "Accounting or finance sounds good for you. Depending on your university\u2019s programs and which one you want. But they are similar degrees. I will that not a lot of jobs will pay you $75K right off the bat. Unless perhaps you have a Master\u2019s. But you can definitely get up there. With a Master\u2019s in accounting and getting your public accounting licensing, you become very successfully financially in that field.",
