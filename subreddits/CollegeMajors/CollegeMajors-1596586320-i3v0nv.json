  "text": "I graduated highschool and still have no idea what to do. I decided to go to college next year, and either starting in the summer or fall. I love music and might continue to pursue it, but I'm on the fence because I'm also trying to find a realistic career. Maybe I've made up my mind but I feel like I'm just lying to myself too.",

      "text": "Look into STEM field majors. You might find something that might interest you. That being in chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, materials engineering, computer science, etc. Music is great and all, but I don't believe that going to college for it is better than just studying it on your own time, while going to college for something else. However, this is up to you on what you want to do. I really wish that going to college for music allows a lot of opportunities, but the jobs you should expect if you go down this route is being a music teacher. Heck this might be what you want to do. Best of wishes for you and your decision.",

      "text": "Part of why one goes to college is to try lots of different things and see where your interests are. The first 2 years should be for taking your required general classes, the final 2 years for studying your declared major. There's room for electives, try a wide range. Maybe put off college for a year or two to try internships or apprenticeships so you get free real world exposure to a variety of careers (and hopefully earn a few bucks to put towards school along the way). Good luck!",
