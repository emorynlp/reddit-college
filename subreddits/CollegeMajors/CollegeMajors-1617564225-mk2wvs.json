I\u2019m just not sure I know I want to be happy but I don\u2019t know where exactly to venture or where my source of happiness comes and college is passing by so fast .

I suggest going to something like Crash Course (YouTube channel) and seeing the different topics and just watch the first video for whatever sounds interesting.\n\nDifferent majors and careers have different levels of interest for different people. For some accounting is super interesting and fun. Don't be bogged down by what others say about different majors/careers, just go by the impressions you get by personally trying each thing.
