  "text": "I don\u2019t even know what I want to be after college like ik engineers and computer science is booming but it\u2019s not my cup of tea also people bash on so many liberal arts majors and psych majors also getting a masters seems quite expense and I don\u2019t want to fall into extreme debt and careers like accounting provide job security but could also lead me to hate my life ? I\u2019m just not sure I know I want to be happy but I don\u2019t know where exactly to venture or where my source of happiness comes and college is passing by so fast . I\u2019m scared I guess as many are or I assume would be. [ also if u went this far plz tell me what ur major is and why u choose it ty! ]",

      "text": "You should definitely begin by doing some intro work for anything you're remotely interested in and noticing what you might want to continue learning about. I suggest going to something like Crash Course (YouTube channel) and seeing the different topics and just watch the first video for whatever sounds interesting.\n\nDifferent majors and careers have different levels of interest for different people. For some accounting is super interesting and fun. Don't be bogged down by what others say about different majors/careers, just go by the impressions you get by personally trying each thing. It's a lot of trial and error but you'll find something that interests you if you keep trying new things.",

          "text": "Since you asked about us, my major is computer science. I picked because I found it fascinating and really liked all my intro classes and any abstract video I'd watch about it. Now that I'm in school, I see other majors I'd also probably love, but I'm sticking with CS because the interest is still there. There's probably so many different things you could be passionate about but you just have to really try new things, even if you don't think you'll like them at first.",

I know lots of software engineers who work their asses off and are unbelievably unhappy and I know lots that are extremely happy. Those that define their happiness by their job are doomed.\n\nDon\u2019t buy into the stereotypes that accounting is boring or that certain fields lead to different levels of life satisfaction.\n\nA big thing I\u2019ve noticed with engineers in particular is what they do on weekends. Some will go to raves, random bars, and party it up like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Others will go home, think about work, watch some tv, and then go back to work.\n\nI chose math because I actually wanted Mechanical Engineering, but my university didn\u2019t offer it. Then from math I went for computer science since there seemed to be more job prospects in that field.",

College is not for everyone and it\u2019s stupid to force yourself through it if one of these options is better for you. However, as far as finding a good major for you, consider these links in this post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lx6z8m/helpful_links/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nTo answer your actual question, I majored in Psychology and Neuroscience because I enjoyed learning about it!

          "text": "I was actually interested in psychology in my search as well . I was wondering if in order to get ur PhD you need your masters and does a PhD in psych require med school? Also how are you paying it off and are masters programs and PhD programs highly expensive or are their ways to waive them off? That\u2019s the main thing that steers me away from psychology is being afraid of not covering my debt but learning about juman behaviors is fascinating .",

              "text": "So, a lot of your questions depend on a number of things. You do not need med school for a PhD in psychology, that\u2019s graduate school. A medical degree is necessary if you want to do psychiatry, which is treating conditions via medications.\n\nIt is super important to note that there are dozens of specialities in Psychology. Clinical psychology is what most people think of, where you work with mental illness. But there are so many different areas. I\u2019m going to be studying educational psychology looking at how graphs and charts can be improved in STEM education. There\u2019s developmental psychology where you focus on the human lifespan. Cognitive psychology, social psychology, industrial/organizational psychology. Point being, there\u2019s a lot you can do that you\u2019re probably not even aware of yet.\n\nHow Master\u2019s and PhD work depends on country to a degree. In the U.S. it is common for you to be able to enter a PhD program immediately after undergrad and you earn your Master\u2019s on the way. In other countries, this combined style program is less common. So, depending on where you are it might be different if you\u2019d be applying for a Master\u2019s or directly for a PhD. Also, how competitive of a candidate you are also plays a factor as a Master\u2019s program is significantly easier to get into.\n\nAffording is another big question and it, once again, depends. Master\u2019s programs generally are expensive. However, a lot of grad programs have funding opportunities. For example, my tuition is free for 2 years and I am getting a 30k stipend because I was awarded a fellowship. Doctoral programs often have funding opportunities with the best having guaranteed funding for a set amount of years. Funding for Master\u2019s programs is a lot harder to come by and more competitive. But basically, generally if a program wants you they\u2019ll find a way to get you.\n\nAlso consider why you\u2019re getting yourself into if you pursue a PhD. Psychology undergrad does prepare you for a lot of HR and marketing jobs, a higher degree is not necessary. Feel free to send me any other questions about my experience!",
