Cs has a higher chance of paying more. If your going to a top 5 Aerospace engineering school you have a really good chance for getting a good job. Same applies for cs but closer to t20. We\u2019ll always need both jobs but there are more and more planes being made so AE engineers are needed. It also depends on what exactly you like about AE and AE is much harder.
