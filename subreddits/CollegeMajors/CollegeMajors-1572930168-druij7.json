  "text": "Hi everyone, I am a senior in high school with pretty decent grades I average A's and B's and do a few extracurriculars. I have always enjoyed business and thought that was the option for me whether it be an entrepreneurship major or marketing or anything in that field. I mainly focused on business courses in high school and did not give much attention to STEM-related classes. I did take advanced courses in science and math but this year replaced those with business courses. I was in calculus but switched out for an upper-level accounting course and for science I took computer science one and am learning visual basic and C++. However, I have begun to realize that business is not the only option out there and I am very interested in electrical engineering but am worried because I am a good math student but I feel that not having taken calculus in high school I will struggle and math is already not my best subject (Mid B's on average). I am also interested in cybersecurity management and management information systems and was told to dual major in those. I am not 100% on what either of those entails so if anyone could tell me what those are like I would love to know. Business is definitely still an option for me and I enjoy it but I feel that I worked hard in other classes before my senior year and can achieve a degree that earns more so I can invest while I am young and have a greater ROI. A business major just seems to me like something that just takes common sense and is not where I should spend my money if I go to college. So to sum it up I basically want to know if I am wrong about business majors, what cybersecurity management and management information systems include and the success of anyone who didn't take calculus in high school but took it in college.",

      "text": "Every1 I know is either majoring in Psychology or Business Administration, both pretty bad majors for getting a job right out of school. You're 100% right on business being common sense. It's kinda like someone majoring in \"entrepreneurship\" but it's unneeded and can learn it for way less than a $50k+ loan. Only go to college to get a return on the investment, and then some. I didn't take SHIT during highschool, I took below level classes and little STEM classes... little AP classes. Matter fact, I did AP Psych, AP English and AP Stats and got 1s and 2s on those. I had a 3.4 GPA overall in highschool, but 3.0 when I applied to colleges(cuz senior year didn't count I guess?) In college, I'm doing much better in STEM classes at like a 3.5 GPA. Think I might end up with an A in Calc 1 this semester given I haven't taken anything related to that in high school. It's all about effort in the ***now***, not the past. You'll do fine in STEM, just give it ur all.",
