In my opinion, your major **does matter** because it's important to get your pre requisites for Grad School so I would major in Biology for this. Try to see if there is a Physician Assistant concentration if your school offers it. *If you don't get your pre requisites, you would have to take extra courses at the Grad School before you attend, thus spending extra $$$.* Grad School is already expensive! \n\nMake sure you obtain certain scores on your GRE as well! You would also need to obtain some volunteer hours/work medical hours before you go to Grad School so look into this too. \n\nAlso, a bonus tip: If you're still in high school, **please go to a community college first! And then transfer to an in-state public university!** You will save $$$ that way, but that's just my opinion and something I am currently doing! :) Hope this helped!", "author": "Superb-Disk-8202", "created": 1632197949, "upvotes": 2}}}
