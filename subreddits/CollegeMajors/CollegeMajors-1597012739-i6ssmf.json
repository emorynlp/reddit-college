It's a 3/10 on a good day and 5/10 on a bad one, so it's not like unbearable but it is darn annoying. 24/7 everyday so I gotta breath every now and then.\n\n I actually finished my 1st year as a Public Health major at school well-known for engineering, but I'm not sure if I wanna continue because I'm not sure how I'll make a lot of money. \n\nI want a major that can lead me to ONE or BOTH things: \n\n1. I wanna make much money as possible so I CAN spend all the money I want on healthcare without worrying about breaking my bank. \n2. and/or find a major that can create/innovate new pain relief/neuroscience/health problems.\n\nPHILOSOPHICALLY, I need some CONTROL in my career/life because being in pain everyday has taught me CONTROL over one's own life is most meaningful.\n\nPHILOSOPHICALLY speaking, if I'm gonna wake up and work everyday with this damned annoying pain, I wanna do something that will directly benefit/find innovative solutions TO pain OR just making a BUNCH of money in any field so at least I can rest easy on a pile of moola and expensive healthcare products. \n\nI got a strong entrepreneurial spirit, I don't like biology class, I like money, power and control. I don't care about making other people feel good unless it benefits me in some way. I wasn't always like this, but pain teaches you that...\n\nAny input would help this struggling teenager haha.", "author": "allstarasian", "created": 1597012739, "retrieved": 1632847611, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {}}
