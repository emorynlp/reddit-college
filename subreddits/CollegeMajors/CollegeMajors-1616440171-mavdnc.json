This has been bothering me for quite some time because I have no idea what suits me best. I have logical-mathematical skills, I\u2019m good at problem solving and enjoy STEM so I do well in maths and physics and do terrible in chemistry. Even though based on those skills you would recommend I become an engineer, I don\u2019t think I would be very happy as one: as far as physics go I have to teach myself everything since my teacher has no idea what he is saying and I\u2019m getting kind of tired of having to learn by myself. A few months ago I was considering aerospace engineer but being realistic that is impossible for me, in my country there are no universities that have this major and to top that off the currency here is quite devalued: 4000$ equal 1 dollar; so I cannot afford universities that have this major (either way because of the physics problem I just explained, I\u2019m no longer interested in this career). I still have some time left and I want to take advantage of this time to learn all that I can for my future. Based on my skills with math and sciences what would you recommend as a major that I can enjoy and that can give me a stable job abroad, in a country with a stable economy.", "author": "Tabrooskies", "created": 1616440171, "retrieved": 1632846960, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
