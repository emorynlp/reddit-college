I'm currently working as a paralegal. I was stupid so I studied communication in bachelors degree. My current job is dead end job unless I become a lawyer and I don't think I like law profession at all. I really want to get out of my current job so I'm thinking about doing masters in either accounting and information systems and I can not choose.. both kind of seems like they can lead to what I want to do. Ultimately, I want to be a consultant or project manager. It's really hard for me to decide on this grad school major because I want to be careful this time. Majoring in communication was bad idea for me and this time, I really want  to make a good decision for my self. I would really appreciate your advices.. \n\nSo here are pros and cons I thought of \n\nAccounting\n\n* pros: stable, clear career path, demand is high\n* cons: tedious like law, i don't like numbers, chances of automation (for low level positions)\n\nInformation Systems\n\n* pros: future-proof, flexible degree, demand is high\n* cons: flexible so I need to know what exactly I want do focus on, male dominated field (I'm woman so I concern about sexism), not stable as accounting\n\nThese are pros and cons I can think of. Which one has better future and which one would fit me? I'm interested in obtaining CPA because this seems like valuable license but at the same time, I don't want to do taxes or audit. I want to get into advisory or it audit. If there are any suggestions, please let me know. I Would appreciate advices from someone who knows about these professions/degrees. I have no one to help me. Thank you everyone for reading this long post!!
