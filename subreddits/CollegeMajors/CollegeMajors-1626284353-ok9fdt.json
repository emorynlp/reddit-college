Do you have interests in a particular time and place or just a more generalized interest as this point in time?\n\nRemember that double-majoring is a thing. Say getting a B.A. in history *and* psychology.",

Congratulations on excelling at wrestling.\n\nHave you spoken with a naval recruiter about joining upon getting a Bachelor's degree assuming one or more recruiters haven't already been in touch with you?\n\nWhen I was graduating from high school back in 1997, I had this USMC recruiter determined to make a Marine out of me. His repetitive calls got to be so annoying that I told him I would only join up if I can receive an immediate promotion to LTC and for \"Bill to call me with the good news.\" Bill referring to Bill Clinton. Never heard from the recruiter again.",
