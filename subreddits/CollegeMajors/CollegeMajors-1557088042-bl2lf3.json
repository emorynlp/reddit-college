  "text": "I will need to be declaring a major by the end of this year. I am interested in the biology field, particularly lab work and science communications and education. There are just so many different fields to choose from, I am having difficulty trying to decide which major would be right for me. I was wondering if someone here could help. Here is a little bit about what I would likely enjoy:\n\n* Lab Work or minimal impact field work. I am physically disabled so trekking through the rain-forest is unfortunately not an option for me.\n* Teaching others about animals and the environment; perhaps at a museum, school, or zoo.\n* Working with my hands. I am an artist and have done taxidermy, so lab prep work and dissection is fine.\n* Something to do with ornithology if possible. I love learning about birds.\n* Working by self or with a small team is great, but I don't mind public speaking\n* Low employment rate and/or low pay is not important. \n* I'd like to avoid doing a lot of microbiology or pathology\n* Minimal maths and engineering as I have no aptitude in these areas\n* I am definitely not interested in the medical field\n\nI know this is not a whole lot to work off of, but I am open to answering any questions that might help to narrow things down for me. So far I am considering Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, but I don't know about many of the other fields out there. Would general biology with a focus on birds be a better idea? Any help at all would be amazing.",

      "text": "Does your school have an animal science program? That's a typically agriculture focused path that branches out into pathology, nutrition, management, food science, and genetics. Ecology is a great field to go into if you are both interested in organisms and their environment. Depending on your research interests that may require a decent amount of field work. Though it certainly has a solid lab side. \n\nEvolutionary Biology is another fieldwork heavy field from what I understand. The whole field was founded upon what was the product of a 4 year sea voyage around the world. But lab work is always possible in any field of science.\n\nAnother option might just be declaring as a general Biology major. If you plan to go on to grad school you can use your time as an undergrad to explore the different branches of Biology to find a good fit. It's what I have done as a history major. Still haven't quite decided, but I've taken classes in: environmental history, Chinese history, women's history, colonial history, and museum studies. You might be able to do the same in Biology. If not, I'd say Ecology or Environmental Science would be good bets.",

          "text": "Thank you for your reply!\nI definitely think that declaring general biology is a viable option. I am interested in ecosystems and how they balance and interact, but also as I mentioned I have a passion for birds. Unfortunately most colleges I am looking at require you to choose one title (you can't double-major in certain biology fields at the same time), which is why I am having such difficulty. It seems so...permanent... that it is a bit overwhelming. I'm glad to hear that there is some 'wiggle room'.",
