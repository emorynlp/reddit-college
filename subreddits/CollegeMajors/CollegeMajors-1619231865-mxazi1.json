However, if I want to do computer science instead and I graduate with a neuro major and compsci minor, what would I do after college to turn my minor into something I can actually use in the jobfield?? I know a compsci minor is not enough in the field.", "author": "apuddleofcuddles", "created": 1619231865, "retrieved": 1632956534, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gvrkhmw": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mxazi1/majorminor_help/gvrkhmw/", "text": "You could always go to grad school in computer science, if you make sure to do decent in your classes and get recs. Georgia tech has a cheap online masters in CS that is only like 9k, if you're interested. Also, a minor might be enough to do programming, but you would need to substitute with a lot of personal projects and internship experience. Which would probably not be a great idea because it would cut into your studying for med school (which is the important thing). so I think doing well in classes + getting prof recs would be your best bet. Or maybe not even go into grad school for CS, but maybe cognitive science or something, which could open similar doors and might be more up your alley.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1619309173, "upvotes": 2}, "gvqxtas": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mxazi1/majorminor_help/gvqxtas/", "text": "You don't have to stop with the minor, once you've finished it you can probably fit in a few extra classes to round out your knowledge/explore CS classes not in your major, and chances are Neuroscience will require the same math classes so you'll be fine!
