I love math, physics, bio, and chem and lately I\u2019ve been thinking about maybe pursuing physical therapy in college. I\u2019ve always been in sports and around PTs, and it seems interesting. What majors would be good to become a PT? Does it require math and science? Would I be better suited for engineering or physical therapy? If there\u2019s anyone that has done either or is in school for either, it would be a great help if you could describe what major you picked, what the courses are like, and if you enjoy it? I have many questions, so any response would be greatly appreciated!", "author": "jlmz-214", "created": 1602616097, "retrieved": 1632847189, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"g8qj4z0": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jak4d1/i_need_help_figuring_out_which_major_i_should/g8qj4z0/", "text": "i haven\u2019t done either, but i recommend looking into all the careers you are interested in and doing research on them. try maybe finding interesting things out and specifically what they all do on a day to day basis. i also took some quizzes to find out what major might fit me best, but that is up to you if you want to do that.", "author": "anxiety-in-space", "created": 1602626101, "upvotes": 1}}}
