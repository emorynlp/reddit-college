For pretty much my whole life, I\u2019ve been interested in biology, specifically entomology. However, recently, I\u2019ve taken an unusual interest in astrophysics. So much so, that I can\u2019t decide between the two majors. If anybody has the time to read this and answer it, please let me know which would be the best option financially, as well as the challenges both majors may bring (I\u2019m not smart so there\u2019s that).", "author": "Jimjimsalabim64", "created": 1570198654, "retrieved": 1632957970, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f2ez6j6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dd7ytt/help_deciding_between_two_majors/f2ez6j6/", "text": "Many colleges organise days where they open up their facilities to potential students, to answer questions and give a general idea what to expect. They are a good place to start if you really want to see what you're up against. Make sure to actually talk to the students there, it's their experience that will tell you the most about the course.\n\nI can't speak for astrophysics, but am in my final year of biology undergrad. If you have specific questions about that I'm glad to answer those!", "author": "ColonConoisseur", "created": 1570206913, "upvotes": 1}}}
