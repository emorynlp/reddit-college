Any Advice?", "text": " \n\nHi, so I have been debating on this for some time now. I am currently in community college as a Business major, but due to COVID-19, I decided to stay there longer. However, as of last year, I decided that when I would transfer, I will change my Business major.\n\n**The problem is this: I am stuck between Speech-Language Pathology and Computer Science.**\n\nSpeech-Language Pathology is intriguing to me because there is a lot of variety within work settings and the population. They work with kids, teens, elderly, etc. I also find speech disorders to be interesting and I love talking and interacting with others. I also love verbal languages (Currently learning Spanish)\n\nComputer Science is interesting because there are a lot of technical languages to learn and lots of different types of careers. (I am also currently learning C++ on my own) And once you master some of those languages, you can create apps, websites, and all different types of software, etc. In the CS cooperate world (Depending on the career you have), you can either work solo or with other people. But I don't know if I would want to work on a computer screen all day.\n\nI love languages, interacting with people, especially those with disabilities and being persistent and solving a great challenge. Both of these fields are challenging in their own way.\n\nI think it's also a debate on whether or not if I want to work in corporate and $$$$ vs what I like more.\n\nI thought of majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Speech Path for Grad School since Grad Schools near me will accept the pre requisites for the minor. Or just minor in Computer Science instead and major in Speech Pathology.\n\nAlthough, a lot of people that I know state that they see me working in Speech-Language Pathology more. I am also an ENFJ-A.

There's definitely going to be work involving both speech pathology and computer science (Like designing voice recognition programs that account for these disorders, \"translation\" programs, etc.) And both are in-demand fields of work. I like the idea of majoring in CS then Speech Path for grad school, but I'd want to have Speech Pathology as a dual major/minor in undergrad as well to look like a better candidate", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1624147460, "upvotes": 3}}}
