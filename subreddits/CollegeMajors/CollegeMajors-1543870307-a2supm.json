I started to study Computer Science this year, I thought I like programming and this things and had a passion for it But, Once I'm in, l didn't like it at all I didn't feel like I wanna study here, I'm thinking about to change my major to business management!! I like it and guess would be less stressful and nice for me. But the question is, Is it worth it ? I really feel confused about which field I should go for, and future of this major \"Business\" is it okay compared to CS?
