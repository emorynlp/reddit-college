I am supposed to choose my major soon, but I am stuck between 2 different majors that revolve around 2 different tracks. I have been thinking about being an English major, and I would've gone for a double minor in marketing and psychology. While I am really good at writing and can easily pass my courses, the material itself bores me. However, in the beginning of this year I've been thinking about changing my major to Nutrition to become a dietitian. The classes for a Nutrition major make me feel enthusiastic to learn just from the course material, but I like the broadness of an English major. I could always minor in either, but the thing that worries me if I go for a Nutrition minor and switch is that it'll take me longer to go to school. I love Nutrition as much as I love writing, but I dream of becoming an author. There's no guarantee I'll make it, but I'm willing to try. I am not good in math or chemistry, and am not sure how much stress I am willing to endure for a Nutrition major. But I would love learning and not feel bored. I have no idea which career path to take. I have also avoided chemistry and bio like they were the plaque. I am lost and have no idea what  career path to choose, but my ultimate dream is to make writing a career, and I don't need an English major for that. But is it worth taking the time and risking taking courses I may or may not do well in just for the sake of passion?", "author": "TheRemarkableOnes", "created": 1582488234, "retrieved": 1632847794, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
