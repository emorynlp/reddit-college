I want to stay in the STEM majors \n\nUCSD\ngot in as nano engineering (i want to switch)\n- very expensive will be in debt after college\n- very hard to change into computer science major. 55 students per semester can switch to cs which is very low and lottery system to get in but idk if I like cs for sure \n- STEM majors are capped \n- pretty campus/ nice location \n- far from home (approx. 2 hours from home)\n- more connections \n- prestigious \n\nCal Poly Pomona \ngot in as computer science \n- very cheap school won\u2019t be in debt\n- close to home \n- don\u2019t need to dorm (saves money)\n- no college life \n- easy to change majors \n- can transfer after to a different college\n\ngoing to ucsd is kinda a gamble because what if i end up liking computer science a lot and i can\u2019t get into the major cause it\u2019s Capped and lottery system. Cal poly pomona is like a safety cause I can transfer and save money but i won\u2019t have a college life because i would be staying at home\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/n3q6nl)", "author": "moochelles", "created": 1620026038, "retrieved": 1632846577, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
