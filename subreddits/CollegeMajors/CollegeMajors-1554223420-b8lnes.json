I can make friends with anyone and talking to strangers doesn't scare me at all.\n\n-I'm really good at my english classes and my psychology courses, I'm not bad at math but I don't like it. Basic algebra and formulas are okay, but I don't want a job in a field like engineering.\n\n\nI'd say I'm a really personable person. I like working face to face with people, and I'd hate to be cooped up alone all day. I also want a job that would be different from day to day. Recently, I've really been considering Marketing. My school has a Marketing program that leads into a Professional Sales track and I think this could be good for me. What do you guys think? I'm not sure where my school ranks as far as business colleges go, but it's the biggest one in my state and where I want to go. Maybe someone could look that up for me, I go to West Virginia University.", "author": "Rennobra", "created": 1554223420, "retrieved": 1632848211, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"ek0vkc3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/b8lnes/what_major_seems_right_for_me/ek0vkc3/", "text": "It seems like things like Sociology, English, Psychology, or maybe even Anthropology may be up your alley.", "author": "abbygrau", "created": 1554301117, "upvotes": 1}, "ejzcvpk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/b8lnes/what_major_seems_right_for_me/ejzcvpk/", "text": "How about communications?", "author": "davvidho", "created": 1554244011, "upvotes": 1}, "ejyrdem": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/b8lnes/what_major_seems_right_for_me/ejyrdem/", "text": "Journalism.
