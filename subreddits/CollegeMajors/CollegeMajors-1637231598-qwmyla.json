  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m currently a student at WSU majoring in Digital technology and culture with a focus on integrated media and design (If you\u2019re curious to what that is, here is the link https://dtc.wsu.edu/major-requirements/). WSU doesn\u2019t offer a graphic design major but they do have a 15 credit graphic design certificate that I\u2019m also working on. Actually I just recently switched majors from biochem to this which is an overwhelming change. \n\nThing is, I am considering two options for minors, Professional Writing and Fine Arts. My advisor advised me to minor in fine arts since I want to get into graphic design, but I feel like professional writing could be helpful as well. For reference, my track includes design classes and more lecture based classes where I\u2019d have to type essays.",
