  "text": "Hi all. I'm a first year college student enrolled at a local community college and I have been looking into computer related majors. The main two I have been looking at are MIS and CIS degrees. I was wondering what is the difference between the two and if one is a better option than the other. I considered computer electrical engineering however I was discouraged with the amount of math and physics required. Feel free to leave your thoughts and suggestions. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "CIS maybe more technical than MIS but not necessarily, it could be vice versa, information systems is the kind of major that isn't really clean cut, both terms are interchangeable so don't stress it too much, go for the most convenient for you in every aspect like coursework geography price etc..",
