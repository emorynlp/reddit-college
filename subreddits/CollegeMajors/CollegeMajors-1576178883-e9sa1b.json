With this past semester I've kind of realized I don't think I want this to be my career. I've always liked working with my hands and what i really want to do is build prototypes, design, and test them. I would prefer small scale projects. I've read a lot about how engineers basically just problem solve, sit behind their desk and really don't get that involved with the building process and I would hate that. I also haven't started Math credits yet because i only needed cal 1 and 2 for my geology degree so I'm quite behind in math so it makes me nervous to jump into engineering. So if anyone has any ideas/majors/ jobs that sounds like this please tell me. I have talked to so many advisors and professors and it's like nobody seems to care or know what I should do.", "author": "firefarting", "created": 1576178883, "retrieved": 1632957503, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fao3obv": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/e9sa1b/engineering_maybe/fao3obv/", "text": "You should take math to see if you're really okay with doing a lot of it. I think people wanting to switch into CS / engineering sleep on how much math you have to do and don't see that it's a pretty difficult switch because of that alone. When I switched from bio to CS I hadn't taken math in some time, so it took a bit to get used to it.", "author": "OGMagicConch", "created": 1576256686, "upvotes": 1}}}
