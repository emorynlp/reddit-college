I\u2019m a 18(f) that is almost done with the first year of university. When I started college, I wanted to be a Secondary Social Studies Education teacher, but then I quickly lost interest in the idea of teaching. I still like history fairly well, so I decided to change my major from Social Studies with a concentration of Teacher Education to History and Criminology, because I started getting into Law and Legal Studies. I\u2019ve always been more of a \u201cEnglish/Art\u201d type of person that Science or Math, but people who go into the medical field make a lot more money and I want to help people with their problems, I just don\u2019t know how to go about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I want to get all of this figured out before the 2nd semester of my sophomore year \ud83d\ude2c", "author": "smolbigred", "created": 1610425465, "retrieved": 1632847055, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gjp59bn": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kvk9iq/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/gjp59bn/", "text": "Social work?
