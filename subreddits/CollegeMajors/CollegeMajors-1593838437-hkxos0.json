I had thoughts of possibly working in a lab (specifically cosmetics, but I\u2019m open to other options as well).\nI\u2019m planning on going back to school (after corona) to get my bachelors, but I\u2019m not 100% sure if either of the fields would be worth it job wise. I\u2019ve seen a  lot of mixed reviews.\nAny advice?", "author": "hallienotberry_", "created": 1593838437, "retrieved": 1632957364, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fwwqfhy": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hkxos0/bs_in_chemistry_or_chemical_engineering/fwwqfhy/", "text": "Engineering", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1593875522, "upvotes": 1}, "fww7g33": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hkxos0/bs_in_chemistry_or_chemical_engineering/fww7g33/", "text": "With just a bachelors degree, chemical engineering is a lot better with regards to job prospects.
