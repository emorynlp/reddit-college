Do you thrive off the slow burn of putting in gargantuan efforts to contribute a little extra to the expansive field of science ? Or do you want to see more immediate results of your efforts...\nI\u2019d advice you to take a look at neuropsychology. That way you can be highly involved with patients, actively work towards different goals within a shorter timeframe and still get involved in laborious research work to exercise your passion towards neuroscience. \n\n(It\u2019s actually what I\u2019m planning to do haha)\n\nGood luck!!\n\nAlso you can definitely get a job after doing an undergrad in neuroscience(just remember to do lots of labs- preferably in neuropharmacology- it\u2019s the jackpot money wise)", "author": "Maleficent_Dot3465", "created": 1630409151, "upvotes": 2}}}
