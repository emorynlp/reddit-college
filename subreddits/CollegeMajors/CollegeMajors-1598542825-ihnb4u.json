  "text": "Hi!! I\u2019m interested in going to either a medical school, PA school, or PT school after graduation. I was wondering if anyone had any insight on whether majoring in Biology (with the cell biology and physiology concentration) or Health Sciences with a minor in Biology would be better? How difficult are those majors/how hard is it to have a high GPA? Also, if I don\u2019t do any more school after I graduate, what are some job prospects with either major? Thank you!",

      "text": "Undergrad doesn't really matter if your end goal is medical school.\n\nI would discourage Biology as an undergrad for this purpose as it isn't very employable if you fail to get accepted into medical school. You can get accepted into med school with any undergrad degree so I would aim to pick something that you would be satisfied with the results of should you decide to not seek post-undegrad education.",
