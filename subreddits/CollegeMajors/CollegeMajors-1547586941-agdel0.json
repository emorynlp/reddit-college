I love working with the kids in the classroom, when I have for clinical hours. I'm in love with my schedule this semester- all education classes. And I really WANT to want this, if that makes sense. I'm just scared that maybe I don't or I'll be bad at it or something. Does anyone else deal with something similar? Is this just a part of the college experience?", "author": "nalagirl22", "created": 1547586941, "retrieved": 1632848237, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ee5iybu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/agdel0/anxiety_about_my_major_in_my_senior_year/ee5iybu/", "text": "I think it\u2019s normal to have self doubt every so often, and that includes in one\u2019s choices. However, your fears seem to really be outside of the reality. You love your schedule, you love what you\u2019ve done so far, and you love the kids you work with, but you seem to be trying to convince yourself that you don\u2019t. It\u2019s really the anxiety speaking, and I know it\u2019s not fun to deal with. I think your doing just fine, and you\u2019ll be fine with your choice of major. \n\nOne point you mentioned really stuck out to me, and that regarded not enjoying a certain reading project. You\u2019re always going to have to eventually do something you don\u2019t like, even if it\u2019s embedded within something you love. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t really love what you do, it just means you\u2019re not a fan of small aspects of it. I love archaeology, but that doesn\u2019t mean I adore every aspect of the field. I\u2019d be lying if I said I love the mapping projects we are bombarded with during excavations. Does that mean I don\u2019t really love what I do? Of course not. The pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nI think you have the basic requirement for an elementary education major, and that\u2019s to have a love of children. You already know you love what you do, and you seem very excited for next semester. The best way to squash those fears is to anchor yourself down by that knowledge, and proceed into the next semester. \n\nYou\u2019ll never know if it\u2019s for you if you don\u2019t do it! You shouldn\u2019t worry about being bad at something either, because that\u2019s why you\u2019re taking classes! If you find you\u2019re not doing as great as you like, find ways to improve! Good luck next semester, you\u2019ll do great! ", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1547591351, "upvotes": 5}}}
