Or should I invest in getting lessons for the art mediums I want to  continue exploring? My reasons for wanting to go include being immersed  in art, making connections, learning new techniques, and becoming better  at playing the piano, drawing, singing, etc. I want the experience of  going to college, but I don't really have anything I'd do with make  degree. I don't know what I would enjoy doing besides working on art.  That's what makes me happy and gives me fulfillment. And none of my  family members have gone to college so I cannot ask them about any of  this. Many of my friends are in college and I've asked them for advice,  but they're also in school for stuff like physics, psychology, etc so  their degrees will allow them to get high paying jobs to help them get  out of severe debt (Which they are most certainly in). Will you please  help me decide? I'll look for comments, and post my replies once I get  off work. Thanks.

You'd be able to take classes part-time while working, and the classes should be inexpensive relative to what a typical four year college charges.

Life with them, work with them, talk with them about your art. Maybe you could ask someone famous if you could look over his/her shoulders for a while.
