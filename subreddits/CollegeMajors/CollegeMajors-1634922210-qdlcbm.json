  "text": "Yesterday I talked to the chairs of both the social science and design/media/technology departments. I should pick a major within the next couple weeks and I\u2019m not sure if I should choose history or digital communications. DCOM would probably have better job and internship opportunities, but history is something I\u2019ve thought about pursuing at the graduate level. I was also thinking of museum work, but I\u2019m not sure if that would be boring or not. My school has a good reputation for job placement so I guess I\u2019m not as worried about picking a liberal arts major. DCOM would give me interesting and creative coursework, and I would be able to do projects for assignments and campus activities. I\u2019m also taking a class in computer programming, so it would be cool to be able to keep working with that. I could consider minoring in history or something, but I\u2019ve already been wanting to minor in creative writing and I don\u2019t know if I would be able to even fit a minor in my schedule. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",
