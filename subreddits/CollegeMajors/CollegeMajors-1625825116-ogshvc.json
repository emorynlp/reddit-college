  "text": "I'm deciding my major right now and I'm stuck between Biomedical and Chemical Engineering. I wanted to work with prosthetics and the adaptions of those to the nervous system are fascinating right now, but I've also acquired a keen interest in pharma recently, and I think I could do a lot better there.\n\nI should also mention the salary is a big factor for me, and it looks like there's a 20-40 k gap between the medians, but might it be worth it?",

If you were to study any other engineering major, I would think you\u2019d have to take up lots of bio credits to supplement.",
