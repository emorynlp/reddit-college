      "text": "Just major in one and put the extra time you have to do better in one major. Minors are okay but my graduated friends and family told me they dont offer much. Common way people get minors is when theyre pursuing a major but switch mid way and they have a minor in their previous major.\n\nThe workload will be about the same just will take you longer to graduate. I think finding internships and work experience is better time than trying to find complete a second major. If anything later on u can just get a masters in a new major and maybe have your job pay for it.",

      "text": "I double majored in math and computer science. It was mostly because I had finished most of my math degree by the time I realized I wanted to pursue computer science.\n\nTbh it doesn't feel that actually having the credential of a double major has helped me in any way other than being a fun fact about me at work. When we interview people we care very little about minors or other irrelevant majors. They seem like they mean a lot when you're in college, but once you graduate they mean so little (especially if it's not used). If I had double majored in business and computer science that might have been more relevant, or better yet to pair it with something in the designing sphere would be great for website design.\n\nIt really comes down to if you want to do it. I am very happy I finished my major in math. I really enjoyed the subject and I miss doing math. It might not have helped me in my field, but it was fun in a sense.",
