  "text": "Hello! I'm currently preparing myself to apply for college **in the United States**. Of course that I already know some particularities of the education system but I come from a place where you don't really get to pick what you want to study at such a detailed level and selecting a major & minor feels so unusual. I'm just curious what others think.\n\nEdit: I am mostly oriented toward a College of Liberal Arts. I want to study humanities... like languages, culture, history, writing etc.",

      "text": "A major and minor allows you to select a specific focus in college for your degree.\n\nFor example, let's say you're majoring in mathematics.  What that means is your classes will be focused on math, and you will be taking many more math courses than some of your peers.  When you graduate, your degree will state your major is mathematics, and you will become competitive for jobs where math is applied.\n\nMinors are the same concept as majors, but it requires less courses and doesn't mean as much as a major, though they can be complementary and make you stand out.  Let's say you declared the mathematics major.  You can also declare a computer science minor, and employers can see that you have some knowledge in that area too.\n\nLiberal arts education is focused on more well-rounded classes, so there is less emphasis on your specific major and more on general knowledge.",
