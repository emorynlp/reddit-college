Here's my thoughts between the three I'm considering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  GIS - I understand this would be a great asset in Forestry but it doesn't pique my interest as much as the other two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Computer Science - This may be the most transferrable and is something I would enjoy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Wildlife Biology - My top interest of the three that I've considered majoring in. This may not be as in-demand for forestry but I think might open the door to completing a Masters in a wildlife science if I choose to go that route along the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would you choose? I'm open to any suggestions.
