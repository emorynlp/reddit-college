For the longest time pursuing English was my goal so I could be a high school English teacher. This has changed. I am not as passionate about English as I was  before and now I can't see myself being in a university  taking  English classes. Also, I can't see myself teaching a subject that  I'm no longer passionate about. That would not be fair to students. So I'm trying to figure out a different path. Here is what I have been thinking about: stick with English but instead of teaching it pursue a career in Technical Writing, pursue a different area to teach like Math or  Science and lastly  find something new to major in like Geography, Accounting & IT. What do you think?

Low stress and essentially forever young. Not to mention the time off plus Retirement benefits.\n\nOnly major downside is the pay rate for teachers. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, work is work. How do you wanna spend those 20,30,40 years of your life? \n\nI dunno bout you but English doesn\u2019t sound bad.", "author": "CrimsonDuckwood", "created": 1625683100, "upvotes": 1}}}
