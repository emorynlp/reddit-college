I do not plan so far on doing anything beyond a bachelor's degree and while I may get job experience during college, I do not know if I will, so I am going to assume that I only have a degree to put on my resume. My hope is that I can get a job that pays decently the day after graduation (rough estimate of at least $50K per year).", "author": "rose-hulman-student", "created": 1624501457, "retrieved": 1632846514, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h2uw066": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o6rlid/college_majors_compared/h2uw066/", "text": "In terms of job prospects, they're all pretty decent. I know the most about physics majors since I'm planning to be one, but I've researched a decent amount on all 3.\n\nCS is the most directly applicable. You learn hard skills that make you desirable to many companies. The biggest drawback is how common it is. CS is easily in the top 20 most popular majors, and CS majors are a dime a dozen. Luckily, entry level CS jobs are *also* a dime a dozen. Nearly every company of every size needs skilled programmers.\n\nPhysics will give you far less directly applicable hard skills. You get plenty of soft skills though. The biggest thing is that you'll become an expert problem solver. Companies hire Physics majors for non-Physics jobs (many become programmers/software engineers) left and right because they know that people who make it through a Physics major will be able to tackle near any task in front of them. Main drawback in my opinion is getting through the major itself. From what I've heard, you've gotta really love the subject to make it. It is *tough* material, especially junior and senior courses, and it'll be absolute hell if you don't enjoy it. If you do though, it can be incredibly rewarding.\n\nMath is somewhere in the middle I think. It depends on what concentration you have. Pure math has a lot of the same outlooks as physics, while Applied math and Statistics are more similar to CS outlooks. You'll be very good at working with numbers either way, which is a skill employers value. Math majors also get hired for jobs not strictly related to math, mainly CS jobs like physicists.", "author": "XcgsdV", "created": 1624515089, "upvotes": 1}, "h2uixiy": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o6rlid/college_majors_compared/h2uixiy/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1624505970, "upvotes": 1}}}
