I'm 2 years in and have 2 years to go, should I make the switch? I'm trying to get a co op this summer in the Geosciences field to see if I like it first. \n\nMy interests lie in working in the outdoors and I would ideally like to go into hydrology or hydrogeology. I also enjoy gis and remote sensing. These jobs can be done with Geosciences but engineering would be the better choice. Any advice or recommendations on whether the switch would be worth it or if I should persevere the last 2 years?
