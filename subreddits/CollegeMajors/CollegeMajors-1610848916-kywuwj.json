I attend the University of Washington. These are the majors I'm considering:\n\n**Biochemistry/Chemistry:** My academic passion. I love learning about it. However, I hear the job market is terrible. Money is important to me coming from a family that has invested a lot in my education. \n\n**Accounting:** My \"career\" passion. I love problem-solving and doing the worksheets in class, and overall my personality and values align with accounting work (more than lab work). However, biochem/chem was always my dream major and lectures won't be as interesting. \n\n**Economics + Chemistry:** Not too interested in economics, but the career options are aligned to my personality. I can pursue my love for learning Chemistry and then go into a career more fit for me. Worried about this being an atypical double major choice.", "author": "yuzuu_", "created": 1610848916, "retrieved": 1632847048, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"gjljosj": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kywuwj/weighing_my_options_science_business_econ/gjljosj/", "text": "Academic passion is short lived.

More employable than a general field of chemistry, and can lead to a stable income. With a chem degree you likely won't be doing a lot of lab work unless you pursue a career in academia with a PhD. With accounting you'll get a stable profession by becoming a cpa, working at a bank, etc.\n\nWith an Econ + chem major, and you'll likely be taking 17+ credits each semester since the two majors don't complement each other.
