We are both sophomores in college. She recently transferred to another institution because of tuition cost. She is planning to major in history with a concentration in Asian studies. Unfortunately the university she transfered to only offers very very few classes on that topic. I was wondering if there is a college or university that anyone might know of that could offer courses related to this field of study over the summer. Even perhaps online? We live in Illinois btw. It might be a long shot. We have been friends since high school and I know how passionate she is about this and I really want to help her.", "author": "Soliel2020", "created": 1598315547, "retrieved": 1632847580, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"g2rccdr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ig1lzk/helping_a_friend_interested_in_asian_studies/g2rccdr/", "text": "My University \u2013 Kennesaw State University \u2013 offers both an Asian Studies Minor and an Asian Studies bachelor's degree, so they probably offer some courses over the summer for it.
