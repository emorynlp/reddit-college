The three jobs I am looking at are a teacher, a paralegal, and HR. My college offers certification in all of these, and a degree in education, but I\u2019m not 100% sure I want to teach and can always get my certification/masters after my degree is completed. I\u2019m interested in law, good with people and I think the field would be good to work in. But not sure about HR. A friend of mine said there is a large job field but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true. I just want a decent paying job in my state (PA) Do any of you have a job in these fields and were any of them easy to obtain?", "author": "Blacksheep1205", "created": 1630106794, "retrieved": 1632958016, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hamd77i": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pcyn4q/college_certs_please_help/hamd77i/", "text": "Hello, I think teaching is well paying job.", "author": "guruessay", "created": 1630107551, "upvotes": 1}}}
