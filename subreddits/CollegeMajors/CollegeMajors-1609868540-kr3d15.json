Plus, chemistry is interesting so I\u2019ll be more inclined to study that than undergrad Econ (Graduate Econ and undergrad Econ are like night and day).

I would say if you want to get a PhD in Economics, usually the best paths for preparation are: \n\nA double major in Economics and Math\n\nMath major/Econ minor\n\nEcon Major/math minor.\n\nChemistry is probably your worst bet for undergrad because it has much less math course work compared to Math or Physics\n\nPhysics is ok, but I would say it\u2019s unnecessarily harder considering what you want to do. If you want to do something related to physical science, I would major in Applied Math and minor in Econ",
