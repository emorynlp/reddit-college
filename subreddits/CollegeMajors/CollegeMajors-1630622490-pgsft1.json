I'm a junior majoring in sociology. So one more year and I'm out of university. However, I recently had some new ideas on how I want to live my life, which means I have to get into Business.  I want to be a Marketing major. I've heard that people could get into marketing without a marketing major though, but I think that's because of good connections? Also, I'm a transfer student and already have an associate's degree (IN GENERAL STUDIES AH BIG MISTAKE), so I can't go back to community college to take business basics and transfer them to uni. Also just found out I could have had an associate's in sociology if I took macro/microeconomics in cc (that course is one of the business basics I need lol). I think marketing might be a hit or miss and instead of switching to marketing, maybe I should double major in Sociology and MIS. I did research and MIS is really good and with a double major in sociology, I think I could do marketing still. I just want opinions and advice. My college counselors are booked for the month. \n\nStick with Sociology and minor in Marketing, Switch to Marketing and minor in Sociology, or double major in Sociology and MIS?", "author": "daintydolls", "created": 1630622490, "retrieved": 1632956999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbdzymb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pgsft1/sociology_major_interested_in_business/hbdzymb/", "text": "I would post this is r/careeradvice", "author": "theenigmaticlover", "created": 1630630634, "upvotes": 2}}}
