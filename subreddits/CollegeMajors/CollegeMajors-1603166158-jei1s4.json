  "title:": "What should I major in",
  "text": "Hey everyone, Im a junior in high school and lately I have been super stressed with what I should major in. I am a very good student and want to go to a UC, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life, let alone what I want to major in. Here is a little about me:\n\n\\-I pretty much like all subjects except science.\n\n\\-I am interested in politics, writing, social justice, things like that\n\n\\-I can play instruments and in drama class\n\n\\-I am outgoing, I am terrible public speaking (I stutter and lose my train of thought while talking), yet I love talking about things I am interested in and debating.  I work okay with other people as long as they are the same level as me/ Im in a place of authority or I am comfortable around them.\n\nsome careers I have considered is lawyer, journalist, news reporter etc, but none of those really jump out at me or have me thinking \"yeah I really want to do that!\"\n\nBasically, does anyone relate to my personality and interests and if so, what do you major in and how do you like it? What career path are you going for?\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Economics. \n\nIt's a degree with a lot of variety (you can focus on quantitative areas like econometrics if you prefer more math, or avoid those subjects if you prefer theory). It has a relatively high average salary. It's directly related to several of your interests. It's simply useful to understand for day-to-day issues, and there's a wide, wide variety of jobs that it provides you access to.",

Maybe not a lawyer but maybe a degree in like public policy or political science. I\u2019m not too sure since I\u2019m a senior in High School lol.",
