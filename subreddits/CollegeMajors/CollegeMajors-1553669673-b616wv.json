I look over the major list like twice a day. I start this fall and I\u2019m gonna go in with all my core requirements already done meaning I have less time to make a decision, if any. \n\nI\u2019m not very good at lab science, I\u2019m decent at math, I shine mainly in arts, aka useless major :( . I\u2019m really expressive and don\u2019t like mundane drawn out tedious  tasks. So many majors don\u2019t appeal to me. So at this point I\u2019m just drawing from the bucket. \n\nI saw software engineering and related fields have high growth employment wise. So I thought why not try that. The only thing is, I barely know anything about computers, or tech stuff, I\u2019m not really sure what field itself entails. I don\u2019t even know what coding is. My question is would I be able to keep up if I just dive in brand new my freshman year? More so from what I\u2019ve explained do you think I\u2019ll even like it? If not any other suggestions?\n\nI\u2019ve looked into what it\u2019s about, but I\u2019d still like to hear more subjective opinions about it. \n\nThanks. \n\n\n", "author": "isaiah505", "created": 1553669673, "retrieved": 1632848196, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"ejhuo8d": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/b616wv/should_i_jump_into_computer_science/ejhuo8d/", "text": "Honestly I don't think you should major in Computer Science. It has a good outlook and salary but it can be incredibly boring and difficult if you don't like it. I'm not sure if you'd be behind since you don't have much experience but from what I've seen a lot of CS majors took a Computer Science class in high school or were able to learn a programming language online. So if you still want to major in it you should probably try to get an understanding of basic programming by using one of those Learn Code sites. You should just keep trying to find what you really like, going on some aptitude sites, looking at various majors at your college, and researching what fits you", "author": "thekidboy", "created": 1553694453, "upvotes": 2}}}
