Most MIS majors, at least that I\u2019ve seen, fall under the business department. So if you want, maybe study business administration to transfer because at university you will need some classes in your lower division that you would usually take at a CC. \n\nThere have been some schools where MIS falls under stem so it just depends what universities you are targeting to go to after CC. You should check their programs and what department they are in and maybe even see if you can speak to someone about it for more detailed questions.", "author": "twin0912", "created": 1628958616, "upvotes": 1}}}
