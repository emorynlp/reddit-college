(High school 2021)", "text": "I am applying to very competitive schools (UCs, USC, UChicago, etc). I am trying to find the best major for myself (both interesting and helpful for job search). I live in California so it is very competitive here. \n\nI have ruled out nursing, computer science (solely because of difficulty). I am not great at math or science, and I prefer social sciences, business etc. However, business, Econ, polo sci, seem to be the most impacted majors. \n\nI am trying to figure out what I should major in OR what I should apply to school with for the best chance of getting in! I know the most practical degrees would be computer science or engineering, but that is simply not my strong suit. I would be open to it as a minor but I'm not sure how that would fit in in the real world. Basically I could use advice on majors to get into Top 20 schools or majors that will result in high paying jobs without being a genius.\n\nHere are my interests/facts:\n\n1. I am good at bio but terrible at chem\n2. interest in social science, psych, sociology but am wary because of little job prospects.\n3. Did terrible in high school math but well in Calculus 1.\n4. Need job security, large job selection in urban field\n5. I am smart and willing to put in the work, but can't handle computer science (debugging is frustrating to me).\n6. Have considered premed (especially Pharma), but would prefer a less competitive environment because my high school gpa is not the best", "author": "srirachacucumber", "created": 1596881245, "retrieved": 1632847613, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"g13b4ld": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i5wr9h/what_should_i_major_in_high_school_2021/g13b4ld/", "text": "I went through the majors at USC and I found these:\n\n1.

If you are interested in the subject and think its difficult you should definitely try it out. That's just lack of effort. I failed my first cs class in college and retook it and got an A. \n\nBut anyways if you really can't do cs there's other majors I recommend for you to check out. UCI has an informatics major which is in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. That major is not nearly as demanding as CS is. You do less coding and more on the social aspect of technology. If you are interested in ui/ux design or product management or health informatics, look into this major! Link: [https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-informatics/](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-informatics/)\n\nNow UCI also offers a Business information technology major basically combining business and software together. So if you are into business check it out as well. Link: [https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-business-information-management/](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-business-information-management/)\n\nMost of the UC's offer a data science program which is kinda like cs but not as rigorous. I think it deals with more statistics and you use python & r. I'm not too sure about this major but its another alternative to cs. \n\nCognitive Science deals with a bit of programming but I'm not too sure about the major overall.\n\nMake sure you major in something YOU want to do, and if you want that technical skills you can always minor in CS.
