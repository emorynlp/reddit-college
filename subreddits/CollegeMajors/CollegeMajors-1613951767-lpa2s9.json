  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently a third year biology major in college and i have come to the realization that i don\u2019t like what i\u2019m learning. i\u2019m a little lost. i feel like i\u2019m not going to do anything with my degree; i don\u2019t have a genuine interest in the subject and it\u2019s too late to change my major. does anyone have a career in something unrelated to what your majored in? how much does major really matter in determining what career you pursue? TIA",
