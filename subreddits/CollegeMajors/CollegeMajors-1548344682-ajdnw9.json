      "text": "What does a unit constitute at your college? My college uses credit and unit interchangeably, but I know it varies from college to college. If your college is like mine, you\u2019re quite far along the pathway right now, as you only need about 30 more units to earn a bachelors. What\u2019s your GPA at, and what\u2019s the threshold before you\u2019re eligible to declare CS? Is this uniform across all majors?\n\nIf CS is really what you want to do, depending on how low the GPA is, the only way to get out is to retake some of your lowest grade classes in the upcoming semester. However, this really only applies if your college offers grade forgiveness, which is common, but not everywhere. If your GPA is slightly lower than the requirement, you may be able to fix it by doing incredibly well in your last 30 units. This will be tough, and it won\u2019t make too much of a dent since you\u2019re so far along, but it could be the difference between acceptable and non acceptable GPA. ",

              "text": "You should be able to calculate the grades required in your upcoming classes to figure out if you can raise your GPA to a 3.0 in a timely manner without retaking classes. Otherwise, you may have to retake a few classes you received a C in. A 3.0 is a B average, so if you mostly have Cs, it will be extremely difficult to raise without retaking some more classes. Without retaking, you\u2019ll have to do really well in your next half of classes to counterbalance this half. \n\nThere are always other options major wise if that\u2019s way too much to feasibly handle. However, if CS is what you really want to do, there\u2019s really not too much else other than retake some classes, or do really well in your next half. ",
