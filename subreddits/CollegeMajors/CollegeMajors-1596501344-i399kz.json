But please, feel free to guide me to where this post belongs if so. \n\nFirst of all to start things out. Iam a pharmacy student in iraq. I have about 2 more years left to graduate. However, iam really into computer hardware. I just like the looks of the PCBs and how they operate. I am totally acknowledged about how a coumputer works, all its hardware how to diagnose and fix them as well. Iam basically an enthusiast (I've actually had my own small business some time ago). I learned everything i know simply from youtube. But i would really like to study this spicific subject \"computer hardware\". \n\nHowever in iraq the system is just broken. most of the lecturers here have no idea what they are talking about. (i simply study on youtube all the time and just take my exams there). I've been to some classes that talk about computers in general. Alot of misinformation. They litiraly cant even speak english. When their own curriculum is in english. Anyone from a 3rd world country can relate for sure but they simply just giveaway PhDs for money. And its that easy, specially if you want to work inside iraq where there are simply no laws. Or at least no one applies them.\n\nWhat iam asking is if there is a way to take online classes from a decent university or an institution abroad. Because i can't leave iraq (atleast not for the next 10 years or so) for my own reasons. And i would really like to study what iam actually into. \n\nMind you i have no idea what the university systems is like in other countries. Here, they simply give you books or mostly summaries of a certain subject from a book written by the lecturers themselves. and they examine you throughout the year. No one chooses his own classes or something. You simply join a profession (certain college) and they give you classes and subjects to join. You dont count hours or something like that. Thry litirally tell you that you have this spicific subject at that spicific time. And you HAVE to attend or you will actually lose grades. More like a school i must say.\n\nI simply don't know where to start searching, what is this profession exactly called? Is it even possible to take a diploma of some sort online? How does this thing work exactly? Iam litirally clueless right now and i wish someone can help me.", "author": "Nawker119", "created": 1596501344, "retrieved": 1632847620, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g16yjj9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i399kz/what_and_where_to_study_this/g16yjj9/", "text": "Maybe try learning off of the university courses on EdX?", "author": null, "created": 1597217567, "upvotes": 1}}}
