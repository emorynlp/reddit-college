Is it better to do a degree in Fashion Design or Fashion Design and Marketing?", "text": "So, I'm pretty confused about whether to take up only Fashion Design or Fashion and Marketing. With the Fashion Design course, it's required to have my own fashion show for my final project which would help give me experience on how to organize events like that and give me exposure to designers and journalists. With the Fashion Design and Marketing course, it would help me learn the creative and business side of the industry but the final project would be to create a business plan. What do you think would be more helpful in the industry?", "author": "elizahmendoza", "created": 1593518075, "retrieved": 1632847662, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
