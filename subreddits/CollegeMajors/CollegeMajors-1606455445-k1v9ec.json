I have scholarships that pay for my tuition and books under Bright Futures which lasts five years from high school graduation for a \u201cmaximum of 120 semester hours toward the completion of the first baccalaureate degree.\u201d I have 108 credits applied out of the 132 required for my major. Also, Florida has an \u201cexcess hours\u201d surcharge and I have 76 hours remaining for that. Anyway, I\u2019m on track to graduate in Spring of 2022, however, I\u2019m not as interested in getting my degree in Elem Edu as I once was. In all honesty, even in my Freshman and Sophomore years, I wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic about it, but I was hoping I\u2019d like it more over time. Plus, I found no interest in STEM fields and I assumed English was a waste of a major so I didn\u2019t switch to that either and I didn\u2019t know what else I might be good at. If I continue, Fall 2021 I go into Field Experience 2 which means I spend 100 hours in a classroom (I did FE1 in the Spring but it got cut short due to COVID), and then Spring 2022 I\u2019m in a classroom part-time my senior year which will also be very taxing. I\u2019m also in the honors program at my university which counts as a minor (there is also an undergrad thesis I will have to complete). \n\nSo my question is, due to my disinterest in my current classes, and my upcoming practicum related requirements, should I change my major to something I would be more interested in? Or should I just minor in English and finish my major since I\u2019m close to being done? So far I\u2019ve taken 30 credits in my major plus the 4 classes I\u2019m taking now, which will make it 42 credits altogether. \n\nPart of why I\u2019m interested in changing it to English is because I think I have potential with writing (even though I know I have really bad grammar). On top of that, my honors professor told me freshman year that he thought I should change my major to English and that I was going into the wrong field because he liked the way my essay was written. (I\u2019ll share it with any of you, looking back on it, it\u2019s probably not that good but he liked how my writing style was more synthetic than analytic. I\u2019ll probably end up scheduling an academic advising appointment with him sometime soon.) \n\nAs far as jobs where an English degree would be useful, I can think of the following: PR, copywriting, social media marketing (but probably not that much), content marketing, and staff writer (although I assume I would have to move a big city?). I\u2019m also aware that publishing assistant, and consultant are options but those don\u2019t interest me. As far as I know, I don\u2019t think I need to change my major to do any of these, a portfolio is good to have though right? If I do go into any of these fields, English would help a lot. My school also has a writing minor for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nAre there any other things I can do with an English major? Are there big things I can do with that? I have high aspirations for myself. The only big things I can think of that a person could do with an English major is writing a book or write for a tv show or movie (which sounds fun to me, although I have no book ideas). I consider myself to be a creative person, and I like being around people so if you have an idea of something that involves writing and being creative let me know! \n\nP.S. Some other reasons I didn\u2019t consider English is that I want something that is practical, plus, even though everything is covered for me as far as college expenses go (minus gas and food) I still care about what my family thinks of me and my choices, but I still want to do something with my life that I enjoy.", "author": "mightygiraffe77", "created": 1606455445, "retrieved": 1632956880, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"gi5ifi8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k1v9ec/english_major/gi5ifi8/", "text": "Here's the thing: there's very little you could do with an English degree that you couldn't do with an elementary education degree. Many people with English degrees do not become professional writers, and many professional writers do not have English degrees. If you want to be a writer, start writing. Write for the school paper, submit to the campus lit mag, start a blog and professional social media channels. You could sign up for a writing class and a marketing class and see how it goes. Even if you don't end up majoring or minoring in either of those things, hopefully they'll teach you some relevant skills. \n\nIf you *hate* your elementary education classes and the thought of finishing your elementary education degree makes you very tempted to drop out of school or worse, then yeah, change your major. But if you're just like \"I don't want to be a teacher, I want to be a writer,\" that does not require changing your major to English.", "author": "ultimate_ampersand", "created": 1609824944, "upvotes": 1}, "gdsuru0": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k1v9ec/english_major/gdsuru0/", "text": "this is something that might get me downvoted to hell because people on this subreddit and r/college tend to be very pro-STEM and pro-\"practical majors\", but if your current major isn't making you happy, it isn't worth it. if you think english will be a better choice for you, talk to your academic advisor and any trusted professors and determine whether or not that's the choice you want to make.\n\nchoosing a major because of convenience, or because you don't think you can do something with a certain major, doesn't actually make a whole lot of sense, because as long as you're capable of applying the skills you've acquired to your job, you're qualified\u2014i'm an english pre-law student, but i know other people who have gone on to grad or med school programs, politics, screenwriting, ghostwriting, teaching, advertising/marketing, journalism, technical writing in large tech companies, working in non-profit orgs, et cetera. an english major will provide you with the skills you need to have a stronger grasp of language, as well as strengthen your analytical skills, and your writing and speaking abilities. those can be applied in a WHOLE host of industries and fields.\n\nalso, if you're not interested in your education degree and are planning on going into teaching: if you end up disliking teaching as well, that's probably going to show when you're a teacher, which would be incredibly unfair to your students. having a teacher who's disinterested in their job doesn't make for a pleasant experience\u2014the best teachers i had when i was younger were teachers who loved their job and made sure we knew it.", "author": "planetaryurie", "created": 1606510564, "upvotes": 3}}}
