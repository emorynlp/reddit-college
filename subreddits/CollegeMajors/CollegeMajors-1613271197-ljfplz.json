{"sid": "ljfplz", "link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ljfplz/lost/", "title:": "Lost", "text": "I'm on my eighth major and I still don't know what to do so I am coming here to see if y'all can help me. For context, I completed around 30 credits over the past 1.5 years (due to a combination of poor mental health, failing classes, dropping classes, and just not doing too hot) and am currently a creative writing major. In the past, my majors have been economics (what I applied to be), elementary education, psychology, and media arts (film, tv, and digital emphasis), among other ones that lasted a week or so. \n\nI don't like a lot of work but can handle moderate work. My mental state is a roller coaster so my motivation has been all over the place. I have a job that I love which is a studio technician at a news station where I either manage the audio for the evening shows or the prompter. When I am not at work or school, I like to browse Reddit, watch YouTube, play Animal Crossing, watch baking and interior design shows, and go on Pinterest. I also sometimes go on walks which are nice and I take lots of pictures on said walks as well. I love true crime and listen to various true crime podcasts. I also play DnD as well.\n\nI don't want a major that will take more than 4 years to complete and the classes that I hate are science and math. I am good at English and I like history but essays are always a chore even if they don't take me that long. I have been in honors English before (high school) and did well but chose not to go into AP. I find anthropology and archaeology interesting, but I don't have an earnest interest in those because it isn't realistic and can be boring at times.\n\nI love to help people and would prefer a degree that allows me to do that, but at the same time, I don't know if there are any degrees that fit me and don't require a whole lot of work so it's okay if the degree doesn't directly help others. I just decided to add this in case there is a degree that ticks all the boxes and still helps others.\n\nI know this is a long post and I tried to keep it short but I apologize if it still seems long. I hope at least one person here can help me. At this point, I'm considering dropping out because of how lost I am.
