I\u2019ve honestly done A LOTT of soul searching and have hopped around from one major to another (Orinigally Business Admin/Management, then Teaching, then Hospitality Management, then back to Teaching, and finally Psychology) and I really think that this is something that I\u2019d really love to pursue since I ultimately would like to help others. I\u2019m at a community college in NC right now and was wondering if any people who are Psychology Major students/graduates can give me some insight on what classes you took? I\u2019m honestly kinda nervous since I want to know what I should expect. I\u2019m doing my best to change my mindset on science in general (I used to always \u201chate\u201d it for no reason since I was more of a math person) and am very curious to know what different classes you took (obviously, it will vary by each college, lol). \nThanks !!", "author": "latinoworkforce", "created": 1597667075, "retrieved": 1632957834, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g1vxcku": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ibd4xp/possibly_psychology_major/g1vxcku/", "text": "Make sure you get your masters because from what I've been hearing a psych degree is useless without one.", "author": "tha_oz", "created": 1597686253, "upvotes": 2}, "g1uujn5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ibd4xp/possibly_psychology_major/g1uujn5/", "text": "this isn't an answer to your question but you might want to think about social work as a possible career path", "author": null, "created": 1597672066, "upvotes": 2}}}
