      "text": "I say this gently, my advice for you is that you need to improve your self confidence. \n\nMaybe you mess up. Maybe someone thinks you're weird. But what matters most is how you see yourself.\n\nIf you convince yourself that you can, then you can, in whichever field interests you. Therapy may help but you will want to focus on your confidence rather than trying to shift blame onto your autistic behaviors.",
