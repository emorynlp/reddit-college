  "text": "i ask this because people will treat you different if you cannot mask since not a lot of people understand how autists think and why they think a certian way. and then there are not a whole lot of jobs for us since civilization everywhere caters to neurotypicals.",

      "text": "I say this gently, my advice for you is that you need to improve your self confidence. \n\nMaybe you mess up. Maybe someone thinks you're weird. But what matters most is how you see yourself.\n\nIf you convince yourself that you can, then you can, in whichever field interests you. Therapy may help but you will want to focus on your confidence rather than trying to shift blame onto your autistic behaviors.",

To succeed in business-related fields, you need to be good with people and be able to form connections or else you will have a very hard time after graduating. \n\nTry majoring in something that will give you a technical skill like engineering or computer science.",
