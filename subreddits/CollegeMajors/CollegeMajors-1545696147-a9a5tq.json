I don't think it was just that branch. I wasn't even enrolled in true engineering courses, just introductory design ones and they were super boring. I had zero interest or motivation to continue with the work after those classes.  I switched my major on the 4th of December to Microbiology.\n\nI've always been interested in biology since I was a kid, but the degree of uncertainty in this field really scares me. I have no clue what the hell I will do with this degree. The financial struggles scare me too because I need to be able to pay off my loans in a timely manner.\n\nI really don't know what else I would do. I hate programming/technology, art, and being highly social. I know I could never teach because I don't have the patience to deal with children/teenagers, I'd lose my temper far too fast. I could never do anything in the medical field because I'd get really sick of dealing with people. I don't think I could be a pharmaceutical rep because I really don't have a charismatic personality, it's not even a matter of social anxiety; I'm just a hardcore introvert. Business always sounded real boring to me. I like to be on my feet and I could never imagine just sitting in a cubicle all day.", "author": "thrwawa999", "created": 1545696147, "retrieved": 1632848193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"egtr2v9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a9a5tq/i_dont_know_what_to_major_in_at_university/egtr2v9/", "text": " I am in my 2nd year of Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS)/ Medical Laboratory Science (MLS) program and will graduate with a Bachelor's in 2020.\n\nFor those who are:\n\n* High school students who are looking for majors in the medical field/ science field\n* Biology/ Chemistry/ Biochemistry/ Microbiology, etc., Majors (working towards a bachelors or already graduated)\n* Pre-med students\n* Interested in the \"behind the scenes\" of healthcare- no direct patient interactions\n\nCheck out this blog on the FAQs for CLS, the answer you are looking for is there.\n\n[https://www.thelabratartist.com/blog/2019/2/18/why-choose-cls](https://www.thelabratartist.com/blog/2019/2/18/why-choose-cls)\n\nThe blog will give you some **career advice** as well.\n\nIf you like the blog check out the rest of the website I created: A Study Guide to CLS\n\n[www.thelabratartist.com](https://www.thelabratartist.com/)\n\nA Study Guide for Students by Students\n\nIts a good CLS study guide and a place to network and connect.

Your post places a lot of restrictions on what you're willing to major in, e.g. education, STEM, finance, etc. However, you did indicate that you're interested in biology, but also expressed uncertainty in the returns of this degree. This makes it a little hard determine a good 'fit' of a degree for you, since it must:\n\n1. Interest you\n2. Have high returns\n3. Less dependent on interpersonal interactions\n\nA career counselor would probably have more insight, since their more knowledgeable about the various majors available at your school.", "author": "EggcellentName", "created": 1545867283, "upvotes": 3}}}
