  "text": "I'm a college freshman and I tried bioengineering this past semester and I absolutely hated it. I don't think it was just that branch. I wasn't even enrolled in true engineering courses, just introductory design ones and they were super boring. I had zero interest or motivation to continue with the work after those classes.  I switched my major on the 4th of December to Microbiology.\n\nI've always been interested in biology since I was a kid, but the degree of uncertainty in this field really scares me. I have no clue what the hell I will do with this degree. The financial struggles scare me too because I need to be able to pay off my loans in a timely manner.\n\nI really don't know what else I would do. I hate programming/technology, art, and being highly social. I know I could never teach because I don't have the patience to deal with children/teenagers, I'd lose my temper far too fast. I could never do anything in the medical field because I'd get really sick of dealing with people. I don't think I could be a pharmaceutical rep because I really don't have a charismatic personality, it's not even a matter of social anxiety; I'm just a hardcore introvert. Business always sounded real boring to me. I like to be on my feet and I could never imagine just sitting in a cubicle all day.",

      "text": "I've been waiting so see if other users had insight, but this post hasn't been getting traction in the past day. \nI think it would be valuable to visit a career counselor of some sort. Your post places a lot of restrictions on what you're willing to major in, e.g. education, STEM, finance, etc. However, you did indicate that you're interested in biology, but also expressed uncertainty in the returns of this degree. This makes it a little hard determine a good 'fit' of a degree for you, since it must:\n\n1. Interest you\n2. Have high returns\n3. Less dependent on interpersonal interactions\n\nA career counselor would probably have more insight, since their more knowledgeable about the various majors available at your school.",

                  "text": "My EGR 100 class was pretty poorly designed for somebody in BE, but it taught me that I would of failed had I progressed in MechE, EE, or CSE. I did not enjoy the hands on building we did in there and the MATLAB programming was incredibly confusing. I am not at all inclined structurally, so I did not understand why things were put together the way they were. Coming up with design ideas was virtually impossible because I had trouble understanding how the structures needed to function. Additionally, there was a huge business/entrepreneur side of engineering that sounded incredibly mundane and boring. I got a 4.0, but I feel like I was carried through that entire course by my group members.\n\nBE 101 was better in that I didn't feel confused 24/7. Designing weird tools/systems to help solve problems in biology was fun for like a month, but it got boring. I wanted to learn about the science behind these problem causing objects. The environments in which bacteria thrive in, their genetic components, the immune system, etc. This was not what was happening. As I progressed further and further through both these engineering courses, they taught us how to make flowcharts/gantt charts, properly communicate with team members, and talk to alumni about their day-to-day lives. To be quite honest, their careers sounded incredibly similar, despite working in different industries, and boring. I probably spoke to 25 different alums from my school. I probably could of stayed and played the game with the courses in BE and been okay, but from day 1 at this university I never saw myself becoming an engineer. I thought BE would be a good gateway into doing research or scientific work in the industry, but it would of required graduate school. Now I am discovering that it doesn't matter that much if you have an engineering degree, just how much you network and apply yourself.\n\nI'm not scared of math or physics like most bio majors. Discounting politics, biology, physics, and math are my favorite subjects. I could muster on through biochemistry topics in school just fine, but general chemistry makes no sense to me. I talked to a career counselor in engineering and she told me that the industry positions were bound to disappoint me. She told me that I would have to look at a masters or PhD to do what I wanted to do. My EGR professor told me to switch out (the day we met) because I was bound to remain confused if basic structural stuff confused me. She also said that your interests/goals sound more aligned with a NatSci degree.",

Remember, college is not about the grades you make, it's about the hands you shake.\n\nI would suggest that you make some sort of ordered list for things that you value in a major. It sounds like that you'll have to at least compromise for something. Order it in the qualities in a major that you absolutely must have non-negotiable versus the qualities that you would like, but could do without. Perhaps some things that could go on that list are:\n\n* Interests you\n* Pays the bills\n* Social\n* etc.",
