  "text": "My step-sister told me how there are endless things to study thats related to scientific research. Im very tempted to base my whole career and future on that cause it seems so fascinating. \n\nIM WORRIED THAT i am not smart enough for doing abroad research (which i what i want to do but idk what deparment/area). Scientific research seems so intimidating and im a Bs and sometimes Cs student ... when it comes to science. I love the subject but im lost when it comes to chemistry ... which is a big component to science.\n\nMy current hs is REALLY COMPETITIVE and its full of smart students. When i try hard i still get overshadowed by the smart students in my class (and im not even in the advanced ones). Im worried that in a college that does provide all these opportunities for research, ill be overshadowed by these people. \n\nHow much do i have to prepare myself to catch up with these smart students? I barely remember anything from the top of my head after years of school. \n\nAm i aiming too high? Ive havent done any OFFICIAL volunteering or job experience & been pretty lax but im really trying to discipline myself lately after hitting lows in my life. Ive heard that research grants involves getting a phD and that really intimidates me ... how affective is mentoring and volunteering? I had slight experience in that and i feel that i had more success in gaining experience in those MUCH MORE than academics",

      "text": "being \"smart\" is relative, having a good \"GPA\" is easily overshadowed by having a good network/summer internship. How well you do in college is irrelevant, all that matters is you make minimum standards to graduate (usually between 2.0-2.5) or if you plan on advanced studies you are at least somewhat above a 3.0. Your academic prowess means nothing after you get your first job. Just be diligent and apply for good internships in a field you want to be apart of. Undergrad research isn't really based on how well you do but on a first come first serve basis, aka just have some interest in your professor's field of study and ask before someone else does, works 9 times out of 10. \n\nDuring undergrad I did research in the Bahamas and New Zealand, I have a good GPA but even if I didn't the only reason I got to do this research was because I was working with my professor since my first semester of freshman year.",
