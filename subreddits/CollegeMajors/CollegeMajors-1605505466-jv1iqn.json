  "text": "Math/statistics/economics are my favourite subjects and I\u2019d like to know what path I could take if I studied these/a combination of these subjects in college. I\u2019m not sure about the prospects and it would really help knowing from someone who\u2019s had first hand experience/has family/friends with a similar career trajectory. Have a good day :)",

      "text": "Consider business with a major in finance, data analytics, or perhaps cyber-security.\n\nFinance would be a good fit with your interests as it relies heavily on math, econ and statistics.  Data analytics would be a bit more on the math/statistics side, but it is a business discipline so the problems tend to be economic in nature.  Many of the business schools still house their data analytics as a particular flavor of the operations management or management science major.  Cyber security is not as widely available as a business major, but tends to have a computer, database and encryption focus that might appeal to you.",

      "text": "Currently I am majoring in Economics and minoring in Mathematics. If you are interested in graduate school or getting a PhD in Economics you can go the math or economics route. But to get a PhD in Math you need a math major. Thats something to think about.\n\nEconomics is generally broader and with interesting views on the world that many other fields won't have. New perspectives are welcomed and encouraged. I also find economics to be easier than math. \n\nMath can become very abstract eg abstract math and calculus. So if you like abstract things you will prefer math more.",

              "text": "Thanks! I think that some common math-ish career paths are becoming an actuary or accountant. Some people in my classes have taken that path. You could also become a statistician or a data analyst, though I don't know much about that area. At my university it is common to double major with math. Some people double major in math and economics, others double major with math and computer science. I'm not double majoring, though that is only because I went in with the intention of getting my Master's in teaching after getting my Bachelor's in math.\n\nI recommend double majoring, because it opens the doors for more opportunities than if you were to just major in math or just major in economics.",
