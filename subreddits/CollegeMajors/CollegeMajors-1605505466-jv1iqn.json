Data analytics would be a bit more on the math/statistics side, but it is a business discipline so the problems tend to be economic in nature.  Many of the business schools still house their data analytics as a particular flavor of the operations management or management science major.  Cyber security is not as widely available as a business major, but tends to have a computer, database and encryption focus that might appeal to you.", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606608706, "upvotes": 2}, "gcjmtp2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jv1iqn/to_those_who_didare_doing_their_undergrad_in/gcjmtp2/", "text": "Currently I am majoring in Economics and minoring in Mathematics. If you are interested in graduate school or getting a PhD in Economics you can go the math or economics route. But to get a PhD in Math you need a math major. Thats something to think about.\n\nEconomics is generally broader and with interesting views on the world that many other fields won't have. New perspectives are welcomed and encouraged. I also find economics to be easier than math. \n\nMath can become very abstract eg abstract math and calculus.
