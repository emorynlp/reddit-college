She had considered social working, but she felt like it would be too stressful to always try to fix other people's problems. Aspects of social working she did like, though, were the problem-solving, the opportunities to meet new people, and the ability to help people (but she only wants to do it to an extent).\n\nAre there any majors that are better suited for her? She's already in her second semester of college, but she doesn't want to spend any more time taking on random classes without some type of major in mind. I've done my best to help her, but we haven't been able to come up with anything. Any input would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "OllieChem-Chem", "created": 1578978177, "retrieved": 1632847912, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ff3088q": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/eogndf/my_friend_doesnt_know_what_she_wants_to_major_in/ff3088q/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1579530155, "upvotes": 1}, "fed0ksn": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/eogndf/my_friend_doesnt_know_what_she_wants_to_major_in/fed0ksn/", "text": "I'd suggest Public Policy", "author": "randomhypebeast", "created": 1578992649, "upvotes": 1}}}
