I need to decide because my class registration is coming up soon and I don't want to waste any credits. My parents really want me to major in Business and would probably freak if I mentioned Communications :/\n\nI've already taken all the classes necessary to get into my university's business school except for Calculus I because I'm horrible at math - which also worries me because my business school actually requires a couple of math courses and a lot of statistics. I'm only a couple of credits away from a Business Administration minor, but if I only do the minor there aren't any marketing components.  I haven't taken as many communications courses in comparison but I'm very passionate about PR, just not sure about future job opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould people in these majors be able to share how the work load and classes have been, and what the job outlook looks like? What type of student do you think can thrive in the major? What type of extracurriculars and experience you would recommend?

I chose PR because I'm an excellent writer and it seemed to be the field I could best put that skill to use. As it happens I really don't give two shits about the field, I simply chose it because I liked writing and didn't know what else to do. Anyway, although it wasn't for me, maybe I can help you out since I've taken 2 years of course work in the subject.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWork load: It's a joke. Seriously, I don't pay attention or show up half the time and pull A's in every single class. Honestly, if you can write well and understand the bigger picture of what you're writing and why, it will be easy, maybe even too easy. For me, I need more of a challenge, which is part of why I switched out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJob outlooks: They're okay. You can find a job pretty easily in almost any industry as long as you have an internship. The pay isn't the best but it's not necessarily bad either. Expect to make around 40-50k for your first job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nType of Student: Like I said, anyone that can write will do well. It also helps to have a talent for design/presentation skills such as photoshop. You have to have a high tolerance for bullshit, though. Most of what you do and write on a daily basis will be soul sucking for a lot of people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtracurriculars: PRSSA. Pretty much guarantees an internship and shows you what the field is really like.", "author": "Str8-Boolin", "created": 1555300910, "upvotes": 1}}}
