Right now I am going to be heading into my third year of community   college in the fall and I am lost and confused in what I want to major   in. Currently im majoring in computer science but I've made a   realization that I don't like coding. I know computer science is more   than just coding but this stuff is hard and i'm not sure I can continue   doing this. I'm just so confused what I want to major in. I want to get  a  good  degree out of college and make it worth the money and I know a  cs   degree can do just that but I am not sure if i'm cut out for that  kind of work. I dont want to be miserable and go through the motions  for the   rest of my time in college. But I also know that a cs degree  is highly  valuable and it can open other doors besides software  engineering.  However there are a few things that I think  im interested  in and that  is data science ( I think this is still coding related?),  data analyst (i think  this is  more econ/business related?), I love the  thought of doing  ux/ui design, product management sounds interesting  too (yes, I am all over the place lol).  I want a decent to high paying job out of college so I mentioned those fields.  I love tech! Not necessarily coding but I get all excited when new tech  comes out whether that's new iphones, laptops, gpu's, ios updates,  whatever. I truly believe I love tech! What are your thoughts on what I  should major in? I always  here  about people going back to college for  stable income/job and  thats what i'm scared of. I dont want to go back  to school just to go  back in cs. If I don't major in cs I was thinking  about majoring in econ  and minoring in stat/math/maybe cs or major in  business information  management.

This happened to me at the end of my second year in community college. So last year. From my experience, I took a breather... a break. Not from school but from coding. I took the time to relax and then come back to thinking about my major in between semesters. I did this because I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going with computer science as well. I wasn't sure if I was passionate about it- and I wasn't, I came to the conclusion I'm doing it for the money, stability, and just since I'm good at math and I enjoyed coding then why not? \n\nBut for you, remember to scavenge the internet for whatever you're interested in. And dig deep without thinking. And I really mean to just set yourself free into the grassy green fields of the world wide web. Go to ios land, to the computer engineering world, to web dev islands, and to data analyst peak. \n\nI hope this helped at least a little bit. Stay strong. I know you'll find the answer. Good luck!", "author": "Cryptic_Rogue1", "created": 1592864469, "upvotes": 3}}}
