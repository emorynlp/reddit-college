  "title:": "Wanted to study Biology, but I'm reconsidering for something more lucrative",
  "text": "My interests lie in places that do not have a good job market. I always aimed towards getting a STEM degree, but the only one that interests me is biology (an oversaturated field) and environmental science (another not so good science area). And the only good bio-related majors (biomedical engineering and bioinformatics) the extra parts needed in them I just can't see myself pushing through. Having taken Calculus and Programming this semester, I feel like I'm in a decent position to admit this (but there's always the possibility I'm not).\n\nI wouldn't be against doing a humanities degree (or possibly a less intense science one) but I don't know any that are worth pursuing. I know some that I am interested in, but I don't want to pursue something that will leave me jobless after my four more years of schooling that's supposed to help me get a job. I'm sorry if I sound picky, but this dilemma has left me distraught.\n\nSo are there any decent bio-related degrees? What are some good humanity degrees? Any advice on what I should consider going forward?",
