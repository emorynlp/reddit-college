I always aimed towards getting a STEM degree, but the only one that interests me is biology (an oversaturated field) and environmental science (another not so good science area). And the only good bio-related majors (biomedical engineering and bioinformatics) the extra parts needed in them I just can't see myself pushing through. Having taken Calculus and Programming this semester, I feel like I'm in a decent position to admit this (but there's always the possibility I'm not).\n\nI wouldn't be against doing a humanities degree (or possibly a less intense science one) but I don't know any that are worth pursuing. I know some that I am interested in, but I don't want to pursue something that will leave me jobless after my four more years of schooling that's supposed to help me get a job. I'm sorry if I sound picky, but this dilemma has left me distraught.\n\nSo are there any decent bio-related degrees? What are some good humanity degrees? Any advice on what I should consider going forward?", "author": "EroniousAlligator", "created": 1601014510, "retrieved": 1632847464, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"g8aegtg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/izedfc/wanted_to_study_biology_but_im_reconsidering_for/g8aegtg/", "text": "Chem engineering?
