That would put me as more of an electrical engineer, but I also have some interest into the aspect of software in modern technology. Based off of this, am I more inclined to Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering (with emphasis on Hardware), EE with concentration in CpE, or EE with a concentration in wireless communications?
