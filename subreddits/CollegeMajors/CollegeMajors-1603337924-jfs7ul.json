  "text": "So I'm enrolled as a freshman for spring semester..for English..for an online community college. I can't register for classes until November 9th but continuing students get to enroll as of today. I won't be attending campus classes at all.. just online.. does that mean I might not get any of the classes I want since I don't get to choose classes till November?",
