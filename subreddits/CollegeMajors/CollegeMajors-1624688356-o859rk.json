  "text": "I am a rising senior in high school on pace to be valedictorian but have no clue what I want to do with my life. So many different things interest me but scare me at the same time and at the same time my parents are pressuring me to have a major ready. I am not interested in working in anything related to a ton of reading and writing but would not be opposed to some of it if it is not the main focus of the job. I have always been successful with math so majors like math, statistics, economics draw my attention but don\u2019t seem exciting to do for a living. But i also love helping people so i am interested in psychology, health, and medical work but psych seems low paying and medical work seems so difficult. I am also curious with computer science although that scares me having zero experience. I was just curious what the best options would be for me if I were looking for an above average paying job, something I am capable of doing, something that has a lot of job opportunities, and something that interests me with its potential jobs. I am not opposed to getting a masters and actually would prefer getting one but i dont know the right path to take. Any help is appreciated. Thanks",

      "text": "In college, you need to choose a major/career that will be high in-demand in the future as this will predict the amount of job openings and that will allow you to make you a good living and one that you will enjoy . I highly recommend using [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov).\n\nWith that being said, it sounds like Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physician's Assistant (If you don't mind dealing with blood and working in a hospital, etc) and perhaps Speech Therapy would be best for you. Regarding some of these careers, it would be better if you have your pre requisites before obtaining higher education, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nDon't shy away from Computer Science though! If you are curious about this field, try it! There are a lot of career options in this field! Software Developer, Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer, Software Engineering, etc.\n\n*Extra Tip: With colleges, I advise going to community college first if you don't have a big scholarship somewhere else. You will save a ton of $$$$ and you can try some different classes you're interested in. (I was number 3 in my class by the time I graduated high school and I still went to community college)*\n\n**You're a rising senior, it's going to be okay. Keep in mind that you may change your mind later in the future and that is okay!  Many people do!**",

          "text": "Just want to first say I\u2019m so appreciative. This is my first reddit post and I\u2019m really just shocked at how much people want to help and how in depth everyone is. I just can\u2019t believe it and I\u2019m grateful for your response\nI\u2019ll definitely take note of that site as in the coming months I\u2019ll be looking to do more research and narrow things down. Physical therapy interests me a lot I\u2019d say but the one thing that also scares me with that is gathering enough observation hours and where to get those pt observation hours all while getting my bachelors and keeping a steady gpa to apply to pt school with. I just have no clue how i would go about that and manage it all. Physician assistant has been commonly recommended to me with this post and so it\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ll be researching with interest. I have never heard of speech therapy so I actually really appreciate the new idea and will look into what that entails as far as career paths and courses. \nComputer science does sound so intriguing, i am good with math and love using technology but my drawback is the no experience whatsoever with comp sci or with coding and worrying how much of a setback that will be. \nThank you for the community college tip, if I don\u2019t have anything figured out by app time I\u2019d much rather do that than a gap year. \nThank you again for all the help and advice and kind words, I appreciate it more than you know!!",

              "text": "Definitely. Also, *KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THE LOANS.* I am going to be honest here though: Between physical and occupational therapy though, I personally recommend Occupational. They just need a Masters when compared to Physical therapy, they need a doctorate and they have over 100k in debt really and I don't think they even make like over 100k unless they got their own private practice or something in their salary. Because one thing I have heard many physical therapists complain about are the loans. (But I would double check on that by using the website and doing your own research)\n\nYou also need to think of college as a return on investment if I am being honest here.\n\nMany people haven't heard of speech therapy actually! But they actually get paid the lowest between occupational and therapy, but the pay isn't that bad from what I heard. But could be a bit better for their education from what I have read about.(I definitely wouldn't mind going into this career though in my case) There is A LOT of variety that you can do with this career! Work in hospitals, schools, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient, inpatient, even have your own private practice! There is also a lot of per-diem (working as requested) jobs and part-time jobs for this profession to earn extra money and building your skills up especially if you don't mind traveling here and there.\n\nI posted a lot about this profession so feel free to check out my profile. Here are a few posts:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/ncj23z/is\\_the\\_slp\\_pay\\_really\\_that\\_bad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/ncj23z/is_the_slp_pay_really_that_bad/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/mp1nwz/what\\_is\\_working\\_as\\_a\\_speechlanguage\\_pathologist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/mp1nwz/what_is_working_as_a_speechlanguage_pathologist/)\n\nWith Physician Assistant, I do know they need a Masters and their pay is a bit over 100k, but there isn't much of a \"growth\" in their salary. If you enjoy the medical field, but **NEVER** wanted to be a doctor, it is also not a bad plan. They commonly work in hospitals to my knowledge (I could be wrong about this) But they do operate here and there, assist doctors, check with patients, etc. It's MUCH BETTER than being a nurse in my opinion! Because if you ask me, a lot of nurses get treated like junk here in the U.S. from what I heard. (Especially with now with COVID, etc)\n\nDon't be intimated by the lack of your experience! If anything, try to find some coding videos on Youtube and try it out yourself! See if you like it and possibly give it a chance! If you like it and are good at it, the salary can be pretty high especially if you work for a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, etc) (Keep in mind though that CS is much more about coding)\n\nYou also need to try and think about where you would want to live in the future and what your lifestyle would be like. For me, I am thinking about living somewhere down the South, etc.\n\n**YOU NEED TO ALSO CHOOSE A CAREER THAT IS RECESSION PROOF.** *(Look what happened with COVID-19 for example)*\n\nAlso, with community college, work a job if you can and at least attend part-time (It will get you to graduate longer, but in my opinion, going slowly and steady and having a messy plan is better than having no plan at all) For me, I think I will be 26+ by the time I graduate if I decide to go to Grad School haha.\n\nAgain, as for me, I am stuck between Computer Science and Speech Therapy. (Currently a Business major, but decided not to go with it due to COVID-19) Lol. I am possibly thinking of majoring in Computer Science when I transfer and minor in Speech Therapy for more opportunities. (It will also determine if I like both fields in a way or it will give me the choice to decide which one to pursue more)\n\nFeel free to message me if you want to know more about my experience! I also have a lot of advice to give! Haha! Hope this was helpful!",

There\u2019s just so many possibilities it seems that i would enjoy but at the same time i want to make sure I\u2019m choosing a career that is one I\u2019ll be happy with since it\u2019s a lot on the line. Physician assistant definitely interests me too, oh my see the problem is I\u2019m just so intrigued by so many different majors and professions right now. Of course thats what these next couple months are for though is to narrow things down for myself and more deeply explore all these majors and career fields. I agree as far as what I have heard of nursing too. \nSee I would love to give computer Science a try, I just cant seem to find time to do that. I\u2019m right now just exploring all these different things as well as being on a soccer team and starting school back up in august, i think i might have to look to give it a shot this july and just get a general view of doing it myself and seeing if it\u2019s something i enjoy. I have heard the employment opportunities with CS can be very good especially at those places I just worry also others with more experience would be able to take over those better jobs. Most likely in the future I\u2019d like to remain in California which is where I am now and where I plan to attend college. Good idea with community college, i will of course keep that in mind if i decide to go that route.\nYea that\u2019s a tough decision, i see the positives with both CS and speech therapy but i like that major/minor approach to it all to get you a good look into both.\nI\u2019m definitely just going to keep these comments of course to refer back to as i do more research in the following months and tryyy my best to narrow things down. Thank you again for all of your advice, resources, and knowledge and I appreciate it a lot! These comments are going to be of great help to me for sure and already have been",

(I heard that state is VERY expensive and I believe it is the most expensive state in the U.S.)\n\nI also recommend that once you complete community college: Go to a PUBLIC IN-STATE school and if you have a good relationship with your family, stay home. Don't live on campus. \n\nYeah, it really is a tough choice. Although, to be honest, I see myself in speech therapy more than Computer Science. Both are excellent fields. For me, it's just a matter of $$$$ vs decent pay and what I would enjoy. Although, my Mom has told me: What's the point of the high pay if one doesn't like their career?",

It's the cheapest option than living on your own or on a college campus.\n\nI agree with you regarding the pay.\n\nTo be honest, I feel the word \"passion\" is overhyped, but I am *NOT* saying one should stay in a career that they hate because in the long run, it's not really worth it. You need to find a balance of both if you want to make a good living and something that you should enjoy, but hey, that's just me. **Every person is different and therefore have different priorities.**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nbwwb9/following\\_your\\_passion\\_is\\_bs\\_advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nbwwb9/following_your_passion_is_bs_advice/) (*Not trying to sound negative in this post, just as I stated earlier, every person is different.*\n\nAlso, people change careers too throughout their lives and that is totally okay!\n\nJust a side note: If I was into the medical field, personally, I wouldn't mind pursuing psychiatry, but that journey is too long and while they make good money, the loans kinda take long to pay off and it is rewarding, but it can get depressing. In my opinion, if someone was really into psychology and wants to work in it, psychiatry is not a bad option if they are really determined.\n\nWith speech therapy, I also heard that it can get a bit depressing as well, but it's not on the \"same level\" as psychologists deal with if that makes sense but patients may trust them at times and therefore, may do a bit of counseling sometimes but it's not their primary thing compared with social workers and school psychologists, etc. If one works in a school, they report situations to School Psychologists (and they usually deal with them) and Child Protective Services. Depending on the setting though, patients may physically attack them as well especially if it is an outpatient clinic (One setting that I will be avoiding in the future if I go on to become an SLP)\n\nRead more about it here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/nn396c/how\\_closely\\_related\\_is\\_slp\\_with\\_psychology/](https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/nn396c/how_closely_related_is_slp_with_psychology/)",
