So many different things interest me but scare me at the same time and at the same time my parents are pressuring me to have a major ready. I am not interested in working in anything related to a ton of reading and writing but would not be opposed to some of it if it is not the main focus of the job. I have always been successful with math so majors like math, statistics, economics draw my attention but don\u2019t seem exciting to do for a living. But i also love helping people so i am interested in psychology, health, and medical work but psych seems low paying and medical work seems so difficult. I am also curious with computer science although that scares me having zero experience. I was just curious what the best options would be for me if I were looking for an above average paying job, something I am capable of doing, something that has a lot of job opportunities, and something that interests me with its potential jobs. I am not opposed to getting a masters and actually would prefer getting one but i dont know the right path to take. Any help is appreciated.

I highly recommend using [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov).\n\nWith that being said, it sounds like Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physician's Assistant (If you don't mind dealing with blood and working in a hospital, etc) and perhaps Speech Therapy would be best for you. Regarding some of these careers, it would be better if you have your pre requisites before obtaining higher education, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nDon't shy away from Computer Science though! If you are curious about this field, try it! There are a lot of career options in this field! Software Developer, Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer, Software Engineering, etc.\n\n*Extra Tip: With colleges, I advise going to community college first if you don't have a big scholarship somewhere else. You will save a ton of $$$$ and you can try some different classes you're interested in. (I was number 3 in my class by the time I graduated high school and I still went to community college)*\n\n**You're a rising senior, it's going to be okay. Keep in mind that you may change your mind later in the future and that is okay!  Many people do!**", "author": "Superb-Disk-8202", "created": 1624728098, "upvotes": 3}, "h33bouq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o859rk/need_help_just_finding_best_options_for_a_major/h33bouq/", "text": "Have you thought about becoming a Physician\u2019s Assistant?
