  "text": "I\u2019m a senior going to college soon and I\u2019m interested in investing, computers, and math. I want to major in finance and am thinking of getting a double major but I\u2019m unsure. I\u2019m thinking of getting a masters in cs since I probably won\u2019t be able to handle cs with finance together, but I\u2019m unsure. Is a CIS degree any good?",

      "text": "Math and statistics are very often used in finance, especially the more quantitative stuff. Plus, it sets you up really good if you want to go to grad school/get your MBA in the future, since you'll have a really good foundation if you want to do the more quantitative stuff. CS is also a good choice, since there's a lot of opportunities at fin tech companies I'm sure that combine the two fields, so knowledge of both would be beneficial. CIS is different from CS though, I think CIS is much more focused on integrating technology with business, CS is more math + programming, basically.",

For upper division math, keep an eye out for Applied Linear Algebra, Linear Programming (Optimization), Probability/Stochastic Processes, and maybe Combinatorics. Some schools offer upper division Math classes like 'Mathematical Finance'.",

There's the financial math major which combines all 3 of your interests, or you can do a finance major and cs minor. Stats and quantitative modeling is a good choice if you are interested in data analytics/data science, and cis is good if you choose the right electives.",
