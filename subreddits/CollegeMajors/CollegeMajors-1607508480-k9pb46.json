  "text": "I\u2019m not really sure what I want to do as a career. I\u2019ve been thinking about some sort of weapons expert or gunsmith, and I\u2019m really interested in how to make smoke grenades, tears gas, thermite, gunpowder and other explosives, and even weapons in general (it isn\u2019t with the goal to hurt people but I\u2019m a big cod guy and I find it all extremely interesting). I have a lot of fun learning about tactical tools and weapons but I don\u2019t know what to do with that and I was wondering what I can do in that field.",
