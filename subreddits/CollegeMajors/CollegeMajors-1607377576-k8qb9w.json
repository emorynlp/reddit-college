The thing is I\u2019m not certain about what BA is best.\n\nChoice 1: I get a BA in teaching (4 years). What this actually gives me is a teacher\u2019s degree. Future wise this is good as I\u2019ll never have to worry about becoming unemployed (although the pay is fairly bad). I\u2019ve got no problem working as a teacher but it\u2019s not really the job I\u2019m after. This will also mean that only about 1/1.5 years will be spent studying pedagogy (or behavioural science), the rest will be spent studying my teaching subjects and on-the-job training (I.e not what I actually wish to study). This is a programme so I\u2019m set for all my courses.\n\nChoice 2: Getting a BA in pedagogy. This is not a programme so I\u2019ll have to individually apply to all my courses with no guarantee that I\u2019ll get in (I have fairly good grades but better safe than sorry). I\u2019ve already studied social anthropology for half a year so I could finish it up with 2.5 more years of study. Studying this also means that my focus will be more into the field of behavioural science and pedagogy itself and not directly into teaching. \n\n(There is also currently the possibility for people to \u201cpatch up\u201d their degrees to get a teaching degree without studying the entire programme but this will take at least two years and I feel like aiming for that is really a waste of time)\n\nSo what do you guys think? Should a go with the safer route 1 or more relevant route 2?\n\n(Additional info: I live in Sweden so studying at uni will not be costing me anything)", "author": "alviisen", "created": 1607377576, "retrieved": 1632847106, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
