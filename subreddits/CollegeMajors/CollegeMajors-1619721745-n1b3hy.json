      "text": "Jobs as interpreters are definitely in high demand, I'm not so sure of the pay but afaik it pays pretty well.\n\nTranslation studies is probably a major designed specifically for this sort of niche, and translating between languages is definitely a different skill from understanding a language, so if you want to go down this career path then I'd suggest taking it.\n\nHowever, it does have an issue of being a tad niche (You can get a wide variety of jobs translating but the major wouldn't apply particularly well to other careers) so I'd look into getting a second major in something like linguistics/english/a language in particular, to both facilitate your translation studies and to widen your horizons a bit",
