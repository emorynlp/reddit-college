BA versus BS is just semantics a lot of times. For example, my school offers a BA and BS in Biology. They\u2019re both under the same school and require the exact same classes, apart from a two year second language requirement in the BA. So in fact, the BA is more difficult just from that requirement, but only slightly. My major is the same way, I simply went with the BA for freedom in my minor and to improve my Spanish. Some colleges only offer a BA and others only offer a BS. Most colleges offer a mix of things, but at the end of the day as long as the classes fulfill what you need, it doesn\u2019t matter if it says Arts or Science. \n\nNow, there are some minute drawbacks. If you want to be a science or math teacher in K-12 in some states, they only allow people with a BS. Along with that, someone who doesn\u2019t know any better may think a BA somehow means you slacked off for 4 years. There may be more differences, but truly, at the end of the day it shouldn\u2019t matter. Graduate schools will know better than to scoff at a BA as long as the coursework lines up with what they require.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1586556475, "upvotes": 2}}}
