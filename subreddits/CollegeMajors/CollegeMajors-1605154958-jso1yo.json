I was choosing between human development family development because I\u2019m a curious person to see why people react or act that way and rehabilitations because I thought I want to help people be better again. But then after this pandemic started I just been trying thinking very hard what to do with my life. Such as the major I was thinking was would I be able to handle meeting people and speaking them for almost half of the day or am I not be able too be emotional or I can\u2019t handle even myself. I think I\u2019m an introvert, I don\u2019t really socialize too much, sometime I want to work from home. I think I\u2019m creative and imaginative. So I ask my aunt for advice she said maybe do computer science to be a software engineer it fit most what I am. I have no experience in coding and trying to learn a bit it is a bit difficult at first, but I\u2019m learning. Also, it\u2019s high demanding and salary and I was like why not try it. I might even take summer class maybe to keep up. That\u2019s when I realize how I have interest, but no passion and I\u2019m scared what if I hate it. I just want to do something I like such as helping using technology I guess while able have a good financial, secure, and able pay off loans one day. Do ever feel pressure for no reason? When I hear people say your still young have time, but to me instead of reassure I felt more pressure and I don\u2019t want money be wasted and disappointment not just around others, but to myself too. So I really don\u2019t know what to do or choose. I\u2019m sorry if this is long I just need to get this off I had this dilemma for a while and very stress. If you have any advice I\u2019m all ears because when winter break hits I hope I\u2019ll be organized and plan what my next step.", "author": "prbly5", "created": 1605154958, "retrieved": 1632847135, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gcp0ja8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jso1yo/dont_know_what_to_do/gcp0ja8/", "text": "Hey. I can literally feel how stressed you are. all of this panicking gets out of control. It is ok to not know what to do, just focus on the next small step. You can also reach out to your  counselors for help. this is my first Year of college and the semester it is almost over. I used to want to major in computer science. I tried it, and honestly it was not for me. maybe it was because of the way my teacher was teaching it. I still play around with coding apps like swift for fun. I highly recommend swift if you want to learn to code. also you might want to find something you love doing because you will be working for the majority of your life. don't look for something just because of the high salary, just saying. you probably feel pressured because you think your supposed to have everything figured out. But no your wants and needs will change over time. Focus on you. Do what you think needs to be done. work hard for what you want because nothing comes for free. its up to you:)", "author": null, "created": 1605679613, "upvotes": 1}, "gc1rmrc": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jso1yo/dont_know_what_to_do/gc1rmrc/", "text": "try computational neuroscience. it'll take you a while to get to that point (won't be offered as an undergrad deal, to say the least; build your own path with a major and minors-- these can also make more advanced electives for your major available), a lot of build-up, in cs and psych and neuro and bio and chem and probs stats, but might be worth checking out", "author": null, "created": 1605192514, "upvotes": 1}, "gc0ftnr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jso1yo/dont_know_what_to_do/gc0ftnr/", "text": "I\u2019m only a freshman so I won\u2019t be able to give you advice as a senior in life, but I can see that you are really stressed. It\u2019s difficult to truly find what you\u2019re interested in during this time when all you can explore is online classes on zoom. \n\nCoding is a useful skill so even if you end up not wanting to pursue computer science, it definitely won\u2019t be a waste of time. You could potentially steer your interest in human development and coding towards something like informatics/human-computer interaction; because it combines aspect of how humans act and respond to technology, and involves a lot of creativity and imagination. \n\nAlso, you may have already done this but it\u2019s always good to search up videos or reddit threads from people who actually work in the fields you\u2019re interested in.\n\nRemember, there are even people who are midway into their careers that decide to go back to school to pursue a different major. And it\u2019s definitely not a waste of money to do so, some people just end up discovering their passion later in their lives. You can always try something different later in your life if you end up not liking it.", "author": "yuzuu_", "created": 1605157654, "upvotes": 1}}}
