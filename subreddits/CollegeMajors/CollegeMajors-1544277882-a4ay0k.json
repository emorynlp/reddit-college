That shouldn\u2019t stop you though from pursuing them, though. I think you should research careers in each field, and figure out one you like. Once you\u2019ve made a decision, then go with the major that leads to it and prepare. I do know Spanish is a very useful skill to have in the career world, but it is competitive since you\u2019ll be up against people with years of experience past the BA in the language. Psychology is a little tougher, as the BA is more of a step along the way to your Masters. Since most Psychology positions usually requisite a Masters at the very least, the BA on its own may not be too prudent. As for specific careers, I don\u2019t know if I can help you there, as I\u2019m not majoring in either of those fields and I don\u2019t know enough about their typical pathways. \n\nEither way, I\u2019d try to find a career that relates to what you\u2019re interested in, and then use that to decide what major to go for.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1544320640, "upvotes": 2}}}
