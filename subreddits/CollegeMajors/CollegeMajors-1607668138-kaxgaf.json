When I look at the current research in each field, CS seems way more exciting. There are amazing things happening every day with machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, and I would love to contribute to any of those fields. Comparatively, electrical engineering advancements seem to cover areas such as sensors, signal processing, semiconductors, and power generation, which don't interest me as much.\n\nThe problem is that I feel like I am more of an engineer than a computer scientist. I've enjoyed my intro engineering course more. While there is obviously significant overlap, it seems that engineers focus more on prototype design, while computer scientists focus more on logical problem solving. I definitely tend to enjoy design more.\n\nDoes anyone who has been in a similar situation want to offer advice? Or correct any misconceptions that I may have?\n\nEdit: For those mentioning computer engineering: At my school, CE focuses on computer hardware. I am not really interested in computer hardware- I am interested in machine learning, robotics, circuits, and EM physics.\nThanks for your help though!", "author": "quasar_1618", "created": 1607668138, "retrieved": 1632847097, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"gfiapms": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kaxgaf/electrical_engineering_or_computer_science/gfiapms/", "text": "If your school has computer engineering do that.
