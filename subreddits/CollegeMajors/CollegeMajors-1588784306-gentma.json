I want to go for a musical career if it works out. But I need a second degree as a backup plan. So far I know for sure that I\u2019m going to minor in Classical Studies, but this is only offered as a minor but not a Major at my college. \n\nSo I\u2019m currently going between two possible second Majors, Biochemistry and History. Im interested in both, and can\u2019t decide. \n\nBiochemistry Pros: \n\n- A STEM Major would mean a better chance at finding good jobs if my first choice career path fails. If I have nothing in the sciences, I\u2019ll wind up with two \u201cuseless \u201c degrees  in which it\u2019s hard to find a job. \n\n- I would have the best of 3 worlds and and be able to cultivate my interests in the Arts, Sciences, and Humanities.\n\nHistory Pros:  \n\n- History would fit a lot more seamlessly with my minor and my music major. I could take History courses that count for both even after I finish the required gen ed courses. Obviously Classical Studies includes a lot of History courses, and music includes music history classes. Thus some credits would count for everything. \n\n- I would probably enjoy history more. Let me put it this way: I have a lot of *interest* in science, but I have far more *passion* for history. It\u2019s my second biggest love after music. If I were to follow my heart I\u2019d do History, it\u2019s just that my brain questions the practicality if it.\n\nSo, any advice? What would you go with in my position?", "author": null, "created": 1588784306, "retrieved": 1632847734, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fpq0cmk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gentma/would_biochem_or_history_be_a_better_choice_for/fpq0cmk/", "text": "Instead did biochemistry, try to pursue something like chem, math, or CS. These major's are hella marketable. As others said, without a PhD in biochem, you really won't get far.\n\nI would also listen to the person who talked about the dangers of pursuing music now. Need with caution, is all that I can say. \n\nHistory is kinda useless. Maybe something like archaeology or anthropology would be great.

Instead I opted for a double major in science and I now highly regret it and wish I chose to diversify in a more economical field. One thing I've come to accept is that if something is your passion don't make it your career make it your hobby you do on the weekends instead.

If you aren't passionate about it, you will be miserable. I burnt out of biochem at the end of my junior year, and I hated my senior classes. Also the other person is right, with just a BS in biochem there aren't as many job opportunities as you think (that's more for a BS in engineering) so you would eventually need to go to grad school. You could possibly work your way up after getting a lot of experience after your undergrad, but not ideal. \n\nMake yourself more valuable by getting experience in unique jobs or internships. Think about ways you could use your degrees in unique ways. For example, I wish I double majored in anthropology or journalism. We have a real need for journalists who understand science. \n\nCheck out anthropology. It's not just people digging up old stuff. Biological or medical anthropology.\n\nI read a really good book about climate change, and one of the authors was a science historian.
