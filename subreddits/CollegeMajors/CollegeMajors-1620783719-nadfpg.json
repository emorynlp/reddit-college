I'm going to Florida Southern College for the chemistry major currently. I have a passion for video editing though as currently I'm in a \"TV Production\" class that focuses on making the school news, montages, and the general direction of editing. I'm actually addicted to it, I can work on one video for hours until its perfect the way I want it to be. The feeling of making that perfect video is a something I can't describe in words either. Although I wanna follow this passion, I feel like with the job outlooks and the careers involved in video editing, theirs not many options as it would be better to go into Chemistry and work into another job I've been looking at; Forensic Scientists or a CSI. If I decided to find a career in video editing, it wouldn't be one who works under management of another studio or movie-like editing. I like to do what makes me happy and excited to make the edit like my bones tingle in a way when I achieve that perfect edit. I honestly have no idea what to do, any helpful tips before I start college?", "author": "Jordan093", "created": 1620783719, "retrieved": 1632956861, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"gyjcfb4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nadfpg/undecided_on_a_major/gyjcfb4/", "text": "Like the other comment stated, if you can stick to general studies before deciding a major, do it. You will change more than you realize as soon as you step on campus. But when you arrive, take the time to learn about what your school offers in TV/Film; weigh your options and decide if you want to learn more about your interests, or if you want the money another career could offer.", "author": "OtherwiseNoteWorthy", "created": 1621315976, "upvotes": 1}, "gxud1e4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nadfpg/undecided_on_a_major/gxud1e4/", "text": "As a college dropout during the time of covid, I\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s very hard to plan for this type of thing right at the beginning. You go into college thinking you\u2019ll do one thing but college changes people. You find new interests, you make new friends, you develop as a person. I\u2019d say don\u2019t worry too much about deciding your major right now. Just do your required courses and figure out what you really like and who you are.", "author": "mssellers", "created": 1620820554, "upvotes": 4}}}
