I have an undergrad botany degree and Master's in Forest Ecology from Northern Arizona University. I work as a botanist (my work is really that of a plant ecologist, but botanist is my job title) for the Federal Government and I am comfortably upper middle class. I think there are more botany jobs in the Federal Gov like BLM or Forest Service and in consultants than there are in academia and gov jonas pay better too. Botany is kind of a shrinking discipline in academia.\n\nLook at usajobs.gov and search \"0430\" which is the job series for botany. There are student/recent Graduate jonas that come up sometimes too. You might have to work in a place a little out of the way to get your foot in they door, but once you are in with the gov it's easier to move around.\n\nAnd money isn't everything, it's definitely something to consider, but having a job that you give a shit about is worth quite a lot.", "author": "bigtoebotany", "created": 1604702117, "upvotes": 1}, "gbbgi41": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jowzts/is_it_true_that_being_a_botanist_wont_make_me_any/gbbgi41/", "text": "If botany is what you truly see yourself loving and doing the rest of your life, then do botany and don\u2019t give a crap about all the other stuff telling you no.
