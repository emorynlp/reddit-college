I want to research brain diseases like dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, adhd, etc. I don\u2019t want to work with people as much. I would prefer in a lab. I want to go to Purdue Lafayette and major in neuroscience and minor in Spanish and statistics. Would I be able to continue working in a lab at Purdue? What would my future career possibilities be, as well as pay? What else should I do? Please give me more ideas, information, advice, anything! The more I know and prepare for, the better.", "author": "Grace_neuro", "created": 1599433826, "retrieved": 1632847561, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
