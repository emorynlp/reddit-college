College applications are due on November 30th for me, as I am applying to only UC and CSU schools. \n\nAs of now, my goal is to enter the medical field, as it is something I have been passionate about for a long time. \n\nI am most interested in becoming either an optometrist, a physicians assistant, or a pediatrician. \n\nI was wondering if any pre-med or med students (if it\u2019s in these three areas that would be extra helpful) had any advice on what majors would be best to apply to. \n\nI know that the obvious answer is biology, but I also know that it is extremely competitive and could hurt my changes of getting accepted into these colleges. \n\nWhat do you suggest I major in? What did you major in before medical school? \n\nAny feedback is appreciated!!", "author": "cactvsjuice", "created": 1603078270, "retrieved": 1632847181, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gbfu1wm": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jducs2/any_medical_students_have_advice_on_what_majors_i/gbfu1wm/", "text": "I would suggest Biochemistry over Biology.
