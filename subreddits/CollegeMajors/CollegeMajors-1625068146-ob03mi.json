I'm 31 and I have an Associates in music but would like to pursue a higher degree. No kids and do not plan on having them. I don't have a huge lifestyle, financially, so I want to think I have a bit more leeway when it comes to picking a career.\n\nI have a lot of interest and it's hard to narrow it down. I was approached about a program that basically lets you create your own major/track. However, I am still a bit lost. I need to narrow things down. \n\nMy interests include \n\nMusic(Music Tech/Composition)\n\nCinematic Arts and Film\n\nPolitical Science and Public Policy\n\nAsian Studies\n\nEntrepreneurship \n\nSo, a wide range of passions and interests.\n\nMusic and Film - I've always had a passion for music. I'm actually freelancing in the industry right now. I would like to pursue a degree in music and film (or at least minor) and work as a film composer, writer, and possibly music teacher. \n\nPublic Policy - Community outreach and advocacy are very important to me. I attended University before with a focus on Political Science and criminal justice. It was great and I would like to still be involved in some way.\n\nAsian Studies - This is purely interest/hobby-based. I love learning about Asian cultures, particularly Japanese culture. I would like to dig deeper into the work/life culture of Japan, social life and the film industry in Japan compared to those in the west.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly have no idea how I can combine these interests and if there is even a healthy career outlook. \n\nMusic/Film with a minor in Entrepreneurship?\n\nPublic Policy w/ a minor in Asian Studies?\n\nI want to focus on my creative drive(music and film) but also have a lucrative career. I want to make a difference. I would like to work in a growing field. Maybe work in advocacy or economic policy. \n\nAny advice?", "author": "ComposeTheSilence", "created": 1625068146, "retrieved": 1632846513, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4ahy37": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ob03mi/an_opportunity_to_start_again/h4ahy37/", "text": "This is a hard one for me. You have so many interests that it's really going to be up to you to ultimately decide what you like and see yourself doing most. If you are already freelancing in the music industry and you enjoy it, why not pursue a degree in music? That would allow you to grow your creative side. But also make connections during college to get more opportunities in the industry. But I do know it's a very competitive and difficult industry. If you also want to make a difference, perhaps music education? This would allow you to get secure a teaching position but also pursue your career in the industry. If you want to work in public policy, that's also a difficult field to break into. Most of the time they will require you to have a Master's and years of experience. Just something to think about. \n\nIt's very difficult to suggest you a major because you have so many interests and they are vastly different. I would suggest talking to your academic advisor or career advisor. I know they would probably be able to provide you more help.", "author": "strangercats13", "created": 1625611754, "upvotes": 1}}}
