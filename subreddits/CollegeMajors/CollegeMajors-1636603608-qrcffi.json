I am Joseph and i am in my last year of highscool, i am a good student , but i am so confused and can\u2019t take a decision about the college major that I\u2019ll apply to in 6 months. I was thinking medicine but i also really like programming and I don\u2019t know how to take this kind of decision. If you would give me advice on how can i take this decision and take the right one. And thanks in advance",

I suggest you try to volunteer at a hospital if you are interested in medicine and see how you like it. I knew I wasn't into medicine because I am not okay around blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood Luck!",
