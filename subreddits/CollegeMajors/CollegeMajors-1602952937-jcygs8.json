  "title:": "Help Me With A College Major",
  "text": "Going into school, I went for a nursing degree/health care field. I really like being able to help people. However, the more I was in it, the more I realized that it was not for me. I really want a career choice that has flexible hours because I am a super big family person (if that makes sense). But I also don\u2019t want to struggle with money, I watched my parents do it since I was young enough to remember. I tried to look into psychology but the more I looked into it, the more I was disheartened whenever I read people struggled with getting jobs with it. So I was wondering if anyone could possibly talk to me about their major(s) and explain to me what they\u2019re wanting to do career wise. Any major would be helpful at this point.",
