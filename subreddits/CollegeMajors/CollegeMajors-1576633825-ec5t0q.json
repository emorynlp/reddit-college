I originally had my heart set on chemistry, but after doing my AA in it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s everything I want.\n\nTo clarify, I am getting my AA through dual enrollment and I was just accepted into a T20 that doesn\u2019t accept dual credit, so I basically start over. I still absolutely love chemistry, but I don\u2019t think a chemistry degree is enough for me. I wanted something that could possibly relate to education and/or society but still have roots in STEM.\n\nI am hoping to attend medical school so it is also very important for me that the major not only implements my love for science, but is also easy to adjust around pre-med requirements.\n\nI know this is strangely specific, but any help is appreciated!", "author": "kamylam", "created": 1576633825, "retrieved": 1632848054, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fba6ff9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ec5t0q/i_thought_i_knew_what_i_wanted_now_im_not_so_sure/fba6ff9/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1576667000, "upvotes": 1}}}
