Like the others have said. You do programming and circuitry classes. Only in college is it hands on. Most engineers do all there work behind a computer. Usually the engineering techs do all the stuff by hand.\n\nYou could also consider mechanical engineering or aerospace. You'll do a good amount of matlab which is technically a programming language, albeit a shitty one. Also there may be some CAD and Solid works too, which while not programming languages still involve work on a computer.
