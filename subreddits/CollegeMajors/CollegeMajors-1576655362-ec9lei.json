Economics is a frequent option although some are more narrowly focused on the physical sciences. Some go as far as requiring a minor in a cognate discipline. It is also very common for it to require more programming and stats than a pure math degree. \n\nWhat's omitted? Some of the advanced pure mathematics courses need to be left out of the default program to make room for this.\n\nRe: Your comment about economics -- there are a few places that have an undergraduate degree in mathematical economics as well.", "author": "jessamina", "created": 1576667125, "upvotes": 3}}}
