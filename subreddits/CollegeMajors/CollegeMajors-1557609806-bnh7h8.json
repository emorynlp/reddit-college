But I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s a useless degree.\n\nI\u2019ve tried bio before, but I found it too difficult like CS.\n\nI\u2019ve just run out of ideas and I can elaborate if needed.", "author": "Anonneedstoimprove", "created": 1557609806, "retrieved": 1632958169, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f0gv2tt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bnh7h8/completely_lost/f0gv2tt/", "text": "Look into info systems and throw that with communications.
