Just how we continue to borrow money and how that works. I also enjoy budgeting my own finances and in my current line of work I sometimes have to break down bill statements for people or estimate what their bill is going to be which I enjoy. What major would have to do with this kind of stuff possibly?", "author": "srama7", "created": 1586154238, "retrieved": 1632847773, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmpvvwx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/fvtjwf/accounting_vs_economics_vs_finance/fmpvvwx/", "text": "Economics is definitely the most theoretical out of the three. You will find people saying economics is the most respected, others saying finance, others saying accounting. Comparing finance and accounting, finance would be more theoretical. Depending on the university, in some cases economics would have the most math, while in others it would be accounting or finance. \n\nI think first you should determine whether you want something more suited for academia, such as economics or something more business related, such as accounting and finance. If you graduate from a target school and maintain a very high GPA, a finance major will provide for the most lucrative career.\n\nAll three definitely have a lot of connections - especially finance and accounting. For example, if you pursue a finance major, you will have both micro and macroeconomics and accounting courses. Just make sure that you take a lot of math, regardless of which one of the three you choose. All three also pair quite nicely with a CS / math / statistics minor or even double major. In my opinion the best would be a math + finance double major which would set you on the path toward quantitative finance, but it is obviously your choice in the end.", "author": "marko_v24", "created": 1586288295, "upvotes": 1}}}
