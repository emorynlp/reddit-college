In the next year or so, I'm thinking of attending a local university that offers a game design major (specifically, it's called ATEC in Games Pathway). However, recently, I've seen a lot of game devs saying to generally avoid these majors if you want a good foothold in the industry and pursue a more disclipine-based major such as Computer Science, Animation, or a major more aligned to what you want to do. Thing is, I'm a bit hesitant on something like CS because I fear it may teach me many things that may not be relevant to game development or will be such a burdening major that I wouldn't have the time to build up a good portfolio on my own by working on my own projects. I also realize that I'm aspiring more to be an indie dev, but I also realize that I would need a backup in case those aspirations don't pan out, and that pursuing a game design major could screw me over in the future.\n\nFor any of you that took or knew someone who took a type of game design focused major, what is your opinion on it? How well would you say it prepares/prepared you or them for this industry? Would you recommend pursuing it? Or should one avoid it at all cost and study something like CS?", "author": "FP-NSCreator", "created": 1597364693, "retrieved": 1632956897, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"g1ey1lz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i9bqyk/opinions_on_the_game_design_major/g1ey1lz/", "text": "CS > game design", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1597384784, "upvotes": 2}, "g1efx02": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i9bqyk/opinions_on_the_game_design_major/g1efx02/", "text": "I would say it would be best to stay away from majoring in game design. My parents have always given me the advice on not getting a laser-focused major in one subject, as opposed to something more broad as it will open up more job opportunities in the future.\n\nI think that going for game design will mean it could be hard getting jobs in other fields related. And looking at the ATEC curriculum most of the work is only in games, so it's not like getting a degree where most is in CS or Tech, with a view game design courses.\n\nIf you're really set on getting a bachelor's in game design, go for a double major in CS and Game Design. Most universities allow double majoring as long as you meet all the requirements by your senior year, and if you're willing to do a bit of extra work, then that would be your best option.\n\nAlso look into a minor in Game Design, as that could also work too.", "author": "kaimamaster1315", "created": 1597372975, "upvotes": 5}}}
