Personally, I think a design type major would work best for that career path. Computer science would also be great, especially since it would be more versatile and you would be able to actually make your own sites/apps. You said you're not good at STEM, but it might be something to look into, still.\n\nUltimately though, your classes and major won't be as important as your portfolio and experience. I was actually interested in UX design for a bit, and got a couple of internships, even though I didn't end up liking it that much. I was an English major though, and the reason I got these internships was because I worked on a website used by a lot of undergraduates at my school for class registration. So my main advice would be to start designing as much as you can, and find computer science/programmer types who need a designer.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1610680411, "upvotes": 1}, "gj0k5zq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kvpwnt/not_entirely_sure_what_to_do/gj0k5zq/", "text": "I would check out majors like Information Systems (and possibly Information Technology). IS typically covers a lot of programming and database topics (and UI/UX, web development, etc) but has less intense requirements than a major like computer science. \n\nThe major difference between IS and CS at my school is that IS majors take the business math sequence (accounting, algebra, finance, stats) instead of the calculus sequence (which is much more complex). We also take a number of business electives like economics and project management.", "author": "infjetson", "created": 1610470290, "upvotes": 3}}}
