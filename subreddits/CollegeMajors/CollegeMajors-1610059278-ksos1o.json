My dad did (he works with software currently), which led me to take a pre-engineering class in middle school. I loved it, and that was that.\n\nSo from then, all I've ever thought about is what classes I needed to take to major in engineering - I'm a junior this year. Then in 10th grade I started exploring a bit more, just to see what other options were available. I read about anesthesiologists, and I was sold. The idea of working closely with surgeons, and being in high stress situations was exciting. So I adjusted my college ideas by thinking that I would major in engineering, probably biomedical or environmental (those were my top more interesting choices), and take courses to satisfy medical school requirements at the same time. A lot of people said that engineering and premed was basically suicide, but I want to try it out. I joined a couple of organizations that relate to medicine for extracurriculars, and in one of them I joined as a graphic designer.\n\nI have never thought about anything art related, mainly because I suck at drawing. But making graphics for the organizations was really fun and I looked forward to creating them a lot more than I did with anything else in my life. So now I have no idea what I should do?\n\nOn one hand, engineering has been in the back of my mind for at least 5 years, so I'm very out of the loop. I haven't taken any art classes offered by my school - I might consider it for next year - I'm not very good at drawing, but the thought of creating them on a daily basis as a job makes me want to major in it. If I do, I also need a portfolio to submit with my applications should I choose to major in graphic design, which is also something I have no idea how to do, seeing that I never thought about majoring in any art.\n\ntldr: I wanted to become an engineer, changed my mind to being an anesthesiologist, then to a graphic designer. I'm way out of the loop and I don't know what I should choose.", "author": "ap7125", "created": 1610059278, "retrieved": 1632847065, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gii2iat": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ksos1o/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_please_help/gii2iat/", "text": "If you want to go to medical school, get a business major cause then you can have a high gpa without worrying too much about the non pre-med requirements", "author": "almostdedxd", "created": 1610075435, "upvotes": 1}, "gihgyxt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ksos1o/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_please_help/gihgyxt/", "text": "My best bet would be to apply as a biomedical engineering major and you could probably switch it to something else if you\u2019d like wherever you go.
