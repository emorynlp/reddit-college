I'm great at English, math, and most sciences but average at physics. I'm an empath and I like to help people. I used to want to major in a social science but my mom told me that there are little jobs in that field. She's trying to convince me to do occupational therapy, but I don't do well in the hospital setting. What should I do?", "author": "anais147", "created": 1596417007, "retrieved": 1632847622, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"g07kv8n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i2nrn2/16f_with_no_clue_what_to_do/g07kv8n/", "text": "If you're genuinely interested in occupational therapy, there are plenty of uses for it outside of hospital settings. That being said, if you aren't interested in it absolutely do not go into it. In all honesty, the degree you get matters less than what you learn while getting it. I've had family and friends major in something just to go into a totally different field. If you want to do social sciences I say go for it, if you change your mind you can change your major, or get a job kind of unrelated to your major.", "author": "OneYoungDumbBoy", "created": 1596464803, "upvotes": 2}, "g0661ib": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i2nrn2/16f_with_no_clue_what_to_do/g0661ib/", "text": "I recommend starting off as undeclared. Choose some classes and electives in what you're interested in, and go from there. There are always jobs available, but some might pay less, or you need a good resume/experience. You have all of University to arrive at that final point of decision -- don't stress too much now. You absolutely do not need to know your future right now.\n\nYou'll likely have to take a set of General Ed or Core Curriculum courses, covering social sciences, math, etc, and most of those should give you a feel for what you'd like to major in.", "author": "jt12008", "created": 1596423888, "upvotes": 2}}}
