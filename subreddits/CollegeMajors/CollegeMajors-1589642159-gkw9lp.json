{"sid": "gkw9lp", "link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gkw9lp/should_i_drop_out_or_not/", "title:": "Should I drop out or not?", "text": "So currently I\u2019m a first year student studying both mathematics and physics in the Netherlands. I mostly decided to do both because I felt like I owed it to myself, but now I really starting to lose interest and any sense of motivation doing both. I\u2019ve always been quite lazy, but still managed to graduate cum laude from high school, so I figured I\u2019d be able to do both majors. I don\u2019t mean to sounds like someone pretentious and being all like \u2018oh look at me I\u2019m so smart\u2019, but I just know I\u2019m capable of doing more than the average student. Lately though with the whole quarantine situation, I\u2019ve lost all the motivation to study and specifically all the motivation to keep up with my maths degree. I\u2019m stuck at home with my parents, without the learning stimulation the library usually offers. I never particularly enjoyed maths anyway, but I always figured it would get better as I went on. I\u2019m seriously considering just dropping out and focussing on one major. Doing both is making me feel depressed. However, doing so would also feel like giving up and not making the best of my time at university. I\u2019m torn on what to do. Does anyone recognise being fed up with your degree? Should I just keep going and hope it\u2019ll get better or just enjoy life and drop mathematics?", "author": null, "created": 1589642159, "retrieved": 1632847724, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fr5nc1f": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gkw9lp/should_i_drop_out_or_not/fr5nc1f/", "text": "I am in a very similar situation, here is how I chose to approach it.\n\nI suggest that you take advantage of this quarantine to reflect on who you are as a person. Take some quality time to understand yourself.\n\n\u2022 Understand what skills you have.\n-Are you a logical thinker or are you more creative?\n- Are you organized? Do you understand what it takes to be successful?\n\n\u2022 Learn and understand what you can and cannot handle mentally and emotionally. \n- Would you be happy doing the same thing everyday? Do you enjoy routine? Or would you prefer variety in your life and work?\n- Would you be excited to put in the work for what you want to do? Does it give you motivation to learn about that subject?\n\n\u2022 Take time to research what you are passionate about.\n- Look into job outlooks and requirements\n- Is your major something you want to do for the rest of your life?\n\n\u2022 Look inside yourself and think about what makes you happy.\n- What makes you get out of bed in the morning?\n- Is there something that you do that you look forward to everyday? \n- What was something that you enjoyed in the past and wouldn\u2019t mind doing?\n\n*As a personal suggestion, I recommend looking into Industrial Design. I was in the major this past year and I loved it. It drew out my creative ideas and allowed me to think about very out of the box methods and solutions. It involves things like sketching, woodworking, designing, building, researching, working in Adobe and other 3D software, and building connections.\nIt made me very happy to be involved in because the concepts are simple to understand, but take a lot of practice and motivation to perfect.\nI was told by my professors that The Netherlands is one of the cultural hubs for design and engineering. I would be happy to give you more detail if you are interested.\n\nWhat is Industrial Design?-\nhttps://www.idsa.org/what-industrial-design\n\nIf you do not think you could see yourself pursuing this field, I would be happy to assist you with research into other careers and any other advice you might need.\nHere are some helpful quizzes if you still feel stuck:\n\nHelp with possible Career options and majors\nhttp://www.careerbridge.wa.gov/survey_cluster.aspx \n\nHelps identify personal Interests and understanding of personal skills \nwww.sokanu.com \n\nFree personality Inventory Test\nhttps://sapa-project.org/\n\nA detailed test that gives you job recommendations based on your personality\nhttp://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp\n\nMy personal favorite: \nThe Myers-Briggs personality test (The most scientifically accurate personality test) that gives you a detailed description of what kind of person you are, your positive and negative traits, and includes what jobs it recommends you would be good at\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test\n\nI hope this helps.

Honestly, save yourself the stress and drop the math\u2014if the physics fits your goals better and is more interesting to you, then keep it and just do well in it. Physics is already a notoriously hard program, and given that this is your first year, its only going to get harder. By completing this degree, people will know you challenged yourself. Plus, university is about a lot more than just your degree; a lot of your professional and extracurricular experiences will be geared toward your future career, so if you have those kinds of quality experiences, I guarantee they\u2019ll mean more than a second major in math. Those are what will make you feel like you made the best of your time.

Just finish your degree. If I paid attention in Middle School / High School my mathematics would be off the charts but I didn't. Now mathematics is affecting almost every part of my life now. It's everywhere and I don't even know the basics. (algebra and so on) I really don't mean to pull the race card but I'm African American. If you look at the statistics the average African American doesn't know how to write an essay properly or do basic mathematical equations( I read about it somewhere and blew my mind but started to realize it was a bit true cuz I saw it in my own school). I know a lot of people aren't going to agree  with what I just said but it's whatever  they don't know my way of life they don't know what it's like  being African-American. Obviously those statistics aren't an excuse to not practice my math I'm actually in the process of doing all that right now. I'm learning how to read, speak, and write properly. I obviously know how to read and write but I want to become an experienced  writer and speaker. Alot of small writing details people tend to lose over time. I'm going to review all that stuff. Long story short just get your degree. I believe you can finish.", "author": "iNUTinURwaifu3000", "created": 1589653096, "upvotes": 3}}}
