I hear a marketing major isn\u2019t worth getting, since the idea of marketing changes every time. I also don\u2019t want to get an advertising major because I feel like it won\u2019t teach me important things if you get what I mean. I was interested in International Relations (my current plan) but I just want to get the opinions of other people.

I might even suggest History if you are looking to work in marketing and advertising.

You're right that marketing is always changing, but that data analytics side is one major part of it that is here to stay.  Being able to aggregate and splice data as you need to is a great way to make yourself stand out from other students vying for these positions, since you then have a skill to supplement what you want to do.
