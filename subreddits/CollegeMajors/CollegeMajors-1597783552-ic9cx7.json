Geology // Geography (i think i\u2019d enjoy geology more, geography seems a bit boring but i\u2019m not totally sure).\n\n2. Any type of engineering.\n\n3. Computer science or cyber security.\n\n4. Pathology. \n\n\nthanks again for the help", "author": "iiCammie", "created": 1597783552, "retrieved": 1632847598, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"g39kkvg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ic9cx7/picking_a_major/g39kkvg/", "text": "I majored in CS, so I'll weigh in.\n\nPros: Less math required than other engineering degrees. You'll still probably have to take discrete math, a couple semesters of calculus, linear algebra, and stats though. You get to build a lot of cool shit, and it's very easy to make something. Like, a mechanical engineering student can't make a HVAC system, but a CS major can make a program, ya dig? Well paying, stable degree. Very interesting also, and there's a ton of subfields. You can study theoretical computer science, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, systems programming, networking, hardware, computational biology, etc.\n\ncons: Stressful and a good amount of work. A lot of outside bullshit is expected for this major. Not only do  you need to do your classes, you also need side projects, knowledge of outside languages and frameworks, and potentially a lot of interview prep. Rampant cheating goes on, since there's no way to stop people from collaborating on projects, for the most part.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1598725126, "upvotes": 1}, "g21sy9x": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ic9cx7/picking_a_major/g21sy9x/", "text": "So I'm a Computer Science major and I'll say this; pros, you'll work with really smart people, its tons of fun, and you'll be able to learn a very in-demand skill. The cons are; there's gonna be a lot and I mean ALOT of tears, most of your professors don't know how to talk to people, your projects won't all be fun and many you won't find interesting, and finally you're gonna have to self teach and do a lot of learning outside of class. All in all, I love this field I'm in my second year and its dope to see how a lot of programs and apps you use every day are built.", "author": "CapCaplaser", "created": 1597796744, "upvotes": 4}, "g2183ws": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ic9cx7/picking_a_major/g2183ws/", "text": "Why would you be discouraged from engineering, then have any type of engineering as a consideration? Also, rule out computer science since CS has also very hard math that could discourage you if engineering made you turned off. Pathology requires a doctoral degree in most cases.
