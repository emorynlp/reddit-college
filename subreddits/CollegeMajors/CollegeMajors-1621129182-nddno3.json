I can\u2019t seem to just stick to the one i\u2019m more passionate about. I took courses that I soon to realize that the major I was looking forward to (psychology) was NOT worth it in means of just my satisfaction and realistically, the statistics of that area of interest. I have selected the top 2 majors that I have chosen to directly stay put in. The problem is, after numerous videos, I cannot choose one to dedicate my years to studying for. Keep in mind, i\u2019m in CC.\n\nBiotechnology at my CC:\nGuarantees certification in biomanufacturing, associates in Biotechnology for transfer, and a full-time job in one of the several job lab-sites. Considering I would want to transfer, then getting into bioengineering or biomedical engineering. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s CS that i\u2019m sure many of you reading knows the pros that come with CS. \n\nI would just want some guidance or advise in picking between which one of these majors I should be highly interested in, as well as explained the cons to both (assuming you may know the cons in one major or the next). Maybe, which one is more relevant? Maybe which one has a better job acceptance rate? Etc etc.\n\nAnd yes, I know I shouldn\u2019t rely on a reddit post to determine how my future looks. I just need some advise or information about the both and what major is actually worth considering studying for.", "author": "iihaller", "created": 1621129182, "retrieved": 1632956776, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"gyacen1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nddno3/conflict_between_choosing_cs_or_biotechnology/gyacen1/", "text": "I think these two majors are great.
