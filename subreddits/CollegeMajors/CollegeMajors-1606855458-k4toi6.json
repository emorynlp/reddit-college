  "text": "Okay, I'm tired of taking those stupid online quizzes that ask your preferences and what you like to pick a major. All I ever get recommended are business-related careers like accounting. So you know what I have done? Of course, I decided to go for my business degree and I'm 99% sure I hate it. I'm so stuck on what to do. I'm graduating in the spring with a business associate's and plan to continue to get a bachelor's in either finance or HR. Not a single one of my classes has interested me even the gen eds. I've gotten to the point where I might just stick with a business degree to open up more opportunities rather than not having a degree at all. I know I could skip a year to figure it out, but I'm afraid I won't return. It's very hard to motivate yourself to do all this work for a major you don't even really like when you work at a factory job that pays $20 an hour... I'm at a loss right now. It doesn't help that there are family health concerns and COVID stressing me out on top of the major decision. Any advice or questions would be much appreciated, Thank you! :)",

      "text": "If you are already working at a factory, see if you can talk to some of the managers or other professionals a bit after the shift or over a break.  In particular, you might talk with schedulers, quality control managers (six-sigma blackbelts as well if your plant has one), purchasing manager, inventory manager, maybe even the plant manager.  All of these are jobs associated with operations management which is a business major.  If you let them know that you are just trying to get an idea of some of the potential jobs and majors you might be interested in, they are usually more than willing to talk about what they do and what their education experiences were.  If you are already comfortable working in a manufacturing environment, this might be a good fit for you.  If not, at least that is one major you could rule out.  BTW I understand that is hard as an introvert, but these people are usually nice people and really appreciate it when anybody is interested in what they do.",

          "text": "I'm extremely introverted. I have a hard time talking to people and only have online friends. I'm a very serious person since I had to grow up from an early age learning my family had many issues like drug addiction. Because of this, I have strong opinions. When I'm with my family or bf I can be quite goofy, however. I had depression for quite a long time and didn't have hobbies other than basic gaming like CoD. Recently I'm trying to bake and crochet which I'm starting to enjoy. I don't really know what I enjoy. I've always had easy As other than for history. History is interesting and all, but not the class imo. I know some people tell me I should go into business because I am a serious person and have the demeanor I guess for it? I just don't find it very interesting. HR I did like the idea of for a bit because I enjoy helping people, but I'm not outgoing AT ALL.",
