I always wanted to be a consultant but I also really like accounting, and I thought, why don\u2019t I do it both in a double major? That way if one doesn\u2019t work out, I have the other to fall back on. I\u2019ve been looking on the internet if this was a good move but the closest I can find is Accounting and Business Administration.\n\nSo I\u2019m here to ask if this is a good combo? If not what else could I do?", "author": "cenzopapi", "created": 1632765561, "retrieved": 1632958194, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
