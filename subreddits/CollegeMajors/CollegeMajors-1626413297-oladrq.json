I have an associates in studio art from community and once I got into university last fall for my bachelor's, attending Fresno state by the way, I changed from studio art to animation. While I was excited for both of my choices to get into art field at the beginning, its slowly demotivating me. Taking these art classes, especially during community, made me less creative and uninspired. I did make a few good projects but the others were sub-par because I felt I wasn't given enough time to work on them and rushed it to get it done. Recently I started looking back at the classes that were interesting at community and the only ones were psychology, sociology and also history. Out of those three, psychology seemed the most interesting. With the art degree, I was planning on getting into the video game to work on art side of games, but with psychology I was hoping there would be opportunities. I did a little bit research and it seems like there is but I need more advice if this would be worthwhile for me.", "author": "zEpicAvenger98", "created": 1626413297, "retrieved": 1632957420, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h5f74qt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oladrq/how_can_a_psychology_major_be_used_in_the_video/h5f74qt/", "text": "Honestly, though it may be interesting, a bachelor\u2019s in psych isn\u2019t worth much in most fields, including video game design.
