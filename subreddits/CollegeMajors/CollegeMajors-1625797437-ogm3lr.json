  "text": "Hey ! So I am currently about to go into my junior year of college. I came in to pursue a psychology major and am still going strong, but decided to add in an informatics minor just this past semester since I enjoyed the class so much (still don't know how I fell career wise. just felt pressure to go into a certain path). \n\nI just don't know if this was the right choice? Everyone says everything pairs well with psychology, but what career paths could I go in with only a minor in Informatics? Not like only having a bachelor degree in Psychology can get me anywhere.\n\nI just don't know what to do. Should I continue with this minor or try to find another minor to better suit my psych degree and land me a job without the need for extra schooling unless I decide I want to.\n\nAny advice helps. Thanks !!!",

Youll be okay but it sounds like you havent fully looked at the job boards post-grad. This id my perspective opinion wothout any info of your future goals. If im wrong i hope that leads you to the right answer, we are all trying to figure it out",
