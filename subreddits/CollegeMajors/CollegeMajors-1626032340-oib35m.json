I'm currently pursuing accounting (Senior prepung for grad school). The pay starting off can be low, but can accelerate quickly (assuming you start as a staff accountant or intern at a public firm). If you work at one of the b4, you may be working around 60-80 hrs assuming you hit your minimum billable hours. The more experienced hires or hire positions in a company (manager - through partnership pay well depending on thr firm, and other factors.) \n\nThere will also be a demand for accounting majors or accountants in general so you will be fine.If you do go accounting remember that you will need a CPA license if you are in the US and if you do plan to work in a public firm. (Most firms look for cpa candidates). Having your cpa license also opens up more career opportunities, as much it may suck studying for it and dealing with your state.\n\nThere is also \"industry \" which is everything else that is not a public firm. Pay varies on multiple factors. Research will be ya friend on that one. Hours will also vary based on your projects/ engagements and if it's busy season or off season \n\nThe people / accountants on r/accounting or if you join their discord from the reddit page ( I like their discord) you can ask more specific questions about accounting there or I can try to answer some here. There are a lot of cpas on both the discord and reddit. (I feel discord gers a faster reply time).\n\nHopefully this helps on your question about the accounting major.", "author": "Tiedbison305407", "created": 1626073083, "upvotes": 1}, "h4uxkkq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oib35m/most_employable_college_major/h4uxkkq/", "text": "Well enjoyment is subjective, what do you enjoy?
