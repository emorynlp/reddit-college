Sorry if I don't know any veterinary related terms.\n\nMy girlfriend has recently decided she does not want to be a DVM for a variety of reasons.\n\nShe will soon be completing her Associates degree in Veterinary Technology and will be a certified vet tech. She has worked at dog/cat clinics for the past 2 years as a \"vet tech in training.\" Which she enjoys, but the pay is as you would expect.\n\nShe planned on getting an online bachelors degree in \"BAS Veterinary Technology\"  from a local uni. We don't know about this anymore since unless you get very lucky or a masters, you end up relying on the associates/VTNE certification.\n\nShe simply wants to do something with animals that is related to helping or managing them rather than being something that deals directly with slaughter.\n\nAre there any online animal related bachelors that have a high chance of a job with okay pay? It seems most related fields can end in a masters in animal science. But if she could get good jobs with just a bachelors, we would prefer that.", "author": "igotpetdeers", "created": 1577381520, "retrieved": 1632956342, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fc36tik": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/efy80s/animal_related_bachelors_that_pays_okay/fc36tik/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1577382851, "upvotes": 2}}}
