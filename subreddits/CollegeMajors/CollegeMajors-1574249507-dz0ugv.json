But English majors aren\u2019t completely useless or a waste of money, it\u2019s just often used as placeholder for this kind of thing. Ya know. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m interested in Digital Media major, with possibly a minor in either advertising or business. (I\u2019m a junior, for context, I\u2019m starting to think). I\u2019m only really interested in this major because it provides more creative freedom, but is still associated with computers, coding, stuff like that. But the film editing and writing, animation, music, and game industry related aspects of the major are what interests me. \n\nWhat truly interests me is, oddly enough, the history of businesses and material goods, like toys. While I absolutely despise world history, human history, I love learning about old advertisements and how they\u2019ve changed, the evolution of commercial goods (or really devolution), or the history of a company, whether it\u2019s dead, alive, or budding. But that doesn\u2019t exist as a major, so my interests in technology and art will have to work together. \n\nI\u2019m the youngest of three. My older siblings are both STEM majors, one a chemical engineer, the other a environmental scientist (more or less a meteorologist). My mom was showing me internship programs for sciences, and I expressed disinterest and just stated the name of the major I\u2019m looking into, and immediately starting bashing it. \n\nFor more context, my family is financially viable to support the three of us through undergrad. Both of my older siblings were supported, and it\u2019s very lucky. My mom started bashing saying how she wouldn\u2019t financially support me going to college to \u201cdraw cartoons\u201d, even though that\u2019s not really the point of the major. I don\u2019t really care about the money aspect, I\u2019ll go into debt and work my ass off to pay it off if I could, it\u2019s just my mom has a lot of power in the decisions of the house. She wouldn\u2019t let me go through with applying for that major at all, she\u2019d shut it down. \n\nI\u2019ve dabbled with computer science before, I\u2019m in a computer science AP class, but I just don\u2019t see myself doing that. While that part of technology is interesting, just sitting down and coding, or messing with the hardware and components of everything doesn\u2019t seem interesting. I put it as, I\u2019d rather be a writer or a video editor than an IT support person, or sitting in an office basement and working on servers. \n\nWhat should I do to convince her? Or should I just abandon ship entirely and come up with a new idea?", "author": "froggiekirbyten", "created": 1574249507, "retrieved": 1632958152, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f84je39": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dz0ugv/how_to_convince_that_any_major_thats_not_stem_is/f84je39/", "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t really care about the money aspect\u201d, yet you\u2019re mad that your mom won\u2019t pay for your schooling unless you pick a stem major? It\u2019s simple. You want to major in digital media, then do it, it\u2019s not your parents\u2019 responsibility to fund your education if they don\u2019t want to. You can pay for your degree with digital media just fine, right?\nIf you\u2019re living in her house and she has these strict rules then you\u2019d have to move out if you\u2019re truly passionate about digital media. \n\nJob outlook and money is important in order to get a good investment from the debt you go thru in college, therefore majors like these could be questionable to many in those aspects. Blame the job market, not your mother\u2019s opinion. She prolly won\u2019t be convinced otherwise so I suggest making a choice here.", "author": "TiNyUzi", "created": 1574251248, "upvotes": 7}}}
