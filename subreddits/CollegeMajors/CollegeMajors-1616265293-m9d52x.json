For context, I have always been a people-person, who was interested in design and working with people. I figured a  communications degree would be good for me because I would have creative freedom (to some extent) in the marketing or public relations field. I know I would be good at it but am weary about the many people who have told me to run away from this because of the lack of job opportunities and decreased salaries. I have also thought about getting a degree in communications or marketing and then minoring in finance/business administration.\n\nAny thoughts? Is this field worth getting a degree in terms of financial stability and job availability?", "author": "kennis255", "created": 1616265293, "retrieved": 1632957584, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"grny6le": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m9d52x/is_communications_worth_it/grny6le/", "text": "IDK much about the other fields, but I will share my thoughts on marketing. I was actually interested in the field for a bit and thinking about getting a job in it. There are jobs in the field, yes generally lower paying than finance/accounting, but in big cities you can definitely find good opportunities. If you do pursue marketing though, your major isn't as important as your experience and skills. Make sure to get some good projects and internships under your belt, as well as some specialty that you can do really well.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1616297485, "upvotes": 3}, "grm5wxt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m9d52x/is_communications_worth_it/grm5wxt/", "text": "It has an average salary of $62,949. And it\u2019s a generally good degree. I do suggest having a dual degree/double major or a \u201ccreative\u201d major with this, as that may give you an edge. But that\u2019s only if you think you can do it. There are a lot of job options like a public relations specialist, author, news reporter, and film editors.", "author": "Inalei_12", "created": 1616266122, "upvotes": 4}}}
