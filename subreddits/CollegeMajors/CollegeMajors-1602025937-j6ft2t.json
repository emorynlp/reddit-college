  "text": "Briefly answering last 20 questions/posts on this site (All-in-One)\n\nFor fun... ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I choose from multiple different majors when I have a relatively wide range of interests?**\n\n* In brief, first thing to find out what your goals are\n* After you understand and learn more, you'll be able to decide easily\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j69kif/17f\\_first\\_gen\\_senior\\_torn\\_between/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j69kif/17f_first_gen_senior_torn_between/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EnvironmentalE or ChemE if want to do eco-startup?**\n\n>Ideally, in future I would like to **open a firm** which works with large corporations to prevent, dispose of, and re-purpose waste in most green way possible.  \n>  \n>I want to specifically focus on chemical waste. I'm especially drawn to chemistry  \n>  \n>and I'm not extremely interested in water quality and air quality.\n\nIn short, pretty sure ChemE. (checked some sources I was correct)\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j66ky9/environmental\\_or\\_chemical\\_engineering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j66ky9/environmental_or_chemical_engineering/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Double major or 5 minors? I just want to do this right way**\n\n>am presenddtly double majoring in International Affairs and Philosophy  \n>  \n>aim right now is to attend law school after I earn this degree in hopes of working for an NGO  human rights , primarily women or LGBTQ+ individuals from Arab nation  \n>  \n>Philosophy degree and wondering exactly what purpose it will serve for me  \n>  \n>if I am really benefiting from it in same way that I would from a different program.\n\n2 things:\n\n1. Once a person has found their passion in life, they're set for life. Once a person knows their life goals, they will know everything else. You sound like a person that knows what they want out of life, and you aren't sure about that, you can ask me and I'll let you know if you are or not\n2. 'same way' - different things give differnt benefits/gains/values, so no, not same\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j31f9b/major\\_help\\_international\\_affairs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j31f9b/major_help_international_affairs/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IS or neurosci minor if both take 6cr more?**\n\n>neuroscience ties in well with what I want to pursue with ph/bio,  \n>  \n>but I think info systems more useful and in demand skills\n\n100% neurosci, and yes you're right, it doesn't matter at all. 6cr is nothing. Also that is an inaccurate assumption that 6cr more of info sys would make any relevant or significant difference\n\n>IS analysis and design and IS database concepts and applications.\n\nYea that's gonna be useless for a bio phd route. Almost all advanced classes/topics are pretty useless for niche routes\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3kwqs/minor\\_information\\_systems\\_or\\_neuroscience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3kwqs/minor_information_systems_or_neuroscience/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need another major if going phd/jd?**\n\n>end game is to get a PHD, or my JD  \n>  \n>don\u2019t mind psychology but I really don\u2019t to major in psychology as I don\u2019t have an insane amount of passion\n\nYikes and wow, you're right, your parent is **insane**, and have no idea what they're talking about\n\nNo you don't. You need a lot of other things\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j2vveg/is\\_history\\_a\\_viable\\_major\\_with\\_a\\_philosophy\\_minor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j2vveg/is_history_a_viable_major_with_a_philosophy_minor/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Out of CS, CompE, DataSci, which would I pick? Should I double major in CS/EE?**\n\n>which of these majors have best job security,  \n>  \n>job opportunity,  \n>  \n>best credentials(value).\n\nSo best value for job security / opportunity? Job security and job opportunity are 2 different things\n\nYou said that you want just these, but you actually want other things:\n\n>because I would feel more accomplished with a \"harder\" curriculum\n\nIn brief, go double major in CS/EE\n\nBut it would depend on what school it is, how it works in that school, and on other details & considerations of what you want. Different schools do (some) things pretty differently\n\nAlso  what country? Not the same everywhere. Different nations do things differently\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j6bm67/computer\\_engineering\\_computer\\_science\\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j6bm67/computer_engineering_computer_science_data/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What should I major? Want to be in california**\n\n>Do you think I\u2019d be okay getting a business administration degree?  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve heard people say it\u2019s way too general,  \n>  \n>but I\u2019m not really sure if that matters as much since internships seem to hold all weight.\n\n3 things:\n\n1. All majors are board\n2. There are no more specific majors unless you go to trade school, coding bootcamp, or schools of the arts\n3. Business typically has marketing as a concentration, so that's what a marketing major is, so question is now answered\n4. Yes Skillset + Work Experience matters a magnitude of 1000000% more than a piece of paper\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1kmjp/marketing\\_major/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1kmjp/marketing_major/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What classes do philosophy majors take, what topics do they typically write about?**\n\nIt's an extensively wide spectrum, but actually everything else is extremely wide also. In brief, philosophy mainly tries to answer for \"truth\" in non-empirical ways primarily with the usage of logical reasoning\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j63tuo/philosophy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j63tuo/philosophy/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to decide a major if I haven't looked into what they do?**\n\n>really interested in environmental conservation  \n>  \n>could help me get knowledge on how to **design** those said eco-friendly products.\n\n1. There's a bunch of majors/options to design products\n2. Different schools have different majors/options\n3. First you have to list a few options for schools you've accepted into\n4. Then you can choose from there\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j54n8x/need\\_help\\_with\\_environmental\\_major/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j54n8x/need_help_with_environmental_major/)\n\nWhat country? Different nations do things differently\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to decide from a wide range of majors if I haven't looked into any of them, and don't know what I want?**\n\nFrom\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3loop/advice\\_potential\\_pathways\\_polsciengecon\\_majs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3loop/advice_potential_pathways_polsciengecon_majs/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3bsuf/advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3bsuf/advice/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j2xdth/public\\_health\\_and\\_economics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j2xdth/public_health_and_economics/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1rrrg/i\\_dont\\_know\\_what\\_to\\_major\\_in\\_but\\_i\\_know\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1rrrg/i_dont_know_what_to_major_in_but_i_know_my/)\n* Writing?

Do you know where I should look?**\n\nLooks like this user had read the short guide\n\n>I want to work in biomaterials\n\nBioengineering, but looks like you've found that out eventually [https://www.reddit.com/user/Regular\\_Enthusiasm57/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Regular_Enthusiasm57/)\n\nFrom [https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1httg/i\\_want\\_to\\_pursue\\_a\\_ba\\_in\\_materials\\_science\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j1httg/i_want_to_pursue_a_ba_in_materials_science_and/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What major to pick: MechE or BioE?**\n\n1.

Better than learning tho, is making  designing good helpful things*",
