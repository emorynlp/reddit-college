Went to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh at one point, didn't graduate and school is now been defunct for a long while. Basically, started over in FL (after about 9 years) and have been back in school at the CC here for a while. Have one more 'gen-Ed' physical science to take for graduation. I've heard USF is usually the place to go around here; or so I've heard.\n\nAt my previous college, I was going for Graphic Design and for the longest time I still wanted to do that or something art-related but now I'm not sure. With all the being able to learn online (some are good, others not so good). I feel stuck on how to proceed or what to do now? Should I just finish that major or pick something else?\n\nI also genuinely fields that deal w/anything space-related or robotics l but the math skills aren't there, unless I were to REALLY haul ass in the higher math classes but it is probably too late, as I have never done well in math.\n\nAdvice/Suggestions are extremely helpful. Currently, looking at USF's website just to see what they have as that's pretty much the closest one.", "author": "N00dlemonk3y", "created": 1620104797, "retrieved": 1632958547, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "comments": {"h4nvxrk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n4giee/i_am_stuck_and_need_help/h4nvxrk/", "text": "What websites can I learn Graphic Design?
