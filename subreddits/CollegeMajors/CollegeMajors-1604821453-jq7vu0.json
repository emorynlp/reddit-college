I could envision myself writing a book one day. & even creating an online platform where I can reach people with my writing. I\u2019m also really intrigued with art & music. I have so much passions and I don\u2019t know what to do, ughh! I\u2019ve considered psychology but I know a bachelors won\u2019t get me far, I\u2019ve considered English but I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s the right fit for me, & recently considered business administration. What major do YOU think would be best suited for me? \n\nThanks!", "author": "nicole03427", "created": 1604821453, "retrieved": 1632955668, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gcgjin3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jq7vu0/choosing_a_college_major/gcgjin3/", "text": "Some other options could be social work, or doing something like art therapy (which I think often requires a masters depending on where you live).", "author": "Celestial-Thestral", "created": 1605496802, "upvotes": 1}, "gblax18": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jq7vu0/choosing_a_college_major/gblax18/", "text": "While it's hard to suggest a major for you when I don't know you, possibly public relations? Public relations encompasses psychology, art, business, and writing. You produce copy (writing), correspond with journalists, you design graphics, analyze consumer psychology, and are in charge of event planning for a business. The main goal of a public relations professional is to build a solid reputation for a business/organization/nonprofit. In an agency you meet with clients (fulfilling your need to socialize with people). If you like helping others, nonprofits sometimes look to hire a public relations specialist. \nIt is a pretty broad field, but encompasses a lot of what you are looking for.", "author": "__WhatIsLife__", "created": 1604830202, "upvotes": 4}}}
