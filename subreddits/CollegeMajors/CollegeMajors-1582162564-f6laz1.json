I love cinematography and the art of film, I feel like it is my passion and calling although I'm not amazing at it. Ever since I was a little kid I made small films and music videos but I also really wanted to be a doctor. Now that I am more mature, I have realized how much work and studying that is required to be a doctor and I'm not sure if I am ready to go in that difficult path. I am also not the smartest, and am concerned that I may not even be able to get into med school. I believe in pursuing what I am passionate about but I have heard that film is not a guaranteed major to get a career in. I live in Oregon if that matters, and I need advice for my situation.", "author": "TosIinii", "created": 1582162564, "retrieved": 1632956317, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fi8opyc": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/f6laz1/should_i_major_in_film_or_science/fi8opyc/", "text": "Honestly unless you\u2019re going to enjoy going into science, major in film.
