I\u2019ve taken general education courses and am technically labeled an English major but my degree is undeclared and I have no idea what I want to do...I\u2019ve always been really good at English and better with essays and analysis but I definitely got by in math and science as well. I wanted to be a teacher for a while Bc it just seems easier but I want to be more financially stable. I know STEM especially tech and computer science are the careers on the rise but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for anything like that.. I like helping people, I love music, tv and movies, and art but I don\u2019t think I can live off of creating any of those of course. I\u2019m very organized and sometimes called controlling, I don\u2019t mind working with others, I just have no real passions or a \u201cdream job\u201d. I was considering a business degree to do Human Resources or some form of public relations, maybe a finance degree even, but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right choice. If anyone has good advice for figuring it out or a versatile/tolerable college major they recommend please help me!!", "author": "Background-Ad-6485", "created": 1616205682, "retrieved": 1632846967, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"grlvqbp": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m8x0l6/dont_know_where_my_life_is_going/grlvqbp/", "text": "I am almost 26, I've been in university since I was 19. Changed majors and programs many times. Do not advise going that route, restarting sucks. If you need to take time out of school to decide then absolutely do that, it is way too expensive to just jump around all the time. Yes, I am an idiot.\n\nWhat I would advise is taking electives. Take something just out of personal interest whenever you can. Look up your school's program/course list and see what sounds interesting. If you have a co-op option then you should try that as well, getting a job within the field you're thinking of really provides perspective. For example, after 20 courses on trees I was pretty sure I hate trees. After one three month forestry position I was absolutely sure that I hate trees and might even cheer for forest fires next summer (but at the same time learning the science behind forest fires absolutely killed any arsonist impulses I may have had... way too much work). My major wasn't even in trees... just required a lot of tree courses.", "author": "shark_nebulae", "created": 1616261232, "upvotes": 3}, "grlree3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m8x0l6/dont_know_where_my_life_is_going/grlree3/", "text": "We sound very similar! So, I switched my major countless times and am not allllmost decided on communications bc it\u2019s general, flexible, and I can minor in something I like. I would honesty advise against pursuing tech or stem just bc it\u2019s stable. You\u2019ll be miserable if you choose something just based on pay. I second what another poster said about imaging your future and going from there. Also job shadowing may help! (for context, I was choosing between speech pathology, which u may like, communications) Also consider if you want to be able to change career fields or jobs easily. Broad majors are good for that!

I'm a history major with a minor in Film, but all of my work experience has been with non-profits, creative media production (I like videography/editing), and athletics. History has been a great major for me, because it allows me to explore virtually any subject, and the skills required (critical reading/writing/analysis) are fantastic qualities for a variety of future careers. \n\nI'm also doing a film instead of a paper for my Senior Honors Thesis next year, which is further enabling me to combine my interests with my major. So, I would recommend History as a versatile/tolerable major, but also focus on real-world experiences and opportunities. Most importantly, study something you enjoy, and many employers don't particularly care, as long as you have a degree, relevant job experience (hence, focus on work opportunities/internships in fields you're interested in), and competence.\n\nObviously, if you want to be an engineer or programmer, you might want to switch to CS or something, but you can always minor in one and explore that.", "author": "jt12008", "created": 1616206645, "upvotes": 4}}}
