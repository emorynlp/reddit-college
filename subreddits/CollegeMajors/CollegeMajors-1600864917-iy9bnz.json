I entered college as a business major and it wasn\u2019t until this summer that I decided I no longer wanted to pursue it and decided that I\u2019d like to become a Speech Therapist/Speech Pathologist. I really would like to help children through speech therapy sine I have some little cousins going through speech therapy right now, and I would really like make an impact with other children in this way. Since I\u2019ve to come to this realization so late into my time at CC, a lot of my transfer options are limited because I don\u2019t have some of the required classes for transfer (example: Some schools I WAS considering required Intro to Psych & Developmental Psych but my schedule won\u2019t allow me to take Intro until next semester). How for some burning questions I have that I couldn\u2019t really find a good answers to online (I got a lot so bare with me if you can):\n1. To become an SLP, would it be better/recommended/useful if I transfer into a 4 year as some sort of Communications Disorder major? (Some schools have different titles like Communications and Science Disorders etc) Or would Psychology be better/worse? (P.S. I\u2019m also aware SLP required a Masters degree, which is why I ask which would best prepare me for a Masters)\n\n2. What is the difference between a B.A & a B.S in Psychology?\n\n3. Do you know any decent schools worth getting more information about? Right now, I\u2019m only genuinely interested in 3 in-state schools but would like to have my options open\n\n4. Does anyone know how good Emerson College\u2019s B.S. in Communication Disorders is? I\u2019m slightly intrigued by them because of the small school size and because it\u2019s in Boston (I honestly really like Boston but the price is low-key scaring me)\n\n5. How many colleges do you recommend I apply to?\n\nI know for some of these I will reach out to the schools directly, but I would really appreciate some help since, as I mentioned before, I couldn\u2019t really find any useful answers online. Thanks in advance and you rock if you made it through the whole thing ;)", "author": "latinoworkforce", "created": 1600864917, "retrieved": 1632957712, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g6cxckg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/iy9bnz/undergrad_wanting_to_become_a_slp_seeking_advice/g6cxckg/", "text": "Hi! SLP grad student here. I can't answer all your questions, but I can answer a couple at least!\n\nIf possible, I'd highly recommend that you transfer to a university that has some sort of communication disorders major (there are lots of different names for this major, but they're all very similar). If that's not possible, you can still get into grad school with an outside major; however, you would have to take a make-up year in grad school to complete your prerequisites. \n\nThe difference between a BS and a BA in psychology usually varies depending on the school. Generally speaking, BS involves a few more math science classes and a BA involves a few more electives. I wouldn't say one is better than the other. If your ultimate goal is to be an SLP, either is fine.\n\nWhen it comes to applying to colleges, I think five is the average number people apply to. Some people do three, some people do ten -- it all depends on your resources and desired schools.\n\nFeel free to ask me more questions!", "author": "Oceanfairy", "created": 1600896110, "upvotes": 2}}}
