Life things came up and I had to stop about a year and a half before I finished. While I did enjoy the program then, my interests have changed a bit. I still enjoy art and design but I've also become interested in coding and creative writing. I've been told game design might be something to look into, but the research I've done shows it's a very narrow field that can be difficult to get into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat other programs/majors should I look into?
