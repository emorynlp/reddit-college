  "text": "I am currently committed to a school as a history major, but they also offer a history education major. I want to be an educator and I am very passionate about history. The history education major doesn't actually give you a teaching credential, so I'll end up having to do a credential program or masters after my undergrad regardless. If anyone has any insight it would be very much appreciated!",

If your goal is to ultimately teach and given that the education major provides some experience, I\u2019d go with History education!",
