The websites I read didn't agree with each other. I have seen Atmospheric Studies (Duh), Physics, communications, and journalism. Some even said you technically don't need anything to become one. I originally going to major in journalism until one of my teachers recommended that I consider meteorology, and I found that being a weathercaster would fit for me.\n\nIs it possible for me to become a weathercaster with a journalism degree?\n\nCan I major in journalism then do a course on Atmospheric studies after? (or is this a bad idea)\n\nThank you guys so much in advance.", "author": "deedoreebot", "created": 1597970104, "retrieved": 1632957476, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g2aztkf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/idmj1w/majors_for_being_a_weathercaster/g2aztkf/", "text": "I would say don't go for a physics degree as that won't really help out. I would say that getting a degree in atmospheric studies or meteorology would be good. If you're willing to double major, do a double major in that and communications, journalism, or media studies. I would research universities that offer these degrees, and go from there. If you are really undecided, consider going to community college, and then continuing on", "author": "kaimamaster1315", "created": 1597995583, "upvotes": 3}}}
