      "text": "If you\u2019re concerned about getting a decent job after you graduate, internships and skills-related extracurriculars are more important than your major in most cases. My friends who did internships during college mostly got decent jobs after college, while the ones who didn\u2019t are mostly either still looking or doing a low-paid internship/stipend post-graduation \u2014 this is true whether they studied something \u201csafe\u201d or not. Regardless of what you end up studying, do your best to get an internship or two on your resume before you graduate. \n\nSome internships pay, although they\u2019re harder to get. Unpaid internships are usually just 10-20 hours a week (my marketing communications internship at a nonprofit was 10 hours/week, so I was able to do it while holding a paying job), and you can often get college credit for them. You can basically do an internship in place of a course, and it will make a huge difference when you apply for jobs later on.\n\nBy the way, I was an English major and I have a decent job in digital marketing now. The pay would be pretty good if I lived anywhere other than one of the most expensive cities in the U.S., and I\u2019m early in my career \u2014 it could grow quite a bit.",
