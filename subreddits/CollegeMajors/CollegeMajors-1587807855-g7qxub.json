My plan was to figure it out as I went (I know, probably not a good idea) because I\u2019d still have enough time to get everything done starting next year. Well, ideally, if money/employment weren\u2019t an issue I\u2019d probably get a degree in geography because I\u2019ve always loved the subject and I am even a bit obsessed wit it. Other topics I like are ecology/environmental sciences and some social sciences like political science etc. in terms of actual coursework, I enjoy researching and writing essays, but I also don\u2019t mind some more hands on stuff.\n\nUltimately, it seemed like a geography degree might not cut it in terms of employability or salary. I thought I had settled on geology, because it is in the very least an earth science that I enjoyed and I kind of tied it into my love for geography. I had even gone on a three day trip with the geology department earlier this year and enjoyed it. However, with the ongoing COVID situation, and after browsing r/geologycareers, I\u2019m thinking that it is not a good idea to major in geology either. Firstly, as with all careers, there is a lack of jobs because of the state of the economy at the moment, but geology is especially bad considering many of the best jobs are in oil and gas. Also, I\u2019ve discovered through many posts on that sub that many, maybe a majority, of geology careers are very monotonous and repetitive, and many geologists spend more time programming than anything else, which I hate. It just seems like the job outlook for geologists, especially inexperienced ones with only one degree, is pretty bleak.\n\nSo, I\u2019m considering changing paths again before it\u2019s too late..\n\nBut what would I switch to? Right now I\u2019m thinking about natural resource management, or maybe public administration. I have always liked the idea of working for local, state, or even natl govt.\n\nI\u2019m not against a business degree, it\u2019s just not exhilarating to me. I\u2019d probably choose marketing if I went into business though, because I am somewhat fascinated by market research.\n\nMy problem is really that I am interested in a lot of things, but either they are not things that lead to a good career, or I am not passionate enough about them from the get go to know what to choose. I feel doomed by the fact that things that I like won\u2019t result in job security or wealth (I\u2019m not asking to be filthy rich, but I want to be comfortable from the start and have room to progress throughout my career).\n\nSeriously, any suggestions are welcome.

Once you get above the 100 level classes as it's very lab dependent. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily count it out if you really enjoy it as no one really knows where the world will be in 4 years.\n\nI would definitely encourage you to major in something you enjoy.
