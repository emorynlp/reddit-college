Now I want to double major in English and psyche, but the logical side of my brain is resisting. Help pls!", "text": "I have a passion for analyzing one's inner world, motivating others to reach their best potential. I'm a natural born leader, but I love to work alone. I've always loved writing stories, studying philosophy, and analyzing texts/film. I'm also very into scriptwriting, I've worked on some indie films and I am magnetized towards theatre for some reason lol. I chose computer science because one of the artistic mediums of which I wanted to express my ideas was game design. I'm a self taught programmer and I find it easy to learn, but I'm ironically quite anti tech (against the development of ai without regulations, against large corporations selling personal data, not a user of most social media). \n\nIs majoring in psychology and English too much of a risk? Frankly I wouldn't care if it is, but from what I've stated above, perhaps there's a better combination out there for me. I'm thinking of some sort of combination of cognitive science, psychology, English analysis of literature/creative writing, philosophy, and even film. I want to make money but I want even more to choose a career that helps me expand my world view, myself, and the world around me above all.", "author": null, "created": 1604108180, "retrieved": 1632957335, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"gapkt5j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jl9scr/i_went_into_university_with_a_premajor_in/gapkt5j/", "text": "If that\u2019s your passion, you should be pursuing that.

You want to major in something you enjoy, but will also help you pursue your career.\n\nI\u2019ve always said that it\u2019s not about the major, it\u2019s about what you do with it. If you have a goal, and have a backup plan, you should be okay. I don\u2019t think majoring in psychology or English would be risky as long as you know what you\u2019re going to do with it. It would help you to have a master\u2019s for these degrees, but since you know what you love and what you want to pursue in these fields, I think you should go with it, especially since you already taught yourself programming skills.", "author": "OkFondant0", "created": 1604161879, "upvotes": 1}}}
