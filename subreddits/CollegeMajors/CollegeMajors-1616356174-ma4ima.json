I am graduating from a community college and am planning to attend Syracuse to complete a 4 year. I cannot decide between a dual major of Supply Chain Managment with Information management and technology or finance with economics. SCM and finance are taught at Whitman, info management is taught at the iSchool, and economics is taught at Maxwell. I am interested in investment banking however I am aware that it is very competitive and that I could certainly be denied. Is Syracuse a good enough school to be considered for IB if I have a 3.9 gpa? I like all aspects of business so whatever job I end up with I would be happy in even if it\u2019s not IB, however, if I don\u2019t get accepted into IB, I think the SCM and info management option would be more useful.

If your coming from CC, id say get a 4.0 every single Semester and get involved as much as possible. Syracuse it good but compared to other Targets schools its alright. If you can financially, try to got to a target school. Getting into IB will be that much easier. And for Syracuse I would say go with supply chain and information management tech.
