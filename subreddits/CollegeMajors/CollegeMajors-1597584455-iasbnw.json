You jump through the hoops. You made it. Graduated high school. Now what? Now it's colleges, majors, career choices. There's a reason very few students leave high school not knowing what they want to do, how to make the biggest choices of their lives such as what major is best for them, or even which broad field best suits them. The school  system doesn't devote any time to it. The school system doesn't even raise awareness to any appreciable degree on how important it is to know these things. Now these decisions are looming. The clock is ticking.\n\nYou have been dropped off at an intersection with no road map. It's like that show where people are dropped off, The Amazing Race, except you are alone, you have to use your own money or loans, and you have no clues. Disclaimer: I didn't watch the show. Just saw the previews. Seems similar. \n\nAnyway, you have to create your road map.  After spending years upon years with your head down, crammed full of useful/useless tidbits now you have to know yourself.  Really well. Whaaaat? Yep. It's the most important project you will ever have. Don't do a half-ast approach.  It will come back and bite you in the rear.  If you don't take it seriously, you will waste money, time, and be down on yourself for years for not making better choices.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nFirst step, check out your high school's guidance counselor's web  pages. They should have some college/career links that might be helpful. They just  don't promote them very well. \n\nThere are personality and career aptitude tests online (Myers-Briggs, college and career planning) that give you an indication of what you are suited for. Look for the free ones. They seem pedestrian and fluffy, but there is  information you can gather that will point you in a direction to possibly peruse. Take a handful of those tests. College and career planning books help too. \"Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well Lived, Joyful Life\",  \"What Color is your Parachute For Teens\" are two great resources. There are many out there. \n\nTry to narrow down a large field. What do you like the most;  Math, Science, English, History, Art, Music?  Give it some time. Think it through. Once you have the large field, then look at career choices. Talk to people in the field. Maybe a blend and interdisciplinary studies is for you. Talk to a college advisor that is involved in interdisciplinary studies. Find out about it from reliable sources.\n\nCheck  out the Occupational Outlook Handbook  [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)   . It is a wealth of  information that will give you a comprehensive picture of many careers.  It provides a summary of what the job actually entails, salary ranges, the outlook for the  career.  Important stuff.  Lifestyle is very important. Unbelievably  important. Pay attention to it. You go from having every summer off as a kid to working year round and earning 2 weeks off a year. Accruing more time off if you are lucky. Possible shift work. Possible weekend work. Possible holidays. Big shock. Lifestyle is a huge factor. Don't overlook it.\n\nOnce  you have an idea of a career you think suits you, find someone in the  field that is doing it. Interview them. Ask them what they like about their career and what they don't like. Ask them if they had the chance,  would they chose this career again? Why or why not?  Shadow a person actually doing the job day in and day out.  It's important to get a feel  for the career you are going to commit to. You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it would you? Same diff. Only more costly.\n\nSelecting  a major is a huge investment of time and money. Huge commitment.  That's an understatement. Years of preparation. Going into debt to get the degree. You don't want to end up with a career that is not a good fit. Can you imagine having a job you absolutely hate AND a huge debt to go with it?  That's a special kind of stuck.  Don't let that happen to you. It's like  wearing shoes that are too tight. every.single. day. You can not research too much.\n\nIf you  absolutely can't decide and you need more time, you can declare a Liberal  Arts major (general education) track.  You would be taking the foundational classes that would apply to most majors. Progressing while you find the right fit. The first two years of college are basics generally, (English, Math, Science, History, that are sequential)  unless you go into something specialized. I'm not recommending you stay in that track for two years, jut that this is an option to buy  you time. You can switch majors once you are sure.\n\nJust some random thoughts and ideas. Hope it helps.
