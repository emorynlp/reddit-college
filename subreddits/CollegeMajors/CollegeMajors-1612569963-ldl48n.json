      "text": "I originally did computer science. However I did it more or less for the money, peer and parental pressure. 2 classes in and I hate it. I didn't do bad in the classes (A's and B's) but I really did not enjoy them. After graduation I still want to work in the tech industry so I switched my major to cognitive science. I go to a community college and hopefully i'll get accepted into their cogsci program. I want to do something in ui/ux or product management. I'm not opposed to coding in the future but for now I dislike it. I'm still in college so I still have a couple years ahead of me.",

      "text": "Originally I was going to major in psychology and minor in art with the intention of becoming a social worker and having an art career on the side, or maybe even being an art therapist.\n\nAfter taking abnormal psychology, I realized a job helping people in mental distress wasn\u2019t a good fit for me after all. So I decided just to major in art instead of minor. I got my degree in that. \n\nDuring the process of getting my degree, I decided that I am not interested in making art for clients or corporations, but I\u2019d rather my art career be all my own. So I accepted the idea of having a day job, even if it\u2019s not in art, to pay the bills while I work on my own art. \n\nI now work as a cake decorator and love it\u2014it appeals to some the things I like about art: I like making things, and feel satisfied when the project is done and I can step back and look at the final product. They hired me with no experience. I am now planning on going back to school and getting a certificate in pastry arts so I can learn more and move up the cake decorating ladder.",

      "text": "Originally, I started college as an English major, mainly because I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I had always liked reading and writing so I settled on it. Being an English major was  somewhat mediocre for me (with the exception of a few excellent classes), and the job opportunities for the major didn't appeal to me. So I took an intro to programming class my junior year, thought it was pretty decent, and kept taking CS classes and switched my major to computer science. To this day, I still wouldn't say that coding is my passion, and there are a lot of people in my major who are way better than me, but I can still hold my own well enough. There have been a few computer science classes I greatly enjoyed, and I'm really looking forward to taking more classes and finishing the degree, even if it takes me an extra year.\n\nI would definitely say I'm glad I changed my major. Going back to high school, I was pretty good at academics, but I never had a specific job that I had my heart set on. Even in college I was dreading graduating and finding a job because I didn't have any idea what I wanted in a career. So for me, computer science offered a well defined, decent paying job path, so I don't need to worry about finding the 1 thing I want to do for the rest of my life. I can just become a programmer and earn enough money that I can always switch if something else comes up. It's also a very versatile degree, so if I get burnt out doing programming there are paths in product management, business analytics, or software sales. Definitely let me know if you have any questions, since I was in the exact same boat a few years ago.",
