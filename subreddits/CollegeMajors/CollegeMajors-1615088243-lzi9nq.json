  "text": "I\u2019m asking for help for anyone who is in college or working. So basically, I\u2019m currently in highschool and I am confused in what major I should take. I have many strong points (science, math, english, and other subjects) but I want to major in something related to business. I heard that if I want to have a high-paying job straight out of school, i should major in something that requires coding. I tried coding in python, but I don\u2019t think I really like it. So, any advice on any business degree that could give me a high-paying job straight out of college? (No programming please) Thanks in advance!",
