So basically, I\u2019m currently in highschool and I am confused in what major I should take. I have many strong points (science, math, english, and other subjects) but I want to major in something related to business. I heard that if I want to have a high-paying job straight out of school, i should major in something that requires coding. I tried coding in python, but I don\u2019t think I really like it. So, any advice on any business degree that could give me a high-paying job straight out of college? (No programming please) Thanks in advance!", "author": "Mel_elextra", "created": 1615088243, "retrieved": 1632958070, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gq2df8b": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lzi9nq/help_with_choosing_business_major/gq2df8b/", "text": "If ypu can manage a certain amount of programming as part of your course work and would like to work in a tech related job without coding for a living (business analyst, product management type of job profiles) you can look at MIS/CIS as majors. \n\nOn the other hand if you are totally averse to programming and since you are good at math, supply chain would be an excellent choice for a business major.", "author": "VolgaBlue", "created": 1615090787, "upvotes": 2}}}
