I\u2019d also probably minor in psychology or marketing as I\u2019ve heard those courses can be really helpful during the hiring process.

I took a variety of classes ranging from organizational, public relations, journalism, production, and leadership. I think that the major gets a lot of bad talk because it is so broad. That's the biggest issue. You have to narrow down what you want to do with it and excel in that area. I think the fact that you already have a concentration is great. You know what you want out of the degree. Now you just need to earn that degree and get the experience to enter the workforce. In terms of your concentrations and minors it's all going to come down how the school you attend works. But I think your focuses are excellent. The college you go to is all going to depend on where you want to go to school, your financial situation, stats, etc.", "author": "strangercats13", "created": 1625789332, "upvotes": 2}, "h4bioeo": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/of7kvi/communications/h4bioeo/", "text": "Communications is a fine major. Biggest issue I can see is all the stereotypes you will get. If you let it get to you, then it will suck.\n\nFriend of mine studied communications, then got a job at a travel company making crap money. Then worked at some company I don\u2019t remember. Then got a bottom of the rung job at Uber corporate, then a good job at ASIC (shoe company) and then went back to Uber as like a director or something.\n\nCompare that to all my other friends who said communications was a joke, took 6+ years to graduate in some other random major (some are yet to graduate) and are no where near the friend who works at Uber.\n\nThere are a million generic jobs out there that I had no idea about when I was in college. Go be a technical program manager or a recruiter or a sales representative. Shit\u2026 work in HR.\n\nSo many in college want to study architecture so they can be an architect (or something like that that has a direct path). Some portion of those will lose interest either before they graduate or within 5 years post graduation. \n\nCommunications (or any major really) is what ever you make it up to be. Don\u2019t let it limit you.\n\nEdit: wanted to add more\n\nI studied with a math major who became a dentist, a math major who became a physician\u2019s assistant, a math major who was a math tutor while she traveled the world\u2026 I think she is going for PhD now\u2026, a computer science major who became a brew master, a computer science major who became a cop, and many more like that.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with a bio-psychology major who became a software engineer while also working with a bio-psychology major who became a salesmen, every project manager I\u2019ve met has a different background (psychology, aerospace engineering, architecture, business, computer science, and probably more)", "author": "travishummel", "created": 1625631425, "upvotes": 3}}}
