I don\u2019t know whether to choose cognitive science or healthcare management as my major, and I don\u2019t know whether I want to be on the nurse practitioner or physician assistant track. I\u2019m worried that if I don\u2019t figure out what I want right now, I won\u2019t have enough time to complete all my prerequisites for grad school as well as college core classes and prerequisites for the majors listed above. Are there any tips to help me decide what I want to do?", "author": "SatisfactionOk6367", "created": 1628356159, "retrieved": 1632956735, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h844xof": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ozx5w9/is_it_normal_to_not_know_what_major_and_career/h844xof/", "text": "I\u2019m a junior and I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing for my major \ud83e\udd72 I feel this", "author": "voidppl", "created": 1628381674, "upvotes": 1}, "h82ub31": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ozx5w9/is_it_normal_to_not_know_what_major_and_career/h82ub31/", "text": "you\u2019re still an incoming freshman! you\u2019ll learn a lot more about those fields and about yourself once you start. \n\nif it\u2019s still confusing for you then, or if you want a headstart, try asking people who are in those fields and see which one you find more interesting?", "author": "oakflowersD", "created": 1628358586, "upvotes": 4}}}
