Can\u2019t get accepted into the business school and the two majors I\u2019m most interested in are political science and history. I know people crap on these a lot but I have extra curriculars and connections are going to play a huge part in me getting a job. So between these two which should I major in? I\u2019m also looking at an Econ or International Studies minor. Any thoughts? I just want to graduate at this point but I want to get the most marketable degree/minor I can. Thanks!

This is a strength of most of the traditional humanities majors (history, English, philosophy).\n\nAlso, i don\u2019t really feel that one major is significantly more marketable than the other, so you might as well go with the one that seems more interesting, challenges you, the one with faculty you like better and want to work with, etc", "author": "puffy-jacket", "created": 1567170862, "upvotes": 2}, "ey8ltq1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/cvzizu/need_help_history_or_political_science/ey8ltq1/", "text": "I double majored in history and political science, so AMA. \n\nI would suggest history because the research, writing, and critical thinking skills you will develop can help you in any career path.
