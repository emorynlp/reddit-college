It's basically CIS with none of the finance courses and none of the math of Computer Science, but instead focuses almost purely on [programming languages and web development fundamentals](http://prntscr.com/1rk2c05) (ignore the overabundance of liberal arts classes; I switched into this major after a semester of English Literature). I've sort of been thinking of just buckling down with the math (I'm bad at it) and getting through an actual Computer Science degree, but it's really intimidating to me because the highest level of math I've completed is Algebra 2 in high school...about 7-8 years ago. And that was barely passing.\n\nI'm happy with this major so far. I like my teachers and the classes I took last semester seemed pretty useful to me. However, this .NET class kind of has me thinking...basically, it's an online course I'm taking and I'm skimming the powerpoint for the first chapter. I realized, however, that the copyright on the bottom is all the way from 2016. The first assignment actually says as one of the objectives:\n\n* **Explain the use of Visual Studio 2017 when developing Visual Basic 2015 program**\n\nThis is making me question if this class is going to be out of date and, to be blunt, useless. I already have Visual Studio 2019 because I used it for my C++ class last semester so I don't understand why I should be working with an old version of Studio and I assume an outdated version of Basic. The C++ class was great, and this web development class seems like it's going to be pretty good too, but the .NET class is really making me second guess some things to say the least (like, as I said earlier, if I should switch into an actual CS major after all).", "author": "KansaiKanpai", "created": 1631095874, "retrieved": 1632958201, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc58eum": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pk7mhy/is_this_net_class_and_by_extension_maybe_major/hc58eum/", "text": "There's a chance the powerpoint maybe is just out of date, I remember some of my professors would teach the same class for like 10 years and just never update any of the dates, lol. It might be a good idea to email the prof about that. But anyway, I don't think this one class should necessarily convince you to switch into a CS major. While I do think that a CS degree is more versatile than CIS (especially if you want to do a heavy programming job), you're right, there are a decent number of math requirements for it.\n\nIDK exactly about the school you're planning to transfer to, but generally a CS degree requires a couple of semesters of calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, data structures (half math half programming type stuff) and theoretical computer science. At the very least, I would recommend a strong understanding of algebra to anyone who wants to get a CS degree. You should ask yourself how long you think it would take you to make sure you even have that, and if you think you're capable of taking 5+ math classes for a CS degree.\n\nTo be honest, IDK much about C# (I'm more of a javascript guy, lol), but I do know it is a very common backend language. So I don't think it would hurt you to take the class, and it could be a good language to specialize in to get a job. I am a CS major planning to go into web dev, so if you have more questions I would be happy to answer.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1631160560, "upvotes": 1}, "hc1tpc5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pk7mhy/is_this_net_class_and_by_extension_maybe_major/hc1tpc5/", "text": "Most of the applications out there at companies will still be using .net framework not using .net core yet.
