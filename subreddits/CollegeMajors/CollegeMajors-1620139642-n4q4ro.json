I want to know more!'. Think of what makes you feel alive, what makes your eyes shine when you speak about it and go with it - and if you put in work and passion into it, money will follow. Can you imagine yourself spending 50+ years programming computers? Getting up every day to do it? If it doesn't make you genuinely excited, don't pick it.\n\nI don't know where you're located or what the job market is where you are, but if you're thinking of studying business at a specific institution you can try researching people who studied it in the past and seeing what they do now. Check out linked.in pages of people who are where you want to be. Don't hesitate to message them for advice - they could be of serious help.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "OatsFanatic", "created": 1620146041, "upvotes": 4}}}
