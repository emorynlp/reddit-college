  "text": "Currently, I'm a Sophmore studying photography and I know that won't really lead to a financially secure future but I'm not really good at anything outside of art.\n\nI'm considering doing a double major in photography and graphic design but...basically I want to know how to find another passion to major in since I'm practically going to college for free I might as well take up a double major in something that I can fall back on or at least do full-time while doing photography on the side.\n\nI suck at math and I can comprehend other subjects perfectly fine...it's just I lack interest in them and I have a hard time sorting through all the options in front of me. I thought about doing a double in English as I spend a lot of time writing and reading, or graphic design as I dabble in it a lot and it'll be a decent job while still being considered creative based work.\n\nYet, I still want extra input from anyone who possibly struggled to find the best route for their future and which path to take to at least get by in life.\n\n...",
