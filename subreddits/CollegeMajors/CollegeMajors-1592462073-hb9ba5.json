I thought about doing a double in English as I spend a lot of time writing and reading, or graphic design as I dabble in it a lot and it'll be a decent job while still being considered creative based work.\n\nYet, I still want extra input from anyone who possibly struggled to find the best route for their future and which path to take to at least get by in life.\n\n...", "author": "negamoonspoon", "created": 1592462073, "retrieved": 1632847675, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fvf54yk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hb9ba5/how_did_you_discover_your_passion_is_it_a_waste/fvf54yk/", "text": "Unless your passion is acedemia, you won't find your passion in college. \n\nFocus on employ-ability in an area you have interest in.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1592637535, "upvotes": 1}, "fv7nftg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hb9ba5/how_did_you_discover_your_passion_is_it_a_waste/fv7nftg/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1592466606, "upvotes": 3}}}
