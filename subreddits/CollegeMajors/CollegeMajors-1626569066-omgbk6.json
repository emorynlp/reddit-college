I am a rising senior and I\u2019m going to start applying to colleges soon and want to have a major ready. I know I can almost always change my major but I still wanna take a deeper dive and figure out what major(s) as well as what career paths may fit me the best. I am currently ranked top of my class so have no worries about doing further education such as a masters or extra certs if needed/would help; this is mainly because I dont mind school and learning new things and have a lot of money saved for college from myself and family so that is not of large concern. My strongest classes in high school were the math classes and the classes I struggled most in were english and history. Although the classes that i enjoyed the most were AP calc, AP psych, and AP bio. I am good at problem solving, helping others, and time management. I want to be able to do a major that leaves me with plenty of options after getting a bachelors whether that be pursuing a masters, lots of different career opportunities, etc. I also would like a major that could bring in above average pay. I am not interested in engineering and I am intrigued by computer science but have no experience and I dont like being in a place where I\u2019m going to be one of the less qualified people. I love to help people, I will most likely be working and living in California, and want a job that i can be happy at. \nAny sort of advice on majors/career paths would be very much appreciated!", "author": "myskaeopork", "created": 1626569066, "retrieved": 1632846508, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h5mf0yu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/omgbk6/need_help_choosing_a_majorcareer_path/h5mf0yu/", "text": "Some random thoughts:\n\nWhat do you think would suit you? Are you introverted, extroverted, or a combination? That does have a bearing on what you would be content doing. Settling on a major you are happy with takes time and you really have to know yourself. There are tests you can help identify what you are suited for. They seem like fluff, but they can be revealing. Your high school counselor should be able to provide some websites that are free and can help.\n\nI would interview and shadow a person in the field you choose before you commit. It's a lot of time, energy, and money you are going to invest. Find out about the field from people doing it. It will save you a lot of aggravation in the long run. \n\nCheck out this website:  [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)  It's the Occupational Outlook Handbook. It breaks out occupation groups, pay bands, projected growth, etc..
