I\u2019m planning on attending Syracuse University in the fall as a transfer student. I plan to do a dual degree program their business school (Whitman) and their technology school (iSchool) has designed. I would be dual majoring Supply Chain Management and Information Systems Management and Technology. How effective is this combo? I am really a business student but I see the value in the information management. Ideally I\u2019d like to earn 80k a year but that doesn\u2019t seem very doable with a bachelors degree out of college. Also, how would an accounting and finance double major pair up against a SCM and Info systems dual degree? I know they\u2019re different subjects but I could see myself doing either one so income is really important. Lastly, which pair would be more beneficial to starting a business? I\u2019m interested in starting a dispensary and thought the supply chain management would help on that end, as well as a tech background for the companies computer systems. Thanks guys!", "author": "Conscious_Ad_3795", "created": 1615756270, "retrieved": 1632956865, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
