  "text": "Good morning, users\n\nI'm currently finishing up my AES at my community college. I only have 16 credit hours left, but I wanted them to increase it to 12 more to tackle on these two courses that equaling 6 credit hours each.\n\nWould the advisor or other department be able to add more credits?\n\nI don't mind paying for the two courses out of pocket.",
