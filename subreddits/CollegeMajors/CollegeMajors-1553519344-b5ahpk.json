  "text": "Currently, I am a freshman in college and I am majoring in Mass Communications (specifically on the Journalist track). Recently, I have been having doubts as to whether or not I actually want to be a journalist. I like to write, but I don't know if it's what I am passionate about. I have been writing articles for a club at my university and every time I go to write an article I dread it. Is that a sign that journalism isn't for me or should I not be concerned about it? I love to write don't get me wrong, but maybe it's the fact that I have to do it is what is bothering me and making me feel like this? Additionally, I have also began looking into careers in Film and or History and for the most part, I am utterly lost with what I should major in. I spoke to my advisor and that meeting didn't really help all that much. I have only taken one class toward my actual major thus far and it was okay. I am due to take another Mass Comm class this coming Fall semester and I am not excited for it but I am excited for my language class, my Humanities class, and my Government class (basically all of my other classes). I love the idea of journalism and wouldn't mind being a journalist, but I am clearly having some doubts and it is truly stressing me out. On the other hand, while I love History, I am a very creative person and love to travel so preferably I would like a career that is not where I sit behind a desk for most of my life. So, what should I do? Any advice and or career/major suggestions/options would be greatly appreciated!",
