I am so unsure of what to major in for my undergrad (currently a junior). I love the humanities, but I do want a career that can help me succeed financially. My dream careers involve being a manager or CEO, or having a high level marketing career, but I am aspiring for a job with a lot of growth and a high starting salary.\n\nHowever, I've been researching and I'm not sure getting a BBA is going to help me. I almost definitely will get a MBA (maybe even a CFA) , I just don't know what major would help me the most.\n\nIn terms of courses I am good at, I am good at honors level math, science. My strengths are english and history though. The kicker is I am not sure if a major in stem is right for me, because I have taken AP Chem and Accelerated Geometry, and have failed tests in those courses and ended with grades from a B- to B. The rest of my grades range from A- to A+ excluding those courses. \n\n My target schools all have an admission rate of 10-20%, and I have a 3.8 GPA and SAT scores between 1450-1510. I have great ECs, and I'm good at art, music, and public speaking. My biggest passions involve politics, foreign language, econ/global trade, but I just want to make sure that whatever I major in will be something I am skilled at (so I can go to a good school for my MBA), but also have career opportunities for me.\n\nAre there any majors that I have a chance of getting into these competitive schools with (despite my low grades in advanced math and science), that could lead me to do well in managing/marketing? So far I've looked at computer science, a business admin degree, public health, and international relations. \n\nSorry for all the detail! Not at all trying to compare myself to others, I am just lost on what I should do and wanted to provide enough context for anyone who can help me.

If I were you, I would also possibly consider finance and/or accounting, which tend to be majors that lead to stable jobs with good opportunity for growth. With finance, though, I think a lot of it may depend on school prestige. So if you get into a prestigious business school, your chances of getting a high paying job are much better than if you go to some random state school. Economics is also a decent option for those kinds of jobs in finance, consulting, and management, and I know a lot of people who go to good liberal arts schools (with no business major) who major in Econ and get jobs. Of course, this is also due a lot to the prestige of the school.\n\nIf you want to go into marketing, specifically, I can say I know a lot of people who did this with random liberal arts degrees (English, psychology, etc.) because your success in marketing will be a lot more about what you can do and not your degree.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is building a good network and making friends with ambitious or well connected people. Go to a good school (it sounds like you have done well in school) and that will definitely help.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1613780066, "upvotes": 3}, "gnyu79p": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ln4l8g/so_lost_on_what_to_major_in_would_appreciate_any/gnyu79p/", "text": "How about a double-major in econ and poli sci (or IR)?
