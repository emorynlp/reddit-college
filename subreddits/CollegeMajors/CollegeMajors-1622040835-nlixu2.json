  "text": "So I thought for like a year that I wanted to go into real estate so i would not have to go to college (I will be graduating high school with two associates, one in arts one in sciences because I go to an early college program). But i have kind of realized that maybe I want to do something more. I have a really big interest in natural disasters, particularly flooding and hurricanes. However, I do not want to be a weather person. Im not sure at all what to do, but I am good with people. I also dont want to be a first responder, more like someone who solves the problems natural disasters bring. Help me!!!",
