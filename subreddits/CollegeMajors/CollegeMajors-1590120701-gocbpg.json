I arrived at Tech with zero credits and made some mistakes first semester, so although I will technically be a rising junior, I likely won\u2019t graduate until Spring or Summer 2023.\n\nI took the online version of CS 1301 (Intro to Python) last semester, and spent much of my finals week cranking out coding problem after coding problem. One of these days, I wasted an entire morning trying to debug a program that should have been very simple, only to discover a stupid typo and storm off to my room, feeling exhausted and defeated. Through anger and frustration, I thought to myself: \u201cDo I really want to be doing this for three more years?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always admired the built environment, I draw constantly, and I have a propensity for art. I\u2019ve considered minoring in architecture in the past, but the curriculum involves no studios and the classes are surveys, at best. That night, for the first time, I Googled the GT ARCH major requirements and calculated how much longer it would take me to graduate. To avoid getting bogged down in the details, I\u2019ll just note that it will take me a semester or two longer to graduate in ARCH vs. CS.\n\nHalf of the people in my life have told me to work hard and play by the rules, the other half tell me to do what I love and fallow my passion. I have very little idea what I want my life to look like, but I would love to have a family and kids one day, and preferably be able to support them as well as I can. I also want a fast car, preferably sooner than later. \n\nA degree in computer science is objectively more likely to sustain me financially. That said, I don\u2019t know if it will be fulfilling to ignore my appetite for creating. Sure, I could do watercolor on the side, but I want to build magnificent structures that redefine design, dedicated to humanity and our capacity of imagination.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t have a \u201cpassion\u201d for CS, but although I\u2019ve had frustrating days, there were some problems that I actually enjoyed thinking through; there is a satisfying rigidity in programming, like an ancient dialect. Who\u2019s to say that I won\u2019t discover excitement about my major some point down the line? After all, I\u2019ve only taken one CS class.\n\nIn addition to it being just as, if not more difficult, architecture doesn\u2019t offer anywhere near the kind of marketability as a degree in CS. A CS major would allow me to do nearly anything I wanted for grad school, and put me in a decent position after that. After all, CS is the future and the future is CS. If I switch to architecture, chances are I\u2019ll try to become an architect, and if/when that happens, only the top 1% of architects (if that) make anything more than a living wage. \n\nMy mom is a lawyer, My dad is a trader, and brother is pre-med. It is not easy going against the grain in an Asian household, but I am lucky that my family is in favor of whatever decision I make. However, if I majored in CS, it would be much easier for them to support me along the way.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to an Architecture advisors, an exploratory major advisor, a graduate from the School of Architecture, a current ARCH student, the PI of a cool design research lab, my therapist, my friends, and my dog. I should have more than enough information, yet I still can\u2019t decide.\n\nI have a decent amount of time, but the decision will affect classes I sign up for in Fall 2020. I am seriously torn. Thank you for bearing with me, if you\u2019ve made it this far.\n\nTL;DR: Computer Science major thinking about switching to Architecture. Love to design but also to make money.

I think when you get a little further along, you'll see there's definitely an architectural element to programming.  The early things are just to get you familiar with problem solving / syntax.  Eventually you'll do larger programs that require you to plan / design them out - and how you do things will be different than how other people / your classmates will do them.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it does have elements of what you're after, you're just not there yet.", "author": "PianoConcertoNo2", "created": 1590164423, "upvotes": 1}}}
