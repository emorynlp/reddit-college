  "text": "Hello, as the title says, im having trouble deciding on what I should major in because I dont know if its worth the time and money to pursue them. I believe creativity is my strong suit while math is my biggest weakness (I suck at it). \n\nI have three majors in mind: Industrial Design, Creative Technologies and Informatics Engineering (it is kinda similar to Computer Science ). \n\nIm also open to suggestions of any major that combines creativity and technology.",

You have -6 karma on your profile so obviously you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nBut to answer your question you can literally work in accounting, marketing, and operations, for example, and make decent money and it\u2019s not a tech job. Hell, you can even work for a tech company and not work in tech. At least where I live that\u2019s how it works.",
