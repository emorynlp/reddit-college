I am fascinated by people and how their brains work. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for psychiatry, though, or the medical field. What would be a good major? I was considering Child Studies and Human Development, since that is something that fascinates me and I would love to have a career in, but I want to know if that is an employable degree.\n\nThanks!", "author": "anarchistinlove", "created": 1586241732, "retrieved": 1632847772, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fmpb5pu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/fwfnn8/trying_to_narrow_down_my_major/fmpb5pu/", "text": "If you want to do social work or other types of mental healthcare work, you\u2019re probably going to need to go to graduate school (e.g. MSW). So I don\u2019t think it really matters exactly what your major is. You don\u2019t have to know from the start! It\u2019s very common to change majors. It sounds like CSHD is a good fit for you; you may also want to explore fields like biopsychology or cognitive and brain sciences.
