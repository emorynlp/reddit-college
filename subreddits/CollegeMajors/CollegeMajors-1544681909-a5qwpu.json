I always encourage people to think about what they want to be doing AFTER college so they know the best route to get to where they want. From a 10,000 FT view though, it looks like a public policy major might be best if you want to do a lot of networking, working with people and ideas, and if you want to pursue a graduate degree in the humanities.",
