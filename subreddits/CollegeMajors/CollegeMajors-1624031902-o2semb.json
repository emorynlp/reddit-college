  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a rising sophomore at a liberal arts college on the East Coast. I\u2019ve always loved school, particularly any chance I had to read or write, and I love being surrounded by people as enthusiastic about learning as I am.\n\nGrowing up, I was SURE I was going to be involved in government, either as a candidate or some form of bureaucrat. I declared a major in Public Policy almost immediately upon arriving at the school (as well as a second major in Gender Studies and a minor in Peace and Justice), and did well enough in my intro classes that I was offered a prestigious research fellowship that freshmen rarely got access to. The research fellowship gave me money to research a topic of my choosing, allowing me to quit my planned summer job and work on my project, which studies the importance of religion in influencing women\u2019s voting patterns, full time. \n\nI\u2019ve always loved writing academic papers, but I didn\u2019t realize HOW much I loved doing it until now- enough that I want to do it full time. My topic is fascinating to me, and although I am only supposed to submit a paper at the end of the summer, I actually plan on writing a whole book on the subject. My advisor says it shows great promise and could potentially get me to a decent grad school- however, he said that it might be a good idea for me to switch majors and go to Political Science, as it\u2019s more relevant to my future career goals as a political researcher. \n\nPart of me really wants to switch- I\u2019d have access to professors doing the job I want to do one day, and the classes offered by the department look AMAZING. My project advisor would also become my academic advisor (he isn\u2019t right now), allowing us to work more closely on the project through undergrad. I was so sure of Public Policy before doing this work, though; although I have no desire to run for office anymore, I feel like I\u2019m abandoning the dream I made as a child. I also really like my Public Policy advisor and would prefer to have her around in some capacity. \n\nI really am not sure what to do here. (I don\u2019t want to drop gender studies because I want my work to focus on women in politics.) What do you think?",
