Especially with the fact that speech-pathology is such in high demand and requires a Master's to pursue. If someone's interested in this field, then when they go to earn their Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology, then they don't need to take an extra year of prerequisites.

However, they are also in high demand because, unfortunately, there is a high SLP turnover rate in the school settings. This is likely due to burnout, including factors such as low pay and high caseloads. Finally, we have to consider the barriers that prevent people from becoming SLPs, which is something you're experiencing right now (limited number of programs, limited number of seats in those programs, the expenses associated with college, etc.)  \n\n\nSo, all things considered, it's likely that the demand for SLPs is increasing at a higher rate than universities can create new programs. Developing an SLP program -- even just an undergrad program -- requires a lot of time, effort, and money. You also need people to teach those classes, but as we've established, there aren't exactly enough SLPs to go around.  \n\n\nEven if we could magically create all of the undergrad/grad programs we need to fulfill SLP demand, it's also important to look at the other side of the coin: what happens when degrees/careers become oversaturated?   \n\n\nAgain, I'm not an expert, these are just some ideas that I've picked up on as I've been studying in the field. I'm sure I'm missing a lot. However, maybe this will help you to understand the scope of the issue. People are slowly addressing barriers to education (online schools are on the rise, for example), but we have a lot more work to do.", "author": "Oceanfairy", "created": 1618074347, "upvotes": 1}}}
