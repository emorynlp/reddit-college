  "text": "... like everyone has had a little click in college that had their interest sparked on towards what they want to major in and idk how to get mine . I would like a career that offers me stability but that I also wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll speak of my current dilemma ,,, hopefully someone can offer advice? In hs I took engineering courses and I used to think I wanted to be a civil engineer and down the line in college I realized it\u2019s so math intensive and that I don\u2019t want to do intensive math everyday as a job even given I reach the level of proficiency. Then I pondered on construction management which my brother is doing which still deals with public works and ur still a part of creating new areas but since I\u2019m a female in a male dominated field I worry that I may be treated unfairly but then again realistically everyone has gotten treated unfairly in their lifetime it\u2019s inevitable!? So it shouldn\u2019t deter me too much! Then I was looking into psychology which needs more schooling for a masters in counseling in order for me to become a school psychologist which seems like a nice jobs but the pay is also low? I also looked into hospital admin management and dietitians work which seemed interesting but I\u2019m unsure on the jobs that will be available. Work doesn\u2019t define your happiness but also still plays a big role in ur life and it\u2019s not something I can ignore ! Can someone offer me advice or share their personal college experiences? Everything being online is taking a toll on me, and I have other life events that come to my concerns idk. I really wanted to grow in college as a person but this first year I feel stuck. Also stem careers being pushed heavily isn\u2019t nice to hear either, people calling certain degrees \u201cuseless\u201d isn\u2019t good either.",

      "text": "Aside from specific job roles, what interests you? Do you like analyzing data, do you want to be at a computer all the time? Do you want to work with people and help them or would you prefer to contribute to space exploration? Do you like customer service? Machines? Trades? It's really tough deciding.  \nI (25F) am pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering, but it has taken a long time to get here. I have about 60 credits of useless credits from random community college classes I tried and didn't like. A lot of us in STEM feel like imposters like we have no idea what's going on. I imagine it's the same in other disciplines, too. If you can, join some sort of club. I joined the Society of Women Engineers and it has completely changed my mindset and makes me feel not so alone.   \nHonestly, my heart is with Civil Engineering. I would love to work with construction or with wastewater, but the class schedule just isn't doable with my job. Electrical Engineering was the only engineering offered online at the college here (Arizona State). They now offer Mechanical and I am considering switching, but I have taken so many EE courses, I don't want to backtrack and do mechanical courses.   \nAt some point, you just have to pick something and hope you can market it to get a job you enjoy. If you're really undecided, pick something that can be used in a multitude of ways.",

      "text": "Dude, idk what you are talking about. In my experience it\u2019s like 5% of the population actually has this experience you speak of where they find their calling for a career. There will be a lot of people who claim they found this, but it\u2019s a lot of shit that makes others feel bad.\n\nAgain, this is only from my experience. I\u2019m a software engineer and I would say about half of the engineers have been coding since they were young. The other half made decisions along to way and decided to go for this.\n\nMy calling was definitely teaching, but chose this field because I desired the lifestyle. I\u2019m definitely testy on this subject because my parents advertised stuff like this and all my siblings are still waiting for their magic calling because \u201cif you do something you love for work, then you\u2019ll never work a day in your life\u201d.... that is just hogwash that sets the expectations of never working and if you are ever working... well then you didn\u2019t find the thing you love.\n\nThe other stuff you pointed out is legit. Like being in the minority is always going to be tough. I\u2019m social and being in engineering, I\u2019m definitely in the minority and so that has its own struggles.\n\nA good role that\u2019s fairly general is a project manager at a tech company. People get into that role with any and all backgrounds. If you are good at math, it will help, but you won\u2019t be expected to do it all the time. You work with engineers so the more technical knowledge you have, the better. Idk, it\u2019s mostly just a path to look into if you\u2019re curious.\n\nAnother one if you are interested, look into speech language pathologist. You work to help kids learn how to speak better and help people who have swallowing problems (like stroke victims). Pay is good and it\u2019s a solid profession. You will need a masters, but it\u2019s significantly less crowded than those in psychology.\n\nI started in college wanted mechanical engineering, but that wasn\u2019t a major at my school. I picked math instead with ideas of becoming a math professor. Then pivoted to computer science because of the job opportunities. I would have loved to teach, I still think I will go back to teach someday. It\u2019s a trade off",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have advice (sorry), just wanted to say I\u2019m in a similar boat. I\u2019m finishing my freshman year (19M) and am trying to switch from a STEM degree to a humanities degree. I\u2019ve just come to terms with the fact that I am not mathematically skilled enough to complete a STEM degree and decided to go where I can be successful.\n\nI think most people don\u2019t have a niche, and work is just a balance of finding something that 1) pays well enough to let you live a life you want to life and 2) doesn\u2019t make you contemplate blowing your brains out. Lucky for you, with how many jobs there are out there and how incredibly varied the human mind is, chances are you\u2019ll be content in the end. Best of luck to you.",

          "text": "What do u plan to do eventually with the humanities degree! Also I\u2019m glad someone else is in the same boat the world pushes stem degrees so much due to the demand and capitalism valuing us for what\u2019s in demand like we aren\u2019t much more than our work which I hate but yea. Tell me where you plan to land id love to hear about different careers at this time",
