I currently have a big dilema which is that I don't know what major to choose. I know what I would like to study but don't know which majors/minors to chose. I'm interested in studying like music business, but also the entertainment/music culture of different continents like Latin America and Asia. Also should I major in music business or business administration (or have one as a minor)?", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1575067166, "retrieved": 1632848132, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
