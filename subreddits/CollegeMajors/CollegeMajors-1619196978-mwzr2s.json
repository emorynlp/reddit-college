However, I keep hitting dead ends when it comes to potential career paths.    \n\n\nI'm one of those people who can't really do math, so anything in STEM is out for me. I've been told I'm good at writing, and so I am working towards a minor in writing in the hopes that it will help me land a job in my wheelhouse.   \n\n\nI've looked into careers such as publishing, animation writing (though I knew that was doomed from the start), and marketing (too much math), and have found that I either likely wouldn't get paid enough to pay the bills or would be miserable every day. I don't want to be a millionaire, I've just seen the dangers of pursuing a passion without a plan b and have decided that I'd rather play it safe. What careers (and degrees)  would be good with someone who is more of a creative person, but isn't incredible to the point where it's worth it to risk it all? \n\nAnd yes, I know you can switch paths in college, but I have a scholarship at a school I couldn't afford otherwise, and I'm trying not to waste time if possible.   \n\n\nThank you very much for your time!", "author": "tetheredpulse", "created": 1619196978, "retrieved": 1632846590, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyw9d5a": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mwzr2s/struggling_with_choosing_a_major/gyw9d5a/", "text": "Have you looked into anything business related?

I don't ask this to be rude, but there are some majors that require a couple of math classes, but the careers themselves don't use that much math and/or the majors besides those few requirements don't have a ton of math.
