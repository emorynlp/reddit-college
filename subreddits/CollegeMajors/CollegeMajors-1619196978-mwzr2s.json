  "text": "I'm a college student without a major, and I am getting closer to the moment when I have to decide a degree (a semester away, to be exact). However, I keep hitting dead ends when it comes to potential career paths.    \n\n\nI'm one of those people who can't really do math, so anything in STEM is out for me. I've been told I'm good at writing, and so I am working towards a minor in writing in the hopes that it will help me land a job in my wheelhouse.   \n\n\nI've looked into careers such as publishing, animation writing (though I knew that was doomed from the start), and marketing (too much math), and have found that I either likely wouldn't get paid enough to pay the bills or would be miserable every day. I don't want to be a millionaire, I've just seen the dangers of pursuing a passion without a plan b and have decided that I'd rather play it safe. What careers (and degrees)  would be good with someone who is more of a creative person, but isn't incredible to the point where it's worth it to risk it all? \n\nAnd yes, I know you can switch paths in college, but I have a scholarship at a school I couldn't afford otherwise, and I'm trying not to waste time if possible.   \n\n\nThank you very much for your time!",

      "text": "Have you looked into anything business related? Business degrees are very flexible with most employment opportunities. \n\nI'm currently a senior in college with a double major in accounting and finance (math and number suit me better personally). Though business majors kinda get shit on from things like STEM, if everyone had a STEM degree, they would be useless. \n\nTry something public relations based. A corresponding business field would be marketing. If you are looking for something non-business related, look into communications.",

      "text": "How bad at math are you? I don't ask this to be rude, but there are some majors that require a couple of math classes, but the careers themselves don't use that much math and/or the majors besides those few requirements don't have a ton of math. If you are bad at math, but are still decent enough to study a shit ton and pass the few math classes, that could open up a lot more doors, like marketing, as you mentioned. From your post below, marketing seems like it might be a good major, since it allows for a lot of creativity.",

Ideally, I'm looking for something that involves writing and preferably lets me be a little creative.  My issue is that I just don't know what's out there. It's not from lack of research- I do my research, I'm just that type of person that when taking a career quiz gets answers like \"artist\" or \"disc jockey\", you know?",

              "text": "For a start, you want to pursue something employable. Publishing, writing, animation, these are all things you could pursue while maintaining a steady full-time job. Try not to pursue majors based off hobbies, but base them off professional interests instead. Consider the classes you have already excelled in and tie them into a professional career.\n\nI also would not let math intimidate what field you want to break into. Most STEM fields usually require one or two semesters of calculus. For marketing at my school, only one semester of calculus is required. With that said, it isn't for everybody. Just know that math does not make up a majority of the usual science or business major curriculum.",
