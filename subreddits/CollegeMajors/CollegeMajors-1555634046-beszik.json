When I did a project in high school that was supposed to be geared towards what we might do in high school, at the time I was like Muisc! But when I thought of what I could do with a music degree, the only thing that came to mind, was teaching. And honestly I wasn\u2019t thrilled. But I love music so I went with it. Now having been in college and gone through a bit of the degree, I feel like the degree is extremely stressful and more time consuming than majority of other degrees... I have every class I need to graduate planned out and it\u2019s 17-18 credits every quarter... \n\nIn order to cope with my stress though I play soccer because I love it! I love the game and I\u2019m really knowledgeable about how it\u2019s played and the systems and positions and that. But I feel like I don\u2019t have enough time to do: Gen Ed classes-Flute/music things- AND Soccer.... and I honestly don\u2019t know what to do because there isn\u2019t anything out there that I\u2019ve found of some athlete also being involved in arts. \n\nI can\u2019t choose one over the other (music or soccer) I just can\u2019t, I\u2019ve leaned towards one or the other and I also end up missing the one that got put to the side... and I\u2019m not talking about, like I want to get professional at both, I just feel like I can\u2019t even play soccer casually and continue my major... but I\u2019ll feel like a failure if I can\u2019t finish... \n\nI honestly have so much more behind this problem of mine, I\u2019d just love to hear from people who were decently good at both arts and athletics but made a choice or maybe not and what they went through on how to decided. And also I don\u2019t mean soccer to be my \u201cmajor\u201d I just mean idk if I can do this music major thing with soccer.\n\nTLDR:\nF(19) 2nd year in college. I\u2019m currently a Music Ed major in instrumental, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right for me because things I do to keep me healthy both mentally and physically get in the way.", "author": "nosbocaJanaiK", "created": 1555634046, "retrieved": 1632958172, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eld3q85": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/beszik/i_need_the_arts_people_and_athletics_people_to/eld3q85/", "text": "It sounds like you're not thrilled with Music education as a career path and that it would probably be better to change majors. It is totally fine to change your major once you realize it's not worth it for you. Imagine how much happier and less stressed you can be if you can pursue both soccer and music casually.", "author": "puffy-jacket", "created": 1555782749, "upvotes": 1}}}
