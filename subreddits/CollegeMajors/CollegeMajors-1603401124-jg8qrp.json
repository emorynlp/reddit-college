  "title:": "What should I major in?/Any college advice?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior and I have been feeling very overwhelmed by college lately. I have always enjoyed learning and I would say I\u2019m a diligent student. Despite taking 9 AP classes, receiving a 4.0 unweighted GPA, and taking a multitude of extracurriculars with leadership positions I have not been able to narrow down what I want to pursue. My friends have all decided their careers and majors while I feel very stuck and afraid of the future. I\u2019m the oldest in my family and most of my family has not attended college so I don\u2019t know much about college careers and majors. My main goal in college is to find a stable career with good pay that I love. \n\nHere\u2019s how I feel about most majors/subjects:\n\nEnglish: Usually my best class but I don\u2019t see myself enjoying any majors revolving around journalism or any other writing.\n\nMath: I\u2019d say I\u2019m above average at math, I really like my current AP stat class and I pick up concepts quick but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d love it as much in college. I liked Pre-Calc and Geometry but I honestly don\u2019t enjoy Algebra.\n\nEducation: My mom is a teacher which has made me pretty sure I don\u2019t want to be a teacher.\n\nSciences: I always loved the approach and ideas of science but I definitely struggle with some of the concepts especially in physics (but my high school has an awful science program). I do love environmental science but I don\u2019t see this as a sustainable career funnily enough. I did pretty good in Chemistry but Biology was not my favorite.\n\nHistory: History has always been a favorite of mine, especially world history, and lately I have come to love my AP gov class yet I\u2019m not sure how good I\u2019d be at law school. Yet again I don\u2019t see myself teaching so I\u2019m not sure of good career paths for this subject.\n\nMusic: Probably the subject I\u2019m most passionate about. I\u2019d consider being a music major if my family wasn\u2019t against it. I play oboe, clarinet, bass guitar, and some piano on the side. I definitely see myself continuing music no matter what I major in.\n\nMore info:\nI love music and I\u2019m considering possibly taking a minor in Performance to teach private lessons on the side of my normal career (I play oboe). Is this a good idea?\n\nI have been considering Psychology/Psychiatry but I have heard these job markets are extremely competitive and I want to have an ensured career.\n\nUpdate 11/6/20: Currently applying to schools with different majors. I have decided I\u2019m going to double major in music with another major of Statistics, Poli Sci, or Public Health depending on the school.\n\nSorry this is so lengthy! All advice and questions are welcome!! Thank you :)",

      "text": "I would look into data science and maybe even epidemiology if you like stats and science. You also mentioned you liked your gov class so maybe look into poli sci (although that does have quite a bit of writing) or combine stats and gov into political data analytics (it's not a common major but some schools have it).\n\nHonestly my advice is just to explore your interests during your first year in college, join classes that are in the realm of your interests and talk to a career advisor, they may give you ideas for a major or career you never thought of.\n\nAnd as for music, yes definitely pursue a minor if you're passionate about it!",

          "text": "Thank you so much, this helped a lot! Epidemiology sounds very interesting! I never really considered a poli sci major but this sounds like a great idea that I will consider. I definitely think I\u2019m going to minor in music no matter what now. I have one more question, should I enter college with a major I\u2019m interested in and then switch later (if i chose to) or is it better to enter undecided? Again, thank you so much for your help!",

              "text": "I would enter with a major declared and then switch later. Some schools have prereq classes required to switch majors or they may have majors that are capped and that can make it harder to switch majors when undecided. Also you'd be able to get a jump on some classes for your major just in case you dont switch so you dont fall behind while also exploring other interests through ge classes.",
