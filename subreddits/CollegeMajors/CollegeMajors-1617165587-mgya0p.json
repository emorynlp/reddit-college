Training Programs", "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI am graduating next month with a degree in philosophy/journalism minor. I was originally pre law, hence the degree choice. After doing a ton of legal internships etc I dont want to pursue law.\n\nMy degree isn't going to offer good job prospects. I want to go into something in the tech world or healthcare. I dont mind going back to school but would prefer a program that is a few months in duration or a job that offers on the job training.\n\nI was looking into IT bootcamps are they legit? I dont want to waste more time or money on something that won't guarantee a career or a job. Any ideas would be appreciated thanks. <3", "author": "ma18L_", "created": 1617165587, "retrieved": 1632958560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gt1g7wa": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mgya0p/it_training_programs/gt1g7wa/", "text": "i would like to know the legit of the IT certs that we can receive and get a job", "author": "jin_kaos", "created": 1617290776, "upvotes": 1}}}
