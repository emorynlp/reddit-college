However, I\u2018ve been exploring the idea of majoring in biology. No, I do not want to do biology for the pre-med route.\n\nWould I have any luck in becoming a biologist or a related field with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology? What job opportunities would I have with a degree in biology? Thank you.", "author": "swofozu", "created": 1614561836, "retrieved": 1632846989, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gpb3h58": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/luw8mb/is_a_degree_in_biology_worth_it/gpb3h58/", "text": "You either need a masters or a double major.
