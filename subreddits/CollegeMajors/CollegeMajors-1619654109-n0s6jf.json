I\u2019m a underclass man with no idea what she wants to do for a career, or at least not a huge idea. I am very interested in the sciences, history and english (I wanted to be an english or language teacher once), math isn\u2019t my forte but I try my best at it.\nThe current majors listed are ones I am interested in, ordered from most interested to least.\n\nAnthropology (Archaeology, biological, cultural),\nNeuroscience,\nEnvironmental science,\nPsychology (bio, cognitive, educational),\nBiomedical sciences,\nand Ecology\n\nAnyone with experience in these majors give me a rundown of each with their experience or pros and cons? I am also curious what careers I could get with them, or if it\u2019s even worth getting them as majors.\nThank you!", "author": null, "created": 1619654109, "retrieved": 1632846584, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gwijck6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n0s6jf/hs_student_in_need_of_future_majorminor_career/gwijck6/", "text": "I know that Psychology will have it's fair share of stats in it, so if math isn't your forte be prepared for that going in.\n\nAs a math major I can't speak to anything specifically but it appears you have two general areas of interest: Earth sciences and \"People sciences\", to greatly oversimplify. Luckily for you, these areas will have a non-negligible overlap in biology. \n\nMy recommendation would be to not declare your major immediately (Plenty of people don't) and to use your freshman year to take some biology, geology/geography/earth sciences, and see what you like. There's no rush to define your future, and you're gonna be spending some time in GE regardless of what you choose", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1619849214, "upvotes": 2}, "gwa2h2r": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n0s6jf/hs_student_in_need_of_future_majorminor_career/gwa2h2r/", "text": "My advice is to think about which jobs you can really see yourself doing, then research them. Look for average salary, job market and work-life balance. Look up reviews on job sites like Glassdoor or Indeed to see which skills and qualifications employers look for as well as reviews from previous and current employees who can give you a glimpse into those jobs. \n\nAlso, try to teach yourself as much as you can about the subject you decide on because a lot of university professors aren't that great at teaching. Universities will charge you an arm and a leg for you to teach yourself in a rush to just to pass quizzes on a deadline. \n\nLastly, look for jobs that have good job markets. You don't want to pay thousands just to find out that no one is hiring for your specific field or that most of the jobs don't pay well.", "author": "flawedgawd", "created": 1619690835, "upvotes": 3}}}
