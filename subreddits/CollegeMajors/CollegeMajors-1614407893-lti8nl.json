I went into college thinking I wanted to do nursing but after working in the field I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. Now I don\u2019t know what I want to do. I love culture, learning foreign languages, history, and biology. I\u2019m really good at memorization and have always been. I am a humanitarian at heart, but I also want to make money and I really don\u2019t where to go with any of my skills. Any advice would be most appreciated and very helpful. Thank you all.", "author": "Ariel33245", "created": 1614407893, "retrieved": 1632956784, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gp3sf2s": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lti8nl/advice_on_a_major/gp3sf2s/", "text": "I agree with the other commenter - I think public health might be a good choice of career. You already have experience in it, it seems to involve some of your interests/goals (biology, culture, helping people), and it's definitely a big field with a lot of opportunity for stable careers. I can't say exactly what kind of jobs are available, but I think it might be something to consider.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1614474317, "upvotes": 2}, "gozam7w": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lti8nl/advice_on_a_major/gozam7w/", "text": "The best major out of all of them in my opinion is Computer Science.

The Public Health major esp. could let you study biology ~and~ help people without entering nursing. Not sure about this since I\u2019m not an expert, but I\u2019d venture that as the medical field grows in the next few decades, plenty of jobs on the admin/community/policy side of medicine will open up, too.", "author": "aphrodite727", "created": 1614414618, "upvotes": 4}, "goyhalu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lti8nl/advice_on_a_major/goyhalu/", "text": "Have you considered being a professor?
