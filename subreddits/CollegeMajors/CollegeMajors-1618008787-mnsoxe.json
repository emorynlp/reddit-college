I would love to know what your experiences are and see if anyone changed their minds on careers/majors because of this situation. I know that I certainly did! I was a business major and because of seeing how this virus affected businesses overall, I decided to change my major. I was thinking of Psychology (Mental health is important, but I realized I didn't want to go into research or be a counselor) or Computer Science or Speech-Pathology. Then I decided to finally choose speech pathology because I realized that I want to help and make others happy. Also, I love talking with people. <3 Plus, there is a lot of variety in this field and a great demand.", "author": "Superb-Disk-8202", "created": 1618008787, "retrieved": 1632956738, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"gu5v0nf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mnsoxe/students_did_you_change_your_mind_on/gu5v0nf/", "text": "I thought about it, but ended up not.

I've seen many people switch into my major (Public Health) to learn health/medicine/epidemiology/psychology/nursing/biology courses to improve lives! Good on you and them!\n\nBut myself? I'm slightly different. Though I still remain a Public Health major, I actually started an Entrepreneurship minor (it's a business minor).\n\nI started taking the business courses, cuz to me, when the world f\\*cked itself, ppl didn't know what to think or who to listen to (thanks politics + social media). If we lived in a perfect world, **science** *by itself* could change the way people think. I totally advocate for STEM, but me seeing it wasn't enough to make these anti-maskers to f\\*cking listen, I realized *my own* truth.....***I JUST WANNA MAKE A SH\\*T TON of money and be the master of my own destiny.*** Ideally, I'd start my own innovative, biotechnology or telemedicine startup and be the CEO (that's why I want business skills) and be as **rich** as humanly possible, cuz **MONEY is what makes ppl listen... whether we know it or not. This way, I can REALLY** ***REALLY*** **help people help themselves.**\n\nEven if I don't become the Elon Musk (or Lex Luthor) of biotechnology/telemedicine (lmao), I'd much prefer being a self-sustaining business entrepreneur doing whatever the f\\*ck I want while my health colleagues go play super hero in healthcare settings. (no slander to health professionals doh! I love them! But I love myself more). (I do, however, slander pure business ppl with no mind or love of health or science...aka Wall Street)\n\nHow come I think this? Because, while everyone is doing online school, they've stayed in 1 house, 1 city... meanwhile, I've stayed in various states/cities, traveling a lot (responsibly) throughout COVID cuz my parents are self-employed entrepreneurs who actually have the f\\*cking time to travel while still making money (my parents aren't college-educated or have \"connections\". They grew up really poor, english wasn't even their 1st language, but they're really street-smart ...and no, they're **not** illegal business lmao...just smart business), unlike ppl whose parents been working 9-5 since they graduated college.\n\nSorry if I sound like a crazy or entitled person...I'm just a 19 yr. old crazy entitled idealist, that's all xD.
