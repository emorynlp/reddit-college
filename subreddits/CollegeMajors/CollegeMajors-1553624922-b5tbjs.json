      "text": "Have you considered a field science like Archaeology? That hits nearly every interest you have apart from working with animals and the thrift store aspect. I wanted a major that had many of your interests, and I've gotten that multiples times over. \n\nAlthough lab work is a part of any science, most of fieldwork occurs in the great outdoors. Contrary to popular belief, archaeology is almost entirely survey based, rather than excavation based, so you get a lot of hiking in during most of your time scouring to complete projects. Photography is also a principle part of any project, and you can get pretty creative with the sketches and maps of objects and locations that we have to keep detailed notes of. There is a lot of math, but it's purely trigonometry and geometry, so nothing crazy. The work we do has plenty of variety, and it's always cool to see and do something new out in the field.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about it if you want! You don't have to, but it sounds up your alley!",

          "text": "Thats interesting, thanks for the advice. My first year of college I took anthropology 101, and kind of found it interesting (thought I might major in it).. I have gone over what I might want to do, from criminal justice, to graphic design, architecture, just not sure. I do know I don't want the typical 9 to 5 job, which I think a lot of people don't really want, but have to. If you can tell me a little be more about the aspects of what you majored in and career paths, I would love to hear it. The only aspect I have always hear about anthropology majors is the need to get a masters, not just a bachelors, and there isn't many jobs offered anymore. Also, I have taken the math up right until calculus, so I should be good on that front. ",

              "text": "Yes, it\u2019s generally suggested that at some point you should get a Masters, but there is still plenty of work to be done with only a bachelors. Heck, I even know a guy who only has an associates that\u2019s been doing stuff for a local firm. \n\nHowever, the amount of work and qualifications depend on your area. While archaeology is legally required everywhere because of multiple federal laws mandating so, the biggest presence is within less developed states that are quickly expanding. For example, I\u2019m located in the Southwest US, so job opportunities are common down here. \n\nMost work is privatized through Cultural Resource Management firms, which is where 90% of all archaeologists work today. These firms get contracted out by the local or federal government, and so projects are pretty common in developing areas. With a bachelors, you can get hired on as a field technician and can work your way up to crew chief at a CRM firm. Once you get to that point, a Masters may be required to advance, but it\u2019s not always the case. However, opportunities will be limited without it, but some people get along just fine. \n\nIf you do want to pursue it, you\u2019ll need to take a field school of some sort to learn the ropes of the trade. It\u2019s not really required, but it\u2019s uncommon to not have experience at one. \n\n",

                      "text": "I just checked it out, and it seems fairly typical for a general Anthropology major. You have plenty of room to tweak it how you want. I also saw that it requires a Lab/Field credit, although I couldn\u2019t find one in your course catalog. You had a class that seemed to be field work oriented, but it seemed that hands on stuff was second, so no clue if that actually warrants working on a site. \n\nI do know that the head of the Anthropology Department there is a notable Mimbres Field Archaeologist, which is personally exciting for me. A few of my professors actually know her, and have talked highly of her. \n\nSo, your program looks good apart from maybe not having a field school, and you\u2019re probably in a good area to find employment, assuming you live in Nevada. I\u2019m stationed in Arizona, so you\u2019re quite close, although technically in a different prehistoric zone than me. If you decide to go through with this, I highly recommend emailing some of the archaeology staff and inquiring about possibly majoring in that. There, they can help run you through a good fit for you. \n\nDo you have any interest in the past and with a specific area of the globe? Or just with humans in general?",

Check to see if there are field schools in those areas as well, as that\u2019ll give you a good grapple on basic artifacts. I don\u2019t know how much Archaeology is in either, but I do know the main focus of many of the digs in Florida is regarding the Spanish Colonial Period. \n\nCheck out Kathleen Deagan. She\u2019s retired now, but she\u2019s a major figure in the Spanish Colonial History of Florida. Her specialization is disenfranchised groups of the period. As for the Pacific Northwest, I know very little. All I know is their use of totemic structures and that many of the contemporary groups of the Southwest migrated from there. \n\nPM me if you need more help, you have a good school I believe, so that gives you a good chance.
