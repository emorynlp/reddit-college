That hits nearly every interest you have apart from working with animals and the thrift store aspect. I wanted a major that had many of your interests, and I've gotten that multiples times over. \n\nAlthough lab work is a part of any science, most of fieldwork occurs in the great outdoors. Contrary to popular belief, archaeology is almost entirely survey based, rather than excavation based, so you get a lot of hiking in during most of your time scouring to complete projects. Photography is also a principle part of any project, and you can get pretty creative with the sketches and maps of objects and locations that we have to keep detailed notes of. There is a lot of math, but it's purely trigonometry and geometry, so nothing crazy. The work we do has plenty of variety, and it's always cool to see and do something new out in the field.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about it if you want!
