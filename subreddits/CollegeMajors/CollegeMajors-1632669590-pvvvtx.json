It\u2019s always been my dream to help people in any way I can. Psychology interests me too, but I\u2019m worried about getting a psych degree because if I\u2019m too burnt out to get a PhD I\u2019m stuck with pretty much no job. I don\u2019t want to be a lab person either. I\u2019m planning on potentially joining the healthcare field, but in case that doesn\u2019t work out I want a major that gets me a decent job after 4 years (I can\u2019t do biomedical engineering because there\u2019s a whole transfer process for engineers and that will take away a year of my time). Any advice would be appreciated!", "author": "SatisfactionOk6367", "created": 1632669590, "retrieved": 1632958196, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hedxatw": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pvvvtx/which_major_should_i_pick/hedxatw/", "text": "Have you considered Biochemistry? Also, if it takes a year to transfer over, you can still work on the classes for the first year of Biomedical Engineering which should be close to Biochemistry's first two years, you'll have a few classes in Biomedical Engineering to add ok top of that. \n\nI will say, the healthcare field is very broad and BME will be making devices to be used on procedures, training and patient monitoring. I worked at a tissue bank over the summer and the BME there worked with two MechE and mostly worked on package design, process optimization and rarely worked on creating new products, that was R&D's job, they typically had PhDs in Bio and Biochem, none of them were engineers. \n\nIf you want to be a doctor, then a lot of majors will work, I think I heard somewhere that Chem, Phys and Biochem majors tended to do the best on entrance exams. I don't know almost anything about med school, just that it's long.\n\nIf you want to be a nurse, get a nursing degree.\n\nAvoid Medical Lab Science degrees because they work in labs almost exclusively, I'm not going to say exclusively just in case there's that one person working somewhere else. \n\nIf you don't know what yet, I'd say biochem and prep to switch to BME by taking the required classes in the first two years. And since you like Psych, minor in it. If you do engineering that'll be difficult since engineering tends to give you no outside electives, but if you like it and want to do it, then do it.", "author": "Eteranl96", "created": 1632686024, "upvotes": 2}}}
