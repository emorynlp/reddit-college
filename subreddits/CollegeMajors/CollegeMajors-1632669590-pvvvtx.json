  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m interested in science (biology and chemistry, heck no to physics) and helping people. It\u2019s always been my dream to help people in any way I can. Psychology interests me too, but I\u2019m worried about getting a psych degree because if I\u2019m too burnt out to get a PhD I\u2019m stuck with pretty much no job. I don\u2019t want to be a lab person either. I\u2019m planning on potentially joining the healthcare field, but in case that doesn\u2019t work out I want a major that gets me a decent job after 4 years (I can\u2019t do biomedical engineering because there\u2019s a whole transfer process for engineers and that will take away a year of my time). Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "text": "Have you considered Biochemistry? Also, if it takes a year to transfer over, you can still work on the classes for the first year of Biomedical Engineering which should be close to Biochemistry's first two years, you'll have a few classes in Biomedical Engineering to add ok top of that. \n\nI will say, the healthcare field is very broad and BME will be making devices to be used on procedures, training and patient monitoring. I worked at a tissue bank over the summer and the BME there worked with two MechE and mostly worked on package design, process optimization and rarely worked on creating new products, that was R&D's job, they typically had PhDs in Bio and Biochem, none of them were engineers. \n\nIf you want to be a doctor, then a lot of majors will work, I think I heard somewhere that Chem, Phys and Biochem majors tended to do the best on entrance exams. I don't know almost anything about med school, just that it's long.\n\nIf you want to be a nurse, get a nursing degree.\n\nAvoid Medical Lab Science degrees because they work in labs almost exclusively, I'm not going to say exclusively just in case there's that one person working somewhere else. \n\nIf you don't know what yet, I'd say biochem and prep to switch to BME by taking the required classes in the first two years. And since you like Psych, minor in it. If you do engineering that'll be difficult since engineering tends to give you no outside electives, but if you like it and want to do it, then do it.",

              "text": "Biochem, Chem, Physics, Engineering and most computational or math degrees are really difficult majors and tend to have lower GPAs, high GPAs will go to super hard workers. Biochem is mostly in the lab, but it has better job prospects than Chem and Biology. If you want lower difficulty, outside of a lab and avoiding engineering, go biology. Biology is still difficult, but less physics and more out of the lab(you can still work in a lab if you want). Job prospects are generally lower pay, but Biology has more diverse job options. I think Biology takes up to Calc 1, but takes more stats classes. Biochem and Chem take up to Calc 3.\n\nEngineering isn't a last resort, it's tough work and it's not easy to pick up suddenly. If you aren't fond of it, don't consider it because it'll be suffering to do something really difficult that you don't like.\n\nAlso, I forgot to say it, but taking longer than 4 years on a bachelor's isn't horrible to do. Ideally avoid it, but 5 or 6 years isn't awful. If you are taking out loans it's a different story, but that entirely depends how much you're taking out per year. I'm taking out 15k per year, my friend is taking out 2k per year.",

Major choice doesn\u2019t matter that much compared to research, rec letters, and MCAT score.\n\nBut speaking of physics\u2026 did you know Physics majors make the highest MCAT scores, along with Math and Econ majors?  Did you know that Bio majors are among the lowest?  Did you know that about half of all Physics applicants get into med school, compared to about a third of Bio and Psych majors?\n\nhttps://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-major\n\nhttps://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/undergrad/mcat-lsat1.pdf\n\nhttps://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/the-best-pre-med-major-backed-by-med-school-acceptance-data/\n\nGoogle \u2018MCAT scores by major\u2019\n\n(Just doing some good-natured trolling to stick up for my physics homies \ud83d\ude04)",
