  "title:": "Is a physics major right for me?",
  "text": "I'll be starting school in January as a junior (went to community college because I didn't know what I wanted to do), as I've taken a marked interest in neuroscience and psychology and the nature of consciousness.\n\nIntuitively, it would make the most sense to study neuro, since I want to study the brain; but, quantum physics and computing are becoming more salient in the field of neuroscience. For that reason, I was thinking I would do well to study physics now, and apply that knowledge to neuroscientific research in post-grad.\n\nDoes this plan make sense? I am open to a double major as well, but I'm really not sure if that would be most efficient (time and $) since there is not much overlap between physics and neuroscience classes at my university.",
