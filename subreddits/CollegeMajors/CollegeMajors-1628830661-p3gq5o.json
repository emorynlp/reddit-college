I would like to know whether an aerospace major comprising of topics related to dynamics as well as structures will be more useful to gain a better understanding in multi agent system specific to aerospace application. Or a major in systems and control that deals with optimization of multi agent system will be more fruitful.   \nI would surely like to work in an aerospace related industry but not sure which path will be more secure in terms of job security as well as learning curve.  \n\nLet me know your thoughts and PM if someone is working on a similar topic, your guidance will be highly appreciated.", "author": "X_Photon_X", "created": 1628830661, "retrieved": 1632958021, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
