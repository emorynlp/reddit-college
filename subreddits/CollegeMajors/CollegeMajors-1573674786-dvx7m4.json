      "text": "I don\u2019t know how your school does it, but a B.A. in Economics at my school only requires Calculus I and an Intro Statistics course (whereas the B.S. requires Calculus II & III and recommends even more).\n\nI feel like Economics is a field where you can get so much out of if you develop the mathematics, but to each their own. All you\u2019ll need is differential calculus (taking derivatives, finding limits, basic optimization, etc.)\n\nThe intermediate coursework will actually use the calculus concepts (whereas intro doesn\u2019t), and advanced coursework is optional. This seems to be the case for most colleges.",
