Currently have one class left before I finish. I plan to major in computer science after finishing my certificate first. I chose Computer Science because I like computers and technology.\n\nI initially planned to get my associates degree in computer science after I finish my certificate while I am in community college but over time, I started having doubts about getting a computer science degree because I was having trouble learning the programming language and doubts about myself being able to complete a computer science degree.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas for what I should major in? I am considering doing something that is related to technology and computers.", "author": "Due-Half-5197", "created": 1629755582, "retrieved": 1632957408, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"ha37rk9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pa9qec/considering_choosing_a_different_major_after_i/ha37rk9/", "text": "It\u2019s normal to struggle with programming.

If you like math, maybe try data science. \n\nThe good news for you is that everyone is going to have to work with computers and technology in their career. The question is just to what extent.", "author": "slouchingbethlehem", "created": 1629757388, "upvotes": 3}}}
