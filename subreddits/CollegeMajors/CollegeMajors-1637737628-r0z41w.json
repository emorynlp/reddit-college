  "text": "My mental health has taken a massive decline and I'm starting to crack under the pressure. I know that my major is something that interests me and is something I love, but seeing how my first semester has gone I'm feeling discouraged. I'm also worried that I won't be able to work a job that I want to. Ideally I would really love to work in a lab, with my main STEM interests being in environmental science, forensics, and toxicology. I love seeing the relationships between things, and I'm not sure what I would do if I couldn't graduate with my major.\n\nThere's part of me that wants to transfer to Ringling and get a BA in illustration or game design, but I worry about not being able to find a job. My parents really push that \"art is a great *hobby*\" since my aunt got an art degree and couldn't find work for it. It's soul crushing to have my passion dampened because of how people perceive my intelligence, how if I got an art degree all of my \"smarts\" would be \"wasted.\" I don't know what I want anymore.\n\nI don't know what I'll do if I can't survive at my current school. I'm having issues seeing into my future. Any and all advice is appreciated; thank you for reading.",

      "text": "This is gonna be so long, I apologize in advance. \n\nSo first of all, in my unprofessional opinion your Mental Health should come above all else. My greatest recommendation is to reach out and communicate with others. Talk to friends. I guarantee you others in your major are experiencing these same struggles. Sometimes they just hide it, and that's because they feel a lot like you might feel, that they are the only ones struggling and so they just try to hide it to fit in. But I suggest you talk about this. AND TALK TO YOUR PARENTS AND THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY! FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE USUALLY YOUR GREATEST ASSETS! IF NOT THEM, TALK TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST! Above all, talk to people. Be open about this! If your College has MH services, don't be afraid to talk to them. This struggle is not one you have to take all on your own. Talking to others, asking for help, being open, and even struggling itself are never anything to be ashamed of. These are all normal aspects of the College experience and completely okay! \n\nIf I understand correctly, this is your first semester at College. If it helps, I'll tell you briefly about my first semester. For me, it was a whirlwind. I had just finished as the top student in my High School class and went to state school thinking I had chosen a path where as long as I kept working hard I could easily scoot thru on my way to checking the boxes on all of my dreams. Well, not so true. In my first semester, I failed classes one after the other, dropped more than I ever could have imagined and finished with 8 credits completed of the 18 credits I started with, and a 2.9 or so GPA which after my High School days was a big shock to me. \n\nSome of the best advice I ever received in my own situation came from a professor of Engineering Calculus. As I'd walked in to his office to ask his opinion on whether or not I should drop his class he kindly and gently said to me. \"You know what's going on right now is your on a plane and it's going to crash. Now, it just so happens that on this plane there are parachutes. Enough for everyone. And there's nothing wrong with you grabbing that parachute. It doesn't make you a bad pilot. In fact, it would be pretty stupid not to. Grab that parachute, learn from this, and live on to fly another day.\"\n\nNow, all of this is a little different from your situation. As I understand you are not necessarily failing academically, but you're struggling under the pressure. So it's a bit different but the big reason I tell you my story is to suggest that there are so many people who get to College and struggle. And it doesn't make you not smart or any less capable. In my own situation, I learned a lot about myself and learned that I was not infallible but that it was okay to struggle, and I came to a greater appreciation for the process and just doing my best. I did make some changes. Eventually, I decided in my case that I would transfer schools, and I did change majors to follow my interests but I did not change my long term career goals at that time. Overall, I completed my degree and was able to reasonably recover my GPA. And hell, it wasn't even the last time I struggled. Organic Chemistry in my third and fourth years was rough, but you know I think that some of my first semester struggles played a role in helping me thru even that. \n\nSo, a few takeaways that I want to point out:\n\n(1) It is okay to struggle\n(2) Just because you are struggling does not mean you are not cut out for or not right for what you are trying to do.\n(3) I personally think it is okay to follow your passions, but also to stay the course and not let the struggle derail you if you are already pursuing your passion (in other words if art is really it for you that's awesome, but if your science major is it for you that's awesome too - just because your struggling now if your passionate about your current major the struggle shouldn't be a reason for you not to pursue your passion if it is what you really want)\n(4) College is a time of learning and times that you struggled thru can be something you look back on in the future.\n(5) It's always okay to ask for help. Especially with mental help. It's always okay to talk to people you trust, and always okay if you need to talk to someone who is trained to help with mental health! Like My Calc Professor said, 'It's not wrong to grab the parachute. It'd be silly not to!' \n\nOnce again I just want to reiterate the importance of talking to others and/or pursuing the help of someone trained to help with mental health if that is what you need. Remember again how I said that I was so shocked at how hard I failed in my first semester. I was so embarrassed at the time that I didn't talk to nearly anyone about it. I came to find out later that many, many kids were. We really should have talked to each other. But we were all just to embarrassed, and we shouldn't have been. So please talk to people you trust, your parents, your family especially! And if you're mental health is struggling don't be afraid to pursue professional help! I recommend talking to your parents to start or to someone you trust. And many schools now days offer programs and that can make it much more financially approachable. \n\nI wish you the very best of luck!!",

      "text": "What's your major & what exactly went wrong this semester? Failing all your classes or just not understanding everything as well as you wanted?\n\n& I understand yours parents' hesitancy. I don't know much about design or art, but the college of design is the only school that restricts admissions at my university. I assume it's to try to keep a bunch of students from getting a degree that may already be oversaturated. I know a lot more jobs for STEM than I do art, but I'm also in STEM, so biased. \n\nA solution depends on your exact problem(s) which you haven't described, but one thing you could do is take an art class or two next semester to split your time between your STEM major & exploring art. I'd also dive into what jobs you think you would work, the demand for them, & what qualifications look like. That'll help put into focus how viable your degree or potential degree is for work.\n\nAlso, life sucks. I know it's impossible to expect 18 year olds to know wtf they want to do for the rest of their lives. At least half of my high school classmates changed their major, some twice. It's normal. You're also most likely gonna have to work a job as an adult & they're not all fun. Most people are lucky to find one with good benefits that they can tolerate. Your free time is for fun & social relationships. Work can suck. \n\n*insert r/antiwork but that's neither here nor there. Best of luck",

          "text": "My current major is Environmental Health Science, and I'd say what went wrong was a class I was succeeding in hit me with 2 very difficult assignments and I couldnt balance those with my other courses, so my grade has dropped to a level where I'm not sure I'll pass even if I get a 100 on the final, which is very stressful to me.\nI'm definitely trying to get into an art class just to get back into my groove, and  try to see if I could possibly double major art and ENHS. I'm open to change, and of course I worry that whatever I pursue won't be enough (make enough money or bring me enough satisfaction)\n\nThank you so much for your response, I can't begin to explain how grateful I am. \ud83d\udc95",

Learn from it & grow. I have the pro/con of no family support so I don't have to worry about pleasing them but I understand if it is in your case. Just know & explain to yourself or others this is okay & normal. You can pick up yourself.\n\nSee if your college doesn't have mental counselors or career counselors. I don't know what job I'll have exactly when (if) I graduate, but I know some will exist & I can apply for them. Just look around career statistics & see if you can't shadow or intern someplace you're interested in.",

      "text": "First of all, I'm sorry you're going through this. I went through a very similar thing myself. College takes adjustment and it doesn't always come easy. \n\nI'll share a bit of my personal story:\n\nI majored in mechanical engineering and my first semester was a disaster. I failed two courses including the first math class and I didn't perform well in the courses I did pass. Coming from straight A's my whole life, I felt like a failure and I legitimately considered quitting. My mental health was not in good shape. I also wanted to study some kind of art which made me question a lot of things. In my case it was music because I'm really into guitar. The thing that stopped me was what you mentioned, the fear of not finding a job. I decided to stick it out and keep trying. It took me several semesters but by learning from mistakes and making adjustments, I eventually got into a rhythm and my grades improved a lot. I eventually graduated and I am currently working while pursuing a second degree. Trust me, you can absolutely do it as well. \n\nThe thing that always concerns me about art degrees is that generally speaking, in art, as opposed to many other careers, you don't need a degree to do it and many never bother to get one while still being very successful at it. Going to school for art is good for two things: learning and networking, both of which are not exclusive to school, it's just easier to do it there. There are many people that graduate and expect to have a much easier time finding a career but unfortunately, it's not enough. There's plenty of luck involved but mostly it's a matter of working really hard and creating a portfolio of work that you can show people to hopefully get hired for something. There is always the possibility that studying art will lead you down a path of tremendous success but you have to weigh it against the consequences of that not being the case at all. Only you can make that decision. \n\n\nDo I regret not studying art? Not at all because I never gave up on it. Art is still a huge part of my life. I eventually realized that you don't have to give up on one for the other. I kept learning from any resource I could find. I took all the music electives my university offered, I joined a band, I participated in music related extracurriculars, I taught guitar lessons and many other things. Learning about manufacturing through engineering got me interested in making things and I eventually set up a workshop for building guitars. After making several guitars on my own, people started commissioning some. I have more plans on how I'll combine engineering with my love for guitars and my end goal is to make a business out of it. My point is your passion doesn't have to go away because your major is something else. In fact, it might even play a role in how that passion develops and it may take you down a path you never even imagined. \n\n\nHere's what I would do in your situation:\n\nIf you enjoy your major, you like where your major is going to lead you and you have a really good probability to find a career in that field, I would stay there. If you're having trouble with your grades, that's ok and it will get better as long as you're willing to put in the work. Also, don't feel bad about asking for help. We all need it from time to time. \n\nDo not give up on your passions though. I really want to emphasize that. You mentioned you're interested in game design. There are tons and tons of resources online for learning programming and game design. You can learn on your own and make games as a hobby and eventually you might have some games that you can release. Maybe one of those games will attract a company's attention and they might offer you a job. Or maybe one of those games will blow up and you'll form your own game company. You just never know what could happen. Doing it as just a hobby can be very satisfying too. \n\n\nI hope that helps and I hope you understand that what you're going through is normal and many people go through it. You're barely getting started and making these decisions can be daunting. Just know that as long as you work hard and work smart, everything will be ok. Even if you have some stumbles along the way, you can always recover.",
