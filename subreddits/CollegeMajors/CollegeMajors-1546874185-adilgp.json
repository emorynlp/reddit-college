My current goal with this major is to become a physical therapist. The problem is I am starting to doubt if this is something I would truly enjoy or if I just choose this path because it is high paying and that there are jobs for it. My other option is something totally opposite which is a career in the arts as something like an animator or something else that deals with visual effects. I also like the idea of being a concept artist or painter, but these are obviously very different.\n\nSo for some background info:\n\nEver since I was a kid I always wanted to be an artist. This was what I had in my head that I would be doing as a future career before I was even old enough to understand what went into such a decision. I would always draw when I was younger and have always considered myself a creative person. I even tried to teach myself some coding. As I got older I also discovered deviant art but spent more time browsing art instead of making art. I was in awe by what other people were able to create but for some reason did not believe I could ever be capable of doing the same. I also purchased a digital tablet and attempted to teach myself digital art, but I feel like as time went on my motivation and patience to teach myself and make art decreased. I have also been very interested in film/tv and can't simply watch a movie without wondering how the special effects were created or making comments about certain details that whoever I was watching it with said they never noticed. When I got to high school, I completely stopped making art and focused more on playing sports which I also loved but did not continue after high school. As I graduated high school and applied to colleges, I was not sure of what I wanted to do, but I found myself taking an intro animation course my first semester as I decided I wanted to become an animator. What upsets me is that I found the course very challenging and that I did not enjoy it, maybe partly because I felt like I did not fit in with all of the other people in my class. Everyone else in my class was I guess you could say the antisocial/socially awkward type who only talked about Pok\u00e9mon go and anime. I have nothing against this at all, it is just I felt like I could not relate to them in those aspects, and being someone who has always been shy and had some social anxiety, I tend to function better around extroverts as they \"bring me out of my shell\" if that makes sense.\n\nSo I think it was a combination of the class not being what I expected, along with the notion that maybe I needed to find myself a more practical major with more job security. I had roommates who were studio art majors who's parents were paying for their school and was both jealous and confused as to what they planned to do with their degrees. I also have an interest in science, nutrition, and exercise, so I guess that is why I was then drawn to exercise science as a major. I took an intro course and liked it well enough, and even though I did not know specifically what I wanted to do, I knew there were a couple of different options with this degree and that I could just figure it out later. My parents also helped to reinforce this idea that I could pursue art as a hobby while having a well paying job were you can help people.\n\nFast forward to now, I have for the most part been sure about my decision to major in exercise science because I have always been told that \"a job is a job\" and that my parents are doing just fine with their normal jobs, but in the back of my mind I still have this feeling that I am not making the right decision. I will literally spend time watching youtube videos about the behind the scenes of my favorite shows and how they make the special effects, and I often feel immensely jealous of those who were lucky enough to make a career out of making art. But I am also confused because I have not drawn in years and have no motivation to (probably out of my own laziness/depression/whatever). So basically I am confused as to if this is coming from me just having a great appreciation of art and acknowledging the fact that film/tv/art is able to make me feel things, or if I really should switch back to my original plan of becoming some sort of animator/visual artist. I do like the idea of being able to create things that can evoke the same emotions in other people as they have in me. But at the same time I feel like maybe it is selfish to want to be some sort of artist because being a physical therapist helps people whereas you make art because it's something you enjoy. I do know that physical therapy school is hard and hard to get into but I still feel like knowing that it pays well and that there are jobs out there is much less stressful than wanting to pursue a career where you might not make it, even if physical therapy may bore me. I also feel bad about myself because my younger sister who's still in high school wants to do something similar (game design) but the only difference between her and me is that she makes herself draw everyday and is now trying to teach herself coding and digital art, and obviously has a better drive and work ethic.\n\nI should also mention that I am paying for college myself and don't know if it's worth going into more debt changing majors when I am almost finished with my degree.\n\nTL;DR: Can't decide if I should finish my degree in exercise science and become a physical therapist or pursue my dream of becoming an artist/animator even though they are opposite careers.", "author": null, "created": 1546874185, "retrieved": 1632956990, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"edhjcxb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/adilgp/torn_between_finishing_degree_in_science_or/edhjcxb/", "text": "I\u2019m in (almost) the exact same position as you. I\u2019m an anthropology major and I really want to switch to art. I\u2019ve always been more artistically inclined and have realized how sad I will be if I can\u2019t have a creative career for the rest of my life. That being said, we are in two different positions.. I am very fortunate to have school paid for by my parents, and they have told me they would support a major change. I\u2019m a junior in terms of credits. \nSince you are paying for school yourself, I would encourage you to explore a few things: 1) if you are on a scholarship, try and find out if taking a semester off would affect that, 2) figure out with your loan officer the same thing, 3) contemplate taking a semester off to think about this more seriously, and 4) if a semester off isn\u2019t plausible, take this summer to soul search. \n\nIt is quite the career change. I can\u2019t lie, I skimmed through your post but did get the gist. But I might have missed this... have you ever been into art? Meaning in high school or below was that your favorite class? Did you love sketching, painting, going to museums, learning about art history, learning new techniques and new mediums, etc... because that what an art major will be like. What do you do in your free time?? I\u2019m not saying you wouldn\u2019t excel in an art program if you don\u2019t do any of those things or have never enjoyed them, but ask yourself why exactly do you want to change to art? Is it the idea/image of being an artist that\u2019s pulling you in? Or the idea of creating things no one has seen before? Because the latter is what you need to truly excel in art. If you are willing to put in some extra work to improve your skills, because I will tell you taking one art class will be tough because you\u2019ll see how established people already are in their craft, and if you took an animation class and felt like an outsider you certainly will in other classes. I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m a hurtful way, but that\u2019s the truth. My first college art class I took I wanted to drop immediately because I felt inferior, but I stuck with it and realized I had some talent, and the class even told me so in our critiques. Granted there were people there that were jaw droppingly good, but I am still talented. \n\nAnyway, don\u2019t change just yet. Really try to look within yourself to find the real reasons you want to switch. Think about what you want from the degree, talk to your advisor about what some art students who have graduated are doing. Go to the art department and talk to them about what the next few years would look like if you switched over. Get an idea of what the future would have in store if you made that decision. try doing art on your own. It doesn\u2019t have to be good. Buy a sketchbook and just sketch and see if you love it or hate it, but don\u2019t make an impulsive decision just yet. Good luck! And I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for ", "author": null, "created": 1546881733, "upvotes": 4}}}
