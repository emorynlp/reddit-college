F23 here, going back to college after battling depression for five years after my first year of college. I\u2019m looking into mechanical engineering, mathematics (either general or applied), physics, and computer science.\n\nI know nothing about mechanical engineering, and just wanted to see if I\u2019m interested in it first.\n\nI love numbers and think getting into higher math levels would be very satisfying. The highest math I\u2019ve completed is pre calc so I really want to learn more.\n\nAs for physics, I only took a semester in high school and nearly failed (aced the midterm somehow). But I\u2019m really interested in learning more especially like space-time based physics and what not. Idk it\u2019s just always been something I\u2019ve wanted to learn more about.\n\nComputer science. I absolutely love to code. I know basic html and css so far and I was able to build a website from scratch all on my own after only a week of learning. It\u2019s just so fun for me. I love creating things.\n\nSo can you all give me your two cents into these degree options? What you like/don\u2019t like, and why they\u2019re good or bad degrees/career fields?? Thanks in advance!!\n\nTLDR: Can you tell me more about degrees in physics, mechanical engineering, computer science, and math?", "author": "autismsqueaks", "created": 1621832836, "retrieved": 1632956737, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"gzexc7f": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/njq519/looking_into_different_stem_majors_just_want_some/gzexc7f/", "text": "Have you considered accounting or finance?

I am currently finishing up my second semester so here are my two cents on it. So far it has been great, somehow I managed to achieve 80% and more on my mechanics and electromagnetism course, but in high school I never got anything above 70% in physics in high school. \n\nSo if you are scared about your physics grade I would say don\u2019t worry. I think it is because in uni you have more time and will only focus on one or two courses which is way better than having 8+ courses in high school.\n\nMy first semester was just mathematics and programming courses since you need them in physics. So you would be getting the benefits of taking some programming courses depending on your uni of course and taking lots of math. \n\nIn my uni the only difference between math and physics major is that physics majors don\u2019t have to take two or three courses, opposed to the math majors. I have lots of friends who took those courses and now have a double bachelors. I don\u2019t know if that is the same in your uni but if you are interested in smth like that I would ask about it.", "author": "mar7_photographer", "created": 1621846211, "upvotes": 3}, "gz8wjws": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/njq519/looking_into_different_stem_majors_just_want_some/gz8wjws/", "text": "Math Major here. I love it, especially when you get into all the juicy proof stuff. It also provides a variety of skills in logic and argument that are broadly applied, and can be useful applying to a range of career fields, though it doesn't necessarily lend itself to a particular career like other degrees do.\n\nCS is also good, but personally I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons:\n\n1) It's the flavour of the time and it's getting flooded with people, so I don't think you'd stand out too much with just a major in CS\n\n2) Considering you're female, I'd be cautious in entering into a CS department without scoping it out first, it depends on the culture at the specific university but for example, one of my female friends has been stalked and harrassed and etc. as a CS major (And I'm in a very liberal NZ city lmao)\n\nIf you do stats, you'll be learning to code anyways.\n\nIn conclusion, join us!", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1621838042, "upvotes": 2}}}
