Ireland\n\nI was good at pretty much everything in school and got the grades to get into all of the degrees in my country . Did 5 languages, all 3 sciences, maths, art. Extremely conscientious, about iq 120.\n\nTook a gap year, then did a year at a Liberal Arts & Sciences college where I majored in health & life sciences.\n\nI dropped out bc the degree was too general and making me a jack of \\*no\\* trades, and master of none.\n\nNow I have the opportunity to pick literally anything from Dentistry, Law with French, Pharmacy, Biomed, Optometry, Modern languages etc etc. I'm paralysed by making the wrong choice because I feel like I'd be good at and interested in all of them.\n\nDefinitely want good salary right out of college bc I'll be 3 years behind everyone else. **Worth mentioning that I will basically not have to pay for college because of financial aid and scholarships, so i can get a free degree in pretty much anything....**\n\nPlease just advise and throw any ideas you have at me. Literally anything xD", "author": "Josh_needsadvice", "created": 1615213391, "retrieved": 1632957446, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"gq894j3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m0gp9i/crisis_in_choosing_college_degree_pharmacy_biomed/gq894j3/", "text": "Dentistry or normal MBBCh", "author": "almostdedxd", "created": 1615222979, "upvotes": 1}}}
