  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a female senior in high school who has been applying to schools as I start to think about my future.  I\u2019m stuck between elementary education vs. psychology and just need some insight and advice from an outside point of view.\n\nI\u2019ve been in an early childhood education career tech program all 4 of my high school years, and love it.  I love working with kids and teaching with my co-teachers and I also was a theatre education intern at a local conservatory, which now I have a paid summer camp position.  I like teaching and love their lightbulb moments and creating a positive classroom environment\u2014 I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I want.\n\nBoth of my parents have their master\u2019s in clinical mental health counseling \u2014 I myself had really bad bouts of anxiety, OCD, and depression and I had some docs that weren\u2019t great, so I aspire to be that one good one.  However, I would want my PhD in Clinical Psychology and those programs are literally impossible to get into .  I\u2019m in AP psych right now and love it and am interested in clinical child and adolescent psychology.   I\u2019m fully aware a bachelors is psych isn\u2019t the most helpful, so am stuck in what to do.  The program where I was treated was excellent and it is my dream to work there.  I\u2019ve noticed people do their bachelors, 2 years as a clinical research assistant (those are limited spots too!) then apply to PhD programs which are really long followed by a fellowship and all of that. \n\nI\u2019m not an awful student, I\u2019m 20 out of a class of 160 with a rounded 3.5 GPA.  I don\u2019t know what to do.  The chances of getting into a graduate program seem impossible.  All of those years of school seem grueling and I know PhD students often have so many loans and not many means of living during their program because of the cost.  \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you!!",
