      "text": "I used to want to do aerospace engineering because I loved airplanes and all that sort of stuff. Then I flew. I'm now an aviation major training to become a commercial airline pilot. It's a whole bunch fun. \n\nAs for picking between a computer science major, you should think about what the day to day schedule of having that job would be like. Which one is more fun?\n\nGood luck bro!",
