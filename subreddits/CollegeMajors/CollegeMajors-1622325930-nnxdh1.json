Help!", "text": "I currently work in the front office for a physical therapy office and I absolutely love it. There really isn\u2019t much room for growth unless I go back to school again. I\u2019m considering PTA, but I\u2019m scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it as I work full time at the office and that isn\u2019t much of an option, as I\u2019m a single parent to an 8 year old too. It\u2019s not so much the work load I\u2019m worried about, I know I can juggle all of that, it\u2019s the clinical hours. I know it\u2019s not likely I\u2019d be able to take time off or take that kind of a cut from not working. Am I really stuck here or do I have options?\n\nAny and all advice is welcome, thanks in advance.", "author": "JAD3DFATE", "created": 1622325930, "retrieved": 1632957072, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"h1q1h0h": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nnxdh1/physical_therapy_assistant_help/h1q1h0h/", "text": "Look into the job opportunities insurances are killing the profession with the reimbursements for therapy", "author": "Puzzleheaded-Tip-562", "created": 1623673225, "upvotes": 1}}}
