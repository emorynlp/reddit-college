It's really important for me to major in something that will make me enough money to survive, but also something that I won't hate doing for the rest of my life. I'm currently still undecided, but I think I have a better idea of where I eventually want to end up than when I first started college. My problem is, I don't know exactly what major will get me there. \n\nI'm super interested in the makeup/skincare industry. I worked at a Sephora as a cashier pre-covid. I realized there I wasn't super crazy about having to sell products/deal with customers directly, but I was extremely interested in the products themselves and wondered about all the steps they had to take for them to eventually end up at our store. I would love to end up working with a brand in the beauty industry and being able to pitch ideas for new, possible products or have some sort of say in the development. I think I would also enjoy being involved in the process of how a brand will market a product and make it appealing. Eventually, I would even like to start my own brand. \n\nWhat majors are best? I've looked into majoring in Marketing, but a lot of people seem to look down on it and often say they're worthless. Also, if anyone knows the basic terminology for the job positions I'd like to have, please let me know. I don't know any of the official titles and I can't seem to narrow it down either.", "author": "ssayitaintso", "created": 1595907689, "retrieved": 1632956900, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fzj31ib": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hz7dpp/20_f_super_lost/fzj31ib/", "text": "Sounds like you'd be into product design or product management! I'm taking a product design course right now and it's really fun. I think probably a double major in design and marketing for you would be great. Design also has a lot of cognitive science involved so cognitive science + design would be good too. I actually know someone who worked at Sephora as a buyer and she was a marketing major, she used to be a retail associate I think but she made her way up through a marketing internship at Sephora.", "author": "walkingscottstreet", "created": 1595955873, "upvotes": 2}, "fzhh06x": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hz7dpp/20_f_super_lost/fzhh06x/", "text": "I would consider finance as it is a social science that can lead to an okay salary range. Accounting would be more preferable but that doesn't deal with the product at all, whereas finance will loosely deal with the product. For finance you would be analyzing trends in the markets and planning investment decisions.\n\nI wouldn't recommend marketing as it is very soul crushing and is over saturated with the countless people that major in it and don't do their research. Just expecting to find a job immediately after graduation.\n\nI also wouldn't be afraid in making a career out of something that is boring/uninteresting if it is lucrative. Often times people that try to make their favorite hobby/pastime their career they become burnt out and start to treat it like any normal job. Whereas, on the other side of the coin if you go for a high paying field in something you don't like you would hopefully have the funds to fully invest in a hobby and enjoy it to its fullest during your time off.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1595913909, "upvotes": 6}, "fzhecxk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hz7dpp/20_f_super_lost/fzhecxk/", "text": "You have to find a way to connect practical careers to your interest with makeup/skincare. Being a software engineer for a makeup website, or a marketer who spearheads collabs with social media influencers and makeup/skincare products/companies. \n\nYou also need to realize that your future is not held by your degree. The connections you make and on job skills you learn will eventually help you find your purpose in life.   \n\n\nHere is a video.
