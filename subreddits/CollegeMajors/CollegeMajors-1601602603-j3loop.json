Potential Pathways, PolSci/Eng/Econ Majs.", "text": "I am a Freshman in community college. Im now 20. Ive worked fast-food, warehouse, Ive tried college, Ive tried the military, and now Im back to college. I had no idea what pathway I wanted to go down in college, and I have decided on engineering, though I dont think I want to do that anymore. I love politics, and the economy is so interesting. I have been listening to politcal podcasts every day for the past two years. I read many articles about the on goings in congress, and the recent presidential debate has furthered my fascination with politics. My wife is an econ major, and a political science minor. Every class she has taken for her major/minor is so interesting. I am currently taking an Intro to IR class and it is fascinating, although I do not know if it really represents what a true political science class is like. Engineering is a STEM major, and all that math and science does not particularly sound interesting to me. I would like to give it a chance, but I am feeling that engineering really is not the path I would like to follow.\n\nI am asking that any Engineering Majors of any kind, as well as Econ and Political Science majors, tell me what a day is like for you? What is your workload? If youre a Freshman, what classes are you taking to prepare you for future classes? If youre a senior, what have you taken so far, and what classes have you taken that are not necessarily needed for your major, but you have taken because you felt it would help in your field. What is your minor? Why was it your minor? Why are you specializing in what you have chosen? If you can tell me anything at all, thank you.\n\nAnything and everything helps", "author": "HandsomeApples", "created": 1601602603, "retrieved": 1632956838, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"g7dqek4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3loop/advice_potential_pathways_polsciengecon_majs/g7dqek4/", "text": "I\u2019m an Econ major with a math minor now. I was doing a joint Econ and political science degree for about 18 months because I also find politics and government fascinating. Unfortunately none of the political science classes I took were remotely interesting for me. It was legal case studies and hierarchies of different organizations. I love studying economics and the curriculum required a lot of math and I enjoy math so I added the minor. I haven\u2019t graduated but it seems like a versatile degree. Can you add an Econ or political science minor to your engineering degree to check out a class or two and see if it\u2019s interesting? Have you thought about what kind of job or industry you might like to work in to see what kinds of positions and requirements they have?  I don\u2019t have any advice but you definitely don\u2019t want to dread studying whatever you decide.", "author": "peaceandatheism", "created": 1601625975, "upvotes": 1}}}
