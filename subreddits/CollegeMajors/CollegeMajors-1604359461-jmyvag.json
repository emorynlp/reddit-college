I want to go towards that because I want to start my own construction company and was wondering if that is the major to go to and the career I'm choosing is the right one in order for me to start my construction company.  My major is in business management. My dad is currently a full time construction worker working on jobs that he gets called to. He's been doing it for the past 20 years and has always been extremely busy. So my plans are to start up my own company and maybe work as a PM as my main job. Or go all in with starting my company. So my main question is should I keep going for the PM Career, or complete community college and just try to start my own company as soon as I'm done with school?  Thanks in Advance! (feel free to ask any questions).", "author": "Dangeruss33", "created": 1604359461, "retrieved": 1632957334, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gdi3mxl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jmyvag/should_i_change_my_major/gdi3mxl/", "text": "If you are serious about starting your own company, get the business degree.
