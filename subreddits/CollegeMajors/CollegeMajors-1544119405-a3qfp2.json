I want to be a chef, and own a food truck, however instead of attending culinary school for one year and being thirty grand in the hole, as well as having to move somewhere I don\u2019t wanna live for the one I\u2019d even want, I want to go to a normal college, preferably University of Reno. However I don\u2019t know what to would be best to major in.

It\u2019s also smart that you want to attend a \u2018normal\u2019 college because if you change your mind about your chef/food truck plans, it won\u2019t be as big of a deal.\n\nAfter researching The University of Reno, I would suggest looking into a bachelors in Management or General Business. A minor in Entrepreneurship would be great! I don\u2019t see anything specific to culinary or restaurant management, so those will probably be your best bets. You could at least look into those majors. \n\nI recommend taking any culinary classes that your high school offers if you\u2019re not already. If possible, you may want to consider getting a job at a restaurant somewhere to get a small taste of what it\u2019s like. ", "author": null, "created": 1544128068, "upvotes": 3}}}
