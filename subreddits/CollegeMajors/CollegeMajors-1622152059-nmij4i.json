Geography, history ,politics, animation, museums , music and theatre are my main fields of interest and I am looking for pursuing these abroad. Can any international student who is studying these subjects or someone who has a job in the above fields suggest countries and degrees that I can pursue?\n\nEven the tiniest information is of great help, thanks!",
