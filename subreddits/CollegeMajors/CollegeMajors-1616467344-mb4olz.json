I was previously interested because of the high demand and quick employment rates after college, and I still prioritize that, but I\u2019m just unsure about being a nurse. I do pretty well in school and take AP math, english, and history classes and I\u2019m good at science, but I think it\u2019s boring and I zone out in class. I got a 28 on the ACT, and reading was my highest score. I\u2019m in a lot of extra-curriculars like varsity cheerleading, honor society, student council, Eco Club, my school\u2019s newspaper, and an ambassador for new students at my school. I\u2019ve also competed at local speech competitions and done well. I\u2019m a coach for a local running club at my elementary school and I really like doing that. I enjoy planning and organizing and working in group settings, I\u2019m also a pretty strong writer, and I enjoy working with kids/elderly. I have a lot of experience working in the customer service industry already and am comfortable working with people in general. I don\u2019t want to rule out working in the medical field altogether, because I know it\u2019s a pretty stable career and I wouldn\u2019t be stuck with student debt all my life, just not sure nursing is right for me and wondering if I should look elsewhere in terms of majors. I\u2019m sort of interested in public relations, hospital administration, pharmacy, economics, or journalism. I\u2019m really confused about what I want to do after high school, so a little help would be much appreciated!", "author": "lazyfriesland", "created": 1616467344, "retrieved": 1632846958, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"grz5343": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mb4olz/indecisive_about_major/grz5343/", "text": "Study statistics", "author": "user4684784124", "created": 1616534169, "upvotes": 1}}}
