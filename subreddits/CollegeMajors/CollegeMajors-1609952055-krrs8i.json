Taking forensic science means I am required to minor in chemistry... which sucks for me because I absolutely hate chemistry. I also found out being a forensic scientist means you have to appear in court... which ALSO sucks for me because I'm horrible at speaking and articulating what I want to say.\n\nOne of my classes was an introduction bio class, and I found that I enjoyed it, especially the units regarding genetics. Because of that I've been thinking of changing my major to something biology related but I don't know what would be a good fit.\n\nSome more general info that could help: I am interested in cells, using microscopes, using computers, film, and photography; I have ADHD; I despise writing papers and reports; I hate math\n\nThanks in advance :)", "author": "megamindism", "created": 1609952055, "retrieved": 1632956786, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"gij3jw4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/krrs8i/forensic_science_major_here_thinking_about/gij3jw4/", "text": "look into public health, bioinformatics, or cognitive science", "author": "yellochoco44", "created": 1610103514, "upvotes": 1}, "giep0ss": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/krrs8i/forensic_science_major_here_thinking_about/giep0ss/", "text": "You could do just plain biology if your school offers that major, or try to specialize in something.
