I have more of a passion for music than CS (although I love both) but I am worried about money. I know that careers in Cisco, Amazon, Cybersecurity can compensate you well and I'm not sure how to make a living as a music major. I have a family to support so I'm not on my own.\n\nSo I'm considering majoring in CS and minoring in Music. Time might be a problem though so maybe I will pursue music at a latter date. I'm not sure how to approach this.\n\nMy second thought is that I want to be able to be an entreprenur. So majoring in CS and minoring in business (haven't looked into this yet.) is what I'm thinking to go for right now. I want to be able to sell myself properly and set up a brand. Is pursuing business the correct way to go about this? \n\nI definitely want to pursue all three. I'm just not 100% sure of the best way to go about it.
