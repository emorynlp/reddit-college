  "text": "I want to major in something that I\u2019m interested in however this isn\u2019t the \u201cmake mom proud\u201d major. I plan on focusing on politics, international business, and or sociology. For those who got an Asian Studies Degree, is it worth it? Are you making a living? Is it hard to find a career? [ I\u2019m living off of strictly student loans so I don\u2019t have the time or money to waste if this major doesn\u2019t do me good ]",
