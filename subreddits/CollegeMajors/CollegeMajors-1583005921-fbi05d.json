(He did get a MBA though). \nI have an uncle who is an accountant (majored in accountancy) and makes even more, he\u2019s basically the sole provider for a family of 4 and they regularly go on vacations, own nice cars, even built their dream home. \nYou can definitely make good money with with a business degree, and the people in my life who have gone to business school are happy it\u2019s their careers. You can become an accountant, financial analyst, business analyst, actuary, even cooperate attorney if you decide to pursue law school. I don\u2019t know too much about a business administration degree, if you can\u2019t find any info online about it I\u2019d talk to an advisor or someone in the business administration program. \nBest wishes! :)", "author": "cartermagnolia", "created": 1583294782, "upvotes": 2}, "fj4pmc4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/fbi05d/what_can_i_do_with_a_business_administration/fj4pmc4/", "text": "Hmm probably nothing", "author": "ChrisJ2000", "created": 1583013856, "upvotes": -3}}}
