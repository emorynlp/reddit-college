Now I'm a bit confused to pick between Engineering And Business.\n\nSo first of all I want to eliminate computer science from engineering ( I dropped CS as a fourth subject from A-levels as well). Then we have chemical, mechanical, electrical, industrial and environmental. From business side we have Finance, marketing, business tech management, business administration etc.\n\nI'm a huge fan of tech in general, I would like to work at a products division at a tech company. I kind of want to be the guy who decides what products will be released in the future, how the marketing will be done etc. Sort of like a product manager. I also have an interest in markets as well and also is interested in investing.\n\nOut of engineering mechanical, electrical and industrial are the no-brainer options for me. All 3 would let me design and create products which another person tells me to. Not necessarily make my team create products which I would like to be created. \n\nFrom business perspective, I won't be able to make any products but I can lead other people to create products I want to be created. Many people are saying that getting a position like product manager or marketing manager at a tech company is impossible without a technical background. Is this true?\n\nWhat do you guys recommend me pursue as my major to get into what I really want.", "author": "smc23678", "created": 1610791872, "retrieved": 1632847049, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gjmwvm1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kygfvn/hard_to_choose_between_engineering_and_business/gjmwvm1/", "text": "Maybe a industrial engineering major and a finance or some kind of management major or switch industrial engineering with electrical.", "author": "ChurninPark", "created": 1610910611, "upvotes": 1}, "gjk7vmg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kygfvn/hard_to_choose_between_engineering_and_business/gjk7vmg/", "text": "You can go into business with an engineering degree, but you can\u2019t go into engineering with a business degree.", "author": "yellochoco44", "created": 1610875609, "upvotes": 1}, "gjih2m2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kygfvn/hard_to_choose_between_engineering_and_business/gjih2m2/", "text": "Use a coin.
