I will can focus on either gestational analysis or a more ecologically based focus. Where I live there are a lot of local GIS opportunities at Edision, Irvine Police, JPL, several national parks/monuments etc.\n\nI am also considering getting a BS in computer science, but hesitate because I am extremely ignorant in that field. I do have a lot of software experience which makes me more interested in GIS.\n\nThis is going to be an enormous time / financial commitment, and I would just like any advice or encouragement. I know that the technology is rapidly changing and that a computer programming background (which I lack competently) is very helpful if not required. \n\ntl;dr : I need this to be worth doing, and I don't know what I'm getting myself into. Please let me know any thoughts comments advice warnings or opinions. I need resources to investigate and I need your experience to contemplate.
