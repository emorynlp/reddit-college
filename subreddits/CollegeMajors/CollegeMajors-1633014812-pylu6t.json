Don't go to 4 years of college to do something you think is fun. Do it to have a degree that will send you wherever you want to go in life. \n\nEven if you're taking out a loan. I would only look at Healthcare, accounting, engineering or any kind of STEM degrees. Those degrees will instantly land you high paying job right out of college. You may only have to do it for a few years before you can translate that experience to a different type of job that will pay you well for you experience. You could spend a year or more after college looking for a job with the kind of degrees you are wanting to pursue. You will still be able to persue your passion outside of work. \n\nIf you truly want to get into photography, as mentioned above. Just get a cheap car and a good camera and go create an amazing portfolio/Instagram/website.\n\nThere should be a \"listen to your mom\" option.

By the time I quit, I\u2019d wracked up a ton of student loan debt that haunted me for years until was I was able to pay them all off\u2026 so don\u2019t major in photography. Take some classes in it, for sure! Even minor in it, but please don\u2019t go into debt for a degree in photography. \n\nI was a photographer for several years before getting into a different business, and 99% of what I learned was not from my college experience. As a hobby now, it\u2019s great, but I learned my lesson the hard way for sure, and it was an expensive lesson.", "author": "kateminus7", "created": 1633016789, "upvotes": 3}}}
