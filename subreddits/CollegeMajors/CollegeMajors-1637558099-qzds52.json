  "text": "Currently doing a Criminology undergrad. The subject matter is insanely interesting to me, and I like every aspect of my degree. I was thinking of getting into Forensics or becoming an investigator after university. Unfortunately Criminology has a pretty terrible reputation when it comes to it's usefulness out of university and it's thrown me off completely, since I am petrified of being a burden to my parents. \n\nWondering if there are any respectable degrees that are good for getting a job outside of university, preferably with interesting subject matter. Math and science aren't my strong points but if it has a little math I'm down to try at least.",
