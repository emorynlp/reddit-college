  "text": "I want to major in something technology related. Currently I\u2019m majoring in computer information systems, but I\u2019m thinking of switching to computer engineering. I can\u2019t do computer science because of how confusing it would be with certain classes available in either the fall or spring, combined with prereqs and coreqs.\n\nI\u2019ll be able to do a bigger variety of jobs and learn more from school if I do engineering. It\u2019s more rigorous and difficult but I think it would be worth it in the end. It\u2019ll take me an extra year because of math prereqs (but i\u2019d still need to do them if I stay in info systems, I just don\u2019t go far into math in that degree).\n\nIf I go for the engineering degree, then I still would be a hirable option for the same careers that information systems gets, right? It seems most info systems careers are analysts.\n\nInformation systems is more business oriented but from more of a technology point of view.\n\nSo it really comes down to business or engineering. What do you think would have a better work/life balance overall and more enjoyable?",

If you want to get into the physics/science/mathetmatics of computer science, computer engineering seems like a better choice. If you really want to do a lot of programming, computer engineering also seems like it will give you more of that.",

I\u2019m not good at math yet, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m starting at lower level classes first.\n\nI think I just have this irrational fear that I\u2019ll be working alone staring at a computer screen 24/7 and business sounds like more socializing, which I guess is a stereotype.\n\nI know that\u2019s not very true, but I\u2019m just a freshman so bear with me lol",

      "text": "Are you sure you want to rule out computer science? You could always  talk to your department advisor to get help with the scheduling. I don't think you'll be satisfied ruling out a major that's potentially a great fit. When I asked about the difference between CE/EE and CS, they answered that CE deals with the hardware aspect of computers and CS works with the programming/software aspects.",

          "text": "Yeah I\u2019m sure because computer science is packed with a bunch of difficult classes every semester that would be very difficult to get through. I think failing would be likelier in this case. I would have to take like 3 classes in the summer just to get done in time.\n\nI\u2019m instead starting off in pre-engineering, where it\u2019s much a much easier load, getting all the math,physics, and chemistry requirements done with a couple engineering elective classes. Then I can transfer to a university as a sophmore, or to engineering science which is only one more year. Overall it is an additional year, a 5 year program but much easier since all the difficult classes are spread out. I\u2019m in community college btw.\n\nBesides I can probably still get software developer jobs and learn higher level programming, but I can\u2019t easily get into hardware anyways with a comp sci degree. Hardware is pretty interesting just like software.",
