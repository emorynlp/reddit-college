  "title:": "What are some college majors that help you \"think outside the box\"?",
  "text": "I'd like to get some college career suggestions to help me think better, critically. My dream is to become a hedge fund manager or run a venture capital firm, but I don't want to pursue a major in finance or economics, as they have no real-life applications, as many top investors like Buffett, Munger and Steven Cohen have commented. I know that no university or major will automatically make me a great investor, but I would like to study something that would give me at least a solid intellectual framework.\n\nI've been doing research and I saw that some of the best investors in the world like Carl Icahn, George Soros, Peter Thiel, Peter Lynch, Guo Guangchang, and Leon Black studied philosophy,  , and they even point out that having done it was important for the success they have had.\n\nSo I would like to hear your opinions and suggestions. Thanks.",

      "text": "If you want to learn to think critically and think outside the box, examine different ideas throughout history and learn what ideas you only believe because of the historical moment you\u2019re situated in, study philosophy. If you want some secret knowledge to help you run a hedge fund, philosophy\u2019s not for you. Try Econ. But it seems like philosophy would benefit and interest you, not to make you a billionaire, but to make you a better thinker",

My college let people modify majors with other topics (e.g. engineering modified with economics) so that you could complete the requirements for the primary field of interest while also tossing in some other fun/interesting coursework",

We need to stop glorifying billionaires because sweetie, none of us will ever become one. They are chosen, not self-made.\n\nYou don't need a college degree to do any of the things you just listed like being a hedge fund manager or anything. What you need is capital. If you want to learn how to think critically all you need to do is just read lots and lots of books.",

      "text": "Philosophy would be great, but applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, or engineering would also be helpful. Problem solving is a much-desired skill and employers can much more easily reach someone business basics than teach someone with a BBA problem solving. \n\nThere\u2019s no secret major that will make you a great investor. I\u2019d suggest picking one that you enjoy, can get decent enough grades in, and specialize in something.",
