My dream is to become a hedge fund manager or run a venture capital firm, but I don't want to pursue a major in finance or economics, as they have no real-life applications, as many top investors like Buffett, Munger and Steven Cohen have commented. I know that no university or major will automatically make me a great investor, but I would like to study something that would give me at least a solid intellectual framework.\n\nI've been doing research and I saw that some of the best investors in the world like Carl Icahn, George Soros, Peter Thiel, Peter Lynch, Guo Guangchang, and Leon Black studied philosophy,  , and they even point out that having done it was important for the success they have had.\n\nSo I would like to hear your opinions and suggestions.
