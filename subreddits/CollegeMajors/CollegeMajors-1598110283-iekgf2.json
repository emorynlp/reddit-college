  "text": "I think that I would like to be part of a software developer team, but I also like managing people, so that's why I thought that I would take MIS major. However, will it be a disadvantage for me to get a job in that sector if I got a MIS instead of CS degree? Since CS seems to have much more programming courses while MIS have more business related course",

      "text": "If you want to program, do CS. From there, you can move on to being a product manager or other managerial roles. If you do want to become a manager, adding on a MBA would be a good idea. In general, a CS degree gives you flexibility in what you want to do.\n\nA MIS major prepares you well for roles such as a business analyst, data analyst, or consultant. Depending on the path you take, you can also go into IT, software engineering, or become a product manager or scrum master, but it all depends on what you do in college.\n\nBoth degrees are excellent and can land you well-paying jobs, and you can get similar roles with either degree, but like said, a CS major allows you to do things MIS majors can, while the opposite is not true. That is not to say that a MIS major is inferior, but it's just that it's not meant to lead to the same careers as CS majors, hence why they are separate.",

That's a pretty small niche relative to the rest of what generally falls into tech-related jobs. \n\nI have a degree in general studies and work alongside CSs, doing the same job for an AI company. It's obviously more of an operational role than development and engineering, but our skillset doesn't require what they learned in school as far as their math, science, and engineering sequences. \n\nThe overwhelming majority of tech jobs really care about what you can do rather than what you learned in school, but you are right. A CS major can do anything an MIS or IT major could, but an MIS or IT major can't do everything a CS major could.",
