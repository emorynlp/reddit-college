  "text": "I'm planning on going into college soon, I've just graduated, and I'm not sure what I want to major in. I know that I want to become a translator (Japanese to English), but I'm not sure if I should choose East Asian languages or linguistics. Is there a big difference? Which one would help the most on the path to becoming a translator for my target language?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Sorry if there is another thread like this, I'm new to posting on Reddit. Thank you.",

      "text": "I have a degree in linguistics and yes, there is a big difference! Some things we studied in my linguistics degree:\n\n* Do all languages have syllables? \n\n* What does Noam Chomsky think about sentences?\n\n* Why is the plural of goose \"geese\"?\n\n* What muscle do you use to make the \"oo\" sound?\n\n* How do you express possession in Navajo?\n\n* Out of language A, language B, and language C, which two languages are more closely related to each other than to the third one? How can you tell? \n\nThings we did not study:\n\n* How to speak, read, write, or understand Japanese\n\n* How to translate anything from Japanese to English\n\nA degree in linguistics is neither necessary nor sufficient for a career as a translator. If you want to be a Japanese-to-English translator, focus on your Japanese language skills (assuming you're already fluent in English and are not already fluent in Japanese). Take as many classes taught in Japanese as possible. Study abroad in Japan. Read books written in Japanese, watch TV and movies in Japanese, listen to Japanese radio.\n\nI looked into translation as a career path (I decided against it because, in spite of several years of language study, winning national awards, competing internationally in language contests, and studying abroad in college, I realized it would still take a lot of work to reach a professional level of proficiency in my target language). From what I read:\n\n* Your job prospects are better if you have some subject matter knowledge in a particular area (typically law, medicine, or business).\n\n* Your job prospects are better if you're the \"odd one out\" (i.e. a native English speaker in Japan, or a native Japanese speaker in the U.S.).",

          "text": "Thank you for the reply! I was thinking of studying in Japan for two years at a language school so that I could become proficient in Japanese and have some real-world experience. I thought that would be better than going to a college in the U.S. and taking Japanese here. If I do become fluent in Japanese, do you think I should go to college for business, law, or medicine instead of translating/interpreting?",
