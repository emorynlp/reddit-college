  "text": "Hello, \n\nI'm a business major at a junior college looking to transfer to a university. Is UCLA a good option? I realize they only have an economics program and I am interested particularly in finance or accounting. Should I be looking into a program specifically with a finance major or accounting major like a CSU? or would UCLA be a good foundation for whatever field I want to pursue. Any advice would be much appreciated.",

      "text": "I think it depends on what you are trying to do.  I am a junior, accounting major currently.  If you are thinking about being an accountant and working at a firm,  I would say get your bachelors in accounting and maybe minor in something to get your 150 credits for your CPA... You could also enter the accounting field through a masters in accounting.  I think it depends on what you want to do and what you are interested in",
