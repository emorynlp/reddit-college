  "text": "Hey guys, I'm going into my sophomore year at a small liberal arts college, and I'm stressin' about not knowing what to major in. How can I find what I'm passionate about? And should I even major in something that I love if the degree has a low ROI? \n\nI know for sure that I do not want a degree in STEM. I've taken lots of career aptitude tests, too, but no career really sticks out to me. \n\nI love history, but I can't imagine only majoring in that subject. I really want job security and a degree which is flexible. \n\nCurrently, I'm thinking of double majoring in history and accounting. The problem is that I'm not sure I even like accounting, lol. I mean, I got an A in my \"intro to financial accounting\" course this semester, and I didn't hate the class (but I didn't love it either). Does anyone have advice on what I can do to figure out what I want to major in asap? Thank you",

              "text": "I don\u2019t think double majoring in history and accounting makes sense because those 2 careers don\u2019t go well together. And apart from that you should check job prospects for history majors. From what I know mainly teaching in high schools or colleges.\n\nFinding your passion is bad career advice. The thing is you don\u2019t know whether you like it or not until you do it. You might like history, but you might hate the jobs that come after it. What you should focus is to do what you are good at. If you are really good at something, there is no doubt you will like it. Also don\u2019t try to make your career a hobby (A common career advice nowadays)",

                  "text": "The thing is, you need a certain amount of credits to pass the CPA exam (150 additional credit hours). So if I pursue the accounting route, double majoring seems like the best way to accomplish that. \n\nI'm going to minor at minimum in history because I like it. I know I won't directly use it in my career. But it's taught me valuable critical thinking and writing skills, which I feel are still beneficial to me in the workforce. \n\nI still am trying to figure out where my skill set lies, though",

For writing, pretty sure you can find writing classes.\n\nDoing a double major in accounting and economics or major in accounting and minor in communication studies would be good option IMO. This is totally up to you. I\u2019m just giving you a suggestion",
