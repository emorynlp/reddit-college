What to do if I have no real passion for my classes?", "text": "Hey guys, I'm going into my sophomore year at a small liberal arts college, and I'm stressin' about not knowing what to major in. How can I find what I'm passionate about? And should I even major in something that I love if the degree has a low ROI? \n\nI know for sure that I do not want a degree in STEM. I've taken lots of career aptitude tests, too, but no career really sticks out to me. \n\nI love history, but I can't imagine only majoring in that subject. I really want job security and a degree which is flexible. \n\nCurrently, I'm thinking of double majoring in history and accounting. The problem is that I'm not sure I even like accounting, lol. I mean, I got an A in my \"intro to financial accounting\" course this semester, and I didn't hate the class (but I didn't love it either). Does anyone have advice on what I can do to figure out what I want to major in asap?
