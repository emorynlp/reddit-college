So if you really like programming, it might be worth it to grind through the math classes and get your degree. And a lot of the math in computer science is very different from the math you might be used to, especially calculus. If you're curious, try looking into discrete math and analysis of algorithms (there's probably some good courses online somewhere).", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1617582073, "upvotes": 2}, "gteg4e0": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mk7k6h/is_computer_science_a_good_choice_if_im_not_good/gteg4e0/", "text": "Computer science is basically applied math so...", "author": "biggerarmsthanyou", "created": 1617581617, "upvotes": 2}}}
