      "text": "How good are you with languages (Like, the more technical side of english). CompSci is a very \"Jack of all trades\" degree, as you mentioned, but computational liguistics is always gonna be an in-demand field and it combines both as best as I can see. If you like a particular language, major in it and CompSci. If not, go CompSci, take a few classes in English Lit to get your feet wet then dive into the lingustics area.",
