      "text": "I\u2019ve really enjoyed this major so far! All of the course work has been interesting to me so far, even the parts that aren\u2019t specifically for the SLP track. The professors in the classes that aren\u2019t specifically for SLPs usually try to relate the content to SLPs and show us how we can use the info. \n\nI\u2019d say that the most difficult classes for me were Audiology, Hearing Science, and Speech Science. The way that my university plans degree paths put pretty much all of the hardest courses in the same semester, but I made it through. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but this major is definitely worth it.",
