  "title:": "Can you get a BA and a BS?/how do credits work",
  "text": "I know it\u2019s a dumb question but hear me out. So I just started a BA in biological sciences with a minor in psychology, because honestly I love biology but I\u2019m too lazy to do harder math and science courses especially since I don\u2019t even know what I want to be yet. However I know jobs prioritize bachelors of science since it\u2019s more based in science ofc, so my question was if I was to finish the BA but later on solidified my decision and wanted to get a science-y job would I be able to use the science classes I took during the BA and put them towards the BS and not have to take the basic ones all over again? (I looked the each degree plan and they are both 120 credit hours or something but obviously for the BS classes having to do with psychology will be replaced with more advanced stem classes(?))",

      "text": "Pretty sure the answer to your question is No. \n\nThat being said, most employers aren't going to care whether you have a BA or BS, they care more about your experience and what the degree was in. So if you have the option of the exact same major in BA vs BS, it's not really going to matter much to the employer. Just get some experience in the industry you want to work in, maybe some Certifications, internships, personal projects, etc and you should be fine.",
