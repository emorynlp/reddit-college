I'm currently in community school rethinking what my major should be. I've always been interested in cultures (if I could I would love to learn about more then one culture) and would love to study it, but I also would love to open my own business/company. Also studying business has been on my mind. I've had this dream where I would open my own kind of fandom mall and tv network and such. Basically I want to make money off of fandoms and such. Kpop and Latino music are popular in the United States and having a tv channel where you can find out what's happening in those genres would be nice. I also was thinking if majoring or minoring in music (with a option in music business/industry) would be a good idea for me. Sorry if it doesn't make sense, but that's what I want to do. Any ideas would be appreciated.\n\nP.S. If you guys know any degrees that are similar to the ones I listed then those would also be appreciated. Even graduate degree ideas would be appreciated. \n\nTl;dr: What major/minor should I do if I'm interested in opening a fandom-related business like a tv channel and/or mall, etc? Something in culture (more then one culture sounds cool to me), Business Admin, and/or Music Industry/Business.", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1575497502, "retrieved": 1632848105, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f9od08g": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/e66wya/degree_decisions/f9od08g/", "text": "I would say Business Admin", "author": "ap835", "created": 1575501643, "upvotes": 2}}}
