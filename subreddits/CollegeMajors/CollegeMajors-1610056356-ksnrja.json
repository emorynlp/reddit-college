For the last two years, I've been taking general courses (history, biology, and algebra etc). I declared my major general studies. I've been taking these courses at a small 2 year community college with the hope of transferring to a larger 4 year university this fall. My interests lean more towards a BBA in finance, but I also enjoy the aspects of engineering, but more for the critical problem solving skills that look good to employers more so than a general business degree. I would really appreciate some feedback and I am open to discussion.", "author": null, "created": 1610056356, "retrieved": 1632955587, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"giikryq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ksnrja/engineering_degree_vs_bba/giikryq/", "text": "All I\u2019m gonna say is that it\u2019s easier to go into business with an engineering degree than to go into engineering with a business degree", "author": "yellochoco44", "created": 1610086358, "upvotes": 2}, "gih4mjf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ksnrja/engineering_degree_vs_bba/gih4mjf/", "text": "Do one as a minor and the other as your major!
