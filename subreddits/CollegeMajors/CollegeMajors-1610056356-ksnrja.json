  "text": "For the moment, I'm torn on what I want to major in. For the last two years, I've been taking general courses (history, biology, and algebra etc). I declared my major general studies. I've been taking these courses at a small 2 year community college with the hope of transferring to a larger 4 year university this fall. My interests lean more towards a BBA in finance, but I also enjoy the aspects of engineering, but more for the critical problem solving skills that look good to employers more so than a general business degree. I would really appreciate some feedback and I am open to discussion.",
