I have always been in love with technology and wanting to work with Apple or Google as my life goal. However, I am also interested in politics and government jobs and the idea of foreign service and working in an embassy as a diplomat abroad. Law enforcement has also been on my mind, however I have also just came to the conclusion of having a good job, family, and house. My first major was computer science, but I changed to political science because of the math that discouraged me. I\u2019ve recently been looking at switching from PoliSci to computer information systems. Would this be a good move? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s less math and more on hands about using technology which I love, and will it help me land a good job ? I haven\u2019t done coding before or programming but it\u2019s a learning process of course but I just would like to have a job to use technology.
