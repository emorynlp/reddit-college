  "title:": "Environmental Science vs Psychology",
  "text": "Hello there.\n\nI know this seems like a very strange comparison, but these are the two areas of science that I\u2019m most passionate about. I\u2019m currently in the very first semester of an Environmental Science major, which means I could theoretically switch if I absolutely wanted to. I love ecology and I love psychology, and my current choice of ecology was made based on very small reasoning. I just love them both so much that I almost needed an excuse to just pick one over the other.\n\nJust so you know a little bit about my current choice, I chose ecology over psychology for two small reasons. The first is that I liked the idea of getting to work outdoors better than solely working in a lab. I love being outside in nature, which has been a pretty big draw of ecology for me (yes, I do understand ecology likely involves lots of lab work, but the chance to get to work outside at least sometimes is what attracts me). Second, people can be annoying and frustrating, while animals tend to be predictable, and I like predictability. I partially chose ecology over psychology because people seem super confusing compared to larger ecological systems that usually make sense. Obviously people are super interesting, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be having this dilemma, but I just rationalized that people would be more difficult to work with and understand so ecology was probably a better option for me (yes, I do understand the ecology, like all science, will have difficulties, but I figured they\u2019d be easier to manage than difficulties with humans). I don\u2019t know if this rationalization was actually true, but I needed something in order to make my initial choice.\n\nSo that\u2019s my admittedly thin reasoning that I chose ecology before officially beginning college. Now I want to ask about the big differences between an Environmental Science major and a Psychology major, *and specifically the careers they can lead to.* I\u2019d especially appreciate insights into how they differ in research methods, how they differ in daily work, and how they differ in actual concrete career options. I probably won\u2019t change my mind, but this question occasionally plagues me so I\u2019d like to deal with it once and for all.\n\nThanks so much for any responses!",

      "text": "I can help with the psych careers. I had a similar dilemma between psych and ecology during my junior year, I stuck with psych and neuroscience. So, the main thing to remember is that a psych bachelors makes you competitive for \u201cnormal\u201d non-academic jobs in HR and such. I can\u2019t speak on these opportunities for ecology. In the long run (considering grad school) there\u2019s lots of opportunities in psychology:\n- the ever present counseling/therapy\n- education research (what I\u2019m doing)\n- neuropsychology (combined brain-behavior clinical work)\n- industrial organizational (help make the work place better)\n- psychometrics (make our measures better)\n- social psychology \n- cognitive psychology\n\nAnd in each of these subsets there are numerous sub-specialities. I\u2019m combining my passion for the environment and my interests in education research to specifically study how we can create educational approaches that more efficiently teach students the critical science skills necessary in the population to fight climate change. In the end, psychology is super interdisciplinary and you can certainly integrate it into ecology research if that interests you.\n\n\nImagine the ways human psychology influences the way they interact with ecosystems and how that can then have downstream ecological effects. Consider a psychology minor. However, I think you should check out sociology. I have a feeling that you\u2019d enjoy integrating human system level research into non-human ecosystems. The interactions here are endless.",

          "text": "Believe it or not, from the one sociology class I\u2019ve taken, it didn\u2019t interest me all that much. Granted, COVID practically cut the class in half, so I didn\u2019t get the full education, but from what I did experience, it was interesting enough, but not on the level of ecology or individual psychology. However, I do see the benefits of a soc class to an ecology degree, as they are pretty similar studies that just focus on different organisms.\n\nI really liked your idea of a psychology minor, as at this point, I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t give up ecology as a major. I just love animals, fungi, ecosystem interactions, and the outdoors way too much (plus, I think I definitely prefer a prospective ecology career over a prospective psych career). However, perhaps I could apply a psychology minor to the psychology of the animals in an ecosystem, as maybe it could give me insight into why specifically they react to things the way that they do.\n\nIf I could run something by you real quick, I\u2019m looking at the required courses at my college for a psychology minor. I don\u2019t know most of the course names, but I know their broader categories. I\u2019d have to take the intro to psych, which would likely already be done because of my AP Psych credit, then a class on basic psych research skills, then a choice of one developmental *or* interpersonal class, one clinical *or* counseling class, and one biological *or* experimental class. I figure interpersonal makes the most sense for me for the first category, as does biological for the third (or maybe experimental, I\u2019ve been doing research and the internet told me that so idk). I don\u2019t see much of a point of clinical or counseling, though it would probably end up as clinical. Do all of my ideas sound alright, or do you have any advice for where you feel I may be wrong? I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll try to do this yet, and idk if my academic advisor, who is an ecologist, would even recommend it, but I figure it\u2019s better to have some things figured out in case I do decide to pursue it.\n\nAs a final, big question. Would a psychology minor provide any real benefit to me if I go into an ecology career? I know you probably don\u2019t know a ton about ecology because you ended up choosing psych, but any advice you give would be helpful. Whether that advice involves my personal understanding of the subject, my career prospects, whatever. Anything can help me out.\n\nThanks for your super helpful response, I would\u2019ve never thought of a psychology minor without your suggestion. Also, sorry it took so long for me to respond. I\u2019m a classic case of a grade A procrastinator.",

              "text": "So, the real question you need to ask yourself is what do you want to do! Is grad school in your plan? Doctoral or Master\u2019s? This really matters. Honestly a psych minor might not help you depending on your goals, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll hurt.\n\nSo as far as your psych classes, experimental makes much more sense over bio imo. Bio psych is usually functional neuroanatomy and neuron biology. It really does not relate at all. However, with experimental you might get exposure to how psych research is done and come up with unique ideas on how it may relate to ecology. In the end, this unique perspective is what you\u2019d be looking to gain.\n\nAs for clinical vs counseling, it kinda depends. In a lot of countries, these two fields are slowly becoming the same. However, generally speaking clinical deals with disorders whereas counseling deals with non-disorder-related challenges. I don\u2019t think it matters too much which you pick from these two.\n\nIn all honesty, I think sociology makes the most sense. Looking at how pollution and stuff disproportionately affects minorities and how society as an entity interacts with an ecosystem is a lot clearer of a connection than psych. However, it\u2019s a minor, it really doesn\u2019t matter a ton since you\u2019re pursuing your major already. The main thing here is passion. \n\nI\u2019d be totally down to chat some more about this as there\u2019s a lot to say that I probably forgot to type",

                  "text": "To be honest, I\u2019m not certain on what I\u2019ll end up doing for sure. My mom has been encouraging me to do at least some further schooling after this so that I\u2019m not outperformed by future students in my field, or so that I\u2019d be able to adapt to increasing requirements in my prospective careers, and I probably agree with her on this. My dad, on the other hand, has been highlighting the benefits of getting a government job, and that kind of lines up with my interests so far, as right now, I see myself most likely involved in some sort of land management, probably at a national or state park or something. Basically working to make sure the park\u2019s land is managed to best support its ecosystem(s) and the various organisms that inhabit them. I haven\u2019t looked super deep into it yet, since I haven\u2019t even taken an ecology class or gotten to know my ecology professor yet, but that\u2019s probably where I\u2019m leaning right now. The biggest thing for me is that if possible, I want to work mostly in or with natural areas, preferably larger areas.\n\nWhen I describe it to you, it doesn\u2019t sound like psych would have much of a purpose here. Maybe you see something different, but idk.\n\nThanks again for your willingness to talk this through with me. It\u2019s super helpful to me figuring it all out!",

I think I had 8 elective credits available at the time I asked, at least -2 through a class I recently added on, so that only leaves 6 credits of wiggle room *at most.* I looked into a psych minor, and though I didn\u2019t do the full math, I believe it would take over 10 credits to be able to do it. I simply don\u2019t have the room for a psych minor in my allotted amount of credits, which means I don\u2019t really have any choice here.\n\nThanks for all the help you gave me while I was trying to figure all of this out.
