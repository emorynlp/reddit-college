I\u2019m currently in the very first semester of an Environmental Science major, which means I could theoretically switch if I absolutely wanted to. I love ecology and I love psychology, and my current choice of ecology was made based on very small reasoning. I just love them both so much that I almost needed an excuse to just pick one over the other.\n\nJust so you know a little bit about my current choice, I chose ecology over psychology for two small reasons. The first is that I liked the idea of getting to work outdoors better than solely working in a lab. I love being outside in nature, which has been a pretty big draw of ecology for me (yes, I do understand ecology likely involves lots of lab work, but the chance to get to work outside at least sometimes is what attracts me). Second, people can be annoying and frustrating, while animals tend to be predictable, and I like predictability. I partially chose ecology over psychology because people seem super confusing compared to larger ecological systems that usually make sense. Obviously people are super interesting, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be having this dilemma, but I just rationalized that people would be more difficult to work with and understand so ecology was probably a better option for me (yes, I do understand the ecology, like all science, will have difficulties, but I figured they\u2019d be easier to manage than difficulties with humans). I don\u2019t know if this rationalization was actually true, but I needed something in order to make my initial choice.\n\nSo that\u2019s my admittedly thin reasoning that I chose ecology before officially beginning college. Now I want to ask about the big differences between an Environmental Science major and a Psychology major, *and specifically the careers they can lead to.* I\u2019d especially appreciate insights into how they differ in research methods, how they differ in daily work, and how they differ in actual concrete career options. I probably won\u2019t change my mind, but this question occasionally plagues me so I\u2019d like to deal with it once and for all.\n\nThanks so much for any responses!", "author": "Comrade-Thanos", "created": 1606822884, "retrieved": 1632847110, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ge9e73k": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k4jbs4/environmental_science_vs_psychology/ge9e73k/", "text": "I can help with the psych careers. I had a similar dilemma between psych and ecology during my junior year, I stuck with psych and neuroscience. So, the main thing to remember is that a psych bachelors makes you competitive for \u201cnormal\u201d non-academic jobs in HR and such. I can\u2019t speak on these opportunities for ecology. In the long run (considering grad school) there\u2019s lots of opportunities in psychology:\n- the ever present counseling/therapy\n- education research (what I\u2019m doing)\n- neuropsychology (combined brain-behavior clinical work)\n- industrial organizational (help make the work place better)\n- psychometrics (make our measures better)\n- social psychology \n- cognitive psychology\n\nAnd in each of these subsets there are numerous sub-specialities. I\u2019m combining my passion for the environment and my interests in education research to specifically study how we can create educational approaches that more efficiently teach students the critical science skills necessary in the population to fight climate change. In the end, psychology is super interdisciplinary and you can certainly integrate it into ecology research if that interests you.\n\n\nImagine the ways human psychology influences the way they interact with ecosystems and how that can then have downstream ecological effects. Consider a psychology minor. However, I think you should check out sociology. I have a feeling that you\u2019d enjoy integrating human system level research into non-human ecosystems. The interactions here are endless.", "author": "Zam8859", "created": 1606832773, "upvotes": 1}}}
