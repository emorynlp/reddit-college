But sometimes I feel like I would hate it.  So pretty much this is the safe bet.\n\nThe other two are very interesting but it\u2019s more school and a lot harder work.\n\nP.S. I go to a small college with limited majors but it\u2019s close to home.\n\n", "author": "captianrobotpants", "created": 1546048419, "retrieved": 1632957400, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ecvtz0r": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/aagsz4/advice_over_picking_a_major/ecvtz0r/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1546191244, "upvotes": 1}, "ecs0raz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/aagsz4/advice_over_picking_a_major/ecs0raz/", "text": "Since you're a freshman, you honestly have plenty of time to figure out this decision, although more time in some than others.\n\nIt's seems like you've narrowed down your interests well enough, but each one is not exactly related to each other. I think it would a good idea to try and figure out what sort of career you'd like to prepare for by researching typical positions in each field. Once you've found a few you'd like, I'd compare and contrast those on factors such as; Average Salary, Job Growth, Average Education level, etc. Once you've selected the career you'd think you'd like best, I'd then choose the major that prepares you for that. All things considered, I also personally think it's important to do something you'd think you'd enjoy versus something you know you'd hate but has better prospects, so factor that in as well.\n\nAnother good idea, since you're a freshman, is to really utilize your Gen. Ed. classes to figure out what fields you truly have interest in. So, take a few Psychology, Business, and Basic Engineering classes to satisfy your general education guidelines, while also gauging if you truly like something within that field. This can also help you find specific careers you'd be interested in, and even some early networking with people in those fields.\n\nNow, out of all the majors you've expressed interest in, I'd say Engineering has the best prospects on all fronts. There's always a need for engineers (need varies by type) and they make a good salary with just a BS. However, the field is brutal class wise, and I'd only pursue this if you're truly interested in it. As for Psychology, you're best bet for actually working in the field is to go to Graduate School or Medical School at some point after getting your BA or BS, although there are exceptions. As for Business Administration, I honestly don't know too much about it, but I've heard conflicting information regarding it. Some have told me that it's tough to find a job with just a BBA, and others have said the opposite, so I assume this can vary depending on where you're located and what you want to do.\n\nAgain, I'd highly recommend researching careers that you'd be interested in within each field, and then comparing them to find the best fit for you. Along with that, take basic classes in each field to see if you like what they offer, which can also lead to more career ideas and even a bit of networking. This assisted me in figuring out what I wanted to do, and I hope this can help you too!
