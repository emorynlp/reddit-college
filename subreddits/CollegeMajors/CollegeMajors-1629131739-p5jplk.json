Farmers to Turbine technicians to mechanical, civil, chemical, & beyond engineers to politicians & lawyers. You will need to be more specific in what you want to do as a job & in what technologies. Good news is you don't necessarily need to know now, wherever you are at. You can take a couple classes or intern or shadow & see what you like. \n\nBased off your 3 options you listed, I think you want to go with the science or applications aspect. I don't know as much about chemistry, but I'll assume you'd most likely would need graduate school to do or get into research. Engineers apply that science & only need a 4 year degree before they go out into the field (I don't know if chemical engineers need their PE or not). My university has a biorenewable engineering major, which is basically chemical engineering plus specific class on bioreweables and agriculture.", "author": "Gamerz1818", "created": 1629146074, "upvotes": 2}}}
