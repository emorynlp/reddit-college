Freshmen didn't get to choose their class sections, so I had an EXTREMELY late lab (7:30pm - 10:30pm), making me come back to my dorm around 11:00 - 11:30pm. I know it doesn't *sound* like a lot but it made me miserable. A few month before the semester started, I had a job at a chain bakery (start time was 2:30pm), and I'd come home around 1:00am - 3:00am, so it reminded me of that a lot. My advisor gave me a lot of random 30 minute breaks in between my classes, so it was also extremely annoying because I didn't know what productive thing to do in between classes. Don't even get me started on COMMUTING from dorm to classes. Big waste of time. I think maybe I just didn't know how to time manage...\n\nTo this day, **I still wonder** what would have happened if I had a normal lab time. I dedicated my **whole** high-school career to Biochemistry just for me to become exhausted.\n\nThough, I'm equally happy with my double major today (Economics concentrating in Data Science, and Nursing).", "author": "EmilyEmlz", "created": 1621826003, "upvotes": 1}, "gyw813j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nb5t18/if_you_had_the_chance_again_what_would_you_major/gyw813j/", "text": "Currently I do Finance and Accounting as a double major.
