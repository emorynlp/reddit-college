All the schools I know just have you be a pre-nursing major and you take all the prerequisites needed. Usually this gets you the AS in allied health or biology or both. And then you apply to nursing programs whether that be the AS/AA in nursing, then transfer to a university to get the bachelors which is like only a semester or two more. \n\nThe other option is you get accepted right away to a university and just get your bachelors there. \n\nThe biology major and health science major is different as it is not for nursing. Unless the health science major is like the Allied health courses, otherwise, health science is like public health/ healthcare policy/admin type work. I\u2019m not sure what school you go to but I\u2019d ask a counselor to clarify this for you because you shouldn\u2019t be majoring in either of those for nursing. Let me know if you have more questions.\n\nUnless you\u2019re going to do an accelerated nursing program afterwards then that\u2019s an entirely a different story and you could just choose either major, preferably biology so you can also take the nursing prerequisites if needed, and then apply to accelerated nursing programs.", "author": "twin0912", "created": 1610218337, "upvotes": 3}, "giofam6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ktw4tn/health_science_or_biology_major_for_nursing/giofam6/", "text": "Are you doing nursing for this degree, like where you do the prerequisites and then get into the nursing program sophomore year?
