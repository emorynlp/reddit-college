I\u2019m currently working at an AI startup and a lot of what they focus on is this connection the mind/ brain have towards the AI platform they\u2019re making. My university has this major that I\u2019m really interested in called cognitive neuroscience. I\u2019d really like to go into biotech/ healthcare technology, but I\u2019m worried since Cognitive Neuroscience isn\u2019t considered a \u201clife science\u201d despite the amount of life science classes I have to take that it would prevent me from entering this field and I should instead be a  biology major (which at my school is essentially designed for if you\u2019re premed). \n\nI understand it\u2019s kind of early to be thinking about this, but I want to make sure I have focus as early as possible and if what I\u2019m interested in can get me to where I want to be. It makes sense why life science companies want people with life science majors, but if you have the background but not necessarily the major could you still enter this field? Ideally, what I major in can prepare me for a specific field, but I can\u2019t really find anything on what cognitive neuroscience opens someone up for. It sounds very interesting and a nice balance between challenging and not overwhelming, since I\u2019m not looking to be overworked by anxiety and stress. This is what I want to spend my time in school learning about, but I don\u2019t want to spend my time learning concepts I\u2019ll never apply or need to use again post-college. \n \nBasically, I\u2019m really unsure if I should pursue this cognitive neuroscience major my school has, which seems to have a healthy mix between STEM/ Psych, but I don\u2019t know for if I want to go into biotech or healthcare or tech (I do plan on a minor in CS) if this is a major I could pursue for it or if I must go down a pre-med/ bio track. Or if I had this cognitive neuroscience major with a biology minor, would that help in any way towards going into biotech on a non-technical end? I know minors aren\u2019t all that useful, but my school\u2019s bio minor is like 7-9 courses or something like that, so maybe there\u2019s substance?? I\u2019m not sure if anyone can answer my concerns, but I just needed to put this out there since I\u2019m at a point where any external guidance would be very helpful.
