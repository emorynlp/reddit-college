So I'm going to a community college near me. I know I have time to decide but I would like a headstart in deciding my major. Since I was a little kids, I've always thought of being something in law like a detective, lawyer, or something around that. But now, since I've found so many interest, I cant decide. I've look at sports medicine mainly because I found it interesting the things I would do for physical therapy after I got an acl tear. Then I've looked at video game development and computer science because I like it. I've also looked at psychology because I've always found the human mind interesting. I've kind of decided not to follow a computer science degree because I k ow with just classes and some camps around me that I could get a job in it without a degree, but the others, i dont know what to decide. I especially want to decide so that I can choose the right u diversity to transfer too because I am going to canada after community college. Would it be possible to get a major in something and minor in something else just to keep all options open. Can anyone give me any advice or anything? I know 1 thing for sure is that I want to help people some how, I've always liked helping people even if it wasnt directly and even if they dont recognize me for the help.\n\nTL/DR: i want to help people somehow, I've always liked helping people, even if it wasnt directly. cant decide between law field, phsycology, computer science, and sports medicine. Is it possible to get a major in 1 thing and minor in another to have my options open.

They can be completely unrelated to each other as long as your school offers them as a minor. I was going to get a major in Zoology and a minor in Creative Writing because I like both of them, but now I decided to major in English Education, minor in Creative Writing, and minor in Teaching English as a Second Language after discovering I don't like taking science classes.\n\nI totally understand what you're going through. I love doing several things but I chose what my favorite thing to do is. That would be Reading and writing.\n\nMy suggestion is for you to research the majors you're interested in. College websites often list the classes that will be required to complete the degree (at least in the U.S.). This is a great way to discover what interests you. If a lot of the classes sound interesting to you, then you should consider doing that major.\n\nAlso, think about what career fields will require a graduate degree. You mentioned law degrees. Sometimes law career fields will require getting a graduate degree or attending law school, which is expensive and time consuming. If you don't want to do these things, then it might not be the best option for you. \n\nThirdly, I would suggest taking more consideration into the things you enjoy nowadays than when you were a kid. There's only a few people I know who have always known what they wanted to do since they were a kid. Most people seem to change their minds throughout life. For example, I wanted to be a famous singer when I was a kid. Now, I have realized that I am terrible at singing and don't really enjoy doing it. I also wanted to be a princess when I grew up, so childhood isn't always the most reliable source of interests. Chances are, what you are interested in these days will be your interests for a lot longer of a time. Obviously, this depends on the person.\n\nI think you just really need to reflect on yourself and your interests. Even things that you think will have no job aspects or are just what you consider hobbies could lead to your dream career. Just make sure not to rush the decision. Even though I'm pretty sold on being a teacher, I'm keeping an open mind to other job aspects. I've even been researching cosmetology programs and schools because I love doing my nails and would love to be a professional nail artist. That's more of a backup plan. I suggest you come up with a backup plan as well, just in case.\nJust figure out who you are and who you want to be. Also, keep an open mind and know that you don't have to make a final decision right now or even in the next few years. Job opportunities will come along the way and open your mind to other possibilities. Hope this helps!", "author": "AnonymousPinkDolphin", "created": 1586907973, "upvotes": 2}}}
