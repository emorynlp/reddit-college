I\u2019ve been told by basically everyone I\u2019ve talked to (except my anthropology professors) that this is a very useless degree. However, I feel like I\u2019m a bit too far in the game to change my major (or at least change it to something drastically different). Not to mention I\u2019m very interested in anthropology, the only issue is I would like to be making at least 90k at some point so I\u2019m thinking I double major or minor in something to make myself more accessible to job offers? But I\u2019m not sure what\u2026 I\u2019m honestly just interested in anything that will make me money, I want to travel, I\u2019m passionate about social justice and I\u2019m good with people. I\u2019m also not sure what would be smart to get my masters in? \n\nIf anyone could give me some advice on what is smart to pair anthropology with, if I should change it or how can I be RICH I will love you forever lol.

Like most liberal arts degrees, anthropology is more supposed to give you a broad set of foundational skills that you can apply to many different problems and careers instead of a specific skillset for one career path. This is not a bad thing, and in fact majoring in a liberal art is a great experience, but unfortunately unless you are savvy or have a very clear idea of how you are going to use the degree after college, it does not have the best job prospects compared to some of the other majors I listed above.\n\nA lot of people with anthropology/English/history/other humanities degrees often end up working in marketing, HR, writing/editing, teaching, sales etc. These are certainly worthwhile careers, but I don't know if you would find them interesting (or if you have even considered them as careers), and the pay may be less than you're comfortable with, on average.\n\nHere's my advice: Do some heavy thinking about what kind of career you want after college. Forget about your degree for a second, just go back to basics. What jobs seem appealing to you? I haven't done this kind of research myself, but I'm sure you could just start looking up random jobs or talk to your career center or something. Make that a priority to think about what kind of job you want. After you figure that out... then you can start thinking about what to major in. And more generally you should cultivate extracurriculars so you can pursue that career and try to get internships in that.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1632540344, "upvotes": 1}}}
