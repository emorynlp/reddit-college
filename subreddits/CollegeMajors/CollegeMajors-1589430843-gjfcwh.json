But IT probably wont get you rich, computer science is much better and more broad anyway. IT is cool but if you're going to school just for money and not interested in the field, skip IT. \nFinance/Econ are similar to IT and typically have high paying jobs. Also engineering is almost always a safe bet for making good money.\nAnd you can be a diplomat with any degree, it's just based on your people skills and your connections to your government. Majors that would help would be political science, but I'd suggest dual majoring with something else to have a back up plan.", "author": "Insomnimanic1", "created": 1589540100, "upvotes": 3}, "fqoojyz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gjfcwh/diplomat_or_it/fqoojyz/", "text": "no one cares about what your parents think or if you get rich or not .
