  "text": "Hello,\n\nSo I'm starting Uni in the fall and I still havent decided on a major. I've been thinking something healthcare, I can tolerate it for the most part and I need a good salary. But idk about med-school or even becoming a nurse. I told my mom health care management but anything other than med-school she always gives a side-eye bc she is a doctor. In my heart at this moment, I can't see myself enjoying med-school or being a doctor. I'm really not a science person, but I can manage. My problem is I can do most things if I try hard enough, even if I hate it. Idk what to do anymore. I've thought about law too but I'm not too sure. And I'm good in psychology but that is like the worst major I heard\n\nTo give a summary of me: I'm a bit introverted, yet outspoken at the Same time. I like to chat with others and give advice, I love making commentary on any and everything. I just want a job that I won't have to work 10+ years just to make less than six figures, and I don't want to be miserable either. Money is very important bc I've experienced how it is to not have much and life was scary back then, never want to go back to that place. I'm so lost and just don't have a passion for much:/",

      "text": "Hmm...I do understand how you feel since I have been through this dilemma.First of, one thing we do have to understand is that there is no perfect career. There will be parts you will like and don't like about it. \nThe question you have to ask yourself is whether you are willing to go through the challenges for the path you choose.\n\nOne way I did try was to look up all the majors that were offered. From there, I research more on what these degree allows you to do as a career, what you will learn in that major and so forth. \n\nThen I look at their courses for those major as well. What do they teach? If for example, you chose an accounting major (what i'm currently doing), and there is a course that says \"principles of accounting\". You can read up books on that specific topic or just basic general accounting if you have no idea what accounting is. You can also watch videos on what accounting is and also ask people around you about their careers in accounting, how was their studies on it etc. Ask their experience, pros and cons of accounting, just ask a lot of questions that might help you give a clearer picture.\n\nIf after all that research and you still haven't gotten frustrated or bored at the accounting book you are reading and that you also want to know more and learn more about accounting and even itching to just use that knowledge on accounting, you can give that major a go. \n\nIf you have done some research and find you are interested in a few majors. Pick the top 3 you most likely would choose and choose 1 from there. \n\nBut remember, as I have said. No career or degree is perfect. There is a lot of \"what if\" but at the end, we have no idea what a degree really teaches you until you go through it. There will be parts you will like and don't like about the possible career you are going into. Everybody's experience in a major and career is different because everybody IS different.\n\nAs for going for the degree for the money, remember, go back to your research. Yes money is good, but is it really what you find yourself interested in? Don't let money cover your eyes on what the major is about. I had a friend who took a degree for this reason and she ended up changing her degree for something else.\n\nIf there comes a point in time you question if the degree that you are doing is what you want. Ask yourself if that you really hate studying this major or you just don't like the way it is being taught etc. \n\nSorry if its a little messy. I do hope this helps a little.",

I'd recommend (if you don't take a gap year) to just either do general arts or science courses first year and try and see what you enjoy. Have you considered being a teacher? A therapist/social worker? Idk how well they are paid where you live but those are options. Public Policy also may be a good option.",
