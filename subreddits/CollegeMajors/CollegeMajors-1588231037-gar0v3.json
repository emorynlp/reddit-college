  "title:": "Realistic prospects for a BS Economics student?",
  "text": "\nTo begin, I am an undergraduate bachelor of science in economics student minoring in data analytics. I go to a small public school in the southern United States, not exactly a bastion of academic acheivement, but probably the second or third best public school in the state. I expect to graduate with well above a 3.0 cumulative GPA, but probably no higher than 3.5. \n\nNow I am not naturally good at mathematics, but I have managed to apply myself and complete basic calculus and statistics courses. I do struggle with more advanced macroeconomic applications (namely the Solow Growth model and its derivatives), and I have yet to take econometrics. I have no issues grasping and discussing (in length) economic concepts, but my quantitative skills are somewhat lacking compared to a typical bachelor of science student. \n\nAll that being said, I suppose my real question is as follows; what are the realistic prospects moving forward for an average BS Economics student with intermediate math skills graduating from a no-name university? Do I need to pursue more advanced maths in order to appear marketable? Also, is graduate school even an option, being so far behind on maths (I don't have too much of an interest in academia, as I have heard it is highly competitive)? Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to be asking such questions. But any help would be greatly appreciated. After reading other places on the internet, I am beginning to think I may have chosen the wrong path due to my lack of high level math skills, and that the only economics majors who do well graduate from prominent northeastern universities.",
