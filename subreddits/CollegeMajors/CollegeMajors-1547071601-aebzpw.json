It doesn\u2019t matter what the degree is in, they\u2019ll hire you because they feel that it\u2019s not so much what you know, but the dedication you put into something for four or so years. A lot of office jobs are like that, and while a degree in something related could help get you hired, it really doesn\u2019t matter that much to them. \n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s also jobs that will hire you for the skill set you have, but again, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the degree is in, as long as it contains the skills they\u2019d want. For example, I saw a job opening for a mapping project that was going on in my area. They only required that the applicant have a degree in: Anthropology, Geography, GIS, Geology, or anything else slightly related to mapping. Again, you wouldn\u2019t officially be an Anthropologist or a Geologist, but a cartographer. Another example would be someone majoring in sociology, and because of their skill sets, they get hired into Human Resources.\n\nNow, there are certainly degrees that have a higher likelihood of working in the field, such as Engineering, and those that have a lower likelihood, such as Classics. Some people want to major in something like the latter, but don\u2019t really want to go to graduate school. That\u2019s fine, and there\u2019s plenty of jobs they can still get with their degree, but there is not many in the actual field with just a bachelors. On the contrary, Engineering doesn\u2019t necessarily require graduate school, so the bachelors is usually fine for them. \n\nNow, if you want to work in whatever your field is, by all means, go for it! People usually mention this so you know you have other options, but plenty of people go on to work in whatever field they majored in as well. It really just depends on what someone wants to do, and if they can afford to reach the education level of their desired field. ", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1547076793, "upvotes": 2}}}
