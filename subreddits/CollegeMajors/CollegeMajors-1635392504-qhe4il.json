  "title:": "Want to Change Major, but Cant Stay Another Second at my College.. Advice?",
  "text": "So I'm a Physics Major right now and I had prospects on going to grad school. But, frankly, the coursework is killing me and I really don't wanna do grad school now. I'm worried about future jobs after grad, and I'd rather be able to have a good job right after college, and study physics as a passion on my own. I'm thinking of CS, But I'll probably have to stay here another year to finish the major. \n\nBut I'm honestly hating the school I'm at now. A big part of me doing physics for so long was bc I spend time trying to transfer. I could try again (am a junior) but I'll have to stay here as a plan b. But I don't even know if I could stay another semester.\n\nI feel really stuck and running out of time to make a choice. Advice?",
