It was my first test in the class also in person since COVID happened. My mom told me that she was worrying and wants me to change my major to like accounting. I was upset over my test grade since I tried my best and did study. However my final exam grade will also substitute my lowest test grade meaning I have to ace all these upcoming tests (HOPEFULLYYY). Since she is stressing I can tell and she also told me that I spend a lot of time studying but that's me doing homework everyday. I am a freshman but have so much homework. I also do work weekends so my days off from school/work are spent doing homework. I was asked what do I wanna do when I grow up. I really don't know. If I'm gonna be honest I just wanna be a twitch streamer or a house wife of a rich man in Dubai living in a penthouse. I just wanna be rich and wealthy because I grew up poor, obviously I won't become evil but I'm gonna do good with the money. I know computer-science will get me a lot of money (hopefully) and I like playing games so I kind of put them together and got comp sci to major in. Now I'm lost and don't know what to do. I also wasn't thinking of even switching my major until my mom pointed it out.  \n\n\ntl;dr Failed pre-calc test and now I'm lost and don't know if I wanna do comp-sci anymore.", "author": "nahlikeno", "created": 1632544372, "retrieved": 1632957532, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heb2td8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/puzomo/dropping_comp_sci/heb2td8/", "text": "Computer science, as a subject, is essentially applied math. A lot of the course load will be eaten up by programming courses, but you should expect to take a good number of math classes as well, including a couple of semesters of calculus, discrete math, data structures and algorithms (a mixture of math and programming), linear algebra, computer science theory, and maybe a stats class or something else. Now, a lot of this math is different from the math you're probably used to, and in my experience is more logic based than formulas/rote exercises, but it is still math nonetheless, and people who were good at calculus in high school generally tended to do well in these courses as well. \n\nIf math really is something you're not good at, I would personally not recommend computer science. Now obviously I cannot gauge from 1 post how good at math you are, but if you are struggling with pre calc, there is a good chance you are going to have an even harder time with those other math classes I mentioned. I would only recommend sticking it out if you really really love programming, since there are some people who are good at programming but bad at math. But in your case, it seems like you are mainly in it for the money and stability (understandable), and because of a vague and spurious connection between playing games on the computer and computer science. \n\nI'm not going to straight up recommend you to change to another field, but I think accounting may be more up your alley if you think the math of CS will be a serious issue for you. Not to say accounting is easy, but I have heard the math involved is not super complex. Also, I don't mean to come off as insensitive, if you honestly want to become a house wife to some rich guy, why not do that? There are rich men out there looking for college aged wives, lol.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1632629817, "upvotes": 1}, "he7iigi": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/puzomo/dropping_comp_sci/he7iigi/", "text": "I have a CS degree..\n\nIn my experience, the people who go in thinking that because they like video games they\u2019ll like CS, don\u2019t last very long. \n\nIt\u2019s more - do you like being at your computer for hours and hours working on a problem?

If so - that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get from CS. If not\u2026maybe considering switching (accounting is great and an awesome choice by the way). \n\nJust to clarify, you do get better at problem solving.
