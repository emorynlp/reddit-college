Right now I am starting my freshman year at my uni as a Digital Arts & Culture. I chose this major because I was stuck on what to do and figured that it was a mashup of web design and graphics.

Considering I am creative and looking for future job opportunities while the digital world is still growing, what would be a good minor with marketing for me? Or maybe should I stick to Digital Arts? Also, don't know if this matters but I'm considering moving out of the US after graduation, preferably in Eastern or Western Europe.", "author": "ansand202", "created": 1630651710, "retrieved": 1632846497, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbizcnp": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pgzv5e/looking_for_advice_on_what_to_major_in/hbizcnp/", "text": "It might depend on what you're interested in. If you think the graphic design aspects of marketing are appealing, then graphic design could be a good option. But in marketing I think your overall skills are going to be more important than having a specific minor, especially in digital marketing where a lot of skills aren't taught in universities. Getting certified for Adwords or SEO might be a helpful thing to get better at.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1630724817, "upvotes": 1}}}
