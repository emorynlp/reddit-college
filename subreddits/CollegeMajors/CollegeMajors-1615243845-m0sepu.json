I have tried to decide based on intrests but the things I am intrested in either require extreme luck to get a job, the job outlook is tiny, or the only viable jobs are things I would hate. I have a really hard time identifying my strengths and weaknessess. Some of my intrests are video games, film, and history. I know that I am generally fulfilled by being creative, I also love storytelling and analysing stories. Currently I am planning on going to community college to complete my general education (and to buy myself time to decide what I want to do without spending tens of thousands of dollars). How am I supposed to decide my major? I would really apprecieate some advice.
