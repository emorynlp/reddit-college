It is so much fun just to have the freedom to create, and in this exploration I discovered my passion for coding.\n\nNow I'm no genius or what have you, in fact my C in Grade 12 would love to say otherwise but I know that this is what will make me happy.\n\nSo basically my advice is to not just do something for the money, but to try and follow something you are really passionate about. But also be realistic about the job market, if that is one of your concerns.\n\ntl;dr follow your dreams my dudes.", "author": null, "created": 1544387062, "retrieved": 1632956749, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ec1ugdw": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a4odhz/to_anyone_thinking_of_changing_majors/ec1ugdw/", "text": "Doing criminal justice right now I was undecided whether or not to continue with this major, but then I started to take courses and I started liking it a lot, now I want to be part of the criminal justice field to help people, I talked with detectives/officers/court officers all of them said that the job is stressful sometimes but when you resolve a case and help someone is a joy beyond money that last a lifetime I want to do that too :)", "author": null, "created": 1545149613, "upvotes": 2}, "ebnlppz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a4odhz/to_anyone_thinking_of_changing_majors/ebnlppz/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1544648371, "upvotes": 4}, "ebg9uno": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a4odhz/to_anyone_thinking_of_changing_majors/ebg9uno/", "text": "Ha ha, just \"going through the motions\" in your kinesiology classes...very good!", "author": "prairiedad", "created": 1544388564, "upvotes": 11}}}
