  "text": "I\u2019m in highschool rn and I really just have no idea where I\u2019m headed in terms of choosing a major and what I want to do for a living. \nI mainly like math and chemistry and hate history. I enjoy pure math overall but also like statistics and all that lol. Chemistry is fun and I do pretty well in that class.\nAlso nothing super business heavy if that makes sense lmao. I have experience from taking business classes but don\u2019t see myself doing something rlly focused on that.",
