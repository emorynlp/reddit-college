(troubled college student not knowing what to do)", "text": "Hey, guys, so I just feel really lost right now about my career path and am just not sure if I'd rather do premed (thinking primary care such as pediatrician or family practice) or engineering.\n\nFor the longest time, I've wanted to be a doctor all my life and I do like helping people but for some reason during senior year of high school, I decided against it due to it being so long and watching a variety of youtube videos that say it isn't worth it, so I did some research and applied for computer engineering because I like math and engineering is bascially applied math, but now I am just really unsure about what I truly want to do since I'm not really good at programming as seen in my experience at my previous institution (but maybe I can get better?) but I do like math though.\n\nI'm currently transferring to another school, so I'm kinda running out of time, but what advice can you guys give? From a financial perspective, which would be better? should I do premed after all (as a bioengineering major since I already finished some advanced math courses) or just stick to computer engineering?\n\nI know people say all the time to not go into medicine for the money but with the salary of a doctor, wouldn't it be simple to pay back those student loans in a few years and then catch up to the engineer? or would becoming an engineer be better financially?\n\n **Edit: Money aside, what would your guys' advice for me to figure out what I really want to do?** \n\n**PS**: Sorry guys if it sounds like I'm only doing it for the money; it is a factor (being the 1st in my family to go to college) but not the main one. I'm considering medicine because I do like helping people and becoming a doctor has always been my dream since I was a kid until senior year of high school where I decided to reevaluated what I wanted, but it's still been in the back of my mind. On the other hand, I'm considering engineering due to my love of math.", "author": "Your_Weeb_Senpai", "created": 1627425156, "retrieved": 1632957416, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h6wnlht": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oswvil/is_med_school_worth_it_do_doctors_or_engineers/h6wnlht/", "text": "If you're considering engineering and like math, try Aerospace or Electrical Engineering.\n\nI'd also consider Math or Stats with CS or another practical degree (like Econ/Finance).\n\nYou could still work in medicine with a Math background.
