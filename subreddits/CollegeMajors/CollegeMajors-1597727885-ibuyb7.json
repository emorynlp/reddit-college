      "text": "Not me, but a lot of people I know have done it. If you go to a prestigious or well known school, it can lead to a lot of lucrative job offers in consulting or banking. If not, it's more hit or miss, but still not a bad option. The main downside is that it's a liberal arts degree, so it's not going to \"prepare\" you for a specific career path. You'll have to do the research to see what kind of job you want and how you can apply your degree to it. It also gives you a lot of technical skills, since you'll probably have to take econometrics, stats, calculus, and Lin algebra classes.",
