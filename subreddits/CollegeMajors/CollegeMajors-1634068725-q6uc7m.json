  "title:": "Art Education or Choral Music Education Major?",
  "text": "Should I (F18) major in Art Education or Music Education with a Choral emphasis? I'm taking a year off before college and I have until April to apply. \nFirst of all I know I want to be a teacher for sure because I want to have a positive impact on kids. I want to do an art related major because I want to be able to spend time caring about the kids and not have to stress as much about if they learned what they need to graduate. Instead I want them to have fun, feel safe, and learn what they want to know going into life and college.\n\nMusic Education Major Reasons:\n\u2022 I \u2728lived\u2728 in choir in high school. That's where all the best memories are, it was my safe, happy place, I could do what I loved there.\n\u2022 My mom majored in music and at an intense private college, so she's kind of scared me. \n\u2022 I've been singing all my life and am pretty good at it but could work on it more.\n\u2022 I can play the piano somewhat and with a little more practice I could be pretty decent at it. \n\u2022 I don't play any other instrument.\n\u2022 I can read music slowly, and I can only sort of sing it from sight.\n\u2022 I sing when I do everything and I get chills when I hear a large group of people sing together.\n\u2022 Singing helps me release emotions and express myself, and I would love to help kids do that too.\n\u2022 I never got sick of choir. I could sing and work on it and play piano all day every day.\n\nArt Education Major:\n\u2022 I had a crappy art teacher in high school so I didn't love the class so much.\n\u2022 I am mostly self taught\n\u2022 I was considered the best at art at my small school, but would by no means be anywhere near the best at a college.\n\u2022 I am really great at drawing, but I love painting best.\n\u2022 I'm less scared of this major's classes in college.\n\u2022 From what I've seen kids don't take art quite as seriously as choir, so that scares me\n\u2022 I am best at drawing, sculpting, painting, and oil pastels, calligraphy. I'm worst at carving, and anything on a computer. I can do any kind of art and it usually ends up decent except things on a computer.\n\u2022 I love the creativity and the ability to express yourself and emotions with art, and I would love to inspire kids with it.\n\u2022 I would get burned out and tired of art class because I hated being assigned very specific art things to do every day, and some days I just didn't feel like doing art.\n\nI'm not really worried about not being able to catch on or learn things because I was first in class in high school. I'm just worried I'll get burned out or it will be so much work, or I'll be too far behind in learning things, so it'll take too much work to catch up and figure things out. Basically I'm worried about burnout in and after college. (Also, I have ADHD)",
