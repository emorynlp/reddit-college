  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm really not doing well right now, as I can't decide on a major combination. I have class registrations for Fall April 7 thru April 9, and the departments could need a week to get me added if I choose their major. So I don't have much time. \n\nI've lost sleep over this, panicked over this, I'm absolutely miserable about this. I'm going into my senior year this Fall and I don't have it figured out. \n\nTo make it worse, I'm an international student and I'll need to extend my permission to study in the US by April 20...and by then, my majors should be final. \n\nI literally spent the last week talking to 9 other departments and all of them were good matches. I had multiple professors tell me they wanted to do undergrad research with me. While this should make me happy, all it did was make things worse...I was praying for clarity, that something would scream at me: \"You must pursue this!!!\" But no matter what, it all seemed to match. Everything was a good fit, everyone wanted to sign me up right away. I talked to department reps of all kinds, everything from creative writing to mathematics. I have too many interests, I can't figure this out. The fact that I'm international also means I don't have forever to play around and figure it out. The school wants me to get done at some point. \n\nI'm currently double-majoring in physics (BS) and economics (BA). I'm doing really well with that combination, but I don't enjoy it like I thought I would. \n\nI'm missing the humanities approach, the writing, the narrating. I used to dream of writing about the history of money, the philosophy of money, where it comes from, what universal concepts are behind it. But then I started getting nervous that this would leave me poor. I started worrying that I needed to work towards a 'real' job in tech etc. Hence the switch. \n\nI was talking to the anthropology department and would like to double-major in anthropology and quantitative economics (I'd also have a BS and BA with this combination). The anthropology advisor, a professor in the department, said he'd like to do an independent study with me because he liked the questions I had about human beings and money, but I've been reading that anthropology is hard to sell outside of academia. \n\nWhat also flows into this is that my mom is here in the US, and I'd like to try studying something that could get me a job here so I can be with her. She applied for a Green Card for me, but that could take years. So, a job here would be the bridge I'd need to gap this time. I'm trying to choose something I love and something employable. I feel like the things I love are always the least employable by today's market standards. \n\nI've been looking at CS or data science as well, but it doesn't feel like my heart is in it. \n\nIf anyone could give me some advice, some outlook, or maybe just share a few kind words, I'd really appreciate it. I wish you all the very best.",

      "text": "Anthropology will not help you get a job in the U.S.\n\nI know a lot of bartenders and baristas with Anthropology degrees, even PhD in some cases. The competition for academic roles is fierce and usually only the well connected or truly exceptional make the cut.\n\nCS and Data Science open up a ton of high-paying career options. Definitely weigh your priorities though - I chose a less fun career path for more money, and value the life it gives my family, but that\u2019s partly because my priorities changed in my late 20\u2019s when kids came into the picture.

I do think Physics is generally considered less useful than engineering in most business settings, but I think there are exceptions. Economics is generally looked at like a business degree - softer and less useful than STEM, but you can still compete for business analyst-type roles especially if you pair it with some basic data analysis/ data science skills.",

You should consider a different major, such as communications, finance, or other stem majors like biology (and physics like you mentioned,) since that can land you a bunch of opportunities.",
