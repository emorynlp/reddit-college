Lately I\u2019ve been debating a lot about switching my major to chemical engineering; however, that would probably result in an extra year of undergrad. I\u2019m honestly just really stuck between keeping my current major or switching to chemE.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in a similar situation? Or any advice/insight whatsoever?", "author": "haleynaperkowski", "created": 1623260099, "retrieved": 1632846519, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h17kjb1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nw1in3/chemistry_vs_cheme/h17kjb1/", "text": " I'm doing a major in both ChemE and Chemistry, in my first year  I get both subjects but  in my second year I will need to decide between either ChemE or Chemistry major. I also couldn't decide between the two majors so I choose studie that has both . But  the difference between ChemE and Chemistry is that  ChemE is more thermodynamics and more math (physics to) and Chemistry is more reactions and synthesis. But it depends if you love math, thermodynamics and physics you should switch to ChemE. But it really depends where do you see your self in 5 or 10 years?  Do you see yourself working in a lab  or  working in a office at a industrial plant overseeing the process. Also it is always good for a ChemE student to have a bit of Chemistry knowledge,because if I am not wrong there are some jobs that combine the two a little.", "author": "Jumbo2895", "created": 1623277094, "upvotes": 3}, "h17jh8i": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nw1in3/chemistry_vs_cheme/h17jh8i/", "text": "I think it would be worth it, there's a lot more jobs for chemical engineering majors.", "author": "sluttyjubilee", "created": 1623276618, "upvotes": 1}}}
