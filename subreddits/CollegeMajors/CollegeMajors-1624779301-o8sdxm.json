  "text": "(19f)\n\nI'm graduating next year with an AS in Business Management, but I know that I don't want to pursue a BS in BM. I usually get excited at the thought of something, become completely obsessed with and invested in it, and then move on to something else (my current obsession is Chemistry, the one before that was Psychology). I don't know what to get my Bachelors in as I'm easily bored and flit from interest to interest. Can anyone offer me advice? I already feel like I'm failing since the plan was to have my Bachelor by 20 (finished HS at 16).",

If anything you're only a year behind but even that isn't that big of a deal. You're not a failure at all. You're just trying to figure out your place in life. Everyone has a different journey in life and just because yours doesn't align with society's expectations doesn't mean you're a failure.\n\nIf you're still interested in psychology but it was the path ahead that deters you I would pursue that. I noticed you said you get bored easily, I'm the same way but what I do to help ensure I stay interested is I have a number of hobbies I turn to when I get bored instead of changing fields. The hobbies will provide a buffer because some people just need to have multiple things to focus on.",
