I usually get excited at the thought of something, become completely obsessed with and invested in it, and then move on to something else (my current obsession is Chemistry, the one before that was Psychology). I don't know what to get my Bachelors in as I'm easily bored and flit from interest to interest. Can anyone offer me advice? I already feel like I'm failing since the plan was to have my Bachelor by 20 (finished HS at 16).", "author": "colorixed", "created": 1624779301, "retrieved": 1632957558, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4eh31l": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o8sdxm/i_need_help_choosing_an_area_of_study/h4eh31l/", "text": "why do u nred to finish high school by 16? whats the point?", "author": "ghostmode342", "created": 1625693582, "upvotes": 1}, "h3747rj": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o8sdxm/i_need_help_choosing_an_area_of_study/h3747rj/", "text": "Is there any interest you keep coming back to?", "author": "ze_shotstopper", "created": 1624787573, "upvotes": 2}}}
