  "title:": "Is there a major difference between a health science degree and medical lab science?",
  "text": "I am debating between two schools to transfer to. One has a health science program and is considered the flagship school and the other has a medical lab science program. I think the medical lab science program would be interesting. I would like to know if there is a major difference and if getting a medical lab science degree would give me some kind of edge. The MLS program also offers clinical experience. \n\nI plan on applying for my masters eventually in maybe biostats, pharmacy, or anesthesiology. I am also double majoring in stats as well. I was considering jobs such as a CRA position in the interim too.",
