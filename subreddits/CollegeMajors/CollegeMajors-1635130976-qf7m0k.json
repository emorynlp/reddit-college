      "text": "I'd say pick the industry of the business you want to own and major in whatever it takes to get your foot in the door of the industry to learn. Then eventually own your own. Minor in business. \n\nIf you want to own a tech company study something in tech. \n\nIf you want to own a real estate company. Study something around that. \n\nYou get the point.\n\nYou might be better off studying accounting, finance, web design or something that can save you alot of upfront cost when you open your business. A business major has gotten increasingly useless.",

In marketing ur gonna just mostly learn how to advertise and study mostly sales related things , also accounting sets you up for the majority of all business jobs/careers anyway.\nIf u were interested, business admin is also a good option",
