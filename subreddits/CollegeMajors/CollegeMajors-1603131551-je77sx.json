Degree while getting my prerequisites for the Associates in Science and Nursing (A.S.N.) program. I want them to be two separate degrees, not my A.A. turning into my A.S.N. \n\nThe reason being is because in case something happens, I don\u2019t want to be left with college credits and no degree. My question is, what I\u2019m trying to do is possible right? I know it may sound weird but it\u2019s what I want to do. \n\nCan I get an A.A. and then transfer into the A.S.N program?", "author": "Swirlsntwirls", "created": 1603131551, "retrieved": 1632847179, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gbftwrq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/je77sx/nursing_major_help/gbftwrq/", "text": "I\u2019m currently doing the coursework for both an AA and AS in Econ and Math, respectively.
