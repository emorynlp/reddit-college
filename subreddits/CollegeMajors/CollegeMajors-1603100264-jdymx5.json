  "text": "I've shifted between engineering fields without having gone into the upper level courses. I know I have a strong ability to reason with logic as well as analytical thinking. I have a decent mind for math as well. I've gone from Chemical Engineering(it felt like my brain didn't quite click with chemistry) to Computer Engineering. But I dropped my Intro to Programming class because as of late it feels like there are too many precise pieces of knowledge needed for coding for me to be effective at it. \n\nAny advice for potential fields that I could try or ways to go about removing what I don't want to do would be appreciated. How have you gone about this part of the journey?",
