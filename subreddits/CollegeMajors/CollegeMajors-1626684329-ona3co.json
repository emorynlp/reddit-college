  "text": "Hi, I graduated from high school about 2 years ago now and since I\u2019ve been working in a factory, which I\u2019ve absolutely hated with every fiber of my body. Forced overtime, forced weekend work, and working midnights means I have very little time for myself and time to do things. Over the past two years I went from line worker to one of the best operators in the shop, better than those that have been here 30-40 years. Overtime money is okay, but I\u2019m always drained afterwards and only get more drained from more of it since it never really tends to stop. But in all actuality, I kinda do enjoy my job at times, as the machine operator I\u2019m responsible for the people on my production line, keeping the machine running, making robot program adjustments, and basic troubleshooting and diagnosis of machine problems. The only thing I really hate is the overtime. After working here I\u2019ve been considering pursuing an engineering degree, but the thought of potential long hours like I endure already don\u2019t make me too enthusiastic about that choice. I had no interest in engineering or factory work before working here, my dad got me a job here and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t quit in the first week, the constant 12 hour shifts and weekends and the 12 hours on weekends meant I\u2019ve never really got to enjoy my teen years and pursue college like I would\u2019ve liked to. I\u2019ve got enough money to quit and go to school full time at my local community college. While in high school, what I really wanted to do was pursue some sort of computer science or IT degree, since I have a huge interest in technology like phones, computers and whatnot. My other career/major choice would potentially be psychology, I do enjoy listening to peoples problems and helping them the best that I can. I\u2019m very uncertain as to what I\u2019d like to do, and haven\u2019t the first clue as to what would be right for me.\nEdit: My only real goals in life are to be able to not live paycheck to paycheck like my parents did and do, I\u2019d prefer to be better off than them in life as my dad would like me to as well, I\u2019d like to be able to be a home owner one day, and be able to support up to 2 future children, essentially, I just want a career path that will give me the ability to be able to afford to take care of myself, the kids, hopefully my future spouse will have a job of their own, my current significant other has hopes of the medical field, pay a mortgage, be able to save money for retirement, yearly vacations, a new car every 10-15 years, and I cannot stress this enough, free time to actually spend with family and friends, this manufacturing crap doesn\u2019t really offer that at all.\nMy current game plan is to build up some more cash from this job, quit, get a part time job and attend college either full, or part time. Beginning this fall or next year in the fall. I\u2019d like to keep this job while going to college due to the ability to afford things thanks to overtime, but I\u2019m not someone who can work 60-80 hours a week and have time for school, I\u2019d either suffer in work performance, or suffer in school performance, neither of which I\u2019d like to do.",

      "text": "not going for engineering is short term vision.  engineering is a high paying job and if u play it right, u can retire for good in mid 30.\n\nmajority of people get psychology degree, then go back to school for second round, to get more marketable degree, i never understood it, why not just get marketable degree right from start",

      "text": "It sounds like the last couple of years has been tough. It looks like you learned a lot from it. \n\nCheck out the Occupational Outlook Handbook. [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)  It has occupation groups and breaks out a lot of information you are looking for like pay, growth, and lifestyle. \n\nYou know, the first 2 years of college you could declare a liberal arts or interdisciplinary studies major. Get the general education or foundation classes over with while you decide what you want to do. You don't have to use the whole 2 years to decide. You can change your major any time you want. It's just a means to buy time and still move towards your goal.\n\nTake advantage of your college's student services/career center. They have a lot of information. Spend time finding out what would suit you. It's worth the time to do it.\n\nFit in some time for fun while you take classes. You earned it.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "If you do end up getting interested in working along the lines of listening to people's problems and helping them, you'd be looking at either counselling or social work. Counselling is more of person-to-person help while social work focuses more of the big picture. Psychology is more of the research side. Though to paint a clearer picture, counselling =/= therapy, those 2 overlap a lot, but their capability to help their client legally is different (this is the case for my country, it may be different in others). So if this still interest you, I'd recommend to find another appropriate subreddit to ask people in the field of their opinions. \n\nBut I must say Computer Science definitely opens a whole lot of doors, while there's also much more within that branch itself. So again, do your research or find an appropriate subreddit to help you with your search.\n\nSafe to say is I believe both branches will definitely promise some sort of stable income, but CS definitely has much more opportunity to rise in ranks compared to Psychology/counselling. \n\nWish you the best of luck!",
