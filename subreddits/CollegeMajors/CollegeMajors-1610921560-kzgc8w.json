  "text": "I am an international (indian) student and have been accepted into two universities\n1. Master of Biotechnology at Texas A&M University (received a scholarship that waives off my international tuition fee)\n2. Master of Science in Biotechnology and Entrepreneurship at (New York University, Tandon School of Engineering with a $20,000 scholarship)\n\nIm looking for a program that will enable me to work in a lifescience company (business/industry oriented), although i do not want to lose my chance of pursuing a PhD. \n\nI've heard that students of master of biotechnology (a PSM degree) arent preffered into research positions. Is this really true?",

Suitable for students who are interested in early stage technology companies and/or aspire to start*\n\nFor the A&M program, it looks to be \n\n*The MBIOT degree is a Professional Science Master\u2019s (PSM) degree. These innovative degrees prepare graduates for science careers in business, government and the non-profit sector, and emphasize advanced scientific knowledge and professional skills such as communication, project development, and commercialization.*\n\nThey look pretty similar. Both seem to have a business focus, and keep in mind that the Biotech field will be SURGING after Covid.",
