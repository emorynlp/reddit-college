Registration for the Fall Semester starts soon and I\u2019m running out of time so I need to choose a major. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to tells me to just choose one and if I don\u2019t like it, then I can simply switch to another. But the thing is even choosing one. single. major. is hard for me. My friend tells me it\u2019s because I can\u2019t find a major I like that I have a back-up plan for, meaning it\u2019s hard for me to personally find a major that I think is reliable. I\u2019m always that friend who is indecisive and overthinks a lot and I like to stay organized. I\u2019m very introverted and at my current part-time job, I find it hard for me to make small talk with the customers. I feel like everything I say to them is forced out and unnatural unlike my coworkers who are very people orientated. \nRight now I don\u2019t have any passions or hobbies. I use to be in drum-line in high school but music is not something I would personally pursue career wise. In my free time I surf around social media looking at memes or hangout with my brother. I kinda feel empty in a sense that I don\u2019t have a passion to drive me towards a career path or anything.\nI don\u2019t mind an office job, I\u2019ve always like the idea of a fun office setting. Some of the majors/careers I\u2019ve considered are psychology (but I don\u2019t want to go to grad school for that), statistics, nursing (only because all my Filipino relatives tell me that\u2019s what I should do), accounting, medical laboratory, health science, architect (because both my parents are currently architects) and even event planning (only because I follow someone on instagram who is an event planner and it looks like a fun job, but I feel like I\u2019m way too shy for that).\nI don\u2019t know what I expect from this post, I kind of just needed to let it out. If you read this entire post thank you for your time.", "author": "chickennugss", "created": 1551730510, "retrieved": 1632956987, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "comments": {"eivnylb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/axbrdd/why_is_it_so_hard_for_me_to_choose_a_major/eivnylb/", "text": "I would not rule out event planning just because you are shy, I am very shy and introverted and as I started to get more experience at work and school I started to become more comfortable in certain social situations. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll ever become a social butterfly but I\u2019ve learned to interact with people and not feel constantly anxious and drained at the end of the day. \n\nI would not suggest nursing just because your family is pushing you towards it. While it\u2019s a great career for the right person, it is a high stress job and it\u2019s one that\u2019s gonna require a lot of constant social interaction, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good combination for most introverts. \n\nAccounting and medical laboratory both sound like they might be up your alley. Maybe major in something like biology for now and take an accounting class and do some job shadowing in other areas that interest you so you can narrow down your interests. That way you have a path chosen but there are still chances to change directions if you want to.

I'm the same way in being introverted, and if you end up in a job where you're directly communicating with clients, the questions asked between you and them are petty straightforward, yes or no responses usually. I worked as a tax assistant for a woman who owned her own tax business and listened to a lot of her phone calls with clients. \n\nBut in the end, choose something you enjoy, and good luck!
