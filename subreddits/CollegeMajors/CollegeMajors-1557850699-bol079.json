I didn't think this would be me. Even my English teacher in hs told me, \"yeah, you're not like that, you'll graduate in four years.\" But, here I am. Talking to my different advisors seems like I'll just get judged(honors college advising, my program advisor and my major advisor). So, I'm testing the waters here.\n\nI have 3 years until I have to graduate. I have around 54-56 credits and my gpa is around a 3.2. \n\nThe thing about the push to stem is that you get told all the good things and that \"anyone can do it.\" So, I started in physiology(thought I wanted to be a physical therapist because of a hs class). Then I changed it to computer science when I finally got through the doors because I liked technology and the career path( didn't have to talk to so many people, I changed a bit since I can now do more social interaction).\n\nOnly thing is that my math placement score were abysmal. Not surprising. My english score pretty much saved my SATs. But, not to worry, a group was just founded that connected underscoring math people in stem majors to resources. The program worked for most people, actually one of the most successful programs to be launched as an \"experiment\" for my uni.  Heck, I was considered \"successful\" because my gpa was 3.65 and I was invited to the honor's college after I was rejected because my SAT scores were 20? points below the threshold. But, my lowest grade was algebra. 3.0(80), on the back of a 3.5(90), but still a 3.0(80). I should have knew then because all of the rest of the engineering peers had 4.0s(100s) easily and were mostly invited to assit the class after the semester ended. But, I was advised to keep grinding. And I wanted to because I wanted to be successful at something and my mom was proud because she thought I was on the way to a lucrative field in comparison to my older sister who went the social work route(I'm first generation, btw).\n\n\nA breakdown of my spring freshman year gpa and lowest grades: \n\n\nSpring\n Overall GPA: 3.3 \nTrig: 2.0 \n\"Easy\" starting engineering class: 2.0\n\n*Well, keep grinding.*\n\nA breakdown of my summer lowest grades and gpa \n\nSummer:\n\n Overall Gpa: 2.8\n\n Physics 1: 1.5 \n\nCalc: 0.0\n\n*Well, it was the summer. I seen worse. Now, you're eligible to finally take the first programming class. Don't know. You'll might like it. *\n\nSo, instead of going to career fairs because I was embarrassed by my gpa even though I gotten interviews (and failed them) earlier, I tried working on my gpa.\n\n\nMy fall sophomore year gpa \n\nFall:\n\n Gpa:3.0(on probation with hc) \n\nMath: dropped it \n\nProgramming: 2.5\n\n\nMy latest grades: \n\nSpring:\n\n Gpa:3.25\n\n Calc: 2.5 \n\n\nProgramming II: dropped it before it started, was too shell shocked.\n\n\n\nInstead, I went down the lists of alternative majors and started with classes for those. It went pretty good. I 4.0ed those majors classes, although I did somehow must have failed my philosophy exam and ended up with a 3.0.\n\nSo, here I am. My options were to go either a ux route or an \"IT\" route. I'm leaning towards IT. But, my parents aren't thinking that it's \"good\" enough and that'll I'll be wasting the degree learning things that can be self taught. A lot of my fanfare has died down and they want me to reconsider a major I scratched out freshman year even after doing well in the related class. It's a business degree with a focus on the food industry. Lots of science and business. I did better in my science classes (3.5s) than I did in my math classes, so that's something.\n\nHere's how they compare:\n\nIT major: \n\nStarting rate:? \n\nPlacement rate: 97% \n\nTime to finish: 33-40 more credits\n\nBusiness major: \n\nStarting rates: 45,000\n\n Placement rate: 99%\n\n Time to finish: 50-60 more credits\n\nMy upcoming fall and spring semester are full of classes from the ux major to the it major, though I'm leaning towards the IT major. The IT major is popular at my school, the ux major is just starting and the business one is the most highly regarded. But, I'll be basically choosing a whole new career path. Sure the classes looked standard enough and the stability seems a bit better, but I'm not sure at this point if I should just get any degree at this point and be done with it or if that's just defeat talking. Plus, I talked to one of my friends whose in a business major and she said they want to see an internship every single year, so I'll be behind in that regard.\n\nTL:DR: Former comp sci junior who went from a 3.6 gpa to a 3.2 gpa because of math and engineering classes. Trying to decide between business(longer time to complete) vs IT major(easier to complete, less regard) .", "author": "Whoknew98", "created": 1557850699, "retrieved": 1632957515, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {}}
