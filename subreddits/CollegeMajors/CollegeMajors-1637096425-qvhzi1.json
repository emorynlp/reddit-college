  "text": "I am currently in a marketing degree online and don't know if its really what I want to study. I want to be able to make a comfortable wage out of college. I currently work in sales and I don't mind the work its just I don't feel like I have as much of a passion for it as much as i would with photography or graphic design. Does anyone have any insight on what to do? Or if you were in a similar situation.",
