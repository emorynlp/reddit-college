  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm reaching to this wonderful community because I am trying to decide which college I should pick. I would be an international student from Peru, and I am not sure which college can be the better pick for the Broadcasting and TV Diploma program. **Humber, Seneca, Canadore and Durham Colleges** seem to have very good courses in their curriculum, but I am aiming to focus in Editing and Post Production.\n\nDoes anybody here have a preference and why. *Which program have the best option for post production?*\n\nThanks a lot in advance for the comments.",
