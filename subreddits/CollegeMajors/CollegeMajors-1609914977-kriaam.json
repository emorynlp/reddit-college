I am having difficulty deciding what major to go with. These two subjects are so fascinating to me. web development and biotechnology (molecular biosciences). I have had some experience with coding and writing websites unit ever since high school I\u2019ve been interested in biotechnology.\n\nWeb development- its amazing how simple text files can be linked together and form websites. Also how editing styles for color schemes and backgrounds, layouts, fonts work with external Style sheets and what not.\n\nBiotechnology- I took a course in high school about how dna works and how cells reproduce(you know basic high school knowledge ) then I took a course in college and we learned more about codons and mRNA and how basically it will be important in the future from medicines to agriculture and more. \n\nClasses start in about a month. Thanks for all who respond.

And computer science has a lot of application to biology as well, considering the field of bioinformatics. But I would not recommend majoring in \"web development,\" if that is indeed the name of the major. The reason is that web frameworks change so quickly that it isn't really possible to structure a curriculum on it. Computer science is better if you want to go into web dev because the curriculum is timeless and can be applied to many more fields.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1609988300, "upvotes": 2}}}
