I (20F) have been studying Japanese for about 4ish years, and have had an aspiration to become a Japanese translator for a while. After getting a translation license and graduating, I had planned on becoming a translator so I could get a job either translating medical documents or being a traveling translator for business persons (translating Japanese to English and vice versa). My only issue, at the moment, is that I have already taken all levels of Japanese at my community college, and I've been out of practice for almost a whole year. I don't have any Japanese friends either and didn't make any friends during all the semesters of Japanese I've taken.\n\nAt the moment, I'm enrolled in an Oceanography lecture class and I'm really enjoying it. It's really fun learning about the different ecosystems, the history of the ocean, the behavior of waves and wave energy, and the interesting organisms that dwell in all levels of the ocean. \n\nI'm highly considering going for some sort of Marine Science or Marine Biology major instead of Language Translation. Anyone have any suggestions?", "author": "hyliabunny", "created": 1575316800, "retrieved": 1632956981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
