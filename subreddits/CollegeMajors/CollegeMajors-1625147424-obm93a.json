Very directly applicable, and most STEM jobs require at least a bit of coding know-how. \n\nMath will likely only be a couple classes on top of what you need for Aerospace. Same for Physics, and likely Planetary Sciences.\n\nRealistically though, minors aren't near as important as your major. Having a minor in Planetary Science will very rarely give you an advantage over someone with a minor in Math considering you're both AE majors. Do a minor in something that interests you, whether that's STEM related or otherwise.", "author": "XcgsdV", "created": 1625204055, "upvotes": 2}}}
