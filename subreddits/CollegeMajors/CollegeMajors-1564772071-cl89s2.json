I've been told by many people that the only way I'll get even a decent job in this field is to get a Masters/PhD. And I'm not even certain I will like the job I get. I majored in psychology because it was the only thing I was interested in. Well, thats not true. I am also interested in Behavioral Neuroscience, but I don't have a background in science (haven't taken the basis biology/chemistry classes), and I'm not a 4.0 student. My graduating GPA will likely be around 3.1 or 3.2, which is okay, but not the best it could be (I get almost straight B's, with a few A's once and a while). I didn't mind most of the classes, but the ones I liked the most had to do with the physical science of the brain, and the ones I hated the most had to do with research and statistics. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is would it be a waste of time and money to do a post-bacc and get a degree in BN? Is this degree to difficult for someone like me?", "author": "tortiesunite", "created": 1564772071, "retrieved": 1632848195, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"eylbgvz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/cl89s2/i_regret_getting_my_bs_in_psychology/eylbgvz/", "text": "Just start your job whatever it ends up being and see what you like and don\u2019t like about it and what opportunities turn up from there. Lots of people have regrets about their majors but it\u2019s not really worth it imo... if psychology was really your only/primary interest you can\u2019t really fault yourself for choosing it. Lots of people even in majors and career paths they like don\u2019t like their first job after college either.
