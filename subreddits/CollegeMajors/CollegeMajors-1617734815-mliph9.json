I absolutely dread working there; the boring tasks, my moody bosses and having to do everything for them, the 9 to 5 which leaves me feeling like I have absolutely no free time at the end of the day.\n\nSo for the last year or so I\u2019ve been really trying to figure out what I really wanna do for the rest of my life but all the thinking about it and researching makes me feel even more lost; there\u2019s so much one can do on this world, how could I ever decide on just one thing? \n\nI\u2019ve already tried to minimize my options but even so I feel like there\u2019s not one thing that /really/ fits me. At first I was adamant about going into media but then I realized that I\u2019m not really creative enough for it (I solely enjoy writing but I don\u2019t wanna do it for someone else), then I thought about going into science or biology (it seems interesting) but I feel as though I\u2019m not smart enough and it\u2019s not really something I see myself truly fit for. As of right now I\u2019m considering going into psychology (clinical mostly) as I feel i\u2019m empathic enough for it and it too does seem interesting but then again I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s really fit for me \u2014 do I really wanna listen to people talk all day? \u2014 I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to know or figure out what I really like. \n\nGenerally I can only say for sure that I wanna do something where I can make my own decision (mostly) and bring in my own ideas, use my strengths (tho I don\u2019t which ones I even have) and generally feel like I\u2019m doing something important and something of value to society or individuals) \n\nDoes anyone \u2014 who\u2019s been in the same position maybe \u2014 have any advice for me? I\u2019m really thankful for all or any help at all!!", "author": "Opening-Deep", "created": 1617734815, "retrieved": 1632846844, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gtmf96o": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mliph9/help_im_lost_trying_to_figure_out_what_i_wanna_do/gtmf96o/", "text": "Have you thought about going into HR? This is a field where you get to help others while also bringing in your own ideas to the table. Any job where you or not the director or manager will have you working under others, unfortunately. No matter what you decide. But with experience and education you can climb up. Any business field seems right on track as well. Maybe even working for a non-profit. \n\nIt's overwhelming when you ask yourself, \"what do I want to do for the rest of my life until I die?\" You can't like that. You have to think more in terms of, \"what is something that I can enjoy for the rest of my life?\" Try answering that question instead.", "author": "strangercats13", "created": 1617747828, "upvotes": 2}}}
