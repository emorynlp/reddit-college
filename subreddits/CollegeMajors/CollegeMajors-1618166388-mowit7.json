I am 23 and entering Humboldt State University this fall as a freshman zoology major. I love animals and mainly want to work in a zoo or sanctuary as an animal handler (or as anything but a veterinarian). I have also discovered an interest in ecophysiology as I am super interested in learning about adaptation and behaviors in animals!! I'm just wondering if zoology is too specific of a field in case I don't get either of those jobs right away? Should I just go for a biology degree with an ecology concentration?(you have to choose a concentration at my school). I know I want to study animals I just dont think I want to be stuck in such a specific path if it's not so lucrative of a field! What should I do?\n\nEdit: there is a general bio concentration", "author": "autismsqueaks", "created": 1618166388, "retrieved": 1632846692, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"gu8cejp": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mowit7/should_i_do_biology_or_zoology/gu8cejp/", "text": "I've never even heard of zoology as an undergrad major, but if you're more interested in that field of biology do that.
