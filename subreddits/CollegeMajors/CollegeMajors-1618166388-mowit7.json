  "title:": "Should I do biology or zoology?",
  "text": "Hi! I am 23 and entering Humboldt State University this fall as a freshman zoology major. I love animals and mainly want to work in a zoo or sanctuary as an animal handler (or as anything but a veterinarian). I have also discovered an interest in ecophysiology as I am super interested in learning about adaptation and behaviors in animals!! I'm just wondering if zoology is too specific of a field in case I don't get either of those jobs right away? Should I just go for a biology degree with an ecology concentration?(you have to choose a concentration at my school). I know I want to study animals I just dont think I want to be stuck in such a specific path if it's not so lucrative of a field! What should I do?\n\nEdit: there is a general bio concentration",

      "text": "I've never even heard of zoology as an undergrad major, but if you're more interested in that field of biology do that. I found out after a couple years in college as long as you have a degree in something you can still get plenty of jobs out there. I have a BBA in Accounting and am not even working in accounting. I graduated 3 years ago.",

              "text": "Yep! Biology is a huge field and zoology/botany/ecology all fall under it. So you can easily go for zoology after a biology degree.\n\nAnd you have more interrelated subjects too so you're not ONLY focusing on zoology. It's genuinely better to go for a general biology degree.\n\nSource: I study a combination of Biotech/Biochem/ Chem and I see people doing general biology get the same jobs/ fields as I do. And they have a greater arsenal of subjects they've done. \n\nGenerally, try not to get into a specialised field at the undergraduate level.",
