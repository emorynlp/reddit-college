It was so stressful and frankly I didn't really want to be a nurse. I never looked forward to my classes and I don't want the responsibility of someone else's life in my hands. I am thinking of switching to finance or accounting for job security (they don't interest me either). What interests me are \"fluffy\" majors that aren't practical. Social work and psychology are among them. I couldn't handle nursing school and am wondering if I can handle anything at this point. I am afraid whatever I will switch to I will just have another breakdown like I did in nursing school. I am also dealing with depression, so I no longer have the motivation to do anything. I used to be a great student before, though.", "author": "Apprehensive_Lake555", "created": 1607395205, "retrieved": 1632956826, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"gf33d68": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k8vnly/lost_and_looking_for_advice/gf33d68/", "text": "Social work is totally practical!\nBureau of Labor Statistics shows it is project to grow faster than most other fields: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/mobile/social-workers.htm\nPsychology is in a similar area (I\u2019m a psych major) however how much education it takes really varies.\n\nDo you need to make a certain amount of money to live how you want to?
