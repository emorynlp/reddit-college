I recently posted over in r/college regarding my current predicament.\n\nI\u2019m currently a sophomore education major, with a concentration in human development, and I just wrapped up my third semester. However, I found the education classes this semester not only difficult, but at times enraging, as the grades often appeared to be subjective. Additionally, much of the material was not very interesting to me: many classes repeated the same material, and did not allow for much exploration in assignments or papers on my end.\n\nSo that\u2019s where I\u2019m at now. I\u2019m thinking about switching to psychology, as I do very well in my human development classes, and I find the classes more engaging. \n\nAll I know about the future is I love working with kids, I love designing fun and impactful lesson plans, and I\u2019d like to work with children who do have mental health issues.\n\nAny advice? Should I try and give education one more semester, or just switch to psych now?", "author": "blirbo", "created": 1545593066, "retrieved": 1632848202, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ecf4263": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a8xhau/might_change_majors/ecf4263/", "text": "Have you talked to any faculty in either department?
