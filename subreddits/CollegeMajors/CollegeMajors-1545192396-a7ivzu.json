I initially picked Mathematics because I loved math throughout grade school and only got straight A\u2019s in maths, and the average salary is pretty high. However, I came across this article titled \u201cshould you be a math major\u201d. To summarize it, if you only like calculating stuff and solving equations, and are not really interested in proofs, then you should not be a Mathematics major. This stood out to me because that is exactly me. I have absolutely no interest in proofs and theorems. As a kid, I also really enjoyed building things out of paper and pretending they were iPhones, gaming consoles, etc. So I thought about taking an engineering class in high school, but because the school always screwed up my schedule, I couldn\u2019t join one. Recently I\u2019ve been thinking about whether I will truly be happy with a job in mathematics, as they all sound kinda boring (teaching, actuary, data analysis), but the only thing that stands out is the salary for actuaries. I\u2019ve been wondering whether I should consider switching to engineering or not, and what type of engineering? Can someone please suggest a good type of engineering for someone like me who enjoys building small/medium sized objects and machinery. Also, I\u2019m good at Chemistry and Physics, but hate Biology.

I agree that you'd probably be better off in applied mathematics or some kind of engineering. I'd go talk to the engineering school immediately and see what you can register for in spring. You'll definitely want physics and programming as well as calculus. \n\nIf you change your mind later, it is a lot easier to switch OUT of engineering to math or science than it is to switch INTO engineering. \n\nI think that you should also look into geosciences/geoengineering if that sounds at all interesting -- people with strong mathematics/physics/chemistry tend to do well there.

Upper division mathematics courses are definitely proof-heavy, regardless if you go into Algebra, Analysis, or Applied. I think that's just the nature of mathematics - what can we say about every object X that has property Y? If you really want to stick it out with mathematics, I think you'd be happier focusing more in Applied Mathematics, since Algebra and Analysis are the \"pure\" mathematics, of which proofs and theorems are pretty much form the bases of. Otherwise, it sounds like it you are more interested in using mathematics as a tool. \n\nWith that, I recommend taking engineering courses, as you mentioned in your post. I'm not too familiar with the engineering disciplines, but to my understanding, MechEs focus more on the \"physics\" aspect of engineering. Obviously, ChemEs focus on chemisty. And I'm pretty sure that Electrical Engineering students must still take a course in Complex Analysis. I'm not too sure about Civil Eng and Comp Eng. To me, it sounds like you might be mostly interested in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nYou might also consider Finance, Economics, or Statistics as a major, as mathematics is often used as a tool in these disciplines as well.\n\nI hope this helped a little!
