I\u2019ve been looking at Sheridan and other colleges that offer an animation BA. I think it would be a cool thing todo and I would love to be able to make movies and tv shows that people watch and are just in awe in. Here\u2019s the thing tho, I don\u2019t have confidence in my artistic abilities and working for a big production company ie Disney, Dreamworks etc is not something that is easily accomplished. I\u2019m trying to be realistic with myself here. The world revolves around money, and I would love to be able to provide for my friends and family if need be. Which is why I\u2019m thinking about going into Economy, I\u2019d be able to become a financial manager/advisor. Although I\u2019m not the biggest fan of math, it would pay the bills and I get to help people. The third option is international relations or social anthropology. I love studying cultures and learning about how other people live, not to mention how history has effected peoples views on other cultures. In addition, how history has effect their own culture. I have no idea if there is a job that pertains to something around just learning about other cultures, which is why I\u2019m nervous into majoring in it. I\u2019m most passionate about digital art/animation and learning about other cultures. Which are pretty different. I keep asking myself, \u201cwhat do I want todo for the next four years\u201d and I come back to \u201cdrawing or studying other cultures\u201c. I\u2019d like to know your thoughts!", "author": "Drops-of-Saturn", "created": 1589672121, "retrieved": 1632958122, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fr5iuqx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gl4u67/help_i_have_no_idea/fr5iuqx/", "text": "I just finished my freshman year at a private art school so I understand where you are coming from. \n\nTo give you an idea of what it consists of:\n\n\u2022 It requires a lot of practice to get where they want you to be in industry standards.

The ROI on a 3d animation degree is going to be higher than that of an Archaeology or Anthropology degree, and most jobs only require a bachelor's degree. While you may not be working at major film companies (right away), it will at least pay the bills and allow you to do something that you love.
