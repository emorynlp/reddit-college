I ultimately want to get into psychedelic drug and marijuana research for their therapeutic/medical effects. I'm interested in how these substances are digested/metabolised and where in the brain/nervous system they affect to produce their effects. I'm a little bit of an overachiever and I already have a lot of units from a previous major before changing my major so I've been thinking about what to double major in if I decide to do so because I might have \"too many\" units for a single major.\n\nI'm interested in psychology but I've also thought about statistics. Which would help me land a job fresh with a bs degree? I feel like I can learn about psychology on my own with books but a double major in biochem and stats would help with job searching and also help with research. My intro to chemistry lab had a little bit of statistics in it and having taken freshman level statistics helped me understand it better. Math is not my favorite subject but I felt like statistics was easier than college algebra.", "author": "AnotherSpotOfTea", "created": 1625011377, "retrieved": 1632846513, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h5dsnr1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oakwu6/double_major_biochemistry_and_psychology_or/h5dsnr1/", "text": "Major in biomedical engineering and go for grad school. Science degrees don't make money and the job opportunities are scarce. You should probably go for engineering in a related field, chemical engineering, biomedical eng etc. I recommend biomedical engineering because it seems to align more with your interests and you can do a minor in neuroscience. Don't increase your workload too much if you want to go to grad school, just focus on taking parts in researches, maintaining a good gpa, building connections (as dumb as that sounds) and taking up on internships. Another route you can take is psychology and biomedical eng but the number of credits you would have to do might be a little too much.", "author": "Fun_Relationship_995", "created": 1626432356, "upvotes": 1}}}
