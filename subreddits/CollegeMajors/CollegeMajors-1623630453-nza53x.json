How should I approach selecting a major? I need something that would provide remote work opportunities, and that won\u2019t be really hard because I need to practice and work?", "text": "I\u2019m currently 25 I dropped out of college. Because I just felt really depressed and wanted to try new things. After I left I feel I got to really learn a lot about the world and myself. I traveled to 20 countries , I worked in many jobs, and currently I\u2019m a tennis coach and I love it. I played tennis in high school but never felt I reached my potential so I think this would be a great opportunity to improve as a player and a coach while hopefully learning and building relationships. Because currently I live in a small town, I\u2019m single and don\u2019t know anyone outside of my students. I was considering education because I work as a coach and would potentially like to work in education. However I only have 3 years eligibility and this program would take 4 more years. The other majors are all liberal arts majors, and it doesn\u2019t seem like they offer much opportunity as far as the job market goes. Although getting a degree that makes money is not primary to me because I want to continue coaching and know I can make an income with that. A back up plan or an opportunity to work remotely if I wanted to would be nice, but the only degrees offered are liberal arts type degrees. I was considering: international business, international studies, or theatre. Theatre because I love acting and am not worried so much about getting a degree that makes money and I have a scholarship so I won\u2019t be getting into big debt. I also wonder if I could still work in education if I major in something else?\n\nAny insights would be great!", "author": "LoudCricket4876", "created": 1623630453, "retrieved": 1632957430, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h1qdrc1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nza53x/recently_got_a_tennis_scholarship_to_a_liberal/h1qdrc1/", "text": "international business, theater minor", "author": "MentalJackfruit5423", "created": 1623680065, "upvotes": 1}}}
