Double Major?", "text": " \n\nWhen I first transferred to my college my adviser told me I could either double major or have a major and 2 minors. Weird right? For 8 months I had a double major of CRJ and Spanish. Few months ago in October I was stressed and realized how I did not like how my Spanish professors for my intermediate (almost advanced) classes werent as hands on. I could understand them and communicate with them, but the tests did not reflect on what was being taught in class.\n\nSo I decided to drop my Spanish major and have a CRJ major with a Psychology minor. Now, **2 months after that decision,** I feel like maybe I should still keep my Spanish and add it on to my minor. But, is it worth it? I mean, worth it to have the PSY and Spanish minor with a CRJ major after college. I dont want to spend anymore time or money on it if it wont be a benefit to me in the *real world.*\n\n**TL;DR CHOOSING BETWEEN A MAJOR AND MINOR OR A MINOR W TWO MINORS.**", "author": "talktotori", "created": 1545584614, "retrieved": 1632957525, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ecewd6m": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a8w97e/should_i_have_1_minor_or_2_double_major/ecewd6m/", "text": "As /u/bitchassshortie is insinuating, it depends on what your future plans are.
