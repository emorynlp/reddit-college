I think i want to do something with science, but I am not really sure what. does anyone have any tips about how they chose their major, and could possibly share it? i would appreciate it, thank you.\n\np.s. if no one has any tips and maybe just wants to suggest a major that I might like, I can tell you a little bit about me. I am pretty interested in science. Sciences like astronomy, marine science, and environmental science have all peaked my interest at some point in my life but i\u2019m still not sure if that is what i want to have as a job. I also am pretty good at math and have been thinking about engineering as an alternate choice. I also like animals lol idk if that\u2019s important (i work at a doggy day care atm). if any college major comes to mind when u read all of that about me feel free to comment it would help a lot :) thanks.", "author": "iiCammie", "created": 1595712243, "retrieved": 1632956575, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fzbq4ro": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hxuivj/picking_the_right_major/fzbq4ro/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1595788384, "upvotes": 5}, "fz9adgs": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hxuivj/picking_the_right_major/fz9adgs/", "text": "I'm sure there are career tests that you can take that will point you closer towards a certain area of academic interest.", "author": "kwuhoo239", "created": 1595725630, "upvotes": 1}, "fz8r5rl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hxuivj/picking_the_right_major/fz8r5rl/", "text": "Hi iiCammie! So I happened to see your comment and our company is currently trying to help solve this problem for people like yourself. We are actually doing a pilot program where we are asking people to evaluate our videos that are aimed at understanding what certain jobs are like. Message me if you have interest in participating!

Again they come under Biology part? Astronomy is more Physics and Math related I believe , you might want to look into what sub subjects you like too", "author": "pablopistachioo", "created": 1595713576, "upvotes": 3}}}
