  "text": "Hi i\u2019m a 17 y/o female and I am going to have to start applying to colleges soon but I have absolutely no idea what job i want to have when I am older and i\u2019m struggling trying to pick a major. I think i want to do something with science, but I am not really sure what. does anyone have any tips about how they chose their major, and could possibly share it? i would appreciate it, thank you.\n\np.s. if no one has any tips and maybe just wants to suggest a major that I might like, I can tell you a little bit about me. I am pretty interested in science. Sciences like astronomy, marine science, and environmental science have all peaked my interest at some point in my life but i\u2019m still not sure if that is what i want to have as a job. I also am pretty good at math and have been thinking about engineering as an alternate choice. I also like animals lol idk if that\u2019s important (i work at a doggy day care atm). if any college major comes to mind when u read all of that about me feel free to comment it would help a lot :) thanks.",

              "text": "Astronomy is a great major ! but again I am not sure how quick this gets you a job right after graduation , unless you're not aiming that. Know you aim. Astronomy majors are usually sooner or later working at research centers ( I am not sure but I guess so /Google says so) . But this might be a major that requires some more specialization ? like Masters or PhD. \n\nSo you need to figure out that what you want right after college ? Right off to work or grad school? Now even if you dont know that rn , that's cool!You have time to weigh the pros and cons of everything. I don't know the pros and cons and you'd have to make a list of that according to yourself / your preferences \n\nBut since you said you like Math and Physics ,maybe Mech Engg, Electrical Engg, Comp Engg might be your thing? Depends . \n\n1).Mech Engg has more of Classical physics, I think optics too, maybe Relativistic mechanics mechanics (basically old school physics) and yea Math is almost same for every engg major.\n\n2).Electrical Engg has mostly Electromagnetism ,Relativistic mechanics, basically a lot of circuits , all those boards, and a good amount of stuff related to computer . \n\n3).Computer Engg is like a mixture of Computer Science and Electrical Engg... basically both Hardware and Software.\n\nNow if you ask which one is easy...it's engg and I am also an incoming freshman so I don't know but if you got an interest it shouldn't be thhaaattt hard , but engineering in general requires more work and efforts.\n\n4).Now there's also Math major and Statistics major which are honestly greattt!! Good choices , great internships, good pay too.\n\n5).Data Science is another major that is a mix of Computer Science and Math. Still a good major but a more specialized major so depends if it interests you.\n\nPS: you might also want to look into Civil Engg or Architecture or Aeronautical Engg  like that depending on where you are applying",
