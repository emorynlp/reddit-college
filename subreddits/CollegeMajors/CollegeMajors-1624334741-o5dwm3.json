I love kids and want to work in schools, but I don\u2019t want my own classroom. I\u2019m going to Santa Monica College this fall to get associates in \u201carts and humanities\u201d, \u201cbehavioral and social sciences\u201d, communications, and a certificate in ECE. What major could I possibly transfer into to where I\u2019ll have lots of career options, but can still be looked at as a good candidate for assistant teaching? I don\u2019t really want to study liberal studies because I feel like the only thing I\u2019ll ever be able to do is teach. I just want more options. Should I do communications when I transfer? Or do you have any other ideas?? Preferably something a bit easier/less stressful since I have disabilities and have difficulties in more complex lecture settings. Something along the lines of communications seems fine. But any other ideas?", "author": "autismsqueaks", "created": 1624334741, "retrieved": 1632958536, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
