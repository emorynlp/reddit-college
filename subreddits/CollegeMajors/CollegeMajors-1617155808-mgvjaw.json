Going to college for architecture in community college during COVID-19, rooming with family. \n\nCurrently crammed in more than usual, so that's something to consider: I tend to like to be out all day so the only time my parents see me is at night. This is something that I always did when 4-6 people room in an apartment with 2 rooms and 1 restroom. Fine by me if I have a library to study or a place to be alone to focus, but absolutely rage and resent if I don't get that: no distance, no privacy, no alone \"me\" time. Needless to say, the current rooming situation isn't doing good for school or my relationships with family. I would not be surprised if I cut off some of my immediate family and I think they know that at this point. In fact its alluring to turn it into an expectation: no arguments, not even conversations, just an empty room one night when they are on the weekend with relatives. \n\nI also feel like I made a mistake of getting into a relationship last fall. This really saddens me because my boyfriend is really supportive and understanding with all of my insecurities, but I absolutely hate the fact that I turn clingy or emotional with him sometimes. I did it from a good place: confident and happy. If he didn't like me, fine. If he did, fine. The point is to enjoy the person for however long I have them in my company. But now that I gained weight, unsure of my major, want to throw a goddam skillet at the back of my dad's head sometimes, I feel like its just another thing I worry about. Mostly on my own time: when I'm with him, I got better at detaching from worries and having a break, not thinking about weight or major too much. But I feel miserable on my own and that's a warning sign: good relationships, in my opinion, are those in which both are independently happy and if they wanted to leave, they could do so easily. The reason neither partner does is because they are just having that good of a time with you. \n\nBut nevertheless, here is the main point: I don't think I want to do architecture anymore. \n\nAt first this was because of ROI: schooling, salary, work hours, stability, etc. Now its about how much power and affect I can have on a person or people, even if just one, with this job. I don't have any doubt that I COULD be an architect, but I do doubt if I would be a good one if I didn't enjoy it. For one thing I don't really care about what other's think: the door is to the right, just make sure you don't trip over with that big dick of yours. (Obviously say this to only \"special\" individuals. I personally am eager to use this on someone, but I won't since I know it just too mean. Better nice than mean.) So that stated, I wouldn't mind living in a sweater hobo like I do now, doing something I genuinely enjoy for most of my life. Sure, having nice things is nice, but I'd rather save that stuff and be a secretly rich person that still walks in my grandmothers sweater. Yes, I am wearing one now. Yes, it is hot, but my grandmother makes the best sweaters and I love it. And yes, I pride in myself being frugal or at least trying to be. I'm looking for a remote drafting job to create savings and invest. \n\nAnyways, I'm not sure architecture is the way to go considering it doesn't seem like I could make enough to meet common milestones like affording kids/house, would feel fulfilled sitting in front of a computer all day, and my work not making any significant difference on a project not until later in my career. Mind you, I definitely see myself leading and managing people, and of course setting up a business of my own after some corporate servitude, but I want the option of a service job that in of it self is satisfying. Yes, its a stepping stone to having a business/property of my own, but I don't think I'd want to do that in old age: just be a very experienced, useful, and seasoned professional. \n\nAs of now, or the continuation of 4 months since a breakdown, suicidal thoughts, possibly anxiety, weight gain, and an even greater strain on my relationships, I did a bunch of personality assessments as well as forum stalking. So far, the answers are pointing to nursing, but I need to ask more questions to make sure I am not going towards this direction completely out of fear or greed. \n\nPersonally, I see medicine and nursing as a lot more challenging than architecture. With architecture, I just work hard and don't learn much. With nursing I would be working hard not just because of the workload, but because of science, which I was typically too lazy to learn, although I KNOW what I need to do to learn it and truly enjoy it. It also seems like a complete change of pace and although you deal with politics, REAL stress, and I guess gruesome elements like abuse and bodily fluids, it is clear that you have a DIRECT impact on a person. Obviously this is both a pro and a con: I personally see this as a massive pro. And if I were to be a nurse, I'd make DAMN sure I'm in it for the right reasons: it just pisses me off even in a theoretical situation if I was slow or too just stupid to care for someone who is helpless. No, you don't owe them anything, BUT GODDAMIT HELP THEM WOMAN. \n\nSorry, I got a little too emotional there. Basically, I want to do a good job in whatever I do, albeit with considerations of what I want out of life and what I am best at. \n\nSo why the long text? Basically my question is:\n\n1) Should I take a gap year, get out, get finances in order, take some classes to figure out my major situation as well as ask a bunch of people around and THEN return to school? \n\n2) Should I even consider switching majors given that we are in Corona or is nursing at this point irrational? I have 1 year left until application to universities and hopefully if I go fully with architecture, get 3 more years for MArch.\n\n3) Literally just sit on my butt and \"give architecture another chance\" for the last year and only after applying/seeing results have this conversation with myself? I feel like this is a waste of time in a sense since I know nursing is more like 4 years so if I do a calculation then: \n\nArchitecture\n\n\\+1 CC +3 MArch/+2 BArch = 2-3 years of schooling --> Total is 5-6 years of schooling (3 years in community college) \n\nNursing change after spring\n\n\\+2 Pre-requisites + 2 nursing program +3 waitlist = 7 years of schooling? --> Total is 9 years of schooling? \n\n\\+1 certificate/pre-requisites +1 pre-reuiquisites +1 waitlist +2 nursing = 6 years of schooling? --> Total is 8 years of schooling? \n\nJesus christ, I'm going to be very old by then. :(", "author": "Fr0gg033", "created": 1617155808, "retrieved": 1632957193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gy1sp83": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mgvjaw/rant_and_stuck_covid19_tension_major_change/gy1sp83/", "text": "The prospective directions I could be seeing involve: \n\n\\- Straight up healthcare professional. I'm thinking pediatric nurse, or maybe a respiratory therapy or PA since plenty like to shit on nurses in general. The fact that I can APPLY knowledge I am learning now and question it with scientific methods excites me about this field. I also absolutely have 0 problems with guts, fluids, wastes, whatever. Sure, not always the most pleasant thing, but oftentimes feel surreal and interesting to examine. Same goes for any lab operations I like watching in depth or labs I did on frogs. Not much, but something. \n\n\\- Healthcare architecture. Generally, I think if I go for architecture I'd be a public servant. Partially because of security, but mostly because I want to cater to essential needs, not luxury. Urban planning also is appealing, but based on other reddits, I question this choice: not any better in terms of life quality or finances, and you mainly deal with politics if anything. \n\nRight now I'm finishing up my 2nd year with architecture undergrad pre-reqs, not sure if I should take any classes for summer at all. Ive had so many breakdowns not because of a demanding program or COVID (although they helped,) but mainly because indecision eats away at a person. Each day I wake up now and just want to switch, volunteer, work, club, and anything else related to health. \n\nA focus on my own health is the only thing that substantially improved my life, something I can control. I definitely wasn't always like this: I wasn't happy, confident, and essentially not willing to change. But then I suddenly did. So if there is at least one person who wants to do that or if I can convince them to look after themselves, that is what I want to do with my life. And I thought architecture could do that: affect the environment so people are better off as a whole through a sum of a bunch of little things. Not better, just slightly better. But I don't think architecture is the best way to do that: I think medicine is. A proper environment definitely helps, but I don't know how much individual attention and energy I can really give to people if I chose this profession. I'm not even sure its all that essential: I was perfectly happy in a shitty little apartment with 5 other people in it by just changing my mind and then body for the better. So I think a medical profession might be a better fit. Its not just money or lifestyle: I'm trying to figure out how can I best say \"I did good in this life\" with my work and the life outside of it.", "author": "Fr0gg033", "created": 1620955915, "upvotes": 1}}}
