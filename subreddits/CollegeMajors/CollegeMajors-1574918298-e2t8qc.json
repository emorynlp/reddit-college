  "text": "My parents want me to major in Nursing but I don\u2019t want to major in nursing. It can be a very competitive field and I don\u2019t have that type of love for it like others. I want to go on to medical school to be an Anesthesiologist. I know that i can major in anything, my parents are just worried about how I am going to sustain myself while I am in med school. I like things like Music(i\u2019m a musician) and math, but I don\u2019t feel I would do great in either. I would rather just have them as minors. I also will have my associates degree before I graduate high school. Everyone says I just have to find what Like and that really centers around public speaking, freedom of expression, society. There is one major that really speaks to me and it\u2019s called Medicine, health, and society(the name varies) but this major is only offered at a few colleges. I also like the idea of Health Management/ administration. (i have a heavy Ego) Help......",

They're in higher demand than them. They make a lot and it takes less years to do, and it'll make your parents happy.",

      "text": "I would advise you to think long and hard about the path to medical school and whether or not medicine is for you. I truly believe that medicine in a lot of ways is an all or nothing field. You need to first decide whether or not you what to be a doctor before you decide to become an anesthesiologist. The same thing for people who want to become surgeons. If you can't see yourself as any other type of doctor or as a general practice doctor then medicine may not be the right field. It's okay to want a specific specialty in medicine, because it's a field with places for many personalities but make sure you want to be a doctor first, because ultimately that's what you'll be. Start with general and then you can get specific later on with what you want to do in medicine.",

      "text": "Does medicine, health, and society include the prereqs for medical school? Lots of premed students do something that cover their prereqs. \n\nAlso, people typically don't work during medical school so a nursing job won't help much while you're in a med school.",

Also I don\u2019t want to move back home for any reason once i am in medical school. But I also know there are little things out there that i could do like tutor math or give percussion lessons. I also don\u2019t want my major to be worthless. just in case something happens and I don\u2019t go to medical school.",
