I've always wanted to go into music, specifically music production, because I have been making music on my computer since the 7th grade, but everything I've read says to pass getting a degree in music as it is basically useless. \n\n\nI know wanting to be a musician/producer requires a ton of luck and skill to get to as a professional career, but I don't know anything else I would be interested in doing. It's probably the one thing I can say I'm actually decent at.\n\nMath has always been my worst subject, I'd barely pass with Bs and Cs, and it was shaky. English has always been my best subject, but I wouldn't say it's something I'm that interested in. The only subject I'm somewhat interested in is history, but I don't know if I would want to go into a career in that space.\n\nI have always been interested in space, galaxies, planets, things like the Pillars of Creation. Space, what it is and what it contains, has always caught, and kept, my interest.\n\nI've also just recently got interested in the stock market, as well as subjects like compound interest. I was planning to go to college to learn the stock market, but now I just don't know.\n\nI love being creative. Making music allows me to express myself in ways nothing else can, and I'd love to do something that allowed me to express myself in this manner.\n\nI don't know if any of the information I've provided is useful, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you have, as I am completely lost on what I want to do. This has been stressing me out so much, and the thought of doing something I despise for my life is scary.", "author": "Kirbi126", "created": 1615627073, "retrieved": 1632846972, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gqsa33r": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m42vn0/i_am_approaching_the_end_of_high_school_and_i/gqsa33r/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1615628002, "upvotes": 6}}}
