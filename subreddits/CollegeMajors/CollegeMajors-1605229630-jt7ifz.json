              "text": "Biology. A lot of schools also offer dual majors in Microbiology, and taking on a related minor (Molecular Biology, for example, would be easy due to the chemistry already required, or bioinformatics due to the very few additional programming courses required) and a speciality minor (ex. marine biology) could def be useful to consider.\n\nThat's all way on down the line, though. For now, focus on doing well in your sciences and maths. Once in highschool, if you can get permission, I highly recommend taking maths and sciences from CCP programs (college credit plus), as surprisingly, the Professors are generally nicer than highschool teachers and you can earn college credit early on that will transfer into your university (and thus give you more time to specialize or do research/internship). \n\nIf you fail a CCP course, it won't reflect in your later university, and if you ever want to go on post-grad, it can easily be explained with \"highschooler.\"",

The most important thing to remember is that even if these more specified complex subjects and \"college CCP oooo\" sound daunting, they're really not once you get into them, you just need to have a good understanding of the information that comes first before.
