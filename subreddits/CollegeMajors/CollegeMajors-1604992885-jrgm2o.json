  "text": "I'm really stressed out, I need to start applying for colleges soon but I'm stuck and I don't know what to major in. I have a lot of interests specially in arts, music, dance, writing, nature and culture. I never really explored these field I'm just interested in them. So there is a high chance that I might not be good at it or I might not even want to do these things in the future (although I'm good at painting)  I don't know what to do. You'll probably say to try it out but even when I had a lot of time in quarantine I still didn't do any of them. I'm really stressed I don't know what to do please help me out.",

Another thing that you could look into is doing your first two years in a community college and transferring to a university in third year. You could save a lot of money doing that. \n\nOtherwise, some things that might fall into your interests: \n\nEcology, Conservation Biology, Environmental Science, Marketing, Graphic Design, Interior Design, Architecture/Landscape Architecture, Journalism",
