I want to start working on my major the only thing is I\u2019m not sure which one to do. After the military I want to work from home to take care of my future kids while allowing my wife to pursue her career of choice. I was thinking about marketing but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good work from home career. I was just hoping that someone could suggest some majors to look into that could help me land a work from home job.
