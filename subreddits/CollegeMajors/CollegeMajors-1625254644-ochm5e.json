It sounded appealing because I\u2019m interested I environmental advocacy, sustainability, and climate. But as far as I can tell it\u2019s mostly focused in waste management or consulting (things I don\u2019t really want to do).\nAnd I REALLY do not want to help corporate America skirt around environmental regulations.\n\nFor more context I\u2019m thinking of doing some sort of public policy/environmental policy minor if that\u2019s helpful. I also like chemistry and the idea of working in sustainable energy or doing environmental research.\n\nSo in light of all that, is there an engineering major that fits what I\u2019m looking for? Or should I avoid it altogether? \n\nThanks!!", "author": "natasha0214", "created": 1625254644, "retrieved": 1632956852, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3xgf6n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ochm5e/thinking_about_engineeringenvironmenthelp_me/h3xgf6n/", "text": "How about Chemical Engineering with a minor in environmental sciences or maybe law?", "author": null, "created": 1625326588, "upvotes": 1}, "h3ukgkf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ochm5e/thinking_about_engineeringenvironmenthelp_me/h3ukgkf/", "text": "I wanted to do a lot of what you said. I'm basically an environmental engineering major, although I just finished my freshman year. Doing an internship that's not really helping to actively destroying the environment. Jobs come from people needing or wanting something. A lot of environmental jobs come from laws that require companies to do stuff. They don't want to do it. Hopefully more laws come in the future. More large companies are making carbon-neutral pledges, so that's a positive.\n\nI read something while in high school & I think it still holds true. You want to seriously do the most to help the environment? Go into law or become a politician. I'm hoping to get into politics later in life, but right now I'd be happy to do the grunt work of fulfilling laws.", "author": "Gamerz1818", "created": 1625258196, "upvotes": 1}}}
