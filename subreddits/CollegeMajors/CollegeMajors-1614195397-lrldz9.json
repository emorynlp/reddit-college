  "text": "I am a freshman who is majoring in Biochemistry, however as I take more targeted classes I've realized this isn't something I'd like to study. I've enjoyed ecology and sociology, as well as evonomics. I am good at writing (although I dislike it) and am decent at math. What are some majors that will go into lucrative careers?",

      "text": "The New York Fed's [Labor Market Outcomes of College Graduates by Major](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html) is a great resource. These are only averages, though, and don't break out salaries for those with a graduate degree vs. bachelor's only, or \"underemployed\" (a pretty big share of college graduates) vs. not. Econ comes out pretty well overall. \n\nIf you're looking for a lucrative career, the top-paying majors are all quantitative, and most of them are some flavor of engineering.",

      "text": "Economics might be a decent pick. From my discussions with Econ majors, it's a mixture of social sciences type stuff and math/statistics, so it sounds like it would go well with your interests and skills. Many Econ majors end up going into business, finance, consulting, or data science. might be worth checking out.",
