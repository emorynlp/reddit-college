Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science (likely software engineering).", "text": "I have been going back a forth between the two for months now and I don't think I can wait any longer to come to a decision. Let me iterate why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMechanical engineering has pretty much been my passion all throughout my childhood. I love designing and building. I'm a core part of numerous clubs relating to the field and am the Lead of the mechanical subteam of my First robotics team. All my life this is pretty much been my direction. I picked up AutoDesk Inventor with ease and always win any design challenge for any class that involves engineering something. With robotics I'm the root of all design decisions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nComputer science has become a new passion of mine and is something I really enjoy. I'm pretty amateur at it (Only experience is courses at school which I find very very easy). I would love to go into blockchain technology (I really admire cryptocurrency and decentralized networks), which would be very profitable and far higher demand than Mechanical Engineering. I know I wont be able to take courses relating to it but with some college level coding courses I have no doubt I could pick it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dilemma is choosing between the two. In terms of math, I hate theoretical stuff (precalculus was a nightmare, calculus isn't so bad though), but the practical stuff is certainly more my style (I'm considerably better at physics than pure math). I'm just not sure how much I'll enjoy one over the other. The big thing about mechanical engineering that I like is the research and development side, especially with robotics. Mechanical engineering is so broad I'm not sure how well I can focus on that side, as I fear the other will bore me and I will lose interest that is crucial for me to be able to focus on the class. Also Mechanical Engineering is far more saturated with certainly more difficult of a work/course load.\n\nHowever Computer Science or Software Engineering is higher in demand, and something I believe I will find an easier time dealing with the course/work load. I'm still relatively new to it (took the entry level high school course last year and now I'm taking the AP course this year), and I have no experience outside of high school courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR = I like the creation aspect of mechanical engineering and have worked in that genre my whole life, but I don't know if it will really lead me to the research/development/design side and career I have previously envisioned. However coding has peaked my interest and can be more profitable with an easier course load, but being new to it I'm not sure how much more I'd like it over the career I envision in mechanical engineering.", "author": "doom816", "created": 1605146481, "retrieved": 1632847137, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gc0tyfk": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jslukt/another_senior_begging_for_some_help_mechanical/gc0tyfk/", "text": "I suggest majoring in MechE and minoring in Comp Sci", "author": "yellochoco44", "created": 1605166632, "upvotes": 2}, "gbzz8gl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jslukt/another_senior_begging_for_some_help_mechanical/gbzz8gl/", "text": "Honestly, as someone on the software side, if MechE is what you currently enjoy then you should go for it. If you end up choosing not to continue with MechE later on, it's easier to transition from MechE to software, than it is the other way around. You can also do a ton of coding in MechE if you choose to do so.", "author": "user4684784124", "created": 1605147716, "upvotes": 2}}}
