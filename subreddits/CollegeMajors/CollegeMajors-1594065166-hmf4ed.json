Most people say you don\u2019t really need to know what you want to major in until your third year of college but I would like to have at least an idea of something I could go into. The hard thing is though that I don\u2019t really have a particular interest in anything and I think that\u2019s mainly because I\u2019ve never really been told what options are out there to choose from. \n\nI'm not the best math (I've mainly made B\u2019s in the math classes I have taken in high school). Other than math I am a straight-A student and member of NHS (if that actually means anything in the real world). I love the read but I can not see myself as a teacher or professor in the subject because reading to me is just a hobby of some sort. \n\nI would like to have a job that pays really well so I can support myself and my family. At this point, I don't mind doing something that doesn't interest me because I'll eventually learn to like it. \n\nIf you could tell me your occupation and why you love it that would be amazing.

That is not a major, though. Law schools mostly care about your GPA and LSAT test, so theoretically you could major in anything. Most people major in things like english, history, political science (the biggest one for law) and criminal justice.\n\nI am a medieval studies major and I am going into law. Proof that they don't care about your major. What I would suggest for you is to get through high school, get into college, and take courses on anything and everything that sounds remotely interesting in your first year. It will weed out what you do and don't want to learn (for example, I learned I love art history and hate psychology just by using this tactic. I am going into my second year now).\n\nRemember, you are only 17 (I am assuming). You're still in high school. You don't have to know right at this exact second. Things will all fall into place.\n\nHope this helped!", "author": "hobgoblins46", "created": 1594505603, "upvotes": 2}, "fx5rrqf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hmf4ed/college_major_assistance_for_struggling_senior/fx5rrqf/", "text": "\\> I would like to have a job that pays really well so I can support myself and my family. At this point, I don't mind doing something that doesn't interest me because I'll eventually learn to like it.\n\nThe options I'm going to list are based off of this part of what you wrote. If you are going to well paying majors that don't involve much math, I think the following are the best options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBusiness degrees. The most well paying business degrees are IT, management information systems, finance, accounting. In particular, finance is probably the highest paying if you go to a top business school, if not, accounting is probably the most \"stable\"/best paying degree. Generally these degrees don't involve much math. For business degrees, though, your extracurriculars and networking abilities are going to be important.\n\nNursing. Very stable overall, healthcare jobs are expected to increase a ton in the next few years. Generally a very demanding career though. Your heart definitely should be in it if you want to do this.\n\ncomputer science. This degree has more math than the two previous ones, but it isn't as math heavy as something like engineering or physics. You'll probably have to take a couple of semesters of calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, computer science theory, analysis of algorithms, and maybe a stats class or something else. Depending on what type of programming job you get after college, though, there could be almost no math involved. This major is well paying, but it's definitely competitive, and you're going to have to put in a ton of extra time into studying for interviews, doing outside projects, learning new technologies, etc. \n\nI would definitely recommend doing something you find interesting though. Most of these degrees pay well, but also require extracurriculars and hustle to get the best jobs (nursing may be the exception). Do one you find interesting, and you'll probably be more motivated and ultimately more successful.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1594084542, "upvotes": 1}, "fx5lln8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hmf4ed/college_major_assistance_for_struggling_senior/fx5lln8/", "text": "Accounting", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1594080919, "upvotes": 1}, "fx5cbcq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hmf4ed/college_major_assistance_for_struggling_senior/fx5cbcq/", "text": "IMO you should definitely pick your major before your third year of college. That's very late. Not knowing during your first year is totally fine though. \n\nIf you don't have any particular interests, is there a subject you feel like you accelled at more than the others? Do you want a major that teaches you technical skills, or one that has more of a focus on soft skills? There are online tests that you can take that will tell you what group of majors suits you best since you haven't really narrowed it down at all yet. \n\nMy major, architecture, is full of people who are hard working and passionate. The content is interesting and I get to work on a lot of projects instead of just exams and essays, but the course load is massive. I've also learned how to do a lot of things (AutoCAD, modeling, drawing, 3D printing, etc) that I like.  I would probably only recommend it to people who are also passionate about the topic since it can have a real toll on your social life and sleep schedule.", "author": "aegisa", "created": 1594075779, "upvotes": 1}}}
