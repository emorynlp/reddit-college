Problem is, my passion is linguistics and I wanna get into the Applied linguistics program at PSU but there are no linguistics programs at PCC. I could get an associate's in a language but the program at PSU only requires 2 semesters of a language and not 2 years. Plus, there's another track where you don't learn languages and I wanna do that so I can broaden my knowledge of linguistics generally. Should I go for a general studies degree first, or go for a social science like Anthro, Sociology or Native American Studies?", "author": "JoseVirnen", "created": 1625581877, "retrieved": 1632958484, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4abnxf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oew3jz/im_trying_to_decide_which_associates_to_get/h4abnxf/", "text": "Don't bother with an associate's degree.
