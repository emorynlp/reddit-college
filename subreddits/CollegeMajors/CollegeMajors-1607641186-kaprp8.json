  "text": "I am currently a freshman in college. I want to go for something that I will be sure to find a job in. I am very interested in reading and writing but understand the job field is shrinking. I thought about becoming a teacher, but am unsure if I will be able to get a job that makes enough to pay the bills (I live in PA). I thought about going to get a masters and become a pricipal but it seems risky. I also have a talent for communicating with people, making them and making them get along. So much so they wanted to make me a backup manager at my retail job. I really enjoy training people and showing them the ropes. Any advice for me/ potential majors i should look into?",

Another suggestion would be to go to community college and take a lot of classes to see what you enjoy learning. Dont go to university if you dont know what degree you want to study, youll waste alot of money. But yeah watch that video and tell me how it goes",

It\u2019s risky but if you focus on getting internships and real world experience it could be very promising. I\u2019m also thinking of something related to international relations? like maybe a diplomat or work at the UN or something. drafting resolutions / bills. \n\nsorry I\u2019m just a senior in high school haha but thought I\u2019d give some input",
