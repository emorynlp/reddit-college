What would be a good fit?", "text": "I am currently in a community college program for herbal medicine. I have some other credits in English, music, history and communications. I will have my herbal certification after this semester, but I'm not sure if it's something I want to do as a job. Actually, I feel like I'm not learning/retaining as much as a student should. The work isn't hands-on (because of Covid) and I'm having health problems, including pretty severe brain fog, which leads me to my next point;\n\nmy biggest fear is not being able to learn. I'm on the Dean's Honor Roll, but this doesn't mean I'm retaining information. The classes are also easier than other schools. \n\nOne thing I know is that I don't want to be in the city anymore. If I do go to college in the coming year/s, I don't want to stay at my local community college. I'd want to transfer somewhere more fitting for me. \n\nMy biggest interests right now are organic (or just sustainable) farming/permaculture, forestry, botany and environmental sciences. One problem: I haven't taken a science class since middle school. After dropping out of art school, I went to an alternative school. I did learn science topics from a student volunteer, but I never took high school chem, bio, or physics. Science was also my biggest struggle growing up. What if I went to school and ended up not being able to comprehend the topics? \n\nSome other fields that I'm interested are therapy, especially music therapy and possibly nursing. \n\nDoes anyone have advice? I just need some general direction for the future. Are there any trades or programs that are non-degrees which might suit my interests?", "author": "kcur42", "created": 1610231162, "retrieved": 1632847062, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gipfoin": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ku0yif/im_not_going_to_college_unless_i_find_a_fitting/gipfoin/", "text": "You might could work for a national park or something, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d enjoy that long term.
