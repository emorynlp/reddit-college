  "text": "I have no idea what I'm doing, what I need to do or how to do so.\n\nI spoke to many advisors and counselors they all gave me vastly different opinions from one another and only proved to conflict me more on which pathway I got to take.\n\n-._.- (frustrated)\n\nI want to be a mechanic. Work on cars and I want to have a chance to also do financing as a side.\n\nI been told this is automotive technology, industrial technology, industrial engineering? \n\nNames that can't be plain \"mechanic\"  'cause i dont get them and the differences between them.\n\nTLDR\n-What's the name for what I want to do? (Mechanic)\n-How do I get there? (Classes I guess?)\n-Could I also do finance as side work?",

You could always come back to college with that life experience under your belt in a few years if it doesn't pan out, anyways.
