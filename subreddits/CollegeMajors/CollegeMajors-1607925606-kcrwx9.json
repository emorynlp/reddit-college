I suffer from anxiety and ocd. What scares me most about nursing is hurting someone or making a mistake. I'm a perfectionist and I don't want to make mistakes in nursing, because I don't want to harm anyone. I didn't really want to do any of the nursing duties, like start Ivs or place nasogastric tubes. I'm a junior and due to mental health reasons withdrew. I am wondering if I should go back to nursing. I feel like it's not for me, but I have pressure from my family and boyfriend to finish the nursing degree. I am terrified to return to school since I am traumatized from my depressive episode. I have the option of changing to something else-- but I am not interested in the \"safe\" majors my family approves of. I am thinking of switching to finance. I don't love it but I forced myself to do nursing for two years so I can finish something I do not like. I do not know what to do.

Don't choose something just because it's \"safe.\" What's safe for someone else, isn't necessarily \"safe\" for you. \n\nAs u/__WhatIsLife__ said, you can usually link your interests to a stable career.
