The question is, WHERE is the curiosity? WHY you're not passionate that much?, WHAT happened?\n\nLet me tell you what happened, **university happened,** the educational system is build that way, to bombard you with unrelatable information that doesn't make sense in the long run. Most of the teachers are not passionate about their lectures either, because they are forced to teach a huge amount of information that overwhelms them as well. *NO wonder why you feel overwhelmed as well, their lack of passion and the mindset of \"OK just share all of this shit and keep going\" from the teachers KILLS curiosity.*\n\nIt's SAD I know, it's fucked up as well, because you're now stuck for 3-4 years in this, and that leads many young students to doubt their major, and they think that the problem is that they chose the wrong one. (It can be, that as well) No wonder why many graduates are still confused about their careers and what they really want to do in life.\n\nThe classical answer to this is **DROP OUT, GO TO YOUR DREAMS, OPEN YOUR OWN BUSINESS**. It can work for some people, but most of the people dropping out will make it more harm than good, because as I said earlier, you're not really sure what you want, and the risk can be huge.\n\nSo the strategy to go around is, to keep doing the assignments, doing them in a way that allows you just TO PASS, and get that degree, so while doing that you'll create more free time for yourself which you can use to work on your personal projects, study what you find curious for yourself, practice the skills you may need for the career that interests you.\n\nWhen you get the degree you will feel more confident in your own capabilities, because you dedicated the time developing yourself.\n\n***TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR DAILY TASKS and life in general.***\n\n***What is your frustration around university, especially online studies?***", "author": "NikitaRetro80", "created": 1602331064, "retrieved": 1632956443, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {}}
