I constantly worry about committing to something that I would regret. I have so many majors which I FEEL like I would enjoy, but I don't know how to chose. \n\nConsidering majors:\n\n\\-Political science \n\n\\-Philosophy \n\n\\-Film \n\n\\-Psychology \n\n\\-Criminal Justice \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoy specific things, but that could be due to my ASD (autism spectrum disorder). My favorite things are rewatching my favorite TV shows and analyzing characters, or arguing with my parents. I could go on and on about my favorite shows for hours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm an exceptional student in school. I do well at everything, but I tend to like subjects I'm good at-- which poses a problem. I don't know what I genuinely like or dislike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated.", "author": "n0elani", "created": 1605906384, "retrieved": 1632847123, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"gd0e4bf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jxxilw/any_idea_what_i_should_major_in/gd0e4bf/", "text": "in terms of assured job placement/success?

Keep your options open and don't be afraid to explore other fields of study.

It is likely that you have to take a certain number of humanities/social science courses as GE courses for graduation anyway. Spend your first semester\\~year on courses within your interest that would count as GE--especially the ones that overlap majors (for instance, intro to psych course may fill major requirements for both psych and criminal justice). If the major you chose is your favorite out of what you've taken so far, good for you! If not, you can always change your major with little to no repercussions.", "author": "i-am-cyclopropane", "created": 1605907750, "upvotes": 1}}}
