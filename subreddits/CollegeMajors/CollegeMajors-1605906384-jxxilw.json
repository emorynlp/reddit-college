  "text": "I'm by far the most indecisive person out there. I constantly worry about committing to something that I would regret. I have so many majors which I FEEL like I would enjoy, but I don't know how to chose. \n\nConsidering majors:\n\n\\-Political science \n\n\\-Philosophy \n\n\\-Film \n\n\\-Psychology \n\n\\-Criminal Justice \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoy specific things, but that could be due to my ASD (autism spectrum disorder). My favorite things are rewatching my favorite TV shows and analyzing characters, or arguing with my parents. I could go on and on about my favorite shows for hours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm an exceptional student in school. I do well at everything, but I tend to like subjects I'm good at-- which poses a problem. I don't know what I genuinely like or dislike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

      "text": "in terms of assured job placement/success? Crim Justice or Psych. Police Sci is soooo oversaturated my guy. You might consider a public policy major or paralegal studies program, there are huge niche markets for that stuff now. Film and Philosophy are just kinda dead ends tbh...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I was hellbent on a poli sci major and found I loved IT instead, and I as a high school student have gotten job offers for the program I'm in so I'm all set for work. Keep your options open and don't be afraid to explore other fields of study.  And remember, you can still do stuff you love without a degree in it as a hobby.",

The only way you can get a job in the Psychology field is with a graduate level degree, and with the number of psychology graduates every year, you\u2019re most likely gonna get a job in a completely unrelated field.",

Philosophy and film are hard to get jobs in, psychology as well without graduate school. Political science or criminal justice have the most potential job-wise but there\u2019s still a million different ways you could go with that. Do more research.",

      "text": "I'd pick any major out of them and take the rest as General Education (GE) courses. It is likely that you have to take a certain number of humanities/social science courses as GE courses for graduation anyway. Spend your first semester\\~year on courses within your interest that would count as GE--especially the ones that overlap majors (for instance, intro to psych course may fill major requirements for both psych and criminal justice). If the major you chose is your favorite out of what you've taken so far, good for you! If not, you can always change your major with little to no repercussions.",
