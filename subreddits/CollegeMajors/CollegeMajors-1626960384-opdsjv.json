  "text": "I want to create medicine or products that help people get better / improve their life. \n\nOriginally, I was thinking I could major in biomedical engineering, but that field is too specific and oftentimes other engineering majors are able to become BM engineers, without majoring in BME.\n\nNow, I\u2019m thinking I should major in chemical engineering, but do y\u2019all have any other suggestions?",

              "text": "The old joke is that with chemistry you learn to make a new molecule, but with ChemE you learn to produce 800 tons in the cheapest way possible. If what you like is the business aspect, I believe that engineering courses teach you to see problems from a different perspective than a science course.\r  \n\r  \nChemical Engineering degrees tend to be easier to hire, pay much more (even at the bachelor's level), and are better stepping stones to a wider variety of jobs. Chemistry degrees are valuable too, but unless you want to be a lab monkey, you will probably need a master's or doctorate.\r  \n\r  \nSince you say you want to work directly, opt for Chemical Engineering.\n\nsource: I have relatives in the business",
