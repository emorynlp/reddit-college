  "text": "I've been looking at a lot of colleges such as UCONN, JWU, SCSU, SUNY Oneonta, etc. I've been considering a lot of different paths and degrees, and I'm most interest in majoring in Human Dev. and Family Sci., Political Science, Government, Economics, Sociology, Education, and Social Work. Obviously I can't get 7 bachelor's degrees, but I'm not really sure what I should consider majoring in.\n\nI have a great passion for social justice and advocacy. But I'm also incredibly interested in the world of Politics, Government, and Economics. Sociology is very interesting to me, and I love studying sociological topics. I've always wanted to be an educator since I was very little, and could very well see myself as a secondary ed teacher or a professor. I could also see working in mental health, such as a counselor or therapist.\n\nPlease help me. Right now UCONN seems like the best choice, as it offers degrees in all of these subjects, aside from government. Does anyone have any good advice. I'm also interested in doing a double or triple major, but only for degrees that would be well paired together such as Poli. Sci. and Economics, or Sociology and Social Work.\n\nThank you all so much.",

You can filter out the ones you hardly can get a job from (Sociology, Education, Social Work). \n\nYou are passionate about Social Justice and Advocacy, if you study Political Science and Government, not only you can be an advocate, but you also can get a job. Economics major can get you a banking job if you choose this path",

          "text": "Yeah Poli Sci and Economics do open a lot of job opportunities and are pretty wide fields. I disagree that education and social work have barely any jobs, seeing as my Mom is a social worker, and she's said there's tons of jobs available at any given time. And Education is usually in high demand.\n\nBut I do think Political Science seems like a good path. I'll look into various degrees. Thanks.",

      "text": "UCONN is a great school. It is very common to not be sure what you want to major in. During your first year you can take classes in poli sci, Econ, sociology, psych, etc. It might help to talk to upperclassmen when you are there along with talking to advisors. You might want to look into liberal arts colleges bc they are very flexible when it comes to majors.",

          "text": "UCONN is great, and I've been looking into seeing as it has so many that I am interested in. It's a great research school and has a lot of flexibility. I'm also looking into SUNY Oneonta as it is a liberal arts school, and I've heard pretty good things about it. Any recommendations for good schools that offer flexibility and majors listed above in the Northeast US (MD, DE, and above.)\n\nHow hard is UCONN to get into? My relatives in CT have told me it's near-impossible to get in if you're not living in CT, so I'm worried I won't have the skill to get accepted. I left my freshman year with a 3.45 GPA, and A's and B's. Are extracurricular's important?\n\nThanks for the help.",

              "text": "Idk how hard it is to get into outside of New England. I don't have specific admissions/stats info, but colleges like dedication to one or a few things as opposed to doing 87 different things. \n\nI think choosing what schools you're interested in is based more on personal preference. Niche is very helpful.",
