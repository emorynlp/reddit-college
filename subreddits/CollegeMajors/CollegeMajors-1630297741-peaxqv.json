I originally did nursing however I switched because I had a passion for the industry (I also didn't like nursing so much). I met amazing people in my current major, attended a lot of events, volunteered, and continue to do exceptionally well grades wise, but the pandemic completely changed me. I finished my first week back and I am not as happy as I once was. I am now completely worried whether I will find a job in this field as I saw so many people lose their jobs during the pandemic and how companies continue  to pay their workers a low wage even with the degree. I know once I graduate there will be more jobs opening up but I can't help but worry. A handful of my friends either switched out or just dropped out and even the vibes of the campus felt off. I would tell people about the great opportunities there is with this degree but now I'm not even sure anymore. I don't know if its just depression but I am not as excited about it anymore, I'm even wondering if I should pursue nursing again after I graduate. Please help, I feel so lost.", "author": "MoodyBoi9", "created": 1630297741, "retrieved": 1632958015, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hawz4fq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/peaxqv/confused_and_worried/hawz4fq/", "text": "go for nursing. it rough out here in real wirld.", "author": "ghostmode342", "created": 1630322018, "upvotes": 1}}}
