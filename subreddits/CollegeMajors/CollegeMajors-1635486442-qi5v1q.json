  "text": "Currently attending my local university and I have expressed a strong interest in the political science area but like many others I do have some relative concerns for after graduation, been thinking of double majoring and just wanted some advise on that. I am currently planning on getting an economics minor, and have thought about a GIS minor. I feel as though STEM degrees are usually a safe bet but the issue is that, I am not very good at math (and I mean that in the clearest sense that I do not enjoy it nor am I good at it.) And that and timing seem to be the biggest hurdles in terms of employment opportunities since they all like stats/data/computer science. Just looking for advice as to what would help the most. Cheers.",

I\u2019d suggest philosophy. \n\nYour economics minor will include math, and so will a lot of jobs with the term \u201canalyst\u201d in the title.",

      "text": "This is a choice that depends on your personal interests and beliefs, something that we are not fully aware of. You did not mention what kind of income you'd like to have after completing your studies. Tell me more and I can tell you more. \n\nHowever, I would suggest you think about jobs in *education/teaching* since those are safe as well but won't bring you as much money. *Journalism* is also a good choice, but again it's not the safest option if you're not passionate enough to work really hard. Something *business*\\-oriented might be the best option and it's also in high demand. I have also seen an increase in the demand for people who are specialized in anything related to *sustainability*, but I don't think that has much to do with Political Science.",
