If you can't do that, maybe you can volunteer in their shelter once a week to help out?\n\nAnother thing for your animal fix is that there are vacations you can take that you get to work with animals.  You go there and stay at their housing and depending on what you sign up for, you could help with shelter animals, help with lionfish and there was one where you help with baby turtles when they're hatching!  I think those were around Costa Rica or Honduras? Somewhere in that area.  They also had ones in Africa and Asia that help with those  animals.  The trips weren't horrendously priced and looked like fun. I had a friend that went on one and said it was the best vacation ever and absolutely life changing.  One more low-key animal vacation would be being a volunteer at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary.

Its a solid major that will give you connections and is generap enough to where you could easily pivot post graduation if you wanted.\n\nUltimately I see any degree as a half business degree. From the business majors that I knew in school, its mostly about learning the lingo and then they test you on memorization (I'm making wild generalizations, I know).\n\nSo my recommendation is to go into school as a marine biology major with a business minor. Minors are jokes as they won't add any value to your resume, but you will learn the lingo and make some connections. Front load the business minor so that in your sophomore year you can decide \"do I want to pursue a business degree or continue with my marine bio degree?\".\n\nMy advisor gave me advise like this. I was a math major that wanted to go for computer science. I wanted to switch and he said \"declare a double major, then decide which you want to pursue. Drop one if you feel the need\".

The degree is both too broad and too specific. It's too broad in the sense that it doesn't narrow down your skills and you essentially learn a wide variety of fun facts without learning any useful skills, for example soil identification or wetland delineation. And it's too specific in the sense that it pigeon holes you into only working environment related jobs. The bread and butter job for this path is Environmental Consulting (which is its own crap shoot and a lot of people don't like it) but a consulting firm will always hire an Environmental/Civil Engineer or a Geologist over an Environmental Science major so you are already at a disadvantage. Starting pays aren't great (in the range of 25-40K) and the field is very competitive because every starry eyed late teen/early 20s person has it in their head that they are passionate and want to save the environment and to make a change in the world one day. Which leads to the field being so overly saturated that graduate students with Master's degrees are hoping they get accepted into an entry level position.\n\nCulinary arts isn't a viable major as it has an extremely poor return on investment in terms of time used and money spent. A far better alternative would be to just work as a linecook at your local Applebees/Chilis and just work your way up.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1600181493, "upvotes": 5}}}
