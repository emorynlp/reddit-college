I'm 32 and wasted my 20s being a useless alcoholic. Kind of starting my life over at this point. Managing a pizza place could be alrightbut I think the pay is around 45,000 and I'm just not sure its worth it for all the work. \n\nI'm at a point where if I want to go to school and make a better life for myself I need to do it now. I thought being a social worker would be a good fit but from what I hear it can be a real nightmare. My mother is a nurse and said it's more stress than it's worth. She suggested X-ray tech for me and that does sound like something I could enjoy.  \n\nId absolutely love to try my hand at zoology but I know only a few schools specialize in that degree. I've also thought maybe HR management could be a good fit. There are just so many choices and I don't know where to begin", "author": "kooter1987", "created": 1560306462, "retrieved": 1632956907, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"er4d7bx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bzlk8q/what_should_i_major_in/er4d7bx/", "text": "Just avoid any non-STEM, non-accounting or non-tech degrees and you should be fine. Going for any other major usually won't land you a job right out of college (nvm a good paying job at that). For Zoology, I highly recommend you pursue it, but MAKE SURE you get experience/internships while in college. Get involved and make connections, that'll really help out in the long run.

Respected majors I'd say are any hard science, economics or finance if you like business, comp sci or engineering if those are your things. Other than those and a few others, best to have a specific job in mind as they're often more specific. \n\nYou could call up some companies you'd be potentially interested in working in and ask what they'd need from you to get hired. That's always a decent route. For example if you think you might like zoology, find some jobs in that field and ask if a zoology degree would be enough to get you a job.

Figure that out first imo. Then you'll narrow your search. Just start school and you'll find things and people to help you find a career path. If you're not satisfied with 45k/year then I really think you should consider the academic route.
