My grandparents make bank and expect me to be super rich and successful too. All of the things im passionate about make no money I thought about being a personal trainer, author or nutritionist but they don't really make bank. I love exercise, animation, books, movies history, religion , animals and culture but there aren't really any stable career paths for any of those things. I like the creative artistic stuff. All I really do now is pratice piano, go to the gym and play video games. I can't even enjoy my senior year because I'm super stressed about paying but everytime I sit down and get ready to apply I have a mental breakdown when they ask what major I want to do. Have any of you pursued a career in any of  the stuff I mentioned if so do you recommend it?", "author": "Aggravating_Big_8668", "created": 1610309993, "retrieved": 1632956762, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"giw3ucd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kum1rp/i_have_no_idea_what_to_major_for_and_applications/giw3ucd/", "text": "Go for something that will have a good job market and that you can see yourself doing.

Look for passive streams of income while you're young. Look into investing.

I\u2019m just going with one of my interests, while also leaving the door open for a double major.
