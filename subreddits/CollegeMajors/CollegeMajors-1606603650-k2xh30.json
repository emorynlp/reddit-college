If it is common sense, then you probably already knew the answer and are not really learning much.\n\nYour problem right now is that you have too many options.  You need to constrain the problem a bit.  In other words, if everything is a possibility it is very hard to choose.  There are two places that can narrow down the possibilities pretty quickly, one is your abilities and the other is how you want to work.\n\nIt helps to have a pretty good understanding of who you are (consider taking a Big Five personality test or reading the categories and self assessing). Find out if you are introverted or extroverted, assertive, etc.  What are you good at, what skills do you have, what do you think you could get good at with a bit of effort?  What weaknesses do you have, is it worth the effort to perhaps overcome any of them.  Do you like working with people or things?  Do you like to work alone or in a group?  Do you like to work at a desk, or would you rather be outside or moving around the facility?  Do you like a structured work environment, or unstructured one?  Do you like thinking things through logically, or do you \u201dfeel\u201d the right answer?  Do you like working with your hands, your mind or both? Are you better with math or psychology?  Are you good with machines or computers?  Is creative expression in you work important to you?  There are other similar questions you could ask, but he answers to these sorts of questions can rule out many types of career and often suggest others.\n\nThe second thing is to first look past the degree to what type of job you want to get.  Perhaps what industry you would like to work in.  College is not about pursuing your interests, it is just too damn expensive for that.  College is about training you to think like a particular type of professional, giving you the basic knowledge set of one of those professionals, and credentialing you so that a company hiring you has some assurance that the first two have been met.  It is 1/100th the cost of college to read about your interests in books, watch videos, and listen to podcasts.  It helps if your work is related to something that interests you, but not everything that interests you is worth pursuing as work (or paying for as a degree.)  Do you want to work in an office or in the field?  Do you want to travel for your job?  Would you like to interact with many different people or would you rather interact with a few professional colleagues? Do you want consistent hours?  Do you want a job where you have to \u201dsell\u201d your output, or would you rather it be purely objective?  Do you want a job where you talk, write, or draw? What are you willing to trade off for a higher salary, what is non-negotiable.  The answers to these sorts of questions can narrow jobs down.  If you know the job, then picking a useful degree is usually down to just a handful of options.  You might even find that a 4 year degree is not even the right path.\n\nThe answer will come to you.
