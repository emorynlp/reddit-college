Hang in there, it\u2019ll be over before we know it. \nI\u2019m a 24 yr old undergraduate with a loss of direction. I\u2019ve always been weird and misunderstood, so I have a difficult time putting myself into rigid boxes. I have always tried to be an entrepreneur and try to do everything myself. \nSo I\u2019ve built up a pretty sizeable online business model which, outside of COVID season, was doing decently money-wise. It\u2019s always been my dream to do something where I\u2019m my own boss, or at least free to do things in my own way. \nMy community college was not great. I couldn\u2019t get much advice from the arts departments on a direction to take, so my portfolio which you can see at AustinShippey.com (I hope the witchy subject matter doesn\u2019t distract from my various skills) I\u2019ve built everything from website to books to videos to social accounts to classes and shop events. But the market for books is lower than ever. \nSo my main quandary is, I want to apply my skills to do some fantastic job that I don\u2019t know even exists yet. \nI\u2019ve always been a free soul so I can imagine myself going many many many places, singing, acting, painting, making movies, performance art; etc etc. these are the things I love. \nI want to find a position where I can maximize my best talents. But what is actually profitable nowadays? What do I have a shot at? I wish I could peer more clearly into the future, but I\u2019m suddenly at a small impasse in life. I don\u2019t know what degree to get because I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to be showing it to. \nSo I hope to find some wise words of advice to help me find my place, and my people in the world. \ud83c\udf0d Thank you! \ud83c\udf83", "author": "janicot", "created": 1603596114, "retrieved": 1632847169, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"gao9zil": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jhmind/eccentric_content_creator_wondering_which/gao9zil/", "text": "Your attitude would fit right in at a philosophy department", "author": "Atsena", "created": 1604120656, "upvotes": 1}}}
