I took design and I found it fun before I attended university so I chose it as one of my major. I wanted to learn how to program websites and applications too. So I took a double major. \n\nBut 2 months in, my programming is making me suffer. I find it so difficult. Others are leap and bounds ahead of me while I'm stuck. I'm in a deep emotional mess now and I'm thinking of dropping my programming major.\n\nBut I am also stuck in this middle where, if I drop programming, will if affect my career prospects of design. Or should I grit my teeth and continue? \n\nI did think of taking a degree in accounting as I had 3 years of experience on studying accounting but I studied design beforehand so I did not choose it.\n\nAs it can be seen, I have began questioning my decision to just drop out of university so I could change to another degree. I want an answer but I don't know what is the correct answer. \n\nAm I just giving up too easily and making an impulsive decision? What should I do? Any advice would be helpful.", "author": "crishla", "created": 1614869044, "retrieved": 1632956938, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gpoyw5q": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lxm1jt/should_i_change_my_degree/gpoyw5q/", "text": "What jobs were you looking into? \n\nIf you are interested in design and programming then a career in front-end development would be good. When/If applying to these jobs, some companies allow their front-end developers to do both programming and designing a website/app. You can stick to front-end languages like HTML, CSS, javascript, and other relevant frameworks.\n\nIf you really want to drop programming altogether and still love design, you can look into UI or UX design.
