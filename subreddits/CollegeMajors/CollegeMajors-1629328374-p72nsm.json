Not to mention I really enjoy the CJ courses I find them interesting", "author": "ButterscotchJust4", "created": 1629328374, "retrieved": 1632957411, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h9hkvx5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/p72nsm/should_i_switch_my_major_back_to_criminal_justice/h9hkvx5/", "text": "It is true that the field is oversaturated with lawyers. It\u2019s also true that CJ isn\u2019t entirely useful and the LSAT scores for CJ majors are far from the best. \n\nIf you study ITS, do you want to work in the field? Do you enjoy it? Can you maintain a good GPA? You could always go to law school with an ITS degree. Lawyers have all kinds of backgrounds.", "author": "slouchingbethlehem", "created": 1629341806, "upvotes": 1}}}
