Keep in mind not many (if any) foreigners end up creating anime, or working on one in japan. It\u2019s incredibly rare. Natasha Allegri (Bee & Puppycat creator) is now there since the studio they originally used changed, so she was able to relocated to Japan to be more connected to her work\u2019s process. Without connections or a transfer, your chances are slim to nothing.\n\nWith that being said, CalArts offers the \u201cbest\u201d animation program there is, and if you can, i 100% recommend applying for CSSSA! It\u2019s a great summer experience, but tuition for out of state students has gone up (it\u2019s about $6.5k now). \n\nOther than CalArts, i know Sheridan is great for character animation, and RISD for experimental. I would avoid AI and SVA. \n\nFor portfolio, make sure you get figure drawings perfect. Fluidity is key in them, along with the understanding of the human figure. Study from life, observe and draw what\u2019s around you. It is impossible to have a perfectly stylized piece without having your fundamentals. Draw from life, i cannot emphasize this enough. CalArts sketchbooks are about 95% observational, and you can compare them to a student\u2019s stylized work to see just how they incorporate their knowledge of real world figures into their pieces.\n\nEdit: career falls under character animation, kinda got carried away lol", "author": "rollierockie", "created": 1574314046, "upvotes": 2}, "f86zm7y": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dz8qi6/i_want_to_be_an_animator_but/f86zm7y/", "text": "Graphic design maybe? I think you'd have to go to art or film school for this. But ask yourself if this career is worth pursuing at a 4 year institution or not.
