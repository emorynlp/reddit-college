I don\u2019t really know what exactly they are and would like some more explanation on it. I also want to know if its relatively easy or not, requires high level math, and what a average day consists of.",

      "text": "/u/Ayham_abusalem  has summoned me, so here I am.  \n\nMIS is a great degree. ISOM is just MIS with a different title.  \n\nBoth of those degrees will look something like this on the inside:  \n\n* 20% General Education  \n - Should include Statistics, Algebra and Calculus optionally.  \n - Should include an English course and a Communications course.  \n* 40% Business Administration + Economics  \n - Should include Introductory Econ, Accounting and Ethics.  \n* 30% Computer Science or Software Engineering  \n - Should include 2-3 semesters of a programming language  \n - Should include programing as a group  \n - Should include Software Development Lifecycle  \n - Should include databases  \n* 10% Information Technology  \n - Should include introductory Security  \n - Should include introductory Operating Systems or Networks, sometimes both.  \n\n\nDifferent institutions will quibble over the exact percentages of content and might add or remove some content, but they are largely all the same.  \n\nMost of these degrees have a nice array of elective slots that you can fill to tune your education in whatever direction interests you, or whatever direction you think will be the most employable.  \n\nThis degree teaches you a little bit about a whole lot of subjects, which can make you a pretty handy person to have around.  \n\nThe roles this education best prepares you for are anywhere the business needs a liaison between the business operations people, and the technology staff.  \n\nTechnical Analyst roles.  \nBusiness Analyst roles.  \nProject Management.  \n\nThe VERY best thing you can do to help accelerate your career is to access internship or Co-Operative employment opportunities so you can see how the world works and how this education can help you best fit into it.  \n\nThis summer you should build a LinkedIn account and a good Resume. Not a quick and easy resume that you pound out in a night.  \nA **good** resume that takes you a week to get just right.  \n\nWhy?  \n\nBecause the Fall Career Fair event at your university happens roughly 30 to 60 days after the semester begins, and you need to be ready for it.  \n\nDon't let anybody tell you Freshmen never get internships. It's bullshit. Freshmen CAN get internships, the problem is that most Freshmen are unprepared and suck at interviews.  \n\nMake sure you don't suck at being interviewed. Your university has an Office of Career Services on campus.  \nThey host interview skills workshops. Sign up and get in there and learn something.  \n\nWe pay out interns something like $20 an hour and buy them all kinds of educational materials, and provide all kinds of mentoring.  \n\nEven a mediocre summer internship is likely to be a better experience than mowing lawns all summer.  \n\nDon't shy away from tough courses.  \n\nThe bigger salaries go to those who can help solve nasty, stinky, complicated as hell problems.  \nEasy classes don't prepare you to solve these kinds of problems worth a damn.  \n\nBusiness Analysts and Technical Analysts solve problems for a living.  \nYou'll coordinate. You'll communicate.  You'll share information, and gather information.  \nYou'll create presentations to summarize large sums of information into bite-sized, easy to chew on nuggets that are equally easy to remember.  \n\n\nKnow what's great about this education, and these kinds of jobs?  \n\n\nYou don't care who your employer is. You can work for anybody. Every employer needs these kinds of people.  \n\nWant to work for Tesla? General Motors? NASA? Dupont Chemical? Spalding sports equipment? Panera Bread corporate offices?  \n\nThis education is not industry specific. You don't HAVE to work for Microsoft or Apple or something.  \n\nKnow what else is cool about this education?  \n\nThe degree teaches you a little bit about a lot of subject matter.  \nIf you stumble across something that you REALLY like, and want to dig in deeply on, you can stack your elective slots full of deeper coursework in that subject area.  \nBoom, you are no longer a generalist, you are now a specialist.  \n\n\nBuy this book: [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509)  \n\nThat book is a novel. A fictional story about a guy who works for a business that has a giant software project that is going to shit, so he uses some clever project management tricks to unscrew the project only to discover the project is building the wrong product entirely.  \n\nIt presents a practical environment where a bunch of the business to software skills you are developing might be used.  \n\nIt's not a technical nerd book. It's a novel. It's really easy to read and does a great job explaining the processes and tools in an easy to understand manner.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nIf you have more questions, don't be afraid to ask.",
