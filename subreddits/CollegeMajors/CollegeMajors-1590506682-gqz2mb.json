I **HATE** biology and science. It was never my passion. However, I came from a family where both my parents were doctors and all my siblings were in the medical field. I was fully aware of the expectation I had to meet and my parents made sure I knew. They wanted me to graduate as a bio major with a 4.0 GPA and become a doctor.  \nI ***suffered*** as a bio major. I had no passion for the classes I was taking. I hated every chemistry class and bio class I took and my GPA suffered too. It was less my ability to do well in those classes, but I had no drive/motivation.  \nFortunately, I met a great group of friends that encouraged me to study what I wanted to study.  \nI changed my major to a double major in History and Theology and took classes that I enjoyed.  \nMajor in what you want to major in.   \nIf you're not passionate about what you study, your GPA and mental health will suffer. Don't make the same mistake I did. Take classes that you will want to get out of bed to attend, not for the participation grade but because you actually want to be there. I can't tell you how many times I skipped Chem, but I've never skipped my History or Theology classes.", "author": "AgoraphobicDisaster", "created": 1590834098, "upvotes": 5}, "fs2fomw": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gqz2mb/is_it_alright_if_you_take_a_major_you_have_no/fs2fomw/", "text": "what major is it? and which major would u choose other than that", "author": "silenca", "created": 1590651850, "upvotes": 1}, "fs1i7k5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gqz2mb/is_it_alright_if_you_take_a_major_you_have_no/fs1i7k5/", "text": "no way.

I got really depressed and missed classes. Failed all of my classes and had major panic attacks due to stress. Think about what you are interested in; how it will effect your future as well as the effects it can have on you mentally. College is already hard as it is, so if you are doing something that you end up hating it call cause more issues.
