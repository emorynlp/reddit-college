I have to declare my concentration for my business administration degree soon, and I'm still confused about what I should major in. If I choose marketing, I feel like I will have an easier time understanding the material compared to my peers, but in my information systems class, some people are way more knowledgeable than me. I guess what I'm saying is information systems is a bit out of comfort level, but it is still a concentration that intrigues me. If any marketing and info systems majors can say what they love about their major(or hate), that will be greatly appreciated.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/p88n7j)", "author": "Then_Pea_9468", "created": 1629476791, "retrieved": 1632958272, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"haei2iu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/p88n7j/pros_and_cons_of_marketing_information_systems/haei2iu/", "text": "MIS graduate here go into accounting lol", "author": "unithrowaway777", "created": 1629968057, "upvotes": 1}, "h9ohfsa": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/p88n7j/pros_and_cons_of_marketing_information_systems/h9ohfsa/", "text": "Information System is more useful, marketing field is saturated.", "author": "DetectiveTacoX", "created": 1629477016, "upvotes": 4}}}
