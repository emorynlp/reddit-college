This program allows me to transfer my general education credits to any program there is offered by state funded university. I have a high interest in the physical sciences, as well as a social sciences. Since I am interested in Chemistry, Biology, Psychology and Social Work, it has been very difficult for me to choose a major. My goal is to eventually go to graduate school after about two years after landing a job out of college.
