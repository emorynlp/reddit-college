  "text": "Got into 2 different school for film and video production pretty much. Got into another for communications with a concentration in digital media. The 2 are heavily focused on video production and the comm one is heavily focused on communications with 6-7 courses in video/ digital media. I love film and video but part of me also loves people meeting new people. Hoping to either be in digital marketing, film, or some kind of public relations and event planning. Any advice on which degree is more well rounded and more worth it? I know neither degree is the greatest. But id still like to finish one nonetheless.",
