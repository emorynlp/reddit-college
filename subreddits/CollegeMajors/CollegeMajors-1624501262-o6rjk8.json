Some don't, it depends on how many courses are required for the major. Check out the website of wherever you're going and try to find that information. \n\nAnyways, minors are mainly ways for you to take courses that interest you without having to get a whole second major. Minor in whatever you think would be cool, or something you feel complements Business Information Systems. Computer Science, Math, and Economics all seems similar enough to complement BIS. It doesn't have to be that related though, I know Chemistry majors with Music minors and History majors with Computer Science minors.\n\nMinors matter far less than majors on things like job and grad school applications, so it really is up to you.", "author": "XcgsdV", "created": 1624514322, "upvotes": 1}}}
