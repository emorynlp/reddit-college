      "text": "Yes because it doesn't teach you any real skills to attribute to a company. It gives you a great overview of different aspect of business. It would be good if you already knew what small business you wanted to start. But company's don't hire recent graduates just because they were given a general overview of finance market and ops that mostly has nothing to do with their specific industry. They want to hire accountants, sales people, marketing, HR, lawyers, computer science majors, analysts, or other tools for their business.",

      "text": "Kind of. People who don\u2019t know what they want to major in but know they want business choose business admin. It has that reputation because it\u2019s not specialized and there is no specific career that you might choose. It\u2019s also probably easier than other business majors so less work.",
