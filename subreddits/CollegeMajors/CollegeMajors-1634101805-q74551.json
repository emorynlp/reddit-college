      "text": "Employers won\u2019t view a writing and rhetoric major very differently from a creative writing major. Either way, you can write! For writing-related jobs, employers will be most interested in your writing samples (preferably not just essays \u2014 blogs, articles, etc. are good) and experience. Some employers may give you extra points for taking elective courses in marketing, digital design, or HTML/CSS, but those don\u2019t need to be part of your major or even a minor. If you love creative writing, go for it! \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about job prospects, consider career options (copywriting/content marketing, PR, editing, journalism, tech writing, etc. are good jobs for any kind of English/writing degree), sign up for extracurriculars that build skills and writing samples (like your student newspaper) and do a relevant internship.\n\nSide note: English is no more or less relevant/broadly applicable than creative writing. They overlap a lot. Either way, you will build writing and critical thinking skills and take more literature courses than the average student.",
