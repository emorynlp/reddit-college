      "text": "Every time someone brings up triple majoring, I have to implore them not to do it. Even double majoring isn\u2019t worth it most of the time. Both are doable but it comes at a large expense of your time.\n\nThere are much more valuable ways to spend your time to get you into your career. I always suggest to take an internship, part-time job, or joining a club and working towards a leadership position in your field over adding more majors. These are a lot more valuable to employers than extra majors. If your goal is academia and graduate school, then use the time to start undergraduate research (ask your professors about getting into it, most professors like to see curiosity in their work and initiative of their well-performing undergraduates). I was able to publish a paper in undergrad because I decided to drop my second major and do research instead. This was the point a lot of my interviewers found impressive when I was applying for graduate schools.\n\nI understand that you might have interests in many things. It\u2019s why I wanted to double major in the first place. However, it is better to compliment your major with a minor and time wise, doing two minors is a lot more forgiving than two or more majors. So, if you really wanted to do all three, I would highly suggest a major and two minors instead of three majors.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I\u2019m happy to help!",

      "text": "One thing I would say about double majoring is that it\u2019s not 2 degrees. In college we saw double majors as if they were getting two degrees and that adding a minor was like getting another half of a degree.\n\nIn industry, it\u2019s pretty much seen as if double majors have about 1.1 degrees or maybe 1.2. Adding a minor is like adding .03 of a degree.\n\nI knew a triple major in college (psycology, math, child development). She took 5 years to graduate. It\u2019s cool that she did that, and I hope she was doing it to serve her own interests because I doubt it had that much an affect on job hunting.\n\nI did a double major in math and computer science. It might have helped me get my first job, but now that I\u2019m 7ish years out, it\u2019s never brought up and I haven\u2019t used my math degree in forever.",

I would worry that it would cause you to graduate late, which for me would have been disastrous since tuition was $45k/year. \n\nI mean, post graduation I don\u2019t really need a school to tell me I got a degree or passed a class. I have studied Portuguese and philosophy on my own, not enough for a degree, but definitely enough for a few courses. When covid is over, I might start taking courses at the local Junior College.",

You start learning about all the inherent assumptions you have like, \u201cwhat if distance was defined as the square root of the difference of the points? What if it was just the sum of the difference of the points? How does this change other definitions of the world around us? What does a circle look like?\u201d\n\nThen you can get into code breaking which is pretty cool. You learn about information passing and interesting ways to pass information, which can be applied to satellites as well as data privacy.",
