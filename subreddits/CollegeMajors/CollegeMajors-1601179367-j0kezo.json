  "text": "So I\u2019ve always loved Biology in various disciplines as well as pretty much anything in the social sciences, but I also have interests in engineering (electrical/structural/construction) as well as architecture and I don\u2019t really want to be boxed in to any one thing. I\u2019m thinking about majoring in biology with a minor in something else or double majoring, but I also know that biology is a pretty saturated major. I guess I\u2019m pretty much asking what the best plan of action would be to indulge a bit in everything like a liberal arts degree, or if I should focus in on one maybe two things. I want to go into research, but, again, I\u2019m torn between different things in biology and the social sciences. Btw, I\u2019m in the process of deciding on colleges to apply to.",
