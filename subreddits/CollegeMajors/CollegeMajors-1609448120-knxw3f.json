When I was 18, I majored in Creative Writing, but I ended up dropping out after a year. 8 years later, I\u2019m enrolled to start my English degree, but I\u2019m starting to have doubts. English has always been my strongest subject. I want/ed to be a writer. However, the creative field is hard to find success in, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m talented enough, to be honest. I want to major in something that provides a steady income and has plenty job opportunities. Now the lab technician degree requires a lot of math and science, which aren\u2019t my strongest subjects. Many of the health science fields are too, how should I say, social? But this field seems a little more introvert friendly, and I would know exactly what kind of job to look for, unlike English where it\u2019s vague and you\u2019re not trained to do one particular job. So, let me know what you all think!", "author": null, "created": 1609448120, "retrieved": 1632847074, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ghnzs4g": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/knxw3f/should_i_major_in_english_or_medical_laboratory/ghnzs4g/", "text": "I used to be an English major, so I'll offer the advice I can. There are def jobs for English majors, and a lot of them overlap with jobs for other liberal arts majors (marketing, HR, PR, copywriting, technical writing, communications, etc.) For me personally though, this just wasn't the way to go. I felt really lost and didn't know what I wanted to do in the future, which gave me a lot of anxiety. Some people thrive with that kind of choice though, and I do know some English major friends/family who were successful. \n\nI think it depends on what you want in your life. Do you value stability or do you want to take a chance and study something you love, even if the career path isn't as well defined? I can't really answer that question for you. For me, though, the answer was clear, and even though I did like English, I switched my major to computer science for better job prospects. It's also worth noting you can get better at a subject, so I wouldn't let the math and science scare you off unless you are very bad at it. If you find the major interesting, I would say it's worth a shot.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1609466983, "upvotes": 2}, "ghn61b7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/knxw3f/should_i_major_in_english_or_medical_laboratory/ghn61b7/", "text": "Medical laboratory technician is more practical.
