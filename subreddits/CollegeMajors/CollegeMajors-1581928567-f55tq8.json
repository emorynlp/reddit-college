I want to change my major to something were I can help and give back to the community. I thought maybe social work or something similar. I am confused on what major to pick. Does anyone have any advice and/or suggestions?", "author": "hugomartinez21", "created": 1581928567, "retrieved": 1632958140, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fhxr796": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/f55tq8/changing_my_major_georgia_state_university/fhxr796/", "text": "Social work would be a great choice if you\u2019re looking to get involved in the community, but definitely look very deeply into what being a social worker involves. One of my friends absolutely loves it, and another is miserable. I would suggest talking to someone who is currently in the field about the career! \n\nSome other majors that are really helpful to others are Student Affairs, Clinical Psychology, Special Education, American Sign Language, and Family and Consumer Sciences. \n\nGood luck!", "author": "livi611", "created": 1581960558, "upvotes": 3}}}
