But I feel I have a specific question regarding these two in terms of employment and what is more in demand.\n\nFinally going back to school at age 30. So I'm older and I know these fields can be hard to get into. I'm really concerned about being able to find a job, especially if it takes me even longer to get a degree considering I work full-time and also have a child that I take care of 50/50 with the mother.\n\nI understand the oversimplified premise that CPE = more hardware and CS = more software/algorithms.\n\nHere is my main question. I see that CS is in more demand but can most if not all of those jobs be filled by a computer engineer? Especially if I take CS classes in my later years of obtaining my CPE degree? Or in graduate school? My thought process is that--yes--specific CPE jobs might not be as widely available but computer engineers might be able to get into CS and maybe even EE jobs.\n\nAs for what I want to do for a job I don't care much, but I am pretty sure I don't want to do IT. Security, programming, anything hardware related really would be great and I would find interest in it.\n\nI'm also in Southern California if that is important to know.\n\nKnowing all this what major do you suggest I do?", "author": "Ames714", "created": 1612070865, "retrieved": 1632956869, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"glhgqos": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l95it2/computer_science_vs_computer_engineering/glhgqos/", "text": "I would recommend computer engineering and then just minor in Cs since then you can enter both fields easily. It seems like you like the engineering side more. How much do you value money, they both make a lot but Cs make more and a lot of the times you can work less hours( if your good at coding you could work 20hrs a week) The the main perk of being a software engineer since you get paid by getting your weekly work done so you don\u2019t have a set hours to work.", "author": "ChurninPark", "created": 1612105634, "upvotes": 1}}}
