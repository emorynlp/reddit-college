  "text": "A tip when considering majors: Colleges are aware that certain popular courses have an enrollment cap (limited seats). This is also true of majors: there are only so many major advisers and upper level major classes.  This is why you see huge intro courses in super popular majors like biology and psych that try to weed students out. They also have courses open in humanities majors and languages in particular that are annually under enrolled. So you will have a big advantage in applications and scholarships if you pursue a major in one of these under enrolled majors. You will simply not stand out if you are ONLY aiming for a major that the rest of the entire first year class is too. So you become the most attractive candidate if you aim to double major in two different things because interdisciplinary studies is very popular at the moment. Remember you can always double major and minor, so there is no need to not study what you want at the end of the day. \n\nFor example, when I applied to college I said I wanted to study Latin. I did end up studying Latin and also economics but by making latin my priority major I got a full ride because no one wanted to study Latin lol. I would\u2019ve gotten nothing if I said my priority major was economics.  And yes I am currently gainfully employed :-)",
