      "text": "It depends on several factors:\n\n1. How much of a pre-existing knowledge base do you have for the two majors?\n2. Considering that your two choices are not closely related, the lack of overlap could be quite a disadvantage. (For undergrad I doubled in history and poli sci where there is quite a bit of overlap of material, but each field is taking a different approach).\n3. The overrall rigor of your university.\n4. The expectations of the faculty of the individual programs and areas of concentration. Say--for example--you could concentrate in operating systems for the CS major: how demanding is/are the profs that teach the courses in that particular concentration?\n\nTo boil it all down: YMMV because of factors unique to you, your chosen majors and faculty expectations of what students are coming in with as well as their course requirements. As well as the nature of the courses--for instance, I suspect upper-level marketing courses will have quite a bit of reading of marketing (and possibly psych) journal articles.",
