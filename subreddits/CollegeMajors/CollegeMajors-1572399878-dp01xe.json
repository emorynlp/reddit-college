      "text": "To study fossils, you can definitely get there by studying biology, but since it\u2019s a subfield of geology, your best bet would be something similar to that. That would take you away from studying cells though. Really, the best way to get there is to study both biology and geology during your undergrad, but it\u2019s not necessary. You will need a graduate degree down this path though if you want to work in paleontology. \n\nFor studying earthquakes, that would be seismology. It\u2019s a field that\u2019s heavily based on physics and math, but it\u2019s incredibly interesting. Check to see if your college offers geophysics, as that\u2019s typically what that field of study falls under major wise. \n\nFor both of these, Earth Science could fit perfectly, although it won\u2019t go as in depth as geology or geophysics.",

              "text": "Well, I\u2019m not a paleontologist, so I\u2019m no expert on how to really get a solid foot in the field. However, I am a practicing archaeologist and although the research is different, the field methods and reasons for research are quite similar. So, I presume it\u2019ll have a similar path. Essentially, you\u2019ll want a strong background in historical geology and sedimentary rocks in your undergrad. You\u2019ll also want to get some hands on experience on a field dig, which a lot of colleges offer. There you\u2019ll learn digging techniques, relevant areas of study, and have contact with real practicing paleontologists. So you can essentially do some networking on these excavations. \n\nI\u2019d recommend contacting someone in the geoscience department at you college about this, as I\u2019m honestly not too well informed on this matter apart from basic knowledge of what they deal with.",
