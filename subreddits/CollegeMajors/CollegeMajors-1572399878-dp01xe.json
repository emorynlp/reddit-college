That would take you away from studying cells though. Really, the best way to get there is to study both biology and geology during your undergrad, but it\u2019s not necessary. You will need a graduate degree down this path though if you want to work in paleontology. \n\nFor studying earthquakes, that would be seismology. It\u2019s a field that\u2019s heavily based on physics and math, but it\u2019s incredibly interesting. Check to see if your college offers geophysics, as that\u2019s typically what that field of study falls under major wise. \n\nFor both of these, Earth Science could fit perfectly, although it won\u2019t go as in depth as geology or geophysics.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1572538369, "upvotes": 1}}}
