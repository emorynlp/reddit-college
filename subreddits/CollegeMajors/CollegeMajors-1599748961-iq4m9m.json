Currently I am in a business course at my college but I hate it, to the point that I have mental break downs constantly. They said that they had programs in place to help me ( I have ADD) but there is none. I like more hands on work, there are no other courses interest that are at my college except  Fashion. My math is bad so I have trouble getting into other colleges.My family wants me to finish a degree/certificate because I have money that I can only use for college (out of both of our hands). Fashion is not something that I partially have a mind for but I think I might be willing to learn it .  I'm conflicted on what to do about my future. I really need advice.\n\nPS. My family are slightly on board ( most want me to finish Business )", "author": "Deadfish234", "created": 1599748961, "retrieved": 1632847556, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"g80485v": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/iq4m9m/should_i_pursue_a_degreecertificate_in_fashion/g80485v/", "text": "You don't sound passionate about fashion, and I think that's important to have.
