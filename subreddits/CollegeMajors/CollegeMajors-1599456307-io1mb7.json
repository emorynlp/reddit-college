I\u2019m a new sophomore bio major in community college and transferring fall 2021 to Either CSU or UC. I just dropped my molecular cell biology class because it was impossible for me to continue the class since it was very hard and I simply didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. I\u2019m thinking of changing my major and when I google majors it\u2019s always engineering, finance. I\u2019m okay in math and I feel like I can be better if I try my hardest. I\u2019m currently draining mentally because of pandemic, pressure of life and work, and classes, apply to colleges. Can you guys please please tell me a career that would pay 70k-90k a year. I am a hard worker. It\u2019s been 3 years that I live in America and I went from working in subway to being a medical interpreter making 20$ an hour. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing my research for college majors and careers and I\u2019m totally lost. I would love to read you guys major and career plans. \n\nI live in Sacramento California, so I would need a career that\u2019s better for CA.
