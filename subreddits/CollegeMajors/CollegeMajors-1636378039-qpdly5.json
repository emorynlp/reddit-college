  "text": "Hi. I couldn't really decide which to major in. I'm OK with finance, I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. But I heard that finance is useful within marketing. \n\nI love marketing, but others said majoring in marketing is useless because you can learn it by yourself. \n\nSo should I major minor? Or double major? Or just major in one of them instead? \n\nThankss",
