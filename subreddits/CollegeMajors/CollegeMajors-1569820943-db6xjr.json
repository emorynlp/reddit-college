I've always been really interested in physics and astronomy, but I wouldn't want to end up working as a teacher/professor, so I'm currently leaning more on the engineering side of things. Problem is, I don't what exactly I would want to do. I've been thinking about Nuclear Engineering recently, as well as Aerospace Engineering, but I would like to know any more possibilities that you all think I may be interested in.", "author": "randomaxe11", "created": 1569820943, "retrieved": 1632848174, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {}}
