  "text": "Alrighty, to start off I am a Junior in HS so I still have quite a bit of time to pick what I want to do, but it's probably better to be thinking about it than to not be. I've always been really interested in physics and astronomy, but I wouldn't want to end up working as a teacher/professor, so I'm currently leaning more on the engineering side of things. Problem is, I don't what exactly I would want to do. I've been thinking about Nuclear Engineering recently, as well as Aerospace Engineering, but I would like to know any more possibilities that you all think I may be interested in.",
