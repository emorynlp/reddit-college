In high school I was fairly well rounded and did well in all my classes but I found science classes interesting. So I just completed my first semester of college in a bio/biochem double major. I\u2019m not crazy about the idea of completing more than 4 years of college and I would just rather graduate and get a job. My only preferences are that I can graduate in 4 years, and get a job where I can work in any city even a smallish town. I was considering finance but I\u2019m not too sure yet. I\u2019m not sure I have a \u201cpassion\u201d when it comes to careers like I\u2019ve never really had a dream job and I just have trouble picturing myself as a doctor or any job with the bio/biochem degree.
