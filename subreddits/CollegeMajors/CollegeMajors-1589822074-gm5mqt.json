  "title:": "What are some really good double major pairs for a student interested in medicine?",
  "text": "I am interested in going into the medical field. Whether it's PA school or nursing school. I am interested in double majoring, but I don't know what are some good pairs. I have a lot of hobbies and interests. Here's an idea of the majors that I thought of. Biology & psychology, Biology & neuroscience, psychology & neuroscience, biology & business(maybe economics), psychology & business(maybe economics). I have an interest in business too which is why I thought it would be nice to get a busness major too. However, my main focus is in medicine because I have always wanted to go into the medical field. What do you think are the best options for me and it's benefits. \n\nIf you guys have any other options please tell me.",

      "text": "IDK if this is the kind of stuff you're interested in, but I know that a lot of med students at my school study humanities subjects in addition to science (I knew a guy who was doing pre med and comparative literature). If you're interested in some of these humanities subjects, eg. English, history, philosophy, political science, sociology, etc. I think those could be really good choices, since they help break up your workload and give you a good mix of different subjects, so you don't get bored of taking science classes all of the time.",

              "text": "well what kind of career would you want if you didn't get into med school? I know pre med and med school/residency is a huge commitment, so I'm assuming you're probably passionate about wanting to work in healthcare and helping people. I mean, would you even want a generic business type job if you didn't get into med school? And what business major are you thinking about? because not all business majors have good job outcomes.",
