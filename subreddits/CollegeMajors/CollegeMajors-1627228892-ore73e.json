There\u2019s so much I know I want to learn and my focus is always on something else after some time. I\u2019ve come to accept that I just want to learn too much and so I changed my perspective. I tried to consider who I idolize, what\u2019s important to me, what I hope to become, and what I\u2019m naturally good and bad at. Considering all of these, I can try to answer the question of \u201cwho do I want to become?\u201d. Answering that question is a lot easier to answer than just \u201chow do I choose what to study?\u201d. It\u2019ll become about who you want to become and how you can get there. Everything seems like it\u2019ll work out just fine from that approach. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed from those who studied something and didn\u2019t regret it.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "TheZarcFiles", "created": 1627261138, "upvotes": 2}}}
