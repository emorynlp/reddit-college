I ask this because these programs get shit thrown at them for the most part but I\u2019m looking for just updated/new feedback that isn\u2019t 1 or 2 years + old. These programs are International Relations/Political Science, A degree in a foreign language/translations, Linguistics or Geography. So from what I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m pretty cucked if I pursue one of these (I would assume again from posts many years ago) and that Geography would be my best bet...but tbh It\u2019d be my last option due to everything apparently revolving around GIS. I\u2019m also extremely shit at math before anybody tells me to do something revolving around economics, engineering, auditing, etc. I just have a huge thing for Social Sciences, I mean I also really like Criminology and Sociology which apparently would mega-cuck me. Thank you for any comments!\n\n\u2022 I just realized I shat on the title...sorry", "author": "ThrowawayPancakes209", "created": 1603386720, "retrieved": 1632957631, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g9qey1t": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jg3ukk/i_am_screwed/g9qey1t/", "text": "It is often said that you won't find a job.
