It is a field that really interests me from an academical and even business point of view. \nHowever, I know that many people who study CS. Everyone of them is really into PC hardware/software and gaming stuff, which I really don't care about. Am I overthinking this or is it actually preferable to have a certain flair / knowledge in aforementioned things ?

On a average work day you will code from 2-6 hours depending on your role and company. Apple you work longer but most companies fall between those numbers. And the higher the role the more business meeting and stuff and the less coding. If you can focus doing work at a computer desk for a couple hours then you fine. Look up some day in the life videos of working and studying cs. Also remember it\u2019s very math oriented. Also what college are you planning on going too, t10 or a t100.
