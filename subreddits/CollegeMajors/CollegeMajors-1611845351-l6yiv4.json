As per the title, I've been taking community college courses for nearly 2 years and have steadily maintained a 4.0 GPA. Initially, I began in a CS curriculum, primarily since I had a relatively decent background with programming, and like many other students, was passively jockeyed into being an \"Engineer\" upon high school graduation since I was good at math and science.  \n\n\n I had a LITTLE spark of interest in programming, which I still maintain. I've characterized my interest in programming before as though, for me, it's similar to \"doing sudoku puzzles on your phone while you shit.\" As you can probably presume, it is not something I do AT ALL in my free time, since I simply can't gather the gusto, and it feels pointless to me.  \n\n\nMy erstwhile, longheld interests have pertained primarily to Literature(English) and Philosophy. However, I'm absolutely terrified to become homeless, or to end up in a teaching position I despite...so, yeah. Also, I wouldn't say I'm a particularly *good* writer, despite desperately having tried to be(my ideational capabilities are subpar, to say the least -- meaning, I don't have ideas, don't know what to write about, etc).  \n\n\nAnyways, for the entire first year of my stay at a CC, I took a CS curriculum and passed with a 4.0 GPA. For my third semester, after COVID hit, I had an anxiety attack(personal reasons) and resultantly dropped out of calculus 3 and an integral CS course.  \n\n\nNow it's my fourth semester, around the time my parents are expecting me to transfer, and I'm in all literature/liberal arts classes. I'm doing fine in them, they hold my interest. But, over the last two years, all of my courses have been jumbled up, and I don't really know what to do from here on out.  \n\n\nI don't even KNOW what I'm interested in. I feel as though I can pretty much self-delude myself into being interested in anything -- however, it's self-delusion, which only lasts so long.  \nI have no marketable skills, no ability to gain an internship, no competencies/talents other than general \"intellect,\" and I have no clue as to what I'm best suited for.  \n\n\nI'd really appreciate advice from whoever is willing to grant it.

I used to be an English major, and a lot of people I knew were also humanities majors. I know these majors are generally clowned on for not leading to good jobs, with the whole \"haha what do you want to do, work at Starbucks?\" trope, but there are definitely career paths for these majors. Marketing, HR, PR, communications, etc were the types of jobs a lot of humanities people got. But you have to ask yourself: are these the types of jobs you want? If you truly are terrified of stability (which is perfectly understandable) and getting a job, a humanities degree, and these types of careers, are definitely riskier. Plus, a lot of these careers don't really seem that interesting, at least to me, which is why I changed my major. I feel like a lot of people just like the humanities and decide to pursue these jobs because they don't know what else to do, which is a potentially bad decision. You should think about what kind of jobs you want, and pick a major that complements it, in most cases.\n\nI would personally recommend for you to do CS then, unless you can think of a career you really want that you can get with an English/philsophy/humanities major. CS is a safe major that generally leads to decent paying jobs. It's also very versatile. You can obviously go into programming, but also product management, UX design, software sales, analyst positions, etc. It just seems like a safer option, especially since you don't have a strong passion to do something else. Sometimes careers are just things we tolerate, and we learn to like them over time.\n\nedit: also, consider double majoring! (if you can). definitely one of my bigger regrets not doing that.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1611883742, "upvotes": 2}, "gl4by4y": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l6yiv4/nearly_2_years_into_cc_40_gpa_still_cant_decide/gl4by4y/", "text": "Something that might help is browsing the major/course offerings of the schools you might want to apply to. A degree isnt a guarantee of any career an english degree isnt an automatic sentence to getting a terrible job but you will need to learn how to market it and network, which is what college career centers are for. Youd be surprised at how many resources are available that people just dont use. \n\nColleges also dont care how long you take to transfer, if you think you want to go back to a stem major, try explaining to your parents how normal it is to take an additional year or so to complete all your requirements. We all have setbacks and sometimes convincing yourself to overcome them can be really enlightening to what your potential is.\n\nIf you have no work experience, try finding virtual clubs to be a part of. these can be really helpful for showing skills such as leadership and working with other people which is half the battle.  Your classwork can also be used an indication that you can meet deadlines and work under pressure (ie doing well on a final exam). These wont be skills that get you a super high paying job but they can get your foot in the door for things like data entry etc. to build up your resume, entry level jobs also can have internal promotion potential, so if theres a company you might want to work for, starting entry level can be a good way to start networking towards the job you want. \n\nLastly, try to get an appointment with your CC transfer center counselor ASAP,  they can help you organize your transfer plan and help you brainstorm different pathways. I think we get so caught up in that we need to major in something we are passionate about, but in reality this only occurs to a tiny fraction of people. Try not to be too hard on yourself for not having it all figured out.", "author": "Transfer2020", "created": 1611854865, "upvotes": 5}}}
