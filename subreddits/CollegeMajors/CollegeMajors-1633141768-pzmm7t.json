  "title:": "What Career or Major should I pursue from my interests?",
  "text": " \n\nI'm nearing the end of high school with only half a year left before college, and I hate going through this question again but I want to make sure I know what I want to do without any doubts.\n\nI wanted to become an automotive engineer and major in mechanical engineering but I'm straying further from that, so here are the motives behind what I would like to do.\n\n1. The spotlight of high school was my engineering pathway, I loved the entire engineering design process by going through brainstorms, heuristics, and the best part was building it all together with some intriguing technology. Unfortunately because of covid, I wasn't able to fully use everything the course had to offer, I was supposed to create a tool rack (it was a challenge to have the product hang up on a wall) and use a CNC, Laser engraver, and basic power tools but I never got to it. The only thing I got to really use was a 3D printer and *basic* electrical wirings like motors and batteries, I thought both were cool but I was still eager to try out the more hands-on approaches. Although my favorite part of engineering was the building part, it was really getting to work together with my friends, we shared some amazing ideas, and putting all our effort into a project like making a cardboard chair to win the nationals *true story B)* was really satisfying to me and I was pretty sad to see that go. So a career that follows aspects of design while still playing a part in getting to build my idea to reality, and getting to work with others in a group is something I would love to have as well. Aside from being a freelancer who just designs a product for a company, builds it, and sells it, which I don't even think is a job, to begin with. I have no clue as to what fields really work like this, and maybe you know what I'm trying to say here.\n\n2) I want a career with good benefits and/or pay. Should speak for itself but I don't want all my hard work in 12 years of school and possibly 4 in college to go to waste. Especially when I try my best to keep the 4.21 (weighted) gpa I have... (I have a 3.96 uw all because of that stupid act prep course, curse you lazy teacher). I think what im trying to say is being the top 35 students is not easy to hold up and I dont want all that effort to go to waste. So a job that pays well is really important to me but likely the most important one....\n\n3) A career that is fun, or at least I don't have to think of it as a job. Yes, this is very difficult and depends on preference but during my time taking that engineering pathway I forgot I was even in school, I was so happy and focused that I knew I could do this for decades and not get bored. Hopefully, something with a lot of room for improvement or change my style once in a while, anything that isn't going to dull out for me but I understand if this is unlikely.\n\n4) I probably should've given more looks into things other than engineering but to be honest nothing else I've experienced so far gave me the feeling of being able to turn my enjoyment into a career. This is why automotive engineering stepped into my mind since 1. it has the design for new features 2. plenty of room for improvement 3. a very good industry to get into 4. something I wouldn't mind doing but I think there are better choices.\n\ntl;dr I rly like engineering, I want something fun (has room for change so I'm not doing the same thing over and over again), has good pay or benefits, and follows the engineering design process (especially brainstorming, prototyping, and actually building the product with a group preferably)\n\nalso, I might be getting career and major mixed up a lot, if possible id really appreciate it if you could use both major and career so I know what to pursue first and think of later, anything general works for your advice thank you all!",
