My whole two years of community I have went back and forth between social work and education. If I go into social work I want to be a school social worker. Teaching is my passion but I\u2019m am worried that it would be harder for me to find a job considering I have a speech impediment (rhotacism). I\u2019m considering getting my masters in social work and associate in teaching assistant but I still have no idea. Any advice on how to make a decision? Advice from anyone who was in the same boat?", "author": "alyssalujan420", "created": 1620204092, "retrieved": 1632846572, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gx2d1ot": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/n5b7r5/choosing_between_social_work_or_education/gx2d1ot/", "text": "Hey there, I also want to be a school social worker! I'm currently in a BSW program, but intend to go onto grad school for my MSW. In my state becoming a school social worker requires an MSW + a school certification. I think I've pinned down that working in a school in any capacity is where I want to be, so my role may not necessarily matter. I chose school social work over teaching because I wanted something that would provide flexibility. If one day I decided I no longer wanted to be a school social worker I would be equipped to do any type of social work or transition into teaching at the college level. For me, it was important to have something that I could transfer elsewhere. Teaching degrees do seem to anchor you into just teaching and administration - but I may be wrong. There's also a less of a need for a masters degree - at least in my state. I think it depends on how much schooling you would want to do (more schooling required to be a social worker) and if you would maybe get burnt out and want flexibility in choosing a different career.", "author": "actuallykhadgar", "created": 1620244114, "upvotes": 1}}}
