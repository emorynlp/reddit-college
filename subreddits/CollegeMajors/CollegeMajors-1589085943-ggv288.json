Would love Input and Advise!\nI\u2019m also thinking about a minor as well. \nIf I were to choose SCM I want to minor in either economics or finance. Which one would pair better?\nHowever if I were to major in Economics I\u2019m unsure what minor would pair well. \nPlease give input and advise on anything. Much appreciated!", "author": "cdfgtfhg", "created": 1589085943, "retrieved": 1632847731, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fqzvhot": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ggv288/business_major/fqzvhot/", "text": "Don't listen to the guy below. SCM is a quantitative business degree that lets you work on the supply chain and logistics for a company, which pretty much every company relies on. Econ is also a good choice, but its career path is far more open (this can be a pro or con). Most Econ majors I know went into consulting, data science, banking, or programming. If you are kind of unsure of what you want to do in the future Econ could be good because there is a wider range of things you can focus on.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1589776397, "upvotes": 1}, "fqpapil": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ggv288/business_major/fqpapil/", "text": "I dont know a whole lot about supply chain management, however I know management degrees are VERY oversaturated. Econ is definately a safer choice with many more options to branch out. But at the end of the day, whatever makes you happy.\nAnd also, you dont need a Minor they're optional. My advisor even told me that most employers wont even give a second glance at any Minors, they only care about your degree. However finance or actuarial science would pair well.", "author": "Insomnimanic1", "created": 1589540920, "upvotes": 1}}}
