I\u2019m an economics major in my senior year right now. There is a lot you can do with economics, especially because many schools place a heavy emphasis on data analysis associated with economics. For me, it is functioning in much the same way as a business analytics degree. Because of this, there are my positions available with just a bachelors. If you wanted to specifically become an economist, most positions would require a masters. If you\u2019re genuinely interested in economics, you should give it a shot! Especially because during recessions, demand for people with a degree in econ actually goes up so firms can make better decisions and plans in the face of financial turmoil.
