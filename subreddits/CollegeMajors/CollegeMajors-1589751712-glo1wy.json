The degrees I have took a major interest are public health, epidemiology, food science, dietetics and international relations. My favourite subject has always been geography in particular I have a big interest in health geography and geopolitics. I also have a passion for volunteering. \n\nI think I\u2019m scared to commit to one degree as I\u2019m scared that I will fail at life and become unemployed as the degrees I wish to study are quite niche. Can someone give me some advice on what degree I should pick and how I should make my decision?", "author": "idk_ugh", "created": 1589751712, "retrieved": 1632957938, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fqz3jxd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/glo1wy/what_major_should_i_pick/fqz3jxd/", "text": "I am in a similar situation at the moment. All I can Ofer is an unbiased opinion on the job outlooks and personal opinions and facts based on what I think would benefit you at the most general level.\n\nFirst and foremost, I suggest you make a pros and cons list of each major that interests you. Put a lot of time and effort into researching each subject and be honest. \nSTEM majors are the hardest to pursue because of the workload and toll it can take on mental health. To delve further into that, people with mental disorders have a very hard time being successful in those fields because they are in a punishing mindset that hinders their performance. \nThe career you ultimately choose will have to be something you can handle and confidently work in no matter what happens. \nIf you think that pursuing a career that requires all of your focus and time is something you can handle, then look into what each subject requires from you. Employers and colleges alike look for passion and dedication when considering anyone. They look for people that can handle those careers even at there lowest point. Coming to a decision on what to choose stems from what you can handle and planting boundaries for yourself. \nThe most intelligent person in the world could have success in their career, but it could all backfire if they do not consider what they can mentally and emotionally handle. \n\nOn another note, of what you are passionate about, I personally think the subject you would benefit the very most from would be Biology. It is a very broad subject that has many concentrations within it, including public health, epidemiology, food science, and dietetics. \nThe reason for this comes from what you are describing as your passion. But keep in mind that this field requires some serious dedication and understanding of what you are learning (which is a lot.)\nMoving on to more specific fields, \n\nIf you plan in pursuing public health or epidemiology, I suggest pharmaceutical science or nursing. It directly related to epidemiology and makes some good money if you work your way up the field. \n\nFood science and dietetics have a few options. One that I know correlated with those is Agriculture. A field that is in high demand right now, it has a few main subcategories you can explore: Animal science, Plant Science, Agribusiness, and Farming. Although farming doesn\u2019t sound like the greatest career due to the physical workload, the unions and companies have some good benefits if pursued. It also can correlate with volunteering, it gives you an opportunity to join the Future Farmers of America, one of the biggest and most important organizations for students and volunteers alike. I took an Agriscience class in high school and got the opportunity to become a Bourlag Scholar after writing an essay and presenting to professionals. It was a great experience.\n\nAs for international relations and geopolitics, you must have very clear opinions, confidence, and have great written and verbal communication. It is a pretty taxing field; it\u2019s competitive, holds many biased opinions and sides, it takes a strong, healthy mind to be successful in and takes a lot of research and commitment. It turns you into someone that people have to rely on for very important decisions, some that may even be life threatening. It is a very unforgiving field but holds a lot of power and receives good income. It also requires time and experience to work up in the field depending on what career you want to apply yourself to.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this is a small fraction of your life that you have lived, many opportunities will come and go, just remember that you are the most important person to understand and care for. Make the choice that you think would make you the happiest and that you think will ultimately make you successful in your own eyes. \n\nGood luck, stay safe, and stay true to yourself.", "author": "holciamp", "created": 1589759274, "upvotes": 2}, "fqyqvm2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/glo1wy/what_major_should_i_pick/fqyqvm2/", "text": "I was in your shoes a couple of months ago. I can\u2019t tell you what to choose but I can tell you what I did to narrow down my options. I wanted to major in Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. These were my options. I applied to the universities that I could apply to with the IB subjects I have. I applied to all four majors, and then while waiting for the answers I made a list with pros and cons of each major and how good am I in each subject. As the acceptance and declines from uni came, it became clear what I can enrol in. Computer Science was off the table but the rest where not. I am still waiting for replies for Physics and Maths but I got for Chemistry. I followed the pros and cons list and selected the uni I have chemistry in as my major.\n\nAs for the finding a job and employment, if you are really good in your major you will find something. Do not stress about it, that is the advice I got from my parents and teachers. So with whatever major you choose just know that to get a job you need to prove yourself and be on top of your studies so a company can sign a contract with you when you intern with them.", "author": "mar7_photographer", "created": 1589753051, "upvotes": 2}}}
