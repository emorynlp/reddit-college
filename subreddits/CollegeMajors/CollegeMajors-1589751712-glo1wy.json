  "text": "I have so many subjects I want to major in as I feel passionate about a lot of issues but I don\u2019t know which one to pick. The degrees I have took a major interest are public health, epidemiology, food science, dietetics and international relations. My favourite subject has always been geography in particular I have a big interest in health geography and geopolitics. I also have a passion for volunteering. \n\nI think I\u2019m scared to commit to one degree as I\u2019m scared that I will fail at life and become unemployed as the degrees I wish to study are quite niche. Can someone give me some advice on what degree I should pick and how I should make my decision?",

      "text": "I am in a similar situation at the moment. All I can Ofer is an unbiased opinion on the job outlooks and personal opinions and facts based on what I think would benefit you at the most general level.\n\nFirst and foremost, I suggest you make a pros and cons list of each major that interests you. Put a lot of time and effort into researching each subject and be honest. \nSTEM majors are the hardest to pursue because of the workload and toll it can take on mental health. To delve further into that, people with mental disorders have a very hard time being successful in those fields because they are in a punishing mindset that hinders their performance. \nThe career you ultimately choose will have to be something you can handle and confidently work in no matter what happens. \nIf you think that pursuing a career that requires all of your focus and time is something you can handle, then look into what each subject requires from you. Employers and colleges alike look for passion and dedication when considering anyone. They look for people that can handle those careers even at there lowest point. Coming to a decision on what to choose stems from what you can handle and planting boundaries for yourself. \nThe most intelligent person in the world could have success in their career, but it could all backfire if they do not consider what they can mentally and emotionally handle. \n\nOn another note, of what you are passionate about, I personally think the subject you would benefit the very most from would be Biology. It is a very broad subject that has many concentrations within it, including public health, epidemiology, food science, and dietetics. \nThe reason for this comes from what you are describing as your passion. But keep in mind that this field requires some serious dedication and understanding of what you are learning (which is a lot.)\nMoving on to more specific fields, \n\nIf you plan in pursuing public health or epidemiology, I suggest pharmaceutical science or nursing. It directly related to epidemiology and makes some good money if you work your way up the field. \n\nFood science and dietetics have a few options. One that I know correlated with those is Agriculture. A field that is in high demand right now, it has a few main subcategories you can explore: Animal science, Plant Science, Agribusiness, and Farming. Although farming doesn\u2019t sound like the greatest career due to the physical workload, the unions and companies have some good benefits if pursued. It also can correlate with volunteering, it gives you an opportunity to join the Future Farmers of America, one of the biggest and most important organizations for students and volunteers alike. I took an Agriscience class in high school and got the opportunity to become a Bourlag Scholar after writing an essay and presenting to professionals. It was a great experience.\n\nAs for international relations and geopolitics, you must have very clear opinions, confidence, and have great written and verbal communication. It is a pretty taxing field; it\u2019s competitive, holds many biased opinions and sides, it takes a strong, healthy mind to be successful in and takes a lot of research and commitment. It turns you into someone that people have to rely on for very important decisions, some that may even be life threatening. It is a very unforgiving field but holds a lot of power and receives good income. It also requires time and experience to work up in the field depending on what career you want to apply yourself to.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this is a small fraction of your life that you have lived, many opportunities will come and go, just remember that you are the most important person to understand and care for. Make the choice that you think would make you the happiest and that you think will ultimately make you successful in your own eyes. \n\nGood luck, stay safe, and stay true to yourself.",

          "text": "Thanks so much for your unbiased advice. I defiantly will be using my time efficiently to research all the degrees I\u2019m passionate about so I can narrow down my choices. \n\nI\u2019ve always been curious in STEM subjects but I\u2019ve always been passionate about social science subjects like geography. So I really wanted to do something which combines my love for geography and STEM. This led me to epidemiology as I would be able to aid those who are suffering from diseases of poverty. \n\nI took biology as one of my IB subjects and I did enjoy the subject but I didn\u2019t do as well in comparison to my other subjects so I don\u2019t think I would be able to purse it as a whole degree. I did find the molecular biology and genetics units the most interesting. I won\u2019t be suitable for pharmaceutical sciences either as I never really liked chemistry. I was thinking of taking a bachelors degree in public health which would allow me to take a masters in epidemiology, dietetics, food sciences or public health. I would have to take a masters in these subjects as a bachelors in these degrees are pointless. It sucks how bachelor degrees don\u2019t have much value anymore\u2026 \n\nI was actually thinking about agricultural sciences as a potential degree as well since the country I\u2019m from (Australia) has a massive agricultural sector. Personally, I think I\u2019d be more interested into the research side of agriculture. As I\u2019m interested in how to minimise the greenhouse gas production in farming systems and cold chains. I\u2019d be interested in alleviating world issues such as food insecurity. \n\nI was really interested in becoming a diplomat by studying international relations as I am fluent in both Japanese and English. I\u2019m really passionate about world issues such as health care, food insecurity and malnutrition and would like to make a difference. \n\nOnce again thank you very much for your detailed advice I appreciate it so much! My overall aim for life is to work on the sustainable development goals and aid others.",

      "text": "I was in your shoes a couple of months ago. I can\u2019t tell you what to choose but I can tell you what I did to narrow down my options. I wanted to major in Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. These were my options. I applied to the universities that I could apply to with the IB subjects I have. I applied to all four majors, and then while waiting for the answers I made a list with pros and cons of each major and how good am I in each subject. As the acceptance and declines from uni came, it became clear what I can enrol in. Computer Science was off the table but the rest where not. I am still waiting for replies for Physics and Maths but I got for Chemistry. I followed the pros and cons list and selected the uni I have chemistry in as my major.\n\nAs for the finding a job and employment, if you are really good in your major you will find something. Do not stress about it, that is the advice I got from my parents and teachers. So with whatever major you choose just know that to get a job you need to prove yourself and be on top of your studies so a company can sign a contract with you when you intern with them.",

Thank you so much for the constructive advice. \n\nI was thinking of taking a bachelors in public health as that would allow me to purse a masters in epidemiology, dietetics or public health. So I might apply to university for public health, food sciences and international relations. I\u2019ll definitely try to make a pros and cons list as well.\n\nI'm naturally such an over thinker so I keep on stressing out about employment. I think I just need to figure out clear goals. \n\nI took HL Geography, HL Psychology, HL English, SL Biology, SL Maths, SL French Ab as my iB subjects. Are there any degrees you\u2019d think would be suitable for a person who took these subjects?",

              "text": "I have a friend that has similar subjects to you and didn\u2019t have a clear goal in mind. She told me that she is going to do something with international relationships and then specialise in sustainability (I am not sure about the international relationship one since it has been a while). Since you have HL Psychology you might want to look at that or something that has to do with social interactions. But the thing is that you should choose a major you like and feel passionate about. From the plan you said you have above, it sounds that you have a goal in mind for next 4 years which is quite good, don\u2019t overthink your masters one tho, you might end up liking a different major while doing your bachelors. So choose a major for your bachelors that can open a lot of options for you in your masters while also being a major you are passionate about.",

Both international relations and public health would defiantly allow me to something involving social interactions. A degree which has both blends well with STEM and the social science would be the best. I definitely need to be more open minded whilst doing my bachelors as I don\u2019t want to miss out on other potential opportunities. \n\nGood luck on your choices as well!",
