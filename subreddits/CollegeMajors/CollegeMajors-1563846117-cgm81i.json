My plan is to major in Electrical Engineering but sometimes anxiety kicks in due to having a fianc\u00e9 and 2 toddlers. I sometimes also feel like I should major in something that won't take as long to complete and hopefully pays well to support my family. My interests are tinkering with things (reverse engineering), coding, taking pictures, working with numbers. \n\nAny advice would be helpful.

It has good job security, pays well, and seems to align with your interests. In the long run, a degree in electrical engineering will probably be a more lucrative and interesting career than something you might get from an associate's degree.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1563882651, "upvotes": 2}}}
