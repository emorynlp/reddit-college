However, ever since I did complete garbage in chemistry, my thoughts have changed. Every single year, freshman to junior, the classes I do worst in are math and science, which I think say a lot for what I should do in the future. Moreover, the only classes I'd say I'm decent in are history classes but I'm not that interested in things such as law or teaching. Regarding personal interests, there's nothing in particular; I just play video games and listen to music and I don't think I'm too into these things either so at this point I'm just lost and need help for deciding what to do. Thanks for reading and please reply :))", "author": "scarytears", "created": 1575334996, "retrieved": 1632958150, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f9j3xuh": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/e58xy1/advice_for_choosing_majors_needed/f9j3xuh/", "text": "You have time to figure it out don't stress too much", "author": null, "created": 1575355135, "upvotes": 1}}}
