I think it's still way too early for my to come to any definitive conclusions, but I'm becoming less of a fan of coding. I've always considered majoring in Data Science and I'm now seriously considering switching. My school's requirements seem to show it's less math (Calculus) and programming heavy, which I think I like.\nMy concerns with majoring in Data science are because it's still fairly new and uncommon as a undergraduate degree. What will I be able to do with a degree in Data science without a master's? My initial reason for choosing CS was because it's more broad and would probably look fine on a resume in a data science field. \n\nI'm still completely uncertain on what to do, but I'm trending away from programming and more towards data science or cyber security and information systems.", "author": "DanHassler0", "created": 1606972770, "retrieved": 1632847108, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gev3x1k": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k5r31o/data_science_computer_science_or_something_else/gev3x1k/", "text": "Do not major in Data science. especially if it has LESS math than comp sci. Most Data science involves using Statistics to draw Statistical inferences so that businesses can make good decisions. Stick with comp sci and take some stats classes, or just drop out. Data science as a degree is a fad. A degree in Statistics or comp sci maybe even math or physics would serve you much better. Usually most real data science jobs require at least a masters. You could find yourself in a much lower paying job if you get a degree like that, and may not even have the skills necessary to do the work. \n\nI would stick with comp sci or switch to math and maybe take a cryptography class or something. Information systems at least at my school is pretty programming heavy so you need to know how to code for most of the jobs that you're asking about. You're better off staying where your at.", "author": null, "created": 1607283197, "upvotes": 3}}}
