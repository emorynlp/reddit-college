Less competition on the uni I'm aiming for\n2. People say that altough economics are still hard, it's objectively less rigorous academically when compared with engineering, so I have a higher chance of securing a scholarship\n3. My hs focuses on science, so I never had any actual chance of learning economics as a subject\n\nMech eng:\n\n1. I like physics\n2. I don't really know but mech eng seems to have better job prospects for fresh undergrad\n3. I suck at chemistry\n4. I don't have any hands on experience in machinery and stuffs like that", "author": "i-came-here-to-fap", "created": 1597932111, "retrieved": 1632956963, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g2a8mun": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/idatwo/should_i_choose_mech_eng_or_economics/g2a8mun/", "text": "There are tons of people who major in something they haven't had previous experience in so don't worry about that.
