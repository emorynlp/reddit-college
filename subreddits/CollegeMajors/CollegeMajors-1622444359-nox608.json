The classes and labs are so intense I won't be able to do 12 units at a time if I am working Friday Saturday and sundays. I definitely won't be able to handle 12 units when I'm taking calculus 2 and 3 if I want to get really good grades because I really want to get into a PhD program. I was/still am part of 2 honors societies for high gpa's, alpha gamma sigma and phi theta kappa. \n\nPlus I had to take a few remedial math classes starting with pre-algebra. Although I like math now because I had an awesome professor for trigonometry which made everything click, I have already done more than 2 years of math now with still pre-calculus to go. 2 more years of math to calc 3. And I might possibly take 1 \"recommended\" upper division math class if I'm feeling down to it at that point. \n\nI'm an overachiever and this biochemistry degree is something I really want. I'm 34 and not getting any younger. I have taken a lot of general education back 15 years ago (the basic psychology 101, English 101, sociology, communications, public speaking, et al) but you know life happens so I've had to take a few forks in the road and spend a while not in school. But still even with all the units I have already it will still take at least 6 years to finish the degree. \n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to ask if it's normal for a biochemistry degree program to take more than the standard 4-5 years nowadays.", "author": "AnotherSpotOfTea", "created": 1622444359, "retrieved": 1632956754, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h0339dx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nox608/is_it_normal_for_the_biochemistry_bachelors/h0339dx/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1622471630, "upvotes": 1}}}
