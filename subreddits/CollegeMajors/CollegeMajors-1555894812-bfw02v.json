This is after a couple years of issues and a lot of hard work where I dropped out and transferred.\n\n\nI would like to try to challenge myself a little harder because for the longest time, I wasn't capable of doing anything. I feel like I have been undervaluing myself. \n\nWith this metropolitan studies major, I've had this gnawing feeling. I've worked hard to get to the point where I am, and I deserve to have a major where I have better job prospects. \n\nI feel uneasy having a major that is not focused enough on something I can specialize in. Most of my gen-eds are filled and I'm not sure what else I can do. \n\nDo any of you feel the same way? What do you think I should do?", "author": "t5_bluBLrv", "created": 1555894812, "retrieved": 1632848209, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"elh7act": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bfw02v/my_major_is_too_broad_and_i_think_i_could_do/elh7act/", "text": "Well to be frank, undergraduate degrees of any sort are incredibly broad. Some can be more broad than others, but the undergraduate level isn\u2019t supposed to be super focused on anything other than a general area. It\u2019s the graduate degrees that fine tune this and trim it down to focusing on something specific.\n\nThat being said, what career plans do you have? If your current major naturally leads to what you want to do, I don\u2019t see any reason to change it, especially if you enjoy it.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1555911173, "upvotes": 2}}}
