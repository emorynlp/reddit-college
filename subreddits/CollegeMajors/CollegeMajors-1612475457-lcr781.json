I'll be the first in my family to receive any college degree so I'm super excited!\n\nBut, I'm undecided about my career and major path. To be honest, I didn't think I would make it this far; I always assumed the world would end before I got into college. \n\nAnyway, I love learning and would love to pursue my bachelors and further on. I love writing and photography and building houses in the sims and astronomy. I've taken a photography and writing class and did very well. But I've also been teasing the idea of becoming a doctor in mind for quite some time now, but I think I'm too old to start.\n\nAnyway, I just want advice how to over come this hurdle and if anyone else felt the same as I do. \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated \ud83d\udc95\nMuch love, \nElizabeth", "author": "rad_duck", "created": 1612475457, "retrieved": 1632847022, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gm1unj8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lcr781/idk_what_to_do/gm1unj8/", "text": "You are not in any means too old to become a doctor.
