              "text": "Tbh, if you were only doing Econ vs Finance (and no CS at all), I would go with Finance as it's more immediately marketable.\n\nBut when paired with more Math/CS, Econ will give you a wider set of opportunities than finance. Econ is a nice compromise between Business and Finance in that you get to understand the flow of money in a bigger picture, but you're not so bogged down with all the nitty gritty highly specialized equations that you encounter in the Finance major. But having the CS major on top of your Econ major allows you to have a stamp on your forehead saying that you know Economic theory, but you also have the math skills/programming chops to complement it.\n\nBut tbf, there is a lot of overlap between the Econ and Finance majors. Students from these departments regularly take classes from each other's departments.",
