I also have an interest in philosophy, the all of the greats like nietzche, Plato, and Aristotle, so I find it to be a good minor as it tracks with history nicely and shows human thought trends over time. \n\nMy end game is to get a PHD, or my JD, but my mom out of nowhere really started attacking me, saying I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job, that I didn\u2019t have a plan, and that I should major in psychology. I really don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t mind psychology but I really don\u2019t to major  in psychology as I don\u2019t have an insane amount of passion for it beyond the parts that interlock with philosophy along the lines of jung and Freud, as they walked the line between psychology and philosophy.\n\nI didn\u2019t cave or anything, but now I\u2019m really anxious and upset, I don\u2019t really know what to do. Is it viable to major in history for my ba before going off for my higher degrees? \n\nI figured I could work as an assistant in archiving, curating, research, any of those fields for a post college job. Before I get my masters, and then get my masters and shoot for higher and higher positions. Then once I have my PhD I can do a million different things related to history on higher levels. But now I\u2019m really nervous and doubting myself.

There are many underemployed JDs, even people who attended very prestigious law schools, and the majority of lawyers say they don't like being a lawyer and wouldn't recommend it as a career path. \n\nIt is true that the academic job market is unimaginably horrendous, and even non-academic archiving etc. jobs are competitive. It may not be viable to do that as a post-college job since you will be competing with people who have graduate degrees. However, there is a big difference between getting an undergrad degree in history and getting a PhD! Should you get a PhD in history? Probably not, but also it's not really necessary to debate that right now because you are still in high school. Who knows if you will even still want to apply to PhDs by the time you're eligible to do so? \n\nHistory degrees are very writing-intensive, so careers such as grant writing or proposal writing are things you might consider pursuing with a BA in history.", "author": "ultimate_ampersand", "created": 1606649552, "upvotes": 1}, "g79ae9g": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j2vveg/is_history_a_viable_major_with_a_philosophy_minor/g79ae9g/", "text": "In the timeline of the usefulness of college degrees, where on one end all degrees were useful, and on the other all degrees where useless, we\u2019re currently at the point on the line where most degrees are useful and some are good.\n\nChoose a major you like and double major in a marketable one.

Even then it wouldn't be ideal as you would be qualified to do nothing special should you fail to get accepted into law school. Psychology also would be a fairly poor option in comparison to other majors given its extreme oversaturation and next to non-existent career outlook with just a bachelors. If you got these degrees it would essentially just be to say, \"I have a degree\" and check off that checkbox from HR departments that seek college educated applicants for their office positions.\n\nMy best advice would be to look at a more financially stable alternative major and to get a minor in history instead.

History with a minor in philosophy is 100% reasonable, both requirements are similar to each other so you won't be likely to struggle. But I'd highly suggest you look into high school teaching or law than the PhD. Both will allow you to pursue your passion of history in different ways, and will be a lot more employable and less competitive.", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1601522514, "upvotes": 3}}}
