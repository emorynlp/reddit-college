I\u2019m also currently taking a criminal justice course rn ;-)).",

Look into exactly what you care about within those specific fields you're interested in. What are you hoping to do once you're out of school? Lawyer? Corrections? Victim services? \nIf you're okay with moving, look into programs that are offered where others aren't. If not, make an appointment with an academic advisor at the closest school - it's their job to help you figure this stuff out. Good luck :)",

That at least what Uber heard and many people say easier degrees like English are the best since they help you a lot and it\u2019s easier to get a good gpa. But overall you should realize that being a lawyer isn\u2019t as good as it use to be. Unless if your really smart and go to a top school then your just putting yourself into a ton of debt for a 80,000,100,000 salary.",
