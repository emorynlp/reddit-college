Maths is super theoretical since it teaches you to prove a lot of fundamental theorems. It will help you become a master in problem solving. Physics is very theoretical as well. Most of the courses are maths courses or theoretical physics courses, in which you need to apply the maths you learned. It is mostly maths but applied to very theoretical and fundamental problems. Think about quantum mechanics; it is full of maths and very very abstract. You will have a few lab courses as well as maybe some programming courses. In the programming courses you will learn to write good code to help you analyse physics problems or help you solve the maths. In conclusion: physics is super theoretical in itself but you can make it more practical by putting in some lab courses or coding courses.\n\nAll the other STEM majors are derivatives (pun intended) of maths and physics. Chemistry is physics applied to the elements. Electical Engineering is physics applied to real world problems involving electricity.", "author": "InterestingKiwi5004", "created": 1597140875, "upvotes": 3}}}
