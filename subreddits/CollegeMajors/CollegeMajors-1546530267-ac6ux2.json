  "title:": "Would a Physics Minor Be a Good Choice for an Engineering Major?",
  "text": "I am torn between engineering and physics. I\u2019ve always dreamed of going to the highest levels in the latter (PhD). However, I am still attracted by the high salaries of engineering. The point is, I want to have high-paying employment out of college (I have a parent and siblings to support) while still being on track to pursue a physics degree at an elite grad school. Next year, I will be attending the University of Notre Dame as an undergraduate; engineering physics isn\u2019t offered, but mechanical, aerospace, electrical, and chemical are options. I am not particularly interested in the first two, leaving EE and CE. Would either be a good combination with a physics minor for both employment and graduate school?",

      "text": "Like u/CatOwlFilms said, Notre Dame doesn\u2019t offer a physics minor. \n\nAs for the physics Ph.D., I think it\u2019s an unreasonable goal if you plan on having a full-time engineering job as you\u2019re trying to do a physics Ph.D. program. There\u2019s a reason that physics students receive a full stipend during grad school, and that\u2019s because grad school is a full-time job. \n\nI recommend that you think hard about whether you\u2019re going to major in physics or engineering. \n\nAs for selecting an engineering degree, I think electrical engineering is your best bet. \n\nI will say that it\u2019s really hard to get into a Physics Ph.D. program as just an engineering major. Physics graduate programs look for you to have completed a certain set of courses in order to be admitted to the program (E&M, classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, etc.). Engineering is just different than physics, so I wouldn\u2019t count on getting into a physics program as an engineering major. It\u2019s possible, but not common. ",
