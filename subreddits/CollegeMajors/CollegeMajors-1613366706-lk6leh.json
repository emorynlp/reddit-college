My options are very different from each other as one is health sciences and one is finance. I love math and numbers and i feel like finance would be a good option then again i don't know how i feel about working a desk job in an office most of my career. My reasoning to going into health sciences is because i would love to help people directly with their health and become a PA or OT but the thing is i never really had a LOVE or passion for science. I've tried finding info on this dilemma but i have found nothing, so if anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated!\n\nThank you!!!", "author": "helluritsashhhh", "created": 1613366706, "retrieved": 1632957448, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gnjpz3y": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lk6leh/finance_or_health_sciences_major/gnjpz3y/", "text": "Go with Finance and take some science courses/prereqs for whatever health job you like. If you don\u2019t like the science, stick w finance. If you like the science, you\u2019ll be able to fill your prereqs and still have an employable major to fall back on", "author": "rad-jazz-21", "created": 1613406855, "upvotes": 2}}}
