      "text": "I think it's possible to become an engineer with a physics degree but if you know what kind of engineer you want to be it would be better to pick that as your major instead of physics. Also, this only really applies if you're in the US. I don't know what the expectations are in other countries.",

              "text": "Ok that makes sense, if you're still a freshman you can just take the engineering prerequisites (like the calc sequence, linear algebra, physics, etc) and do some googling to see what fields interest you then start that major your sophomore year. You could also ask your school's career center about how many of their physics graduates end up in engineering or what they typically do after graduation if you're still really unsure. Hope this helps and good luck finding a major.",

Understand math, the universe, and everything!\n\nI\u2019m pursuing an Engineering Physics BS but I also plan to get a computer science MS (for job prospects, if I\u2019m honest). Even without the MS though, physics majors are similar to math majors in that they can sort of act like technical generalists and adapt to many different quantitative fields like software engineering, finance, data science, engineering, etc. Now, that\u2019s not to say a physics major\u2019s knowledge is equivalent to an electrical engineer who specializes in chip design or a CS major who knows how to build Linux from scratch.  But you bet your ass that a physics major COULD learn those things if they needed to, which makes them very flexible.\n\nPersonally, I recommend CS as a non-physics job for physics majors because it\u2019s probably the most abstract and mathematical kind of engineering \u2014 you work with concepts and abstractions more than physical devices, for which physics equips you well.  I also know physics majors who have gone into aerospace, electrical, and mechanical engineering.  Having a master\u2019s in one of those things in addition to the physics BS helps though, so that you at least have some field-specific knowledge when you go to interview.\n\nCheck out APS for more: https://www.aps.org/careers/",
