  "text": "Hi, I currently have a bachelors on health services management and have a great opportunity to take a couple more years of education. I\u2019m not not keen on getting my masters in hsm so please don\u2019t tell me to, there\u2019s many reasons I don\u2019t want to explain. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of taking health information technology associates degree as it somewhat goes along with my existing major. My question is what do people even do with it other then coding/billing? I plan on taking the rhit exam. \n\nI also had the idea to take computer information systems and getting a certificate on top of that in cyber security. This plan to me sounds too vague and dense as these are very technical fields with a lot to learn.",

Also I don\u2019t even have an associates in information systems why would I be eying a masters in it? Sorry if I sound rude it\u2019s just I don\u2019t think you read the question,thanks for the reply anyway.",

              "text": "Oh, perhaps I don\u2019t know enough about your bachelors major. There are a lot of administrative positions in healthcare, if that\u2019s the field you\u2019re interested in. If you know how to use excel and are familiar with healthcare data protocols, it\u2019s a reasonable step forward to look at MHA. \n\nI suggested infosys because the skills can be applied in a healthcare role, or any industry really. I assumed your bachelors had some analytical/programming courses, so I thought it could be a reasonable jump to look at those types of professional programs.\n\nMaybe you should look at jobs you want and work backwards from there based on the education requirements?",
