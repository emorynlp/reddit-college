I\u2019m not not keen on getting my masters in hsm so please don\u2019t tell me to, there\u2019s many reasons I don\u2019t want to explain. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of taking health information technology associates degree as it somewhat goes along with my existing major. My question is what do people even do with it other then coding/billing? I plan on taking the rhit exam. \n\nI also had the idea to take computer information systems and getting a certificate on top of that in cyber security. This plan to me sounds too vague and dense as these are very technical fields with a lot to learn.", "author": "six9six9six9", "created": 1588350252, "retrieved": 1632847747, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fp6gni3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gbl7zr/health_information_technology/fp6gni3/", "text": "What about an MHA? Professional degrees like that are increasingly in demand. I don\u2019t think an associates degree will help you much if you already have a bachelors.
