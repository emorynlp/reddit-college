      "text": "If it were me, I would major in accounting. In my opinion accounting is the best business degree you can get. It opens up a lot of doors within the business field, allowing you a wide variety of career options to pursue after college.\n\nOn the other hand, business admin isn't a bad degree. However, it is not a great degree like accounting. A business administration degree would still be useful but it is a pretty general degree, meaning employers may not value it as high. \n\nWhatever degree you decide to pursue though, ensure you are networking and building a profile for yourself. A degree is just a piece of paper. However, If you are willing to network and build your profile, you are more likely than not to find a pretty good job right after college.",
