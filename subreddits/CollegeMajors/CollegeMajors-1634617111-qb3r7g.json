  "text": "I was hoping you guys could listen to the plan I have and give me some advice on where I might have made a mistake, hopefully this is allowed in this sub, if not I'll delete the post. \n\nI've just graduated HS, and right after I got my diploma in US my dad got diagnosed with cancer so past few months I've not been able to apply to any colleges, instead I worked online on a TEFL so that I can try to teach ESL for a few years, \n\nI'll make this as short as possible: I'm getting an TEFL certificate. Because of my dad's situation I can not attend college in US, but wanting to get my degree from there, I'm planning to go to an online college for a Philosophy BA, why philosophy you may ask? Let me elaborate, \n\nMy main passion is writing in humanities and also fiction. I want to eventually one day become a published author. So I thought philosophy BA would be the perfect major to get my mind ready for critical thinking, on the side I'll take online fiction writing classes (If I can afford the tuition, why not take two BAs?), meanwhile as I'm doing those things as my passion, I need to make some money as well, \n\nIn the country I'm currently in, making money through in person jobs would end up giving me a salary of like 20 dollars a month, max. This is due to the high conversion rate. So since I need money for my tuition, I have to find some work that is online and that would pay me in dollars. Looking at the skills I have, online ESL seems the best, thus why I'm working towards my teaching certificate. \n\nAll this said, I need advice from you dear redditors. \n\n1. Is this plan realistic? I mean working on one or two BA's completely online while teaching ESL online as well, timewise I mean\n2. Should I go for an english BA as well as philosophy, or should I just take philosophy and instead of going to a full college for english, I can take classes on fiction writing that are more specific on what I'm trying to achieve; in other words, is an english BA that much more useful than just normal online classes for someone who wants to write fiction? \n3. This has been a really stressful year for me and I really need to know if I've gone crazy with my plans or it will actually work. I love you all, and thank you for reading this far",
