I have certain things I want out of a career and was wondering if you might be able to think of a major or career I\u2019d enjoy (I might be too attached to see on a large view and I\u2019d love new perspectives)\n- I\u2019m really interested in government and poli sci (I remember when I was younger, saying I wanted to be in a history textbook and that still holds true haha)\n    - But the corruption in government gets me down\n-I want to help people on a  large scale basis\n- I want to either travel in my job OR make enough money to travel on my own\n- I would like a decent salary but if I can travel then my wage isn\u2019t as important\n- I enjoy intellectual discussion and debate over politics \n- Alternatively I\u2019ve found I really enjoy physics, drafting, and environmental science (in the sense I\u2019m really interested in sustainability)\nAny feed back would be greatly appreciated :)", "author": "sultryrosesummer", "created": 1572096657, "retrieved": 1632958155, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f5p7nbq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dndvyi/i_want_to_help_people/f5p7nbq/", "text": "There are ways to help people in nearly every field.
