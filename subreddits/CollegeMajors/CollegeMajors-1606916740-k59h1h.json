The majors/careers in the title are very contrasting, but I\u2019ll explain my pros and cons for my current options. I\u2019m currently a 20F university sophomore majoring in Marketing with a concentration in product brand management. If I stick with this, I\u2019ll minor in fashion merchandising and/or environmental science because I\u2019m very interested in sustainability and ethics. \nPros: I can be creative, I\u2019ll work on ethical marketing, I have internship/real experience already, and I love science + fashion\nCons: The gen eds for marketing are so boring & difficult to pass due to my lack of interest (accounting, business calculus), job security, and competition\n\nOn the other hand, I could do something more practical and secure. In high school, I originally wanted to be a dentist but I changed my major from biology to business the first week of college. (However, I can have any major and be pre-dent or pre-nursing). I volunteered at a hospital and I enjoyed discharging patients especially those from the mother-infant floor. I was enjoyed the idea of dentistry and the business aspect of having my own practice. I\u2019ve only recently considered nursing. I\u2019m relatively soft spoken and I like to help people. I\u2019ll most likely have a marketing minor.\nPros: job security, not as math intensive, work-life balance, starting salary is good\nCons: burnout, competition for nursing/dental school\n\nOverall, I want to be able to help people in some shape or form. I\u2019m a creative and academic person with a big heart. \n\nThank you for any advice!", "author": "thriftyriah", "created": 1606916740, "retrieved": 1632956952, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gef6vb7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k59h1h/marketingfashion_or_more_practical/gef6vb7/", "text": "Don\u2019t look for the easy way out.  College isn\u2019t supposed to be easy, it is supposed to challenge you and make you better.  That is why companies will pay higher salaries for college graduates, and higher still for more difficult degree programs.  You can do this!\n\nYour original track, marketing with a focus on brand management, coupled with a minor in fashion merchandising seems to fit well together and suggests a clear career path.  Someone looking to hire you will have a good idea of your interests and capabilities.  The minor in environmental science however doesn\u2019t makes sense.    First, it doesn\u2019t really fit with a marketing major.  More importantly, most of these programs are frankly not worth the tuition dollars paid for them, as they have the gloss of a science name but none of the STEM rigor that people desire hiring science degrees for.  \n\nRegarding working in \u201cethical marketing\u201d, I am a business professor, and I don\u2019t even know what \u201cethical marketing\u201d would mean.  You can conduct marketing in an ethical fashion, but you are either working to persuade people to buy your product, or you are trying to understand what would make your product more appealing to a large group of people with the money to buy it.  It is a necessary function, but not terribly altruistic.  \n\nRegarding your core business classes.  Stick with it, they really are useful.  Believe me, I am no fan of double entry book keeping, but being able to read financial statements generated by the accountants is essential.  If you want to be effective in business, you will need to know at least the basics of accounting, operations, human resources and finance.  You don\u2019t have to be experts in these areas, but you do have to know how to interact with the experts, and understand what they are telling you.  If you want to spend $5M on a national advertising campaign you better be able to justify some kind of return on that investment.  If you want to run a sale in November, you better know if you have the inventory or production capacity to deliver the product.\n\nIf you really are interested in nursing, talk with some practicing nurses (you must know some from the hospital.). Find out what their jobs are really like. The degree program will not be any easier than business.  There is quite a bit of science and psychological related material to cover.   If you are going to go that route, don\u2019t get a pre-nursing degree, you will just need to get another degree to be an actual nurse.  Nursing should only require a bachelors degree.  It is a tough job, and can take an emotional toll on you, but some do find it rewarding.\n\nDental school will require an advanced degree, and entry into the field is quite competitive.  Dental assistant or dental hygienist are other options with fewer education requirements.  Are you prepared to spend your days with your fingers in other people\u2019s mouths?  It pays well, but it is not for everyone.", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606947009, "upvotes": 3}, "gedwyi3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k59h1h/marketingfashion_or_more_practical/gedwyi3/", "text": "After the pandemic nurses will be needed more than ever, do nursing.", "author": "cereal_crusader", "created": 1606927661, "upvotes": 1}}}
