They offer programs for Animation and Film, but they offer it from a campus with a far distance from my home campus.\n\nBecause of this, I've decided to go into General Studies. Beforehand, I've thought about doing Health Information Technology. IT was a career choice of mine for many years, specifically in a school setting. I would also be a part of the medical field in some way. I have heard that it's a very stressful job but I'm willing to try it out.\n\nI've also been suggested to try out Nursing. My community college has mandated the vaccine but I will have to check if I'm able to take online classes for it instead of going on-campus.\n\nI'm not sure if having a health IT degree with be exclusive to medical based settings or anywhere.\n\n\n\nI also decided to go pre-med but I'm worried about not fulfilling the requirements to get into med school. I've heard that Biology majors usually fulfill them pretty quickly, but I'm not too interested in it.", "author": "throwaway1142018", "created": 1629388851, "retrieved": 1632846500, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h9unltg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/p7hp6a/general_studies_good_for_now/h9unltg/", "text": "Your school should have a career center department that could help you narrowing down options. This is the core of general studies. With general studies you will need to transfer to a 4 year college,so you need to know what will transfer. \n\nDon\u2019t do pre-med because if you don\u2019t get in med school you are pretty much stuck. \n\nGeneral studies, with some natural sciences courses can give you a taste of pre-med. For nursing yiu need to know if you can deal with blood and other body fluids. It\u2019s trial by fire.", "author": "9alby9", "created": 1629591729, "upvotes": 1}}}
