However, I\u2019m having trouble deciding on what major I should try to get into because I don\u2019t exactly understand the differences between some of them. \n\nWhat is the difference between a biology degree and a biological engineering degree? And what is the difference between a chemistry degree and a chemical engineering degree?\n\nI\u2019ve looked into these fairly extensively online but can\u2019t seem to find anything that answers all my questions. If someone could help by giving me an idea of the difference in curriculums between these majors and what jobs are available to people that hold degrees in them/what day to day work would be like in the fields they prepare you for, I would really appreciate it!", "author": "currently-curious", "created": 1593149849, "retrieved": 1632847666, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fw1ctwf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hg1v5s/biology_vs_biological_engineering_and_chemistry/fw1ctwf/", "text": "Any form of engineering will require going through all the math pre-reqs and a full year of calc-based physics. \n\nBiology/Chem will focus on more theoretical topics and coursework will be heavily based on rote memorization, whereas the engineering variants will focus on more applied and practical concepts. \n\nThe engineering route will be almost unequivocally more difficult than the other options but the monetary and financial reward will be much higher if you attend an ABET accredited college that will allow you to take the FE (fundamentals of engineering exam) after you graduate. After you have passed your B.E. and successfully taken the FE and have acquired 5 years of work experience you can then apply for the PE (professional engineering exam). Where you will become a state certified engineer upon completion. \n\nThe engineering route is much more in demand, you will have a very difficult time working in the biology or chem field with just a Bsc in Bio/Chem. Your best hope will probably be working as a lab tech with this option.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1593152586, "upvotes": 6}}}
