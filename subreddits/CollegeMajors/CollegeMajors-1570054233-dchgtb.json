I am a college freshman, who currently is a data science major. I'm planning to add a second major in either history or political science. I'd like to become a policy analyst at a think tank, but that is potentially subject to change. I'm open to the potential of campaign work or law rn. I love both fields. I'd probably say that history is preferable, but my favorite topic is easily political history so...\n\n\nWhich major do people recommend? Is one seen as a better fit? Does one have a better reputation than the other?", "author": "Cicinattus85", "created": 1570054233, "retrieved": 1632956393, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f28q19o": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dchgtb/should_i_add_a_major_in_history_or_political/f28q19o/", "text": "I double majored in history and political science, so AMA.\n\nI would suggest history because the research, writing, and critical thinking skills you will develop can help you in any career path. I cannot say the same about political science; perhaps it was the classes/professors I had, but there was very little challenging work and I didn't learn much that I didn\u2019t already know about politics.\n\nEveryone in hiring positions probably knows this, too. Unless your school has something more specific than political science, such has public policy, go with history.\n\nEdit: and for what it\u2019s worth, since you said you\u2019d possibly be interested in law, history majors regularly score better than political science majors on the LSAT.", "author": "slouchingbethlehem", "created": 1570067873, "upvotes": 2}}}
