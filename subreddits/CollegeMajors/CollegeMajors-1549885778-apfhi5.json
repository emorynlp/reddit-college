Advice?", "text": "Background: got into top-twenty university in my country (US) as a declared computer science and engineering major. Ended first year with a 2.9 GPA and major depression, largely due to family issues (parents constantly on edge of divorce, also strict Asian types). Decided over the summer to switch towards a tentative mechanical engineering curriculum when I returned for second year (still haven\u2019t officially swapped). Came back under an academic monitoring progress contract with the engineering school, (contract necessitated by my having late-dropped a computer science class I was floundering in during spring quarter, although my GPA is fine by school standards), and got a term GPA of 3.5 and cumulative of 3.2 by the end of fall quarter. However, I was taking three classes that quarter - one humanities and one a retake of a math class, so both were easy - and only got a B in my first mechanical engineering course. This term I\u2019m taking four STEM courses, and they\u2019re kicking my ass. I feel anxious, stressed, underwater, and disorganized, and highly suspect I won\u2019t end the term with a B average between the four - worse, it\u2019s tricky for me to drop a class now that it\u2019s past standard drop deadline, and since I already dropped a computer science course last spring, that would make any further drops now suspect, especially if I want to transfer engineering majors. I\u2019m also worried about losing financial aid since I\u2019m completely on aid since my parents kicked me out at the end of the summer, partly because I informed them of my depression - they don\u2019t believe in mental illness in general - and partly because they dislike my life choices (no, I don\u2019t do drugs or drink and have never had sex, but I\u2019m gay and my dad wants me to be with a man - oh well). With my parents\u2019 approval of my major choice now out of the equation, I\u2019ve done a lot of soul-searching and realized I would never have chosen engineering if it were my choice. I\u2019ve always loved to write and tell stories, and I also like the idea of teaching and working with kids. Ideally, I\u2019d love to have some kind of writing job (be it writing memos in an office job, copy-editing, working in journalism, or teaching English - I\u2019m not picky), some kind of work in a teaching field, or, failing that, some other quiet, stable, uninteresting position that pays the bills and leaves me time to be with people I love and work on my drawings and manuscripts in the evenings. What should I do at this point?\n\nPros of remaining in engineering -\n\n+ The payroll.\n\n+ Career flexibility (I\u2019ve read that I could teach with no problem with a technical degree and some education degree).\n\n+ Everyone around me won\u2019t nag me to stay in engineering because the potential payroll engineers get is too fat to squander.\n\n+ The payroll.\n\n+ The fact that I won\u2019t have wasted a) the difficult trick of getting admitted to engineering in the first place and b) my ability to handle analytical and calculational abstraction, my dislike for actually engaging in this activity notwithstanding.\n\n+ The fact that I can be hired for an engineering job while also having good verbal and communication skills, something that\u2019s highly valued among technical employers according to a successful, veteran engineer friend of mine.\n\n+ The freaking huge payroll.\n\nCons -\n\n+ I\u2019ll hate my classes and myself for the remainder of my time in college at the very least (considering I have hardly any room in my curriculum at this point for humanities classes at all). I might also hate my work when I\u2019m graduated, though career flexibility makes that less of an issue.\n\n+ I\u2019ll be less-qualified for jobs requiring in-depth education in a non-engineering capacity (e.g. the publication industry usually wants to see English as the primary focus in college).\n\n+ I will probably graduate with a lackluster GPA and resum\u00e9, since I\u2019m not all that good at engineering (certainly relative to peers and examples in industry). This will probably reduce the advantage I have as an engineering major - a solid undergraduate resum\u00e9 with good internship work listed (which can only be snagged by folks with good GPAs) is pretty necessary, I\u2019m told, to get a good job in the industry once finished with school.\n\nPros of switching out (perhaps even to something that isn\u2019t strictly a humanities major, but only not in engineering - I can\u2019t swap to, say, pre-medicine for several reasons, but I\u2019m not against transferring into a business-related degree, for example) -\n\n+ I\u2019ll hate myself less.\n\n+ I\u2019ll hate my classes less.\n\n+ As a result, my GPA will probably (hopefully) go up.\n\n+ I will still be graduating with a respectable degree from a very respectable and employable university, and if I do so with a good GPA, I might be more appealing to employers than if I\u2019d graduated with a bad GPA in engineering (though I don\u2019t know how true this is, so absolutely feel free to correct me!).\n\n+ I\u2019ll be investing in skills that I could actually see using in a job I like, in ways that I like, without causing myself to hate myself further and to want to die (I joke, partly).\n\nCons -\n\n+ I\u2019ll be much less stable career-wise - it isn\u2019t necessarily clear to what kind of job, say, an English degree is immediately applicable, compared to the straightforward path of being hired to work as an engineer by an engineering company if one has an engineering degree - and if and when I do land a job, it\u2019s likely the salary won\u2019t be nearly as high as what it would be if I followed a path in engineering.\n\n+ I\u2019ll be nagged constantly by family (parents excluded), friends, and older relations about how I should\u2019ve stayed in engineering for the career stability and for the payroll.\n\nIn sum, if money were no issue at all, I\u2019d switch, but money is a thing. So I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m just a college-scented trash fire at this point (with fragrant notes of self-loathing, anxiety, and possibly depression).\n\nOther stuff - I interned (without pay) at a startup that sold fashion online in my freshman year and worked on web development, which really meant bumbling through Wordpress pages, learning PHP and CSS in a haphazard, mostly Google-sourced way, and panicking over being unable to do what my non-technically-trained boss asked me to do. I didn\u2019t like that job, which is partly why I swapped out of CSE. I also went to a couple coding hackathons, which similarly left me feeling underwater and also contributed to the aforementioned decision. I haven\u2019t interned recently but I have, for pay, tutored/written sample essays for a friend at another college who\u2019s majoring in human resource management (or something similar) and has no idea how to write essays (I say this as kindly as possible: I love her and she\u2019s smart, but essays aren\u2019t for everyone). Even though I had no interest in the topics she\u2019s studying, I enjoyed writing for her - that is, the tasks of researching topics, coming up with a clear and constructive thesis, laying out a trajectory for the paper and writing it in concise and professional language - and it seems to help her. She\u2019s also the daughter of someone who makes 1.3 million USD a year in the auction industry and is interning currently in that same industry, so in the best-case scenario, I\u2019ll get some networking out of this (though that\u2019s a long shot; more immediately, I\u2019m just honing my English and teaching skills, and putting the money she pays me towards saving for student loans).\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts, suggestions, or advice on what to do!", "author": "BadassHalfie", "created": 1549885778, "retrieved": 1632848298, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eiogzyi": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/apfhi5/i_want_to_switch_from_engineering_to_humanities/eiogzyi/", "text": "I switched from CS to English after taking 2 English classes which weren\u2019t required general Ed classes that I liked and because I knew I\u2019ve always wanted to work in publishing (in the back of my mind)\n\nWhat are some potential future jobs you want to do?\n\nDo you hate you major classes because of the subject or just the sheer amount of stem?

Someone told me that double majoring in art and business was easier because business required more math classes they could at once.

While others might disagree, I don't believe the added value of getting a degree that your heart isn't even partially in outweighs this.\n\n>Pros of remaining in engineering -\n\n>The payroll.\n\nI don't have it on hand, but there was a study that supported that money, does indeed, buy happiness. But, only up to a point - specifically when your basic needs are met (i.e. shelter, food) and aren't at risk. Beyond that, it's just diminishing returns. Obviously, how much that is depends on where you choose to live. [I can try to search for the study, if you're interested.]\n\nSome people will tell you that you shouldn't focus on money-making, but you definitely should strive to ensure that your own basic needs aren't at risk. On the flip side, you don't need to shoot for Bill Gates income, if you don't want to.\n\n>also worried about losing financial aid since I\u2019m completely on aid\n\nI know a lot of schools have on-campus resources to assist students with this, so I would definitely recommend paying them a visit. Remember that education is an investment.\n\n>The fact that I won\u2019t have wasted...\n\nYou must recognize that your past efforts are a [sunk cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).
