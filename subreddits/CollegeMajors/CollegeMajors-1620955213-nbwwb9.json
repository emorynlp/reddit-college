You can be passionate about ***MANY*** things in your life. Swimming, hiking, cooking, crafting, art, socializing, taking walks, riding a bike, playing sports, volunteering, etc.\n\n*Hell, you can even be passionate about kissing someone.*\n\nPeople have different priorities in life:\n\nA. One person may want to make a lot of money and be able to afford a lot of the nice and fancy things and invest for their future children, etc and just can simply be tolerate of/satisfied with their career as a high-paying career may be their motivation.\n\nB. On the other hand, someone may want to pursue a career that they love/like and build their way up and gain extra skills/advance their way to a different higher position throughout their career in the future.\n\nC. Some people may be fine with working an average paying career that they like to do and living a simple life!\n\nD. Some people are able to handle high-stress jobs and the flipside is, they get paid well for it even though it may take a toll on their health. This is not always the case though because there are some careers that are considered high-stress, but unfortunately, the pay is quite low. For example, teaching.\n\nWith that being said, every career has its pros and cons and has its stressors!\n\n*Not to mention that the college degree you graduate with kinda matters in today's world and unfortunately, some majors are useless and/or require a Master's in order to start your career. While there are exceptions, there are some articles about this.* [*https://www.careeraddict.com/useless-degrees*](https://www.careeraddict.com/useless-degrees)\n\nIf anything, regardless of what your career/degree is, it is never too late to change your mind. You also need to choose a career that is in high demand and this predicts the amount of job postings there will be.\n\n**NEVER STOP LEARNING! LEARN NEW SKILLS AS THEY WILL BENEFIT YOU! THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS BE CHANGING!**\n\n**CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT WILL GAIN YOU SKILLS AND/OR POSSIBLY WILL LIKE/TOLERATE.**\n\n*Many people also don't work in a field that is related to their degree.*\n\nAdditionally, I personally don't think it's worth it to stay in a career that is high-stress and especially if it's one that you can't like at all, regardless if it is high-paying or not but hey, that's just me.\n\nThere is a/are reason(s) that people go back to school after all.\n\nIt's also not just the degree. Employers don't care about GPA these days; They care about your skills and internships/experience!\n\nBut I won't pretend that money is not essential. We need money to survive and pay the bills and afford some possibly nice things once in awhile ;p", "author": "Superb-Disk-8202", "created": 1620955213, "retrieved": 1632956412, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"h0uakyd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nbwwb9/following_your_passion_is_bs_advice/h0uakyd/", "text": "After reading your post twice or thrice, I realized something. You say following your passion is BS advice, but then you list how people have different priorities. I think you meant to say that following your passion to pick a degree or major is BS.

Make money, and make happiness. After a lifetime in a career, any job will become a mundane job. If you are indecisive, I would recommend you try something in a business field.\n\nFor example, I'm doing a double major (two majors) of accounting and finance. I wanted to pick something that seemed hard, but not as hard as engineering. Usually business majors are told they are the easier majors to get, and so I wanted to get a major in that field that was revered as difficult. \n\nOverall, I'm happy with my majors. If I didn't care about money or flexibility, I would choose something like history, communications, or psychology (all very respectable majors). \n\nJust make sure you don't sacrifice happiness or money in pursuit of the latter option. It needs to be 50/50 whenever possible. I've learned that people who stick to either just money or just happiness tend to be unsatisfied with their education and carrer in life.\n\nPs... over 80% of Americans get a job in a field completely unrelated to their study. What matters is that you get the degree and get out (and get a lot of work experiance).", "author": "JakeFromSF2011", "created": 1621560569, "upvotes": 2}, "gyicwig": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nbwwb9/following_your_passion_is_bs_advice/gyicwig/", "text": "Hello, \n\nI can relate to your post and it is true that although one has passions we have to be relaisitic and choose something like you mentioned that will gain you skills.

There is also a concnetration in HR that im also looking into.
