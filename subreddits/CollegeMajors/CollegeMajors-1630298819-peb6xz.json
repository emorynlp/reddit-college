I\u2019m half way through my associates degree In business administration, only got one more semester till I transfer to a university. I\u2019m stuck on deciding a major at the worse time I feel like. I could do a minor in CS but ive heard it really isn\u2019t looked over great from employers. My question is would getting my associates in business then doing another 4 years for a CS major instead of 2 years to finish a BS in business better.", "author": "SnooPaintings430", "created": 1630298819, "retrieved": 1632846498, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"hba2vjm": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/peb6xz/business_degree_or_computer_science_degree/hba2vjm/", "text": "What attracts you to computer science?

Outside of the likes of accounting most entry \u201cbusiness\u201d jobs will require a degree (not specific to business) where as CS stuff often requires a CS Degree, in my experience.\n\nThe value from a business degree comes from networks.\n\nBut really just choose what you are most interested in, being successful in a career is more likely from working harder rather than picking the right things, if you like what you are doing you are more likely to work hard at it and succeed. Things change all the time so what is right now might not be in 5 or 10 years time.\n\nHaving a goal job (this can change at any point but have something specific in mind) and do what you need to get there is a good way to think about it. When you are just cruising through without a end goal is sight you are less likely to get anywhere.", "author": "richieh89", "created": 1630364706, "upvotes": 2}, "hazaqkl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/peb6xz/business_degree_or_computer_science_degree/hazaqkl/", "text": "No one?", "author": "SnooPaintings430", "created": 1630359495, "upvotes": 1}}}
