  "text": "I have done about 3 semesters of college already at my local community college which allows me to transfer to any school I can get in to but the thing is I have literally no clue what I want to really major in. My major right now is Sociology which is probably one of the worst majors as I\u2019ll probably never make the money I would like to. Right now my GPA is a 3.75 . I excel in English and business related subjects such as accounting. What major would you recommend to me? Preferably a major with jobs that have the likeliness of a high growth percentage in the future and also one that pays well.\n\nAlso, science isn\u2019t something I\u2019d say I\u2019m particularly good at. I\u2019ve recently noticed that I do well with math as I\u2019ve aced the courses I\u2019ve taken so far and I don\u2019t find it as awful as other people do.",

          "text": "The actuarial science exams have been what\u2019s stopped me from pursing that degree I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re really difficult to pass and that they cost a ton of money. I\u2019ve also looked into accounting it seems OK, a bit boring but I\u2019d rather be bored than running around all day. The only thing is I\u2019d like to make more than the max salary for accounting right now. Thank you for your response I will definitely reconsider actuarial science and accounting.",

              "text": "yea i see. this might be more of a stretch, but econ is very math based and pertains to a lot of what you might be learning about in business courses. not sure if it 100% fits your interests, but you could still explore it. it's a growing field with a higher median pay than accounting",
