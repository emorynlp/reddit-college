My major right now is Sociology which is probably one of the worst majors as I\u2019ll probably never make the money I would like to. Right now my GPA is a 3.75 . I excel in English and business related subjects such as accounting. What major would you recommend to me? Preferably a major with jobs that have the likeliness of a high growth percentage in the future and also one that pays well.\n\nAlso, science isn\u2019t something I\u2019d say I\u2019m particularly good at.
