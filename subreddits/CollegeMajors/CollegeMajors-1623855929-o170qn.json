Currently, I am enrolled in a 3 credit internship this upcoming Fall Semester and have recently applied for a Data Analytics Internship at the clinic I currently work for.   I am about to purchase a Data Science Training Course and am enrolled in Statistics this upcoming Fall as well.  I would greatly appreciate any opinions, suggestions on routines and practices, and material that would be beneficial in further preparing myself? Is it ideal to go from Data Analytics to Consulting as this is a field I'd eventually desire to enter?", "author": "ZolwMotion", "created": 1623855929, "retrieved": 1632846517, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h2krjm6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o170qn/suggestions_opinions/h2krjm6/", "text": "Go talk to the folks at [r/MBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/) and [r/consulting](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/). From what I\u2019ve seen, consulting companies do tend to recruit a lot of data pros; you might want to consider a better school for your MBA than Madison though. If you want to stay in the Midwest, you may want to try for Booth, Kellog, or Sloan.", "author": "SaltSnowball", "created": 1624307152, "upvotes": 1}}}
