After Class I go home and play guitar, drums, bass, sing and record for 3-5 hours, I almost have album done (My first gig is jan 5th!). I've been going to community college for nearly 2 years and my time has come to choose a major as I now go to University. Nothing has really ever interested me, atlesast I have never looked hard enough at majors. I need money to live and I understand that. I talked to my counselors and told them I love talking to people and being social and explained everything I just stated above. I also mentioned that I am into writing and published a book on amazon. Every consuleor has told me to either major in communications or english but I'm not sure, I thought about buisness but they sound like risky degrees to get and I cannot go back to my parents house (not a good home life), also thinking about education but people say being a teacher is awful?? all I kind of view my degree is something to make money before my music ever takes off, but what are your thoughts? I also thought about audio engineering but I essentially have already taught myself it (I dont want to major in music, I did not enjoy my music classes i've been in besides one)\n\nTL;DR: Wanna be musician, never understood why im at college, I need to find a degree I can stand to make money since none has been made from music yet, Counselors suggest communications and English but they sound risky\n\nHelp me wise people of reddit.", "author": "Jrock12345", "created": 1546125075, "retrieved": 1632848220, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ecu27a3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/aaq4tl/what_to_major_in/ecu27a3/", "text": "Business isn\u2019t that risky of a degree to earn. \n\nAlso, you claim to have taught yourself audio engineering, but I\u2019m willing to bet that you haven\u2019t taught yourself ~everything~ about audio engineering. In order to be recognized as a legitimate audio engineer, then you need a degree in it. There\u2019s also a stark difference between being formally educated as an audio engineer, and teaching some audio engineering to yourself on the side. \n\nYou seem to be considering a lot of different options. We can\u2019t really offer you much advice, because the choice is ultimately up to you. If you want to be a writer, major in English. If you want to go into business, major in business.
