Relax, you got time. Do not worry about it too much.\n\nKeep in mind when you declare a major in college, studies show that most students change their majors a few times and that is normal! If you ever want to change your major in the future, go ahead! :) For example, I'm a Business major and I'm either thinking of Computer Science and/or Speech Pathology.\n\n(I also personally find it bizarre how society forces HS graduates to choose a major when they are in college when they don't have any life experience)\n\nWith that being said, if anything, try to major in one of the most in-demand majors as this will predict the amount of job openings. Research this and research what careers are related to that major. Also instead of focusing on just majors, research the *careers.* You need to focus on both money and what you like. Having just one or the other in life, it does not usually result well from what I seen based on other people's experiences. Watch videos, ask people for advice, job shadow potential careers, etc. Of course, there are some people that do have a job based on the major that they chose, but this is not always the case. It's also extra bonus points if you choose a career that is \"recession proof\"; COVID-19 made me realize this.\n\nYou also need to think about what kind of lifestyle you want to live as some majors are more lucrative than others, etc.\n\nOf course, you need to gain internships and network while in your college as that is also quite essential.\n\n**Also, be aware that some majors are useless in college and you need to do your research about this early on based on the employment statistics because it is sadly true in some cases.**\n\n*Some majors* ***require*** *you to have a Master's degree after your Bachelor's as well. For some majors, you won't be \"marketable\" for a job without one. Psychology is one of these degrees and in some cases, require a Doctorate's. So try to think if you would want to spend in school longer than 4 years.*\n\n***I also recommend going to community college first when you*** ***graduate from High School for the first few years of college and transfer to an in-state public college. It will save you a lot of $$$ and give you some time to think about what you want to do with your life. Unless you get into an Ivy League, most careers/employers don't care about where you attended school.*** (If anyone from HS looks down on you for going to community college, *ignore them.* Seriously. You will be doing yourself a favor and your future self will thank you) You can also take a year off and work and save some money, think about what you want to do and *then go to community college!*\n\nI highly recommend watching Shane Hummus on Youtube. He gives a lot of advice regarding where to go to college, how to choose a college majors, personal finance, what college majors are worth it, etc.\n\nSince you're also still in Highschool right now, take electives, join clubs that are related to future majors/careers. Go to your Guidance Counselor's office to see what kind of electives are available. Be open to new electives. (Looking back for myself, I would have definitely taking Computer Science if I had just done this and was a bit more open-minded.)\n\nGood luck!
