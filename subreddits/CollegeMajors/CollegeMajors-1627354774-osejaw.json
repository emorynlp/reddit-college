I'm a freshman in college and I am stressed because I do not know what I want do in life [F 18]", "text": "I just graduated from high school last month. My dream careers have always been a veterinarian, a famous musician (vocal), or a model. After some deep self reflection, I have realized that these are not practical and are very competitive to get into therefore resulting in me giving up on those career paths because I don't think I am good enough to compete against skilled individuals. \n\nRecently I have thought of becoming a registered nurse because I thought they made a reasonable salary but after a bit research and speaking with people in the field I realized that the pay does not equate to the amount of hard work that they put out. (Underpaid). I know that I shouldn't be focusing on the money aspect of things I've been told this multiple times my my family but at the same this is how I will be living, this is my entire life that we are talking about and I just don't want to be a failure. \n\nNow I am thinking of becoming either a respiratory therapist or a physical therapist.  They make a pretty decent and livable pay and I would not have to do much more school after graduating with my bachelor's degree ( in possibly biology). But I am pretty sure that this may change due to my indecisiveness.  I am so overwhelmed with this pressure from my family to find and major and career but I really don't know what to do. \n\nI love animals but I would hate to see them suffering and it is also just alot of schooling required which I don't want to do. I have a passion for singing and making music but again it is far too competitive and if I don't make it into the music industry I would just be stuck with a \"useless \" music degree.

Try to find what makes you happy and then worry about finding a business approach to that.\r  \n\r  \nI'll take the music industry as an example, since you mentioned that you are interested in that. If you check Google, there are hundreds of openings currently available at companies like Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud that you can apply to and get a job with without specific title requirements. Not counting all the exciting startups that are created every day.\r  \n\r  \nA title does not define anything.
