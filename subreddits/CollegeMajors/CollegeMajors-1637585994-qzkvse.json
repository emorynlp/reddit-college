  "text": "I am still in the first year of my Master's degree in Tourism. For five years of study at the university, I got a hell of a job working in boring Google documents or other similar services where it is impossible to work creatively.\n\nSo I created a small startup with friends to solve this problem. If you fill the same and want to look at how to get rid of boring documents, let me know in the comments.\n\nI don't advertise or sell anything. I need your opinion right now to create a handy thing.",
