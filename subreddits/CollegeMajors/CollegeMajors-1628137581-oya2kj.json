Someone to inspire you.\n\nWhat you mention seems to be philanthropy. There is no specific specialization for that, it can be anyone. Most philanthropists made their money in lucrative industries, and then dedicated their lives to charity, as you have to keep in mind that those jobs are not about making money or making a fortune. I'll give you the example of Chris Hohn, a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager. He said it had always been his dream to be a philanthropist, to help people and give money away, but he knew that to do that he needed the money first. So he went into finance, and today he is one of the richest people in the UK. He currently runs the largest foundation in that country.\n\nYour question should be: how can I make the biggest impact on the lives of disadvantaged people?", "author": "Saborizado", "created": 1628145109, "upvotes": 1}, "h7rsf1p": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oya2kj/need_helping_picking_a_major_as_im_3_years_into/h7rsf1p/", "text": "Maybe international relations or something similar to that.
