  "text": "I am a graduate from 2020 and both my parents and brother have been asking me to apply to summer instead of fall in university. So I can get a head start, and I did so....but I didn\u2019t know what major to go to and I figured I would know once I go to the university and talk to an advisor.... now that the whole quarantine thing happened I decided to contact her and set a google hangout for me to figure out what to do... She tried her best to help but I don\u2019t feel like I reached anywhere after talking to her.\n\nBasically I love math and physics! But I want to communicate with my clients and have meetings and discuss stuff!!\n\nWhen I applied to uni I chose design management (I did that because I could change my major and it was the only thing that wasn\u2019t business (my dad told me I can\u2019t take business bcz anyone can take it) and had communication with the client)\n\nI am currently considering mechanical engineering but I am not sure if I will have the meetings and stuff I want :(",

If you are taking a course over the summer, from my experience math and physics classes tend to be a lot easier during this time. So maybe doing Calc 1 and Physics 1 might be something you should look at doing this summer while you decide.",

My brother (he took electrical engineering) kept saying that mechanical engineering is fully technical work and I won\u2019t get to even talk to the client (mostly emails and no face to face meetings)\n\nWhich is the biggest reason I avoided engineering (I was about to settle with taking it as a minor since I love it, but I like talking to ppl more)\n\nHearing that reassures me! I am thinking of talking to more mechanical engineering graduates and seeing how their work is (if it\u2019s more from home or outdoors and talking to others) thanks ^_^",

              "text": "The professional world isn't as siloed off as college is. Mechanical engineering is more likely to be purely focused on technical stuff, but I'm not as familiar with the industry. It also depends on the company you work for. I work for a small local company so I wear a lot of hats (my background is comp engr and am currently a software engineer)\n\nThe thing is, having a solid technical degree means you can do just about whatever you want in addition to that technical stuff as long as you're good at it.\n\nI know a doctor of education who's a software developer. I know a CS grad who primarily does design work. I know college dropouts who are running their own businesses. The world really opens up (or sometimes caves in) for you once you graduate.",
