She tried her best to help but I don\u2019t feel like I reached anywhere after talking to her.\n\nBasically I love math and physics! But I want to communicate with my clients and have meetings and discuss stuff!!\n\nWhen I applied to uni I chose design management (I did that because I could change my major and it was the only thing that wasn\u2019t business (my dad told me I can\u2019t take business bcz anyone can take it) and had communication with the client)\n\nI am currently considering mechanical engineering but I am not sure if I will have the meetings and stuff I want :(", "author": "nonpopularopinon0-0", "created": 1588767973, "retrieved": 1632956258, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fqzq85l": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gej1e8/tt_any_guidance/fqzq85l/", "text": "its my understanding that a lot of engineers end up doing client facing stuff anyway (look up engineering sales - it may be to your liking).
