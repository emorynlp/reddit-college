  "text": "I am looking into degrees at UC Irvine. There are a lot of different types of computer related degrees. These are the specific two I am most confused about, because I thought a degree in computer science helps you to *become* a software engineer\u2026 so.. what is the difference between a computer science degree and a software engineering degree? Which is better? I plan on double majoring with the game design and interactive media degree.",

      "text": "For specifics, you should look at the required courses for each. To my understanding, there are lots of different CS-related programs at UCI, so do have plenty of options. \n\nThat said, it seems the SE degree has a bit more \"fluff\" in it than the CS degree does, and I'd say design theory is something you can easily pick up on the job. If you're interested in something like AI/ML, I think you have to be a CS major, not a SE major. There will be less theory, and it will be more applied (engineering and informatics focused). SE however does include a senior project, which will be good for your resume. It all depends on what you want to do in the future. \n\nI'd also double check with the school to make sure you're allowed to double major with those degrees.",

      "text": "I would generally recommend computer science. Everyone has a good idea of what a CS degree entails, employers are going to see your degree and know you've taken data structures, algorithms, CS theory, computer systems, statistics, linear algebra/calculus, compilers, databases, AI, or some combination of those classes. A software engineering degree is a little less defined, and it's harder to guess what kind of classes you've taken, which I worry may leave some to believe it's less rigorous. Overall, I would recommend the CS degree.",
