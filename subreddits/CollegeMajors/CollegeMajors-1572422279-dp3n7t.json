{"sid": "dp3n7t", "link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dp3n7t/completely_lost/", "title:": "Completely Lost", "text": "I posted here about 5 months ago asking about what concentration I should do, and since then my college career has been a mess. I contracted Lyme disease and had to withdraw for the semester. I was majoring in environmental science, but now I'm not sure if I can do anything in science. I had pretty bad memory loss that lasted so long that some of it became permanent, including a good chunk of what I learned in middle and high school. At the college I go to even \"introductory\" classes expect students to have prior knowledge about the subject, so science is out the window unless I want to wait to go back to school until I re-learn everything (I love science, but not enough to be willing to do that, especially since there are other subjects I'm equally passionate about.)\n\n One thing I did retain is my knowledge of the French language. I lost some of my memory but I love the language so much I am re-studying it, and even with the memory loss I am at the intermediate-low level (well above what would be expected of introductory French classes at my college.) I love French and I actually have considered getting a BA in French and a masters in linguistics since before I decided on environmental science.\n\n I also love geography, but I'm not sure about it as a major. I love history and I used to be really good at it, but now it is more difficult for me to memorize things like dates so I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do it. That being said, I am still in recovery so those skills will come back to me eventually, and I'm working my mind as much as I can to keep it in shape. \n\nWould getting a degree in French be a good idea? I know that it is in way less demand than Spanish (for teaching) but I think getting a masters in linguistics would make my job prospects better. Any advice helps.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that any non-STEM major has to do a minor, so I could do a minor in one and major in the other.", "author": "moymeoy", "created": 1572422279, "retrieved": 1632957383, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"f5vmtmr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dp3n7t/completely_lost/f5vmtmr/", "text": "1st off, sorry that you had to go thru all that and experiencing memory loss. That sucks. However I think every subject in school requires memory tho, so that is the part you'd have to tackle on. But, what jobs can you get with a french degree? You gotta know what college is for, it's an investment into your future... at least for most people. You should major in something more practical and useful that way when you graduate, you won't be left jobless. Geography and history are both the same, you'd need advanced degrees in those to maybe find an OK-paying job, generally in teaching. Masters in linguistics could help your job prospects, but it won't be worth the total amount of money you'll spend on all 6 years. I highly recommend pushing yourself in a STEM subject and try and train your memory for it again. Environmental science is one of those \"STEM\" degrees that isn't the best for jobs, kinda like Biology.\n\nI get that languages require less memory-training but it would not necessarily be worth the $$$. This is assuming YOU'RE paying for school and not an outside source (scholarship, parents, etc). If you decide on language, then try to aim for a PhD or at LEAST a masters. If you get a PhD, you can be a professor which makes much more $$$ than most teaching jobs below college level.", "author": "TiNyUzi", "created": 1572493284, "upvotes": 1}}}
