  "title:": "Stuck Between Two Majors",
  "text": "I am currently finishing my last year at a community college and will be transferring to a 4 year school for the Fall '21 semester. For the longest time I was going to transfer and go after a Finance degree. I'm looking to get into wealth advisory/private wealth management with my current employer but upon looking at different schools I came across a school with a major I never have seen before and that is a Wealth Management major. Within that major I am eligible to take my CFP exam during my senior year and in order to graduate I need 150 hours of wealth management experience through internship or through my current employer which I already have. The problem I run into is a regular Finance degree at a nearby university I could transfer to costs $13K a year while this school is $45K a year. I can always do tuition reimbursement and my first year will be covered through the GI Bill but do you think a Wealth Management degree is even worth it? Or should I just do a basic Finance degree and leave it at that?",

Aside from cost because I will have one year 100% reimbursed through my employer and the other year paid for by the GI Bill so tuition isn\u2019t really a worry. Do you think there are any advantages or disadvantages between majoring in one or the other?",
