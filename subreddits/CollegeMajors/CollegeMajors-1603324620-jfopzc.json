For the longest time I was going to transfer and go after a Finance degree. I'm looking to get into wealth advisory/private wealth management with my current employer but upon looking at different schools I came across a school with a major I never have seen before and that is a Wealth Management major. Within that major I am eligible to take my CFP exam during my senior year and in order to graduate I need 150 hours of wealth management experience through internship or through my current employer which I already have. The problem I run into is a regular Finance degree at a nearby university I could transfer to costs $13K a year while this school is $45K a year. I can always do tuition reimbursement and my first year will be covered through the GI Bill but do you think a Wealth Management degree is even worth it? Or should I just do a basic Finance degree and leave it at that?", "author": "Jeffc0814", "created": 1603324620, "retrieved": 1632957642, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g9mf7qq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jfopzc/stuck_between_two_majors/g9mf7qq/", "text": "I'd definitely choose a broder degree, that would be finance.", "author": "Ayham_abusalem", "created": 1603346368, "upvotes": 1}, "g9ly5nl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jfopzc/stuck_between_two_majors/g9ly5nl/", "text": "A wealth management degree is not worth 3X the cost of a Finance Degree.", "author": "DetectiveTacoX", "created": 1603334009, "upvotes": 2}}}
