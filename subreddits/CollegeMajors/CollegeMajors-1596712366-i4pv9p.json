  "text": "I'm interested in that three, but here are some points that may be important:\n1. I am quite good at physics in general, except for electricity or magnetism, and statics are my favourite\n2. I don't really mind math, but I really suck at statistics\n3. I hate chemistry\n4. Since the scholarship program requires to maintain a certain gpa, which of the three is easier objectively (not based on one's passion or something like that) ?\n5. Which one has the best job prospect and pay? I'm in Asia, if it matters",

      "text": "Mechanical and Comp engg might be your thing. Mech has some good amount of Chem..comp sci is plain math, phy , and computer stuff.\n\nI feel maybe Civil depends if you like the general gist of what they do in Civil.\n\nIdk how it's different for job aspect in Asia , it depends from country to country\n\nDifficulty depends on your interest and the amount of time/hardwork you put. Engineering in general is hard but worth it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nComp Sci gets you the highest average salary out of those, again depends on the country , I am speaking in general",
