  "text": "I am currently in my second semester of my freshmen year of college. At first, I went in for computer science but because I failed my math placement I was placed into intermediate algebra and this semester I will be taking college algebra which is pushing my first core class to many semesters. The reason I decided to change my major is because I would like to do something that is more hands-on with tech or in general deals more with tech, I was wondering if there's a major that hands-on with building things such as cars, planes, and maybe even robotics and other things dealing with tech and is at the same high paying with a good amount of good security.",
