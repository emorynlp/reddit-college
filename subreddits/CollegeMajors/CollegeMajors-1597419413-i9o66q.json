I already know I want to be in the law, politics, crime, government, and possibly education field. I really want to become a lawyer, but I\u2019m also interested in becoming a superintendent, working in a gov department, becoming some kind of detective/agent, forensic psychologist, legislator, and possibly some kind of manager (ex: Human Resources manager)\n\nI just have no idea what to Major in. I love debating, politics and history as well. I was considering majoring in history, but I\u2019m not sure if there would be a better choice. I\u2019m so stuck that I\u2019m even considering double majoring. Any suggestions? I\u2019m not really into STEM degrees.

Sci. and History. This gives you a good foundation in both subjects, and can help you get into law school or get a master's. If you go for a program which offers teaching certification, that can help if you decide to pursue education administration. If you are really interested in Mental Health, then add a Psych major on, but doing a triple major requires more work depending on the school, so be advised if you do a triple major in Poli. Sci., History, and Psych, it will probably be harder than just doing Poli. Sci. and History.\n\nPoli. Sci. and History are your best bets due to the foundation for law school, for education, and a lot of the jobs such as detective, legislator, and such you're looking for. Something like a manager in HR or something else is really built on experience, but having a Bachelor's can really help you there.\n\nOverall I'd say look into double BA/BS in Poli. Sci. and History, maybe add on Psych if you're really interested in pursuing mental health. Getting into law, or higher up education or government, that's where the master's degrees come in, so you don't have to worry about that for now.\n\nAlso wanted to add on, that criminal justice is something to look into due to your crime and law interests, but that might be better as a minor, as Poli. Sci. opens up a lot of opportunities that criminal justice does.", "author": "kaimamaster1315", "created": 1597435873, "upvotes": 2}, "g1ghbuv": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i9o66q/dont_know_what_to_major_in/g1ghbuv/", "text": "Like med school getting into a good law program isn't guaranteed so I would always encourage people to major in something that you can \"fall back on\" if your plans don't come to fruition. History is a fun degree, but is it worth four years of your life and possible debt if being a lawyer doesn't pan out? If you had to walk away from education after your four years would you be satisfied with just a BA in History?\n\nPersonally I'd recommend dong a major in Accounting, get CPA certified, and then minor in something fun like History. And as long as you can do basic trig and algebra you have already surpassed the highest math needed for accounting.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1597423051, "upvotes": 1}}}
