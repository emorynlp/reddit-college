As a first-gen struggling to pay for education, I want to follow a passion, but my degree is my ticket to a stable income at the end of the day.\n\nMy main interests/strengths:\n\n* Biology (Mainly Genetics & Environmental Science) (was pre-med for a bit but I don't want to pursue such a grind for so long)\n* Chemistry (I'm good at math and it seems cool, don't want to pursue as an entire major though)\n* Mathematics/Statistics (took AP Calc as a senior, loved the class and did really well)\n* Psychology (I loved AP Psych and it's my major atm, I'm concerned about career outlook\n* Art (I really want to learn some graphic design skills and improve my overall skills and start a small art business eventually, not willing to solely pursue a degree though)\n* Computer Science (I'm interested in learning to code, but as a woman likely to pursue STEM, I've always sold myself shortly before officially taking a class. I've taught myself some Java though)\n\nWhat I want in a career:\n\n* I sort of a minimalist, income isn't that important, I just want stability and enough to save\n* I would love to be self-employed someday or do freelance work (health insurance concerns)\n* I would love to travel and move to Canada or the Pacific Northwest if that affects the job market\n* I'm open to grad school (I am/was a psych major) but I don't really feel comfortable with it being my only option for stability\n* I want to pay off student debt ASAP\n\nIf you got to the bottom, thanks for reading through. I would prefer to not graduate late because of scholarship issues, but I'm open.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I think the reason I like chemistry is the problem-solving aspect of it and my interests evolve and change rapidly, so following my passion is a risky bargain.", "author": "pommejesuisune", "created": 1594240435, "retrieved": 1632847651, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"fxg948u": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hnoyjc/undecided_career_prospects/fxg948u/", "text": "Neuroscience with CompSci minor, take some art classes where you can?
