  "text": "Some of my interests. \n\n In high school I took computer science principals where we did very basic coding with JavaScript. I was decently Interested but eventually started having a hard time memorizing everything. \n\nFrom time to time I imagine myself as an engineer being a part of something big like spaceX, although I\u2019m not into the extremely long hours these careers can bring. But I see the future in these companies.\n\nSo i think most likely \n\nComputer science or computer engineering, I have read that it is sometimes better to take the harder engineering degrees or the most options. \n\n\n\n\nMaybe in the future mechanical or aerospace engineer. \n\n\n\n\nBut the thing is for an associate degree my community college only offers computer science or general engineering.no middle ground computer engineering. \n\n\n\nI kinda feel lost because I have Interests but not crazily passionate about anything.",

      "text": "With time and after taking classes at this CC, you will hopefully find something you\u2019re passionate about. Even if you have an associates in engineering, you could still study CS, as is true for the opposite. \n\nDo you have a list of the required courses for each degree? Does one interest you more than the other? Would you consider double majoring at university, or maybe a major in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in CS/E?",
