Architecture is definitely more of a civil engineering thing, which also involves a lot of math and maybe some statistics. So if you're thinking about architecture but still want to use math frequently, civil engineering is a good idea. If you're solely interested in a career based off its usage of math and/or stats, I would go with any field of engineering.", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1617637920, "upvotes": 2}}}
