On top of being a hard subject I am told that the prerequisite classes are very difficult and I am not a great student in gen ed classes. \n\nThe reason I am interested in circuitry in particular is because of my hobby of electronic musical instruments, this has caused me to have a pretty basic understanding of how breadboards work and how circuitry works. I\u2019d like to maybe use the subject of circuitry to apply it to music technology??? Or maybe even just get a strait music technology degree??\n\nI really could just use some advice because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there", "author": "blueshades09", "created": 1554741426, "retrieved": 1632848210, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ekz26mg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bavzgl/whats_a_good_major_for_someone_who_is_interested/ekz26mg/", "text": "Computer Engineering sounds like a good fit, as does Electrical Engineering.
