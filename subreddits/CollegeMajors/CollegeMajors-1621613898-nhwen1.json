      "text": "I'm copying and pasting an answer from a post similar to this (With some edits) *I want to give you more advice than just degrees cause I honestly wish someone told me this stuff when I was your age.*\n\nIt's okay! Relax, you got time. Do not worry about it too much.\n\nKeep in mind when you declare a major in college, studies show that most students change their majors a few times and that is normal! If you ever want to change your major in the future, go ahead! :) For example, I'm a Business major and I'm either thinking of Computer Science and/or Speech Pathology.\n\n(I also personally find it bizarre how society forces HS graduates to choose a major when they are in college when they don't have any life experience; Just stating my opinion about this!)\n\nWith that being said, if anything, try to major in one of the most in-demand majors as this will predict the amount of job openings. Research this and research what careers are related to that major. Also instead of focusing on just majors, research the careers. You need to focus on both money and what you like. Having just one or the other in life, it does not usually result well from what I seen based on other people's experiences. Watch videos, ask people for advice, job shadow potential careers, etc. Of course, there are some people that do have a job based on the major that they chose, but this is not always the case. It's also extra bonus points if you choose a career that is \"recession proof\"; COVID-19 made me realize this.\n\nYou also need to think about what kind of lifestyle you want to live as some majors are more lucrative than others, etc.\n\nOf course, you need to gain internships and network while in your college as that is also quite essential.\n\nAlso, be aware that some majors are useless in college and you need to do your research about this early on based on the employment statistics because it is sadly true in some cases.\n\nSome majors require you to have a Master's degree after your Bachelor's as well. For some majors, you won't be \"marketable\" for a job without one. Psychology is one of these degrees and in some cases, require a Doctorate's. So try to think if you would want to spend in school longer than 4 years.\n\n**I also recommend going to community college first when you graduate from High School for the first few years of college and transfer to an in-state public college. It will save you a lot of $$$ and give you some time to think about what you want to do with your life. Unless you get into an Ivy League, most careers/employers don't care about where you attended school. (If anyone from HS looks down on you for going to community college, ignore them. Seriously. You will be doing yourself a favor and your future self will thank you) You can also take a year off and work and save some money, think about what you want to do and then go to community college!**\n\nI highly recommend watching Shane Hummus on Youtube. He gives a lot of advice regarding where to go to college, how to choose a college majors, personal finance, what college majors are worth it, etc.\n\nSince you're also still 14 right now, take electives and join clubs that are related to future majors/careers even before you go to college. Go to your Guidance Counselor's office to see what kind of electives are available. Be open to new electives. (Looking back for myself, I would have definitely taking Computer Science if I had just done this and was a bit more open-minded.)\n\n***With that being said, these are the degrees that first come into mind:***\n\n1. ***Psychology.*** You can do a lot with this degree! There are SO many careers in this field that are in pretty high demand! You can counsel, do social work, do research, etc. Guidance counselor, social worker, school psychologist, clinical psychologist, forensic psychologist, consumer psychologist, industrial-organization psychologist, etc. If you want to your own practice, you would need a license for your practice, etc *As I stated before, you need a Master's at least and in some cases possibly a doctorate.*\n2. ***Speech-Language Pathologist*** You're going to love this because it combines 2 of the things you mentioned above: Languages and helping people. Also known as Speech Therapist or Speech Pathologist, this career ultimately helps people with speaking disabilities after they had a stroke, an accident, those with autism, etc. They also help those who have a swallowing disorder that prevents them from eating and drinking properly, but this is usually common in skilled nursing facilities. There is SO much you can do with this field! You can work with kids, teens, babies, and even adults! You can work in hospitals, schools, skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation homes, even travel if you want to! There is also plenty of per-diem (as requested work), full-time and even part-time job openings! *For this career, you need a Master's and to get licensed and get your CFY.* (In all honesty, while I respect teachers, this career is better than being a teacher in my opinion. Lots of SLPs here on Reddit were former teachers before. ) ***I know a lot of information about this field so message me if you want to know more!***\n3. **Political Science** From what I know about this field, you can work with the government, politics, and you can even go to law school with this career. However, I would be careful with this degree because the careers for it are often not in high demand. I also personally would not recommend law school as the field is oversaturated and it is extremely competitive to find a career as older lawyers aren't retiring, etc. I personally can go on and on. But hey, that's just me!)\n\nUse [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov) when searching careers and these are some of the most in-demand careers (And keep in mind that this may be subject to change over the years as you are still 14 and BLS focuses the predictions for the next ten years or so) [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm)\n\nCollege degrees/careers are different nowadays as it is getting more competitive. It's sad, but true, but I'm not saying it is impossible! :D And getting an education is important as long as you are **smart** about it!\n\nPlease message me if you have any more questions! :) I hope this helped!",
