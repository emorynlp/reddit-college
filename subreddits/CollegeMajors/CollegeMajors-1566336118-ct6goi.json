Then maybe study abroad/exchange in Korea\n\nOr\n\nGo with chinese as a major (which almost every uni has) and leave korean out the equation \ud83d\ude2d I know 0% of Chinese, I just think that would be the 2nd most interesting language/culture to learn\n\nIdk, it just seems like all my safety choices only offer chinese to study but they also have exchange programs available in Korea so like?????\n\nWhat sounds like the best way to go?\n\n\nOh yeah! I want to become a translator in the future but I\u2019ll probably teach English abroad for a couple years before pursuing that haha", "author": "miahxh", "created": 1566336118, "retrieved": 1632957978, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"exizp87": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ct6goi/solanguage_majorsminors_i_need_help/exizp87/", "text": "Major in International Affairs/Business or Linguistics and minor in Korean", "author": "Jiyanaki", "created": 1566338898, "upvotes": 1}}}
