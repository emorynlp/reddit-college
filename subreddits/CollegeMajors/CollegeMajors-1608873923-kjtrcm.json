I'm one of those people who has a few different interests and don't know which one to commit to. Especially since it'll be a career that I will be stuck in for most of my adult years. I added a list of careers and majors that interest me. If you're able to help combine or sort out my majors and careers to make the best combination or any advice that would be great.\n\nHere's a list of careers that interest me:\n\n\\- academia\n\n\\- healthcare (nursing, midwife, etc) (I could honestly just do my pre-reqs with any major)\n\n\\- social services\n\n\\- international non-profit related jobs (not really politics, more humanitarian). I also really like international journalism. Where I am able to write articles about the news and awareness of other countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMajors that I'm thinking of: I'm also thinking of double majoring or double minoring.\n\n\\- economics / data analytics (hard skills and very versatile)\n\n\\- middle eastern history (soft skills and enjoy history)\n\n\\- education/academia related majors (higher ed. administration, school psychology, mental health counseling)\n\n\\- nutrition (took a class, liked it. Also think it can be a good bachelors for health care fields or most social service fields)\n\n\\- accounting (literally just see this as a stable and basic career)", "author": "1234masa", "created": 1608873923, "retrieved": 1632955603, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"ggyud57": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kjtrcm/help_in_deciding_majorcareer/ggyud57/", "text": "https://youtu.be/AkZw8KOLWKI\nThis helped me pick my dream major", "author": null, "created": 1608875425, "upvotes": 2}}}
