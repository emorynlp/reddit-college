I want to be a college professor on the side while being a high school teacher as well. I know high school teachers need licensure, but they often want you to have education as your major. I want to teach English/Creative Writing classes as my emphasis. Would it be more beneficial for me to get an Education minor or an English minor with a Creative Writing Master's? Should I get both minors? Any help is appreciated!", "author": "AnonymousPinkDolphin", "created": 1577035652, "retrieved": 1632956979, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
