  "title:": "California-What's the real difference between a uc and a cal state for a bs in Biochemistry?",
  "text": "Just like the headline states, what's the real difference between a UC and a Cal State in California for bachelor of science in biochemistry? A cal state is half the price and does not require as much general education as a uc. I ultimately want to do a PhD probably after a couple years of work experience. Once I have my paper degree, at the end of the day, does it really matter if I attend a UC or Cal state? I would much rather do a Cal State just based on prices and less useless general education (I would have to take a foreign language, some useless English lit class, and some other gen ed class that has nothing to do with my major.).",

      "text": "If you plan on going to grad school, the difference between a CSU and a UC is pretty marginal. At the bachelor level, UCs are more prestigious, but a masters at a CSU is better than a Bachelors at a UC. \n\nHowever, with UCs being more research heavy than CSUs, you will get more access to research opportunities which will prepare you better for grad school. Debt isn\u2019t much of an issue for most biochem PhDs since you will usually get paid for your research to cover tuition",
