  "text": "im currently in my sophomore year of college and throughout the past year i have had big doubts about my major. the reason i even picked urban studies as my major is because i got a scholarship in my junior year of high school which allowed me to intern at my local city hall in the planning division. i worry that i won\u2019t be able to find a substantial job after i graduate. i have looked into minoring in accounting or stats as a cushion, but so far im completely lost. i don\u2019t even know if im completely happy with urban studies but i feel like its way too late for me to change my major into something completely different. if anyone has any advice i\u2019d definitely appreciate it!",

      "text": "So, I will say that I am not that familiar with urban studies, so I can't say off the top of my head what kind of jobs people get with it. My intuition says a decent number of people majoring in it end up becoming urban planners after getting a masters degree, but IDK. I do empathize with you, because I was in a similar position sophomore year, and I had to switch my major because I didn't know what I wanted to do with it. Fortunately, my new major is very interesting to me and has a nicely defined career path (computer science), so the switch was definitely worth it for me, and might be for you too.\n\nI think it could help you a lot to conduct some deep research into what kind of job you want. Start with urban studies, since that's what your current major is in. Talk to your school's career services, or your department advisor, ask them what kind of careers people at your school got with an urban studies degree. Use LinkedIn, try to find people from your school who graduated in the past with an urban studies major, study what kind of jobs they have, reach out to them if you have questions! Linkedin is a very valuable tool. Continue to scour forums like reddit or college confidential or whatever, type in stuff like \"jobs for urban studies major,\" etc. Hopefully, after doing this you will have a good insight into the kinds of careers available for urban studies majors. Reach out to people on reddit/linkedin who work those jobs, and try to see if they appeal to you or not. Ask those people for the average day in the life of someone of their profession, etc.\n\nThen, Do that same process for a ton of different careers. You seem to not know exactly what you want, but are concerned with finding a job, so pick a bunch of \"employable\" majors. Accounting, finance, nursing, IT/CIS/MIS, engineering, computer science, statistics, etc. Find people from your school majoring in these fields or people who graduated from your school who are working in these fields, reach out to them and just ask them a shit ton of questions about what they do. Hopefully this could give you more insight.\n\nYou may also want to consider taking a gap semester and use this time to fully figure out what you want to do.",
