How should I proceed?", "text": "At present, I'm a CS student (just starting sophomore year) who's not very satisfied with my program. I went to a pretty mediocre college, because they offered to pay full tuition.\n\nAfter this summer, I've been seriously looking into getting a math degree; I came into college with some Calc credits from the AP test, but I haven't taking any math classes since. Over the summer, though, I've done a few math-oriented coding projects which required me to teach myself a fair bit of linear algebra, and I ended up enjoying it more than anything I've done in programming for a while. I started looking into more and more college-level math, and I've developed a desire to get a minor in it or maybe switch majors.\n\nUnfortunately, my college doesn't offer math majors. We used to offer math minors, but, recently, the whole dept got moved over to our university's secondary campus. At this point, the highest math class offered at my campus is Calc I.\n\nI've asked to see if it would be possible to take math classes remotely from the secondary campus, and it is not. At this point, I'm mostly just looking for advice. If I want to do college-level math, what are my best options? I'm reticent to transfer, since I have \\~70 credits at this university and will have even more by the time this semester's complete. Is transferring worth it? Could I maybe complete some sort of online math program after finishing my CS degree at my current school? If so, what online programs are worth looking into?\n\nI just need some advice to kind of flesh out where I'm gonna go with this.", "author": "Common_Day_2302", "created": 1630137050, "retrieved": 1632957539, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"haojwmv": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pd5og3/university_doesnt_offered_preferred_major_how/haojwmv/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1630158469, "upvotes": 1}, "hanwj9w": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pd5og3/university_doesnt_offered_preferred_major_how/hanwj9w/", "text": "Ooh fellow math nerd! (Second year math nerd and online classes start up again in 2 days due to lockdown)\n\nObviously there's not any labs or practicals involved in a math major, so you don't *need* to be in-person. But, and the more subjective answer, is how well did/do you do with online learning? If you suck/ed at it, then I'd not recommend moving to it, at least right away. \n\nHowever, I've found that Math faculty are a lot better to their students compared to other faculties I've had experience with, and the niche of the major tends to make them also massive nerds, especially compared to CS majors which have a \"Too big to fail\" feeling that come with having high demand and also feed into a bunch of sexist culture amongst the students (I'm male but haven't seen it in my department)\n\nMy advice would be to not necessarily go full-in just yet, thanks to the online issue, but get your feet wet with what a math major might entail. Look at your curriculum and find the course/s that advertise as an \"Introduction to proofs\". It's the vibe that you'll run into along the major and stuff that you'd need to get accustomed to, and even if you find it's not for you, it's helpful to the type of problem-solving you need for CS.\n\nIn conclusion, ***join us***", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1630142696, "upvotes": 2}}}
