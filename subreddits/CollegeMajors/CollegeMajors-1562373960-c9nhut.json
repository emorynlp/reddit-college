I am not the best at math but I really do enjoy and understand the concepts of economics and I want to go into a business related field (at least I think) when I graduate. What kinds of jobs could I possibly get if I choose to major in econ and is the major challenging in the math department?", "author": null, "created": 1562373960, "retrieved": 1632848186, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"et80b68": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/c9nhut/should_i_major_in_economics/et80b68/", "text": "I am an economics major in addition to Biology, and I'm premed. I like economics because of the abstract type thinking and it's application to well.....everything. It's a good critical thinking degree without it being like philosophy. With that said, the BA in economics is usually a lot less math and more theory based classes, at least at my school. It seems like most of the people in my classes want to either go into business, grad school for economics, or are planning to go straight into the industry as economic analysts or actuaries. Pretty sure now a days, actuaries are usually recruited from degrees like accounting or statistics, so economics is probably not the best major for that. But also, my brother is an actuary and he was an economics major, he just got lucky. Otherwise most are usually a major that's more math heavy and less theory. Some of the others in my classes are pre law also.", "author": "S3403", "created": 1562542968, "upvotes": 3}, "et0kk3v": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/c9nhut/should_i_major_in_economics/et0kk3v/", "text": "I suggest you really look more into it on College Confidential,Quora, and just search about your question on Reddit google searches. I\u2019ve looked a lot about this because I was thinking of double majoring and those really helped me come to a conclusion. \n\nThe main point I got is that if you want to be an \u201ceconomist\u201d or involved in Academia you need to go to grad school. I\u2019ve seen a lot of threads where people say an economics major isn\u2019t as useful without  a masters/PhD. That said Economics imo is one of the better business majors you can get. You\u2019d be really helping yourself if you add a minor or another major. \n\nYou should look at your schools major map to see what classes you\u2019ll take. At business school or in the math department I\u2019d expect it to be more quantitative than it would be if it was taught as a social science.", "author": "thekidboy", "created": 1562380834, "upvotes": 3}}}
