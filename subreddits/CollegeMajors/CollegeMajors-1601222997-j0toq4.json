I want something that will prepare me well for the MCAT but also some thing I find really interesting. I have found three majors that I think I would enjoy and also prepare me for the MCAT. I really like biology but I\u2019m mostly leaning toward doing it just because of the MCAT but I do enjoy learning it overall. Then I found biochemistry and I think I would like that one more but I was reading up on it and a lot of people were saying that if you can\u2019t handle the work it\u2019s gonna bring your GPA down by a lot. Would majoring in bio chemistry be too much of a risk for my GPA I am also not the best at math. As long as I study for it and attend tutoring I can make straight A\u2019s but if I don\u2019t do that I\u2019m most likely failing. I also like kinesiology Which I would major in just because I enjoy it and it also does have good relative courses for the MCAT in my opinion. Although I\u2019m not sure if I should choose between kinesiology or biochemistry. Which one would prepare me better for the MCAT but still not bring my GPA down. Is biochemistry doable to get good grades in as long as you study? Which major should I pick in your opinion?", "author": "Estylla", "created": 1601222997, "retrieved": 1632957692, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g70hri0": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j0toq4/what_to_major_in_for_premed/g70hri0/", "text": "just major in whatever think you'll enjoy or what you'd want to do in case you end up not going down the medicine path. no matter what you major in you'll have to take med school prerequisites which should help prepare you for the mcat.", "author": "AliceRein666", "created": 1601340806, "upvotes": 1}, "g6w6uw1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j0toq4/what_to_major_in_for_premed/g6w6uw1/", "text": "Make sure it's a major that will be useful if you decide you dont want to go to med school later. Life happens and you never know where you'll be in 4 years. So, for example, dont major in bio just because you think itll be good for med school, major in it because you can see yourself succeeding in other areas of the field. You can always choose a major out of the scope of science and take med school prereqs. Look at what classes are required for majors you're interested in and choose a major with classes you'll enjoy because that will keep your GPA up.", "author": "shytries", "created": 1601244660, "upvotes": 2}, "g6v47ch": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j0toq4/what_to_major_in_for_premed/g6v47ch/", "text": "Chemistry or biochem.\n\nBiochem will be more relevant to med school.
