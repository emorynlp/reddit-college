If that doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019d love to have a job in the law and crime field, but I\u2019m also considering working in a government department as well.\n\nI\u2019m considering doing a double major in history and something like political science, psychology or criminal justice, but I\u2019m not sure what would be the best degree to choose.",
