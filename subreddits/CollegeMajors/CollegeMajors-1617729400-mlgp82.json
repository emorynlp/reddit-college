  "text": "I really just have no idea what I should major in. I was doing nursing at one point, but my goal was to get my Masters in Psych Nursing because psychology was my only interest and I thought if I did psych nursing I could do that, actually make money, and at least be helping people. Once I got into nursing, however, I didn\u2019t like it very much. It was interesting, but it stressed me out so much and the horror stories about 24 hour shift were terrifying. The professors just went on and on about how you could be sued for literally everything and how horribly you are treated. Plus, I had already struggled with nurse\u2019s aid training. And the blood... Don\u2019t even get me started on the blood...\n\nAnyway, to give some background about me, I\u2019m extremely introverted. I have social anxiety. I do horribly under pressure. But, I want to major in something that\u2019s going to help people, that\u2019ll pull me out of my shell. I thought psychology would be nice, but I hear that\u2019s for people who are going for their doctorate. Does anyone have any advice for me about what major I could do that will help people and still pay somewhat decently? \n\nI\u2019ve recently been interested in CS and Accounting, but I\u2019m not the best at math. I can get through it, but a lot of it I don\u2019t understand or just can\u2019t remember. What are some computer related majors that don\u2019t require that much math? \n\nAll advice is very happily received because I\u2019m at a loss. \ud83d\ude05",

It doesn't necessarily pay the greatest (depends on the area, in my area I've seen jobs posted between $15-20) but it might be an option and depending on the state you don't need a degree, just a certificate. \n\nIf you like medical stuff you could maybe be a medical researcher, maybe with a slant towards the psychology field?",

      "text": "You sound like me. I am the biggest introvert who has severe social anxiety. I also have high every day anxiety over the smallest things and have a total panic attack under high stress. I also wanted to help people and started off in nursing and psychology. \n\nI think any field where you help people will require a lot of social interaction. I have a few friends who were psychology majors and ended up with jobs in their fields with only their Bachelor\u2019s. But they don\u2019t pay top bucks and are stressful since they are at the bottom. But if you want something better you will need to get at a Master\u2019s. \n\nAccounting or CS are also really good for an introvert. I wish I would have majored in accounting. I would recommend these majors as opposed to psychology because you gain skills that employers actually need. There is a lot more jobs that pay much better in these fields. Plus, there is little social interaction for the most part.\n\nLastly, have you considered at double majoring in accounting or CS and psychology? Or maybe social work?",

I have also considering just doing something like CS or accounting and minoring in psychology, but I just don\u2019t know if CS and accounting would satisfy me in the end because I\u2019m just so fixed on wanting to \u201cmake the world a better place.\u201d It\u2019s hard being deathly afraid of social interaction and still wanting to help the people you fear. I\u2019ve considered elementary education because I thought the younglings would be easier to interact with, but I don\u2019t really know how to interact with kids either.",

It's much easier for me to interact with kids than adults. It's the other adults in my job that make it difficult. But I would say it's very possible if you are passionate enough about helping kids succeed! \n\nAlso, I don't think it's bad to double major in accounting or CS and psychology. Psychology is something that will need for every job. On top of the hard skills from accounting or CS. You can always make that argument to an employer. I guess, it's a combination of what you most want to do and what you think you can actually do.",

I know childhood can be the foundation for the rest of life, and being able to help even one kid who\u2019s struggling would bring me so much happiness. Plus, I feel like it can be quite a creative career. I know you guys have a curriculum you have to stick to, but you still have power over how you teach it kinda, right? I\u2019d love to hear all about your experiences with education if you\u2019d like to share them with me. A big fear about education is the financial side of it for me. I know sometimes teachers don\u2019t make much. Would you recommend substituting? \n\nI never thought of it like that. It could really help me. Still, it may be a lot to take on as far as the workload. It\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ll have to think about.",

In my experience, I\u2019ve unfortunately, encountered many people in this field that are not invested in education. Many even hate kids. I\u2019m not going to lie, it kills me to know that there people in this field like this. It\u2019s people like you that actually care about kids and their success that will make a difference. Kids also develop such incredible bonds with you unlike any other adult. They are truly marvelous. It\u2019s always amazing to see kids succeed. I will say this, though, not everything is great. There are bad days with kids. Sometimes admin is not doing enough to help. But helping kids triumphs this if you have the passion. \n\nAlso, yes. You do have some freedom at teaching things. You have certain topics/curriculum that you are required to teach. But you can most certainly create your own lesson plans to best fit the needs of your students. And yes, subbing is a fantastic way of getting into education. Most teachers must start off as subs to gain the experience. In terms of the money, it\u2019s not the best. But it\u2019s enough, in my opinion. Yes, you won\u2019t make $50K right off the bat like other fields but you must consider you will also not be working summers or evenings most of time. So it works out.",
