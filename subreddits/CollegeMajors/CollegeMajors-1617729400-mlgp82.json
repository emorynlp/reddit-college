I was doing nursing at one point, but my goal was to get my Masters in Psych Nursing because psychology was my only interest and I thought if I did psych nursing I could do that, actually make money, and at least be helping people. Once I got into nursing, however, I didn\u2019t like it very much. It was interesting, but it stressed me out so much and the horror stories about 24 hour shift were terrifying. The professors just went on and on about how you could be sued for literally everything and how horribly you are treated. Plus, I had already struggled with nurse\u2019s aid training. And the blood... Don\u2019t even get me started on the blood...\n\nAnyway, to give some background about me, I\u2019m extremely introverted. I have social anxiety. I do horribly under pressure. But, I want to major in something that\u2019s going to help people, that\u2019ll pull me out of my shell. I thought psychology would be nice, but I hear that\u2019s for people who are going for their doctorate. Does anyone have any advice for me about what major I could do that will help people and still pay somewhat decently? \n\nI\u2019ve recently been interested in CS and Accounting, but I\u2019m not the best at math. I can get through it, but a lot of it I don\u2019t understand or just can\u2019t remember. What are some computer related majors that don\u2019t require that much math? \n\nAll advice is very happily received because I\u2019m at a loss. \ud83d\ude05", "author": "scatterbrainie", "created": 1617729400, "retrieved": 1632846814, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gto6hp4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mlgp82/i_am_completely_lost/gto6hp4/", "text": "Maybe something like a registered behavior technician could work?

I am the biggest introvert who has severe social anxiety. I also have high every day anxiety over the smallest things and have a total panic attack under high stress. I also wanted to help people and started off in nursing and psychology. \n\nI think any field where you help people will require a lot of social interaction. I have a few friends who were psychology majors and ended up with jobs in their fields with only their Bachelor\u2019s. But they don\u2019t pay top bucks and are stressful since they are at the bottom. But if you want something better you will need to get at a Master\u2019s. \n\nAccounting or CS are also really good for an introvert. I wish I would have majored in accounting. I would recommend these majors as opposed to psychology because you gain skills that employers actually need. There is a lot more jobs that pay much better in these fields. Plus, there is little social interaction for the most part.\n\nLastly, have you considered at double majoring in accounting or CS and psychology? Or maybe social work?", "author": "strangercats13", "created": 1617731100, "upvotes": 5}}}
