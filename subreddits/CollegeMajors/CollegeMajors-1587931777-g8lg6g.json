I recently finished my contract and I'm looking into attending College. I really enjoy video editing and pairing it with music and visual effects to make it flow. I'm somewhat savvy with Adobe After Effects and other video editing software. I'm looking for Majors that will teach me more about video editing and the ins-and-outs of different video editing software. Maybe something that will allow me to take footage that was already there and edit the hell out of it with music and special effects. I don't even know if this would be a major, but I thought I'd ask.
