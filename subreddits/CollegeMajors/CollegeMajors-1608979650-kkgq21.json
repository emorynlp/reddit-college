  "text": "Hi, I'm a high school senior who can't decide what major to choose. Since I was a child I always wanted to be a writer \u2014 still do. My parents told me that wasn't a career and that I had to select something that actually provided stability. Since 7th grade I had planned to major in English and later work in publishing. My dream job is to be an fiction editor. However, since last year I had given some thought about psychology. I have always been interested due to own personal experience and curiosity, but it has never caught my attention like reading/writing has. I took several classes and I enjoyed them, but it wasn't my ideal career. Now as a senior I keep seeing how English majors never find a job or get paid very poorly. I keep looking into psychology because I would be interested in working as a counselor psychologist with children and adolescents. My issue is that although psychology is far more stable and I could earn more, I would need more years in school. Also, I just don't want to study psychology. While in English I do really well in my AP classes and I have always been found and eager to learn. I am stuck between my dreams and the sad reality. Sometimes you have to come to that soul crushing reality that some of us don't get to live ours dreams. I've always had an unfortunate life, I shouldn't expect much from it. I shouldn't reach for the impossible, I should settle for stability.\nPlease help. Share your thoughts and experiences. I need some wise words from older people. Being 18 is the worse; that realization that your childhood is done is horrible.\nI will answer all questions. Sorry if I don't reply, it has happened several times that I get notifications but I can't see the comments. Thank you!",

      "text": "I was actually in a very similar situation last year. I see from the comments ur going to community college first and I gotta say: good choice! I was new to my current country\u2019s system and had no idea what to major in or what good colleges to look into. I have some friends that went into whatever major was left at their favorite college and hate it now.\n\nI don\u2019t have any concrete advice I guess, but I was stressing about it so much last year. Don\u2019t stress. You have plenty of time, and your general ed courses will allow you to explore. I just found out I might want to minor in art history!\n\nAlso keep in mind that your major doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate what you go into as a career, a BA is often just to make you more well-rounded and demonstrate your critical thinking.\n\nTake some classes of each subject and take it slow. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever pick a major but now I\u2019m close to committing. You got this! You could always double major or do freelance writing lol",

All of my friends \u2014 who once had a mind set on one career \u2014 have completed changed their minds and don't know what to do. We are all going to community college in hopes to see how it goes. \n\nI will try to enjoy what is left of my high school year (although it is all online) and get the college preparation over with. Congratulations on figuring out your minor; I really enjoy history, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nI will try to take from both English and psychology and try to decide then. As for freelance writing, I have a similar plan. I am a \"writer\" and I will try to get published. No matter my career, I have always had writing as my priority. If I'm ever successful, I will stick to it.",

      "text": "Hey, I\u2019m a psych major about to be going for a Ph.D., let me tell you that psychology is a massive field that has numerous routes for you to take. For example, my research doesn\u2019t even consider disorders, rather I look at how people think and how different approaches to teaching can be improved based on that. My point here is that it\u2019s likely there are areas of psychology (and other fields) that you can\u2019t even think of right now because you\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\n\nI would suggest you do some real research on editing and the future of the job (beyond just fiction editing). The bureau of labor statistics has lots of information on these kind of things. If you want to talk about psychology some more, feel free to hit me up and maybe you\u2019ll find something within the field you\u2019re passionate about.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget about the possibility of double majoring, especially if you have a lot of AP credit. You could choose a more practical major as your second as a backup.",

      "text": "Hey as a senior in College. I had my major set on Nursing or Psychology when I graduated high school. My current major? IT and a minor in computer science. Let me say it\u2019s completely normal to be in these situations because it feels like you are stuck with whatever field for the rest of your life. \n\nNo one can chose your major, but you. Please don\u2019t let other influences like parents, money, or other be a factor in choosing your major. My parents wanted for me to be an engineer because I was in the top percentile in math. But guess what? I hated math. The beauty of college (although it might be expensive if you are in the US) is that you can always change paths. Also I took both nursing and psychology courses through my freshmen and sophomore year. \n\nMy best advice is to go to college with an open mind and the passion will come to you. For me, it was not obvious. But I enjoyed taking IT courses and it was for an elective, but then it kinda clicked. Also there are people in most colleges that can give you advice on career paths with your major, advising and sometimes mental health counseling that can be beneficial for dealing with stresses of adult hood (you don\u2019t need a mental illness to go to counseling they can be good for stressful situations and to talk through them) \n\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the answer you are looking for because I can\u2019t chose a major for you, but there are usually resources at college to help you and I would suggest taking a look at (they come with your tuition if you are from the US 99% of the time) I found them beneficial in my junior year when I hit a midlife crisis because I didn\u2019t want to do either major. But I wish you the best of luck! (: \n\nEdit: formatting issues",

              "text": "The above comment is a good one. A lot of people enter college without knowing what they want to do, and I think going to community college is a good solution, since you'll be able to mess around a bit more without worrying about wasting a lot of cash.\n\nMy experience may actually be somewhat relevant. I was also an English major, but I switched to computer science my junior year in college, and had to do an extra year to get a CS degree. When I was an English major though, I knew other English majors obviously, so I had some idea of what other people were doing, and the possible career paths. Some English majors I knew personally, and a lot I talked to online, wanted to go into various business type jobs, like marketing, HR, PR, communications, that type stuff. Personally, I was planning on going into marketing, which is a field that cares way more about experience and ability than major, so my degree not being in marketing wasn't a huge issue I think and I was able to get an internship before I changed my major. I interned at a small company, and some of the people there had also majored in English. Marketing is a huge field though, so if you did want to pursue it, you would have to do your research and figure out exactly what you wanted to do.\n\nOther English majors I knew did more schooling, although this may be overrepresented because I went to a college with a bunch of overachiever types. I would definitely not recommend this route. Academia is fucked, especially for humanities majors, tenured professorships are extremely hard to get, adjuncts get paid little, horribly competitive and backstabbing, etc. \n\nI can't say much for psychology. I think a lot of psych majors end up going into similar jobs as English majors, marketing etc. If you don't want to study it, though, I think that's something very serious to consider. Like, why spend 4 years studying something you legitimately wouldn't enjoy/find interesting?\n\nAs for actual writing jobs, my aunt actually works as a technical writer, which is another job opportunity I was briefly considering. There are jobs out there for good writers. But these jobs probably don't pay as much as other fields, and are probably competitive, so IDK. Honestly that's about the best advice I can give. You'll see people say that there are no jobs for English majors, or say \"oh good luck working at Starbucks\" or something. This is an exaggeration, but it's dumb to pretend that English majors will earn the same (on average) as computer science majors. Hell, that's part of the reason I switched to Computer science. Of course, I also found the field really interesting, but I'm not going to lie and act like the pay and job security wasn't a consideration.\n\nBut then again, it's probably not worth it to major in something just for the pay, even if you hate the subject. So I would just take classes in a bunch of different fields. And also weigh in your mind how important stability and making money is. It seems like this IS a  big consideration for you, considering that you are thinking about majoring in psych, a field you said you didn't find interesting, because of stability. Maybe consider IT? or accounting? or nursing? or engineering? All of these (and a shit ton of others) are stable degrees, if you put in the work. Not telling you to major in these, just a consideration if stability is a big issue to you.\n\nAnd lastly, maybe think about reframing the way you're posing this question. It seems like you are framing it as a career you're interested in VS a career that's stable. And I've heard this said by a bunch of people, with the whole \"minor in what you love, major in what will get you a job\" rhetoric, implying that what you love won't get you a job. I think this is an unhealthy way of looking at things. Whenever I hear this, I always think \"why not find BOTH?\" A job that you find interesting (not necessarily your passion, but a job that is interesting and challenging), which is also decent paying and stable. \n\nWhen I entered college, I didn't consider majoring in computer science. I only took a class my junior year out of sheer curiosity, and found out I really enjoyed the material. The same is definitely possible for everyone, I think. Like, a lot of these majors and careers are things we have no exposure to. How can we decide whether we like accounting or computer science or philosophy, if we have never taken any prior courses in the material? IDK. My main suggestion would be to take a variety of courses then. In both English and maybe some more practical majors that could lead to a good job. You might really like one of them, who knows. But if you don't, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs (stability/pay vs interest) and hardwork.",

I'm the two classes I took in high school I found how I was very intrigued in finding how people work and what makes them. Irregardless on the career I can still try to be a writer. But my concern is that I don't know what to expect in psychology. I've never been good at science or math, but I'm very good at understanding people. As for English, I know what to expect and I'm good at it. Money is a major concern because I don't want to feel like all of my hard work was for nothing. My parents sacrificed so much to give me an education, and I feel like only following my dreams will be like throwing all of their hard work away.

And technically you have the rest of your life to go to school (though expensive).  I hate the fact high school counselors rush students (happened to me too and was shamed for going to a community college) but going to community college is a good move. The only negative is that you miss that \u201ccollege experience\u201d from what I heard but as a introvert. I didn\u2019t want that anyways. But there are many activities in my community college (assuming others as well) to keep you social if one is worried about that. \n\nAlso with psychology, you will most likely need to go to grad school for a decent job but there are so many fields of psychology one can go into. Industrial, criminal, child, sport, and some others to name a few. But again you will mostly need a masters degree.  That is something I knew when I was pursing the degree and one of the factors of me switching degrees. If that helps you compare the two you already have. English I don\u2019t know at all about the majors but saw the other commenter have some information. (:",

For psychology I planned in looking into child psychology and get a master's. To get licensed I need at least a master's. If I enjoy it or see that I could need a higher education, I would go for my doctorate but once I'm actually stabled because I could never afford it now.\nFor English, I want to work in publishing, specifically ones like Penguin Books. I want to work as an editor since I was in seventh grade, and was often discouraged. After years of research I began to understand why so many went against my decision \u2014 there is hardly ever jobs in editing, they are poorly paid and are only in bigger cities. I live in Texas and if I were paid what it is regularly paid, I could live well, however the jobs are all in cities like New York and Seattle, where it is far more expensive.\nSo really I'm having to decide between a small interest that offers opportunities and a dream job that is nearly impossible. :/ \n\nSorry about writing a lot.
