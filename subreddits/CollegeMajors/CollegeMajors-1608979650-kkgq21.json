Since I was a child I always wanted to be a writer \u2014 still do. My parents told me that wasn't a career and that I had to select something that actually provided stability. Since 7th grade I had planned to major in English and later work in publishing. My dream job is to be an fiction editor. However, since last year I had given some thought about psychology. I have always been interested due to own personal experience and curiosity, but it has never caught my attention like reading/writing has. I took several classes and I enjoyed them, but it wasn't my ideal career. Now as a senior I keep seeing how English majors never find a job or get paid very poorly. I keep looking into psychology because I would be interested in working as a counselor psychologist with children and adolescents. My issue is that although psychology is far more stable and I could earn more, I would need more years in school. Also, I just don't want to study psychology. While in English I do really well in my AP classes and I have always been found and eager to learn. I am stuck between my dreams and the sad reality. Sometimes you have to come to that soul crushing reality that some of us don't get to live ours dreams. I've always had an unfortunate life, I shouldn't expect much from it. I shouldn't reach for the impossible, I should settle for stability.\nPlease help. Share your thoughts and experiences. I need some wise words from older people. Being 18 is the worse; that realization that your childhood is done is horrible.\nI will answer all questions. Sorry if I don't reply, it has happened several times that I get notifications but I can't see the comments.

I see from the comments ur going to community college first and I gotta say: good choice! I was new to my current country\u2019s system and had no idea what to major in or what good colleges to look into. I have some friends that went into whatever major was left at their favorite college and hate it now.\n\nI don\u2019t have any concrete advice I guess, but I was stressing about it so much last year. Don\u2019t stress. You have plenty of time, and your general ed courses will allow you to explore. I just found out I might want to minor in art history!\n\nAlso keep in mind that your major doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate what you go into as a career, a BA is often just to make you more well-rounded and demonstrate your critical thinking.\n\nTake some classes of each subject and take it slow. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever pick a major but now I\u2019m close to committing. You got this! You could always double major or do freelance writing lol", "author": "TheDaughterOfFlynn", "created": 1609203888, "upvotes": 2}, "gh4wf5z": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kkgq21/psychology_or_english/gh4wf5z/", "text": "Hey, I\u2019m a psych major about to be going for a Ph.D., let me tell you that psychology is a massive field that has numerous routes for you to take. For example, my research doesn\u2019t even consider disorders, rather I look at how people think and how different approaches to teaching can be improved based on that. My point here is that it\u2019s likely there are areas of psychology (and other fields) that you can\u2019t even think of right now because you\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\n\nI would suggest you do some real research on editing and the future of the job (beyond just fiction editing). The bureau of labor statistics has lots of information on these kind of things. If you want to talk about psychology some more, feel free to hit me up and maybe you\u2019ll find something within the field you\u2019re passionate about.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget about the possibility of double majoring, especially if you have a lot of AP credit. You could choose a more practical major as your second as a backup.", "author": "Zam8859", "created": 1609041589, "upvotes": 2}, "gh2ofl8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kkgq21/psychology_or_english/gh2ofl8/", "text": "Hey as a senior in College. I had my major set on Nursing or Psychology when I graduated high school. My current major? IT and a minor in computer science. Let me say it\u2019s completely normal to be in these situations because it feels like you are stuck with whatever field for the rest of your life. \n\nNo one can chose your major, but you. Please don\u2019t let other influences like parents, money, or other be a factor in choosing your major. My parents wanted for me to be an engineer because I was in the top percentile in math. But guess what? I hated math. The beauty of college (although it might be expensive if you are in the US) is that you can always change paths. Also I took both nursing and psychology courses through my freshmen and sophomore year. \n\nMy best advice is to go to college with an open mind and the passion will come to you. For me, it was not obvious. But I enjoyed taking IT courses and it was for an elective, but then it kinda clicked. Also there are people in most colleges that can give you advice on career paths with your major, advising and sometimes mental health counseling that can be beneficial for dealing with stresses of adult hood (you don\u2019t need a mental illness to go to counseling they can be good for stressful situations and to talk through them) \n\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the answer you are looking for because I can\u2019t chose a major for you, but there are usually resources at college to help you and I would suggest taking a look at (they come with your tuition if you are from the US 99% of the time) I found them beneficial in my junior year when I hit a midlife crisis because I didn\u2019t want to do either major. But I wish you the best of luck! (: \n\nEdit: formatting issues", "author": "eviltatortot", "created": 1608993767, "upvotes": 8}}}
