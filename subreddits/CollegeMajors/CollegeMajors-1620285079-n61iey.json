  "text": "Good outdoor careers? I\u2019m currently pursuing anthropology with a focus in archaeology. My goal is to work in specifically maritime archaeology as I am a big scuba diver and love the outdoors. However, a lot of people have been telling me that it\u2019s a useless degree and so I\u2019m having second thoughts. Any advice about archaeology or maritime archaeology would be appreciated. Also if anyone wants to comment their major versus what job they ended up getting would be greatly appreciated!",
