  "text": "So I've always wondered what major I should have and as I am going into high school, I feel like knowing a appropriate major can help me do stuff that I am interested in throughout my high school years.\n\nMY INTERESTS: I would prefer something broad, and something is quite interdisciplinary. I love studying science(especially bio and chem) and math, but have always had a love for English literature, history, social studies, philosophy,etc.\n\nI would like a major with a focus on the sciences and on the humanities. Something that is well employable as well wouldn't hurt :P\n\nI know about double majors, but I was wondering if there was one thing that combines all of this.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: I have been looking into fields like economics (which I've heard has been called a quantative humanities subject, which sounds appealing) and medicine (because of the overlap between the sciences and ethics, global health, etc)",

I think it is great to have ideas about what you are interested and I know that creating plans for the future can be comforting. However, it is important to spend time focused on the present as well. Enjoy spending time with friends and doing activities that you are genuinely interested in (as opposed to those that are merely resume builders).",

Information science might also be something worth looking into as it mixes aspects from neuroscience, computer science, history, and linguistics.\n\nAlternatively, a chemistry degree could open up the possibility for a preservation/conservation type career. You'd likely have to add in your own humanities spin, though (or minor/double major).",

I have first hand experience and certification in the field and it\u2019s a crossroad between biology, geology, history, statistics, geography, and humanities. It\u2019s really fascinating and you can definitely focus more on certain areas than others if you find them not to be to your liking. The field is really easy to run with in any directions. You will get less hard science if you focus on cultural or linguistic anthropology, but biological anthropology and archaeology really implement it. I was taken aback when I began studying it at how multidisciplinary it was and that\u2019s really the reason I fell in love with it.",

I feel like there is sooo much to be done in that field, and you could end up extracting DNA from remains to being a museum curator. It's really cool! \n\nI hate to be that person, but do you know what jobs are like after graduation? Like what do most archaeology major's do after college? I assume a master's and then a PhD.",

              "text": "That entirely depends on your location really. In the US, private archaeology is legally required on all construction projects that are federal in some capacity. So, if your area is ripe with development, you can find yourself working in the field doing CRM. That\u2019s what 90% of graduates do after college and most don\u2019t even have a graduate degree. However, if you eventually want to be a higher up in the company doing more research than fieldwork, you\u2019ll want a graduate degree. In CRM, all you need for that is a Masters. However, if you want to do academic archaeology, that\u2019s when you want a PhD. So, there are opportunities for all levels of degrees. Most people in the field want to get a graduate degree, but not all. It does help though!",
