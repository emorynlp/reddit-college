I love studying science(especially bio and chem) and math, but have always had a love for English literature, history, social studies, philosophy,etc.\n\nI would like a major with a focus on the sciences and on the humanities. Something that is well employable as well wouldn't hurt :P\n\nI know about double majors, but I was wondering if there was one thing that combines all of this.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: I have been looking into fields like economics (which I've heard has been called a quantative humanities subject, which sounds appealing) and medicine (because of the overlap between the sciences and ethics, global health, etc)", "author": "vishthefish05", "created": 1588625229, "retrieved": 1632847743, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"fsr8acn": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gdjt4a/help_me_choose/fsr8acn/", "text": "Cognitive Science\n\nIncludes CS, Psych, Phil, Ling, Anthro, and Neuro\n\nNeuro is also interdisciplinary and includes chem and bio", "author": "Nobodynot", "created": 1591198414, "upvotes": 1}, "fqfni5u": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gdjt4a/help_me_choose/fqfni5u/", "text": "I'd recommend that you don't worry too much about your college major.

It\u2019s really fascinating and you can definitely focus more on certain areas than others if you find them not to be to your liking. The field is really easy to run with in any directions. You will get less hard science if you focus on cultural or linguistic anthropology, but biological anthropology and archaeology really implement it.
