My linguistics professor who has a PHD asked me why I chose business as a major. I told him I wasn\u2019t really sure and just chose it to get my foot in the door and to start using my gi bill (get paid to go to school)\n\nHe told me I needed to do what I was passionate about and said he was in my position when he was younger and just going through the motions. He said there\u2019s a reason big name schools don\u2019t offer business administration...\n\nWell sure enough he convinced me and I ended up changing my major to liberal arts until I can decide what is best for me moving forward. I spoke to an advisor before changing it and she said it\u2019s up to me but she thought it was better to stay with business. I far I\u2019ve only lost 2 classes. Right now I\u2019m taking Statistics and my professor kind of laughed when I told him my major was liberal arts and he preferred business. He said some schools won\u2019t even take statistics and liberal arts has too many courses that will become useless. \n\nI just can\u2019t figure out if I should stay with liberal arts or go back to business?? I do know I rather make a lot of money rather than do what I\u2019m \u201cpassionate\u201d about while barely making ends meet.  I am already debt free with 55k saved so I am already thinking about the future and rather sacrifice with a high paying job that I can make work and have more opportunities. \n\nWould going back to business be a good idea or what should I do? I think I am going back to the school later to get some more help and advice.", "author": "FocusedAmbition", "created": 1563541782, "retrieved": 1632848279, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eu7szmd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/cf7d02/business_administration_or_liberal_arts/eu7szmd/", "text": "What degree does \"liberal arts\" refer to?
