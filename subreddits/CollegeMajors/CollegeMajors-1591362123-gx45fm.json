  "title:": "Attention: Business Analytics Majors",
  "text": "For all the business analytics majors here, what are your prospects of finding a position as a business analyst?  I am thinking of double majoring in business analytics and accounting because the double major would only be two extra classes I would have to take.  I have been looking more into business analytics and there is a growth in jobs for analysts, but I am worried that I will not qualify for an analyst job due to the requirements varying from masters degrees, STEM, and business.  If anyone had/is majoring in analytics, I would like to know your thoughts on the matter.",
