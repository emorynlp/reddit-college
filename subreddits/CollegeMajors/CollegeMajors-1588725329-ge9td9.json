Unfortunately I'm not really skilled at anything and I kind of invested most of my time in art during high school. Art is nice and I love it, but realized that I can't live off of it. Basically I wasted my time. \n\nSo far I'm thinking about maybe fashion, psychology, or accounting (I'm kind of bad at math though and I'm really unsure of pysch...) I don't know what other majors or careers that would fit me so what would you guys suggest? I just really crave financial stability...", "author": "cymilk", "created": 1588725329, "retrieved": 1632847738, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "comments": {"fpozsff": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ge9td9/im_lost/fpozsff/", "text": "Any major has inherent risk, both psychology and a fashion degree will have higher risks associated with them because they usually have a lower return on investment.\n\nThere are A LOT of psychology majors so competition for a funded grad school program is very competitive. For a STEM degree you could expect to be accepted into a grad program with a GPA as low as 3.0 as long as you have the correct work/research experience. Getting accepted into a psychology grad program you will constantly have to maintain a pretty high GPA and do a lot of undergrad research with your professors in order to be viable for a masters degree. The money with psychology typically comes from private practice and this requires a PhD at a minimum.\n\nFashion is like a Art/Film/Theater major in which your success is largely dictated by how outgoing you are and what connections you establish while in your undergrad. It is full of highly motivated people that essentially make their own success in a market that is VERY oversaturated and HIGHLY competitive. So your odds of \"making it\" are low, but not impossible. I would avoid this major if you are not 110% determined to do it.\n\nAccounting is a great major that has some of the highest straight out of college employment rates. But the stereotype of the depressed accountant is pretty accurate and you may find the career to be soul-sucking. One thing I will say about a major like this is even though you may find the work to be tedious and incredibly boring. It is high paying and has low unemployment, so taking this as a career path will enable you to do all your fun hobbies and activities during your free time without having to worry about monetary issues.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1588793474, "upvotes": 3}, "fpoy3ze": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ge9td9/im_lost/fpoy3ze/", "text": "Don't be sorry, you're not bothering by posting. This subreddit welcomes posts like this, it's the whole point of it :) You're not wasting your time with art if you enjoyed it.\n\nChoosing a major will not lock you into a career path forever, it's surprisingly flexible as it's moreso about experience. For example, I know a biochem major who ended up as a journalist because he loved it so much yet he had no degree in journalism, just experience. I'm not saying you can pick a major and it doesn't matter, but it's not the end of the world and your experiences outside the classroom are just as important.\n\nYour skill in art will be surprisingly useful when you combine it with something else. Who do you think draws all of the anatomical models in biology books? Or designs complex enzyme reactions for biochem books? We need people who are passionate about art in more fields then you would think :) \n\nYou didn't really list what you like so I can't help a lot, but I'll suggest some that might be interesting: anthropology (medical, cultural, biological), journalism (pick a specific subset), marketing (not super familiar with this but I think you can do a lot of digital designs with this). Don't go into something if you won't enjoy it at least a little bit.\n\nEdit: totally forgot about my friend's boyfriend who is an art major and wants to work in video game design. Think about animation or something. Also coding is a very good skill to learn even if it's not a lot of coding", "author": "AceOfRhombus", "created": 1588792654, "upvotes": 1}, "fpmicu8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ge9td9/im_lost/fpmicu8/", "text": "Dear friend, \n\nToday I thought about all the good things in life and how far I\u2019ve come from the previous adventure I went on. Friend, life is hard. I\u2019m having a really hard time figuring out what I want to do. I really want to do something with animals, or possibly save peoples lives, but everyone keeps pressuring me to become a doctor or something in the Medical field. \n\n(I wrote that above so you know that you\u2019re not alone in this. Someone else, me, is in the same position as you are)\n\nFor me personally, I\u2019ve chosen a major that sets me up for pre med, (biology society and the environment). It sounds like you\u2019re conflicted with financial security and doing what you want to do.\nMy advice to you, friend, is to go out and get experience. You\u2019ll never figure out what you want to do if you don\u2019t experience anything. Go volunteer, shadow, research. Don\u2019t settle on a major because that major could change, don\u2019t settle on a career because that career could change, don\u2019t settle at all because you could change. Expect the best and prepare for the worst. It\u2019s okay to want two different things and it\u2019s okay to feel lost. You\u2019ve made it half way, now you just have to find yourself or wherever it is you\u2019re going. \n\nEverything will be okay.", "author": "banannapancakes123", "created": 1588733722, "upvotes": 2}}}
