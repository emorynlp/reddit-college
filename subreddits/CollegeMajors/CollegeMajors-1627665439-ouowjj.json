  "title:": "Applied Mathematics Vs Mathematics Major",
  "text": "Hi, I am a rising senior getting ready to apply to colleges and trying to figure out which major to go with. I\u2019ve always loved math and from what I\u2019ve read up on applied math seems like a better route but I am someone with no computer science experience whatsoever. \n\nAny information would be helpful such as comparing the two majors, sharing experiences in one or both of the majors, or just sharing any knowledge on maybe even other majors that may work better. \n\nThank you <3",

I had no programming experience when I started, but it can be developed and it's fun.\n\nThe previous responses pretty much outline the differences between each.  Applied somewhat prepares you for a career in industry, while the latter prepares you for graduate research/academia.",

      "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a Math PhD Student! \n\nSo, with either major, you\u2019re going to be taking the same classes at first which can help you pick which you\u2019d rather do. A math major is more proof-oriented and abstract while an applied math major is more computation-oriented. You\u2019ve probably been mostly exposed to computation-oriented mathematics so far in high school but both are really fun and engaging.\n\nI am able to answer questions if you have any but this is sort of my short answer!",

Do you want to do high level math and maybe become a mathematician or do you want to have a job at a company? It's okay if you don't have computer science experience, a lot of the times they'll teach you from the beginning.",
