  "title:": "Help my cousin choose a major",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this, but my cousin (17M) is having trouble deciding which field/major he wants to go into. He's told me that he's content doing anything (humanities, engineering, pre-med, etc.) and has yet to find a passion. He doesn't know anyone in college besides me (although I just graduated) so I wanted to help him out. I have a list of questions that he's written that I've sent to a bunch of my friends to answer, but I'm worried I don't have a varied enough group (most people graduated from my same college in a STEM field). I was hoping that I could post them here and get some responses from people at different schools in different majors to give him the best and most widespread information. I would really appreciate if anyone could help me/him out! Here are the questions:\n\n1. What is/are your major(s)/minor(s)?\n2. What made you interested in that major/field?\n3. What do you like the least and most about your major(s)?\n4. What was your undergraduate academic experience like as that major(s)? (i.e. how were your classes? how important was your GPA for jobs? did you feel like you had a good work/life balance?)\n5. What do you want to do with your major(s)? (i.e. career-wise/academically)\n6. Did you always know you wanted to do that? How did you figure it out?\n7. Do you think getting your degree in that major(s) was worth it?\n8. Would you have done it differently if you could?\n9. Any advice for someone who is interested in your major(s)?",

      "text": "1: majors/minors: computer science\n\n2: Took some beginner CS classes on a whim, enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it, plus you can make your own programs and stuff, so it has a lot of applications.\n\n3: What I like the most is that you can make your own projects. In particular, I am interested in front end development because you can make cool looking websites. What I dislike the most is that the assignments can often be very stressful and sometimes it can feel like you have no idea where to start.\n\n4: The workload was on the heavy side, but it also took me a while to get used to the major, since I switched from a humanities degree. GPA is somewhat important for jobs, but it's really your experiences, interviewing skills, and overall ability that's way more important.\n\n5: Career wise, I want to get a job in web development. Academically, finish my last year and graduate, lol.\n\n6: I knew I made the right choice switching to computer science after my first internship, which I really enjoyed and made me a lot more comfortable programming.\n\n7: Yes. I enjoy the work and it leads to well paying jobs.\n\n8: I would have started programming earlier (before college). I also would have done more outside work when I first switched and made sure I took it a bit more seriously. \n\n9: Start making your own projects early, start interview prep early, and you will reap the benefits your senior year.",

      "text": "1. English\n\n2. I\u2019ve always loved books, writing, and exploring the human condition. \n\n3. What I liked the least: Everyone looks down on you for majoring in English. People constantly ask you \u201cWhat are you going to do with that?\u201d and look skeptical even if you have a real answer, because conventional wisdom is that English majors end up food service (never mind that statistics don\u2019t back this up). STEM and business majors tell you all about how difficult and superior their majors are, and then a few minutes later they tell you they could never make it through all the reading and writing you do. \ud83d\ude44 What I liked the most: Everything else! I loved the classes, the assignments, and especially meeting other people who shared a love for books and creative streak. The creative writing courses helped me learn how to put myself out there, which has helped me in pretty much every aspect of life since then.\n\n4. At my college, English classes (aside from the basic writing course all students had to take) were just as difficult as the STEM classes I took when I thought I would study engineering. They were much more interesting though, at least for me. IDK if GPA mattered much for my job prospects \u2014 writing samples, a marketing internship, and connections with other people who\u2019d worked at the student newspaper were much more important for me.\n\n5. Academically, I wanted to further develop my writing skills and learn more about peoples\u2019 experiences, thoughts, and stories through books. Career-wise, I mostly just wanted to find a job that involved the written word \u2014 either marketing communications, PR, editing, tech writing, or journalism. I ended up in marketing.\n\n6. I started out planning to study engineering or something medicine-related, but after taking mostly STEM courses for a while and being part of relevant extracurriculars, I realized I didn\u2019t want to do that for the next few years, let alone the rest of my working life. I started looking into career options for different majors and found out that English majors had better prospects than I thought, at least if you\u2019re intentional about getting extra skills/experience outside your major. I decided to take a risk, study what I loved, and do everything I could outside of class to boost my post-graduation job prospects.\n\n7. Yes! No question.\n\n8. I might have taken more computer programming/coding and design coursework so I could do more website backend stuff. Not a huge regret, since I can and have learned some of that outside of school.\n\n9. Try out whatever sounds interesting, both in courses and extracurriculars (starting with the more intensive/career-specific fields if any of those appeal to you, but you don\u2019t need to limit yourself to those). If you find something you love, go for it! Don\u2019t listen to haters. Just make sure you look into career options and supplement your degree with skill-building extracurriculars and at least one relevant internship \u2014 this goes for all majors, including the \u201cpractical\u201d ones. Also, if you have any interest in STEM fields, try those out first since they tend to have the most prerequisites and requirements. It\u2019s usually easier to switch from STEM to other fields than from other fields to STEM.",
