It\u2019s still something that sounds interesting to me, however I really want something that pays better. As a teacher I\u2019d basically be making what I already make now at Amazon (teachers are very underpaid in Oklahoma) and I don\u2019t want to study for 4 years just to make the same amount of money I already make. However, I do want to work with kids, preferably between the ages of like 4 and 8. What can I major in, and do for a living, that fits this description but pays good? Any special types of teaching jobs that actually pay good money? I\u2019m really not wanting to make salary either and would like to make at least $25 an hour or so.", "author": "Burtonsbackhurtin", "created": 1632521820, "retrieved": 1632956910, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he64wmi": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/putu8t/i_wanna_do_something_with_kids_but_what/he64wmi/", "text": "Check out the Occupational Outlook Handbook,  [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)\n\nSome areas to look at are; healthcare- speech pathologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist (they work in schools too) community and social service- school counselor, there's a librarian section too.\n\nThe book gives a good break out of education required, job descriptions, salary range, etc.. \n\nHope it helps!", "author": "bluejazzblue", "created": 1632535679, "upvotes": 2}}}
