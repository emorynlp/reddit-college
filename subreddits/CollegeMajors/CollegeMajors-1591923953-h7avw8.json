  "title:": "Any advice for an upcoming sophomore who has no idea what she wants to major in and is kind of depressed about it?",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new to this sub, this is a long post. TLDR at bottom.\n\nI'm an upcoming sophomore at a SUNY University. All I know is I want to go to law school. I'm currently a medieval studies and history double major with minors in business and english. I'm keeping medieval studies, because I know that I love that, but I want to do a double major and possibly a minor because I'll have too much time on my hands otherwise (I've already got 58 credits after this summer going into my second year, I want to graduate in 4 years because I don't want to rush anything, especially because of how I'm feeling currently). I love history, but i do not feel like my schools history major is the right path for me. It's hard to explain, but it just does not feel like a good fit, even though I love history.\n\nI'm kind of a jack of (not all) but a lot of trades. I have a lot of interests. Like I said, I'm planning on going to law school, so the \"practicality\" of the major does not matter to me. I'm interested in many things. I'll list some classes I've taken so you can understand what I have taken and what you might suggest that I take, and I'll also explain some thing I KNOW I'm interested in and some things that I MIGHT be interested in but don't know because I haven't taken a class. Also, I'll mention the majors I have looked at, with the ones I have considered the most bolded.\n\nClasses I have taken:\n\n* **Africana Studies**\\- I have taken two classes, both introductory, one on African American history and one on just African history. I like learning about human rights and the long road that Black Americans have had to follow to reach equality, one that they still follow today. I would like to take a more in depth class about some of the things I learned in these classes. I liked the modern aspect of the African history class, such as learning about colonization and modern African countries revolutions. It talked about the iron age and the distance past and I wasn't that interested in that, though.\n* **Medieval Studies-** I have taken a medieval art history course and a medieval/renaissance course through the english department called \"medieval mythbusting\" talking about the myths society has about the medieval/early modern period. I loved both.\n* **Psychology and Sociology:** I took a class on psychology of diversity through my schools counseling psych dept, intro to sociology, and I am currently taking intro to psych. I loved my psych of diversity class, thought sociology was mediocre, and find psych incredibly boring as of so far.\n* **Accounting-** I actually really like accounting, and I am naturally good at it, which I find weird bc I don't like math\n* **History-** ***I love history*****. Especially European and American history of any era.** I do not like world history, though, unless it is about early civilizations or WWII.\n* **Tech-** I did fairly well in one class, but I did not really care for it. It was a business tech class.\n* **Human Biology-** I took this in high school at a local college and liked it a lot. That was about three years ago though, now.\n\nThere are more, but I'm not going to give you an extensive list. I think that is most important.\n\nThe things I know I am interested in:\n\n* like I said, history. I love American and European history. \n* Politics\n* Social Justice \n* Reading and Writing (not saying English because I have not truly taken a real \"English\" class at my school)\n* Law\n* Accounting\n* Medieval studies (this encompasses more than just history, why I am including it)\n\nThings I think I am interested in (but not sure of)\n\n* business in general, especially entrepreneurship and finance\n* Ecology and Environmental Biology\n* Anatomy and Physiology of humans and animals\n* religious history and studies, especially of the three main monotheist religions\n* criminal justice and disaster preparedness\n* public health (my mom works in this and the whole coronavirus response by the government has interested me)\n\nThings I am **not** interested in:\n\n* math in general (except for finance and accounting)\n* computer science\n* physics \n* chem\n* engineering\n* psychology and sociology\n\nMajors that I am interested in:\n\n* **Accounting**\n* Art History\n* **Business Administration, with a concentration in entrepreneurship and finance**\n* Criminal Justice\n* **English**\n* **History (currently this, but like I said it doesn't feel like the right fit for several reasons)**\n* **an interdisciplinary major where I choose my own major**\n* **political science**\n* public health\n* gender studies\n\nI wanted to create my own major as a \"legal studies\" major but the pre-law advisor told me this was a bad idea. She said law schools don't like that. From what I've heard from other people, though, is that law schools care about stats and not your major.\n\nAny advice about what my next step is would be great. I know this is a crap ton of info I'm throwing at you. My other option is to go to CC instead to figure out what i want but because of the amount of credits I have I don't know if this is possible. I don't think i would take a semester off, it would pretty much be go to CC or push through at this school. I don't think I want to transfer. I don't think it's the school, I think I just have no idea what I want. I have a scholarship so that's why I think I wouldn't take time off, I would either go to CC or stay here.\n\nTLDR; I have a lot of interests. I want to go to law school, so practicality of major doesn't matter to me. Currently a history/medieval studies double major with minors in business and english, but i don't think I want to do history. I have looked mostly into the majors of business, english, accounting, creating my own \"legal studies\" major, and political science. I have no idea what I want to do. Please give me advice!\n\nThank you for reading this if you got here!",

      "text": "Becoming a Lawyer and getting into Law School is a plan but it is far from solid. You need to analyze your situation and think to yourself, \"What happens to me if I don't get into Law School?\" If your only backup plan is a semi-useless history major you could be in deep water if this possibility becomes reality. \n\nOne thing that google searching \"I want to become a lawyer\" or \"How much does a lawyer make\" doesn't tell you is that the big firms that give those stereotypical *large* lawyer salaries only hire from T14 law schools. It's not just about getting accepted into law school it's about getting accepted into the *right* law school. Going to a T50 or T100 law program will still cost upwards of over $100k in debt but won't qualify you for those large salaries and career growth opportunities. So, unless you can comfortably rely on getting into a top law program or somehow get a full ride at some lesser school then it can often times not be worth the amount of debt your would acquire. \n\nEnglish/History/Poli/etc. all fall under the same social science umbrella that is highly competitive and doesn't qualify you for a desired position in your field of study without getting a PhD preferably or a masters at minimum. Accounting is an incredibly viable backup plan for if you don't get into a solid Law Program as the major is pretty easy, you get qualifications, and is highly in demand. If you can or have already passed college trig/algebra then you have already exceeded the math expectations for an Accounting major.",

I think its safe to say that if I got a good LSAT and kept my gpa here I could get into a T14, and if I didn't get a good LSAT but kept my GPA like this (splitter) I could probably get into a T50 right? I'm taking accounting right now and I think that's my backup. I really like it and its easy for me.",

I\u2019m your same year so I don\u2019t have tons of advice, but I\u2019d say your second major should build skills that your Medieval Studies major wont, and should be something you feel you\u2019ll excel in.",
