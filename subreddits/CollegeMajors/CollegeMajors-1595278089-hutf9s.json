Hopefully this is an appropriate place to ask this question, if not I apologize. I want to pursue a creative career, but I'm not sure what track to go down. I'm open to suggestions. \n\nAbout me: \n\n* In High School I got certificates in graphic design, Photoshop and InDesign. \n* I started college in 2006 majoring in film. Fearful of my career prospects, I switched majors and earned a bachelor of science degree in Criminology in 2011... but law enforcement didn't pan out and I pursued other paths. \n* From 2019-2020 year I got certificates in Digital Painting, Digital Design and Graphics, Advanced InDesign and Illustrator. \n* I made live-action shorts that got better over time from around 2006-2013. I made animations of increasing quality sporatically from the early 2000's, the most recent being this year. I'm working on a comic right now and thanks to certificates in digital art I have a decent amount of that sort of thing too. \n* I recently left the military in May of this year after five years of service. Since I used up my federal student loans on my first degree, my plan is to pursue a higher degree with the G.I. Bill. \n\nI tried the \"safe\" path of just working for money, and I found  life to be hollow and unfulfilling. Honestly, I'm fine with a modest salary - it would be a dream job just making a living doing something I love. \n\nI enjoy all forms of art, from comics to drawing to animation to photography to film to multimedia/graphic/digital design. I enjoy all of them and am decent to good at all of them, I just don't know which area I should specialize in for a degree. \n\nI've already been rejected by one university (UCLA) for film, so now I'm reevaluating myself and what I should pursue. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.", "author": "Rickswan", "created": 1595278089, "retrieved": 1632956901, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fypmgya": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hutf9s/what_creative_masters_degree_should_i_pursue/fypmgya/", "text": "I attended Columbus College of Art and Design this past year and based on my experience, I think you would do phenomenally at an art school but keep in mind that it would be no easy task. \nBased on what you wrote I think another thing to put some time into and consider is what it is that you wouldn\u2019t mind doing for the rest of your life. Keep in mind that nothing will stay the same! Variety is a big part of life, you will come across many different opportunities!\n\nHowever, please keep in mind that this is a huge decision, any path you decide to take will require you to put all you into it. What the real world doesn\u2019t tell you is that you need to bust your ass to be happy, it takes A LOT of time and heavy consideration to know exactly what it is that will bring you to success. \n\nI notice that many people\u2019s biggest problems is what they are willing to put up with in the real world when jobs come around. A lot of people switch majors because of work loads, stress, and the inability to identify what they want out of their future career. \nIf you have had a part time job before, think about what you did and didn\u2019t enjoy about it. What aspects of it made you do the job in the first place? What goals did you want to fulfill? What keeps you going?\nTake some time to think about what it is you want to do for possibly the rest of your life- what would you be willing to put up with? How much money are you looking to make? What kind of environment do you work best in? \n\nTo be successful is to know how manage your time and priorities correctly. I highly suggest buying a planner and write out a day to day schedule for yourself. Think about what it is that you can take care of in the next few days or weeks and put that on your to-do list!\nMake small short term goals for yourself to build yourself up to your long term goals. \nI like to think about it like I\u2019m rewarding myself, for each small task and day to day responsibly I get through, I get one step closer to what I will achieve. \n\nTake your time and be as well rounded as possible, future employers and life in general can slap you in the face with all the problems it has, the best way to combat that is to learn and adapt as much as possible. Take your time to learn and understand the world around you because as unpredictable as the real world is, you can have control over it. You\u2019re happiness and your future depend on how much effort you put into your goals, mindset, and work ethic. Take this time in your life to prioritize your education above everything- but please don\u2019t over exert yourself! \n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what it is you want to pursue, I made a thread with helpful links that might be able to help you identify what you want to hone in on!\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gmugf8/helpful_links_to_majorcollegepersonality_quizzes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nIf you happen to decide on art school, don\u2019t hesitate to message me if you have any questions. It was a path that took a lot of energy and serious time management. It was worth every second to meet people, gain the skills and learn to look forward to what was going to happen as each day passed.\n\n\nNow to conclude this already long and preachy response, I want to offer you something that I learned on my own that not many people come to understand- Don\u2019t stress yourself out, take mental breaks to help yourself do better and think about how you might be able to help yourself destress and find healthy outlets in hobbies to help you through tough times. Take your time and do your very best to get through the hard times, as they will be the building blocks for your future. If you feel like you have everything figured out, that\u2019s awesome, keep doing what you\u2019re doing!", "author": "holciamp", "created": 1595287563, "upvotes": 3}}}
