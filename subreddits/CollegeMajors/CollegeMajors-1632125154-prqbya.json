I\u2019m excited, but I can\u2019t decide on what to major in and need help", "text": "I currently work as an operator at a water treatment plant. They\u2019re offering to pay tuition as long as it can be seen beneficial to myself and the company. \n\nMy biggest hesitation is that I\u2019ve never been great at school, but the work itself doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s more just not being very good at the fact it requires a lot of memorization. I\u2019m mechanically inclined, however I can problem solve because the tools are in front of me. I have a hard time with say naming conventions, fact memorizations, etc because there\u2019s no tools but to straight up study/remember materials. \nI\u2019m not necessarily bad at math even, but I need to have formulas in front of me to work through it because without them I can\u2019t remember what number goes where on even a algebraic level. \n\nThe two majors I\u2019m looking into is either a engineering degree, or a business degree. I haven\u2019t decided which is better, but for those of you in school currently I\u2019d like to know what you see as differences and what may be better for me in my situation. \n\nI am looking at maybe eventually getting an Business Analytics or industrial/mechanical engineering degree. \n\nBoth can get approved through my work. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering, about starting small with getting an associates degree and trying that out first to see how I do. This way I can always apply my credits towards a bachelors, if I continue to go through with it. Most if it all jobs within my company do typically require a Bachelors though. \n\nI am also considering computer science, but that\u2019s an abstract interest of mine. Is it possible to minor in something like that? Seems it may roll into either bachelors a bit.", "author": "Rallypig802", "created": 1632125154, "retrieved": 1632958199, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdt5z77": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/prqbya/im_going_to_apply_to_colleges_29m_im_excited_but/hdt5z77/", "text": "I think it really depends on how much you like math.
