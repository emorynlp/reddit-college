Good choice for me?", "text": "A bit about myself. I already have a college degree in visual art. Class of 2019. After college I spent a year serving AmeriCorps helping at-risk teenagers but I didn\u2019t really like that. So I searched around for more jobs and fell into a job as a cake decorator and it\u2019s my favorite job I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately, and I think I should dip my toe into business classes because it seems like it\u2019d be good to know, no matter what I do. If I want to promote my art\u2014that\u2019s business. If I want to open a bakery\u2014that\u2019s business. If I ever am pinched to get a job\u2014business skills are more marketable than an art degree. And I found out the company I work for will pay my tuition if I attend one of the schools it has that program with.\n\nSo the question: should I do it? I don\u2019t want to spread myself to thin by working full-time, getting another college degree, trying to build my art career, and a social life. So I want to think about it more before committing. \n\nWhat can I expect classes in a business program to be like? Do you think it\u2019ll fit in with some of the other things I\u2019ve talked about?
