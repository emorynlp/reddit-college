      "text": "I recommend [ONET](https://www.onetonline.org/) it\u2019s not perfect but you can spend a while looking at different careers. There\u2019s even an interest quiz that will tell you careers based on what you are interested in. There\u2019s also a ton of filters you can use to look at jobs with specific characteristics. Although the website won\u2019t tell you what to major in, you can just research the job a little bit to find out.",

      "text": "I don't know if this counts but regarding specific career paths, I highly recommend using [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov) to learn about certain careers. **These days, it is important to choose a career in which is in high demand, what you like and will also provide you a decent living.** Once you choose a career, try to research on what major it relates to.\n\nI do know there is this Youtube channel ran by a guy named Shane Hummus in which I highly recommend for you to check out. He provides financial, career, and college advice, And unfortunately, these days your major does count as there is a very competitive job market due to the fact that more students are attending college these days. You need to choose a major that is *marketable*. You also need to debate on the fact on whether or not if you want to go to Grad School as it is required for some majors. Part of this is because the bachelor's degree may be oversaturated as many people major in it. For example: Psychology, social work, etc. Of course, it is not everything, but it does increase your chances quite a bit. Internships, networking, scholarships, etc are also essential.",
