He provides financial, career, and college advice, And unfortunately, these days your major does count as there is a very competitive job market due to the fact that more students are attending college these days. You need to choose a major that is *marketable*. You also need to debate on the fact on whether or not if you want to go to Grad School as it is required for some majors. Part of this is because the bachelor's degree may be oversaturated as many people major in it. For example: Psychology, social work, etc. Of course, it is not everything, but it does increase your chances quite a bit. Internships, networking, scholarships, etc are also essential.", "author": "Superb-Disk-8202", "created": 1624054439, "upvotes": 1}, "h295174": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o2vxqy/should_there_be_website_were_students_can_view/h295174/", "text": "!remindme 2 hours", "author": "ZaWarudo15", "created": 1624049968, "upvotes": 1}, "h28ltxt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o2vxqy/should_there_be_website_were_students_can_view/h28ltxt/", "text": "As far as viewing *every* possible career paths for every major--that is probably something you will only get in a very general sense and it likely will not be too comprehensive.", "author": "qwertyrdw", "created": 1624041280, "upvotes": 8}, "h28j5xj": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o2vxqy/should_there_be_website_were_students_can_view/h28j5xj/", "text": "Usually a school will have a list of all the majors they offer, so no I wouldn't say that it's hard to get info on majors.
