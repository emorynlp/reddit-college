For Archeology, at least if you\u2019re based in the United States, there an entire private sector that is required under federal law where the majority of archaeologists, including myself, work. So as long as there are projects that fit the criteria, archaeology legally must occur. This is fortunate for those of us who want to work in the field! \n\nAs for rewarding, that entirely depends on what you want to get out of the field. What is it you\u2019d want? Also, what area of archaeology would you want to focus on? Some areas are easier to break into than others without an undergraduate degree in Anthropology. Either way, there will be a lot of prep work to prepare you for a Masters in Archaeology, as there are a lot of preliminary things most archaeology graduate students have from their undergraduate days. Things such as the general history and goals of the field, excavation techniques, survey techniques, the Prehistory and history of the area they wish to work, the general artifact classes and how to identify and analyze them, etc.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1585242507, "upvotes": 1}}}
