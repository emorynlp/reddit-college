      "text": "From what I\u2019m gathering, you seem to admire plants on a visual appeal level, which is perfectly fine, but Plant Science is more based on Agriculture and Genetics. While that certainly  means you do love plants, you seem to really not be engaged with anything informative about them, which would make a Plant Science major difficult. \n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019re very engaged with information pertaining to history, which is a great sign. History will require plenty of discussion, research, and reading at its core, and you\u2019re already halfway there by having a genuine interest in one of those aspects. I personally think that your choice should be history.\n\nNow, the Plant Science major may have better prospects at the bachelors level, but if that\u2019s not your thing academically, that\u2019s perfectly okay. If you\u2019re genuinely engaged and stimulated in history, then by all means go for that. ",

Are you in college yet?\n\nPicking a subject you're interested in is a great place to start but also make sure you are ok with the likely career paths the major equips you for. Maybe consider Environmental Studies, which combines disciplines like earth sciences and biology with social science",
