  "text": "Quick background info: Currently 29 y.o.\n\nhave an Associates of applied science (automotive tech)\n\nExperience in teaching/coaching for about 7 years (2-3 of which was managing a student base at a gym)\n\nSales experience of about 2 years (the last 6-8 months was as a store manager/sales, albeit a very niche/small retail store. Only had 1 employee other than me really)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrying to decide if it's worth it to go back to school and get a bachelors to get a better paying job.  \nare business degrees worth it at all? i've been looking at them but have also been told they're mostly a waste of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were in my position, what ideas for degrees/schooling would you recommend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any advice!",

      "text": "It depends on your interests. What do you want to do, and which classes did you like best when you were in school? Are there any particular subjects or jobs that interest you?\n\nIf you have sales experience, I\u2019m guessing you might like marketing \u2014 in which case, you COULD study marketing or business, but liberal arts majors (or applying for internships/entry level marketing jobs with no degree at all!) could work too. Employers will care more about your experience than your specific major. \n\nI work for a marketing agency, and I have coworkers who studied English, economics, photography/design, culinary arts, and plenty of other less-obviously-related fields. Not everyone here has a bachelor\u2019s or even associate\u2019s degree \u2014 it definitely helps, but you might be able to get into a good field without one if you can find a way to build skills and get experience, like an internship or entry-level part-time role.\n\nAlso, if you want to work in tech, I\u2019ve been told that boot camps are a great way to get into the industry! Those aren\u2019t nearly as expensive as a bachelor\u2019s degree.",

          "text": "Thank you! Honestly marketing was one of the ones i was leaning towards that i might enjoy.\n\nIs it common to hire someone in an entry level marketing position that has no actual experience in marketing then? What generally do entry level positions do on a day-to-day?  \n\n\nLet's say i did want to go that route, would you recommend a degree for that specific path? If i don't, will it hinder moving up past a point?  \n\n\nI have thought about getting tech certs as well, i have a number of friends that are in tech/IT/CiS. But i've done a little bit and didn't want to go that path myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you again for the response!",

              "text": "It\u2019s pretty common to start with an internship. Sometimes they pay a low salary/hourly rate, but those are more competitive to get into than the ones that pay nothing. Fortunately, the ones that don\u2019t pay tend to only be 10-20 hours a week, so you can usually do one on the side while working full time or studying. If you do get a bachelor\u2019s degree, a lot of colleges will let you get college credit for an internship, so you can basically do an internship in place of a course.\n\nAlso, some entry-level marketing jobs have a large sales component. Beyond that, job responsibilities vary a lot from company to company. You might already qualify! Don\u2019t be discouraged if the job ad says you need a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 some employers will accept relevant experience instead of a degree, and you have that already.",

              "text": "A degree will help for sure, but not having one won\u2019t be a dealbreaker for a lot of employers, especially at the individual contributor level (i.e. not high-level management). The degree you choose doesn\u2019t matter that much for marketing, but if you\u2019re very sure that\u2019s what you want to do, you might as well go for a marketing degree if you decide to go back to school.
