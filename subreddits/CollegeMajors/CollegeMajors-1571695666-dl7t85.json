I\u2019m currently studying Biological Systems Engineering (genera route) and then taking the FE exam. I\u2019m good at it, I don\u2019t really mind it I\u2019m not that passionate about it (I feel like I\u2019m too extroverted, everyone else in my major seems so introverted, I love working with people) but I like the security of an engineering degree plus I believe being a woman will help job security and I love solving problems. I feel like lately I\u2019ve been really iffy about my major, I am also interested in business. I\u2019ve always been intrigued by being my own boss, being a leader, being a manager/boss so I planned on getting my MBA on top of my engineering degree. But I was looking at the business school and they have such cool degrees such as \u201cFinance, Investment, and Banking\u201d and \u201cInternational Business\u201d (this sticks out to me because I LOVE traveling. And also even Real estate. I\u2019m kind of babbling, but would you say a bachelor in engineering or a bachelor in one of these business degrees? I would say they are both pretty \u201csafe\u201d. I just am afraid I\u2019m going to be making the wrong decision?", "author": "queenbean2278", "created": 1571695666, "retrieved": 1632848160, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f4ocqnb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dl7t85/whats_a_better_bachelors_engineering_or_business/f4ocqnb/", "text": "Get the Engineering degree and minor in business.
