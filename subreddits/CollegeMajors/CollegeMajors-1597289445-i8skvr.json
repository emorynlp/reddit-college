  "text": "As of right now I\u2019m heading into computer engineering this fall. In reality I don\u2019t think I can handle the math and science that comes with it. I would say I\u2019m not the best when it comes to math and science but I really want to pursue a career/major with computers. \n\nRecently I have discovered that I like the idea of behind the scenes of movies and tv shows. I was searching for majors that deal with editing and designing on computers for video production. I found the major film and video production but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I really want to change to or look into. Maybe even animations or video designs I\u2019m not sure. Any ideas or suggestions about what I could possibly pursue that deals with computers and film/video production.",
