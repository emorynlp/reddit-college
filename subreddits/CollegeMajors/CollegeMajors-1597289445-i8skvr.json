In reality I don\u2019t think I can handle the math and science that comes with it. I would say I\u2019m not the best when it comes to math and science but I really want to pursue a career/major with computers. \n\nRecently I have discovered that I like the idea of behind the scenes of movies and tv shows. I was searching for majors that deal with editing and designing on computers for video production. I found the major film and video production but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I really want to change to or look into. Maybe even animations or video designs I\u2019m not sure. Any ideas or suggestions about what I could possibly pursue that deals with computers and film/video production.", "author": "Washja3", "created": 1597289445, "retrieved": 1632956964, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"g1ctigb": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i8skvr/computer_major_uncertainty/g1ctigb/", "text": "What about information technology?
