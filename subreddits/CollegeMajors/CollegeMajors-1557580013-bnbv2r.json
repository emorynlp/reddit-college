My career plans are flexible but I\u2019ve always been artistic and visually oriented so I was interested in a creative career. This past semester I took some prereq courses for my major, art history and 3D design, and it got me rethinking my major. I LOVED the classes, but my 3D professor was talking to me and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s pushing me away from art, he really likes my work and is super enthusiastic about my ideas, but he seems to think I\u2019m more analytical and would enjoy pursuing a social science of some kind. Then I enjoyed my art history class and did so much better in it than I anticipated that my professor said twice that I should be an art history minor. So there\u2019s kind of an extra incentive to switch; for some stupid reason I can\u2019t minor in art history as an art major. \n\nSo basically I\u2019m thinking, I don\u2019t necessarily need a degree in graphic design to get a graphic design job if I have a strong portfolio. If I were to switch to sociology or psychology and keep art & art history as minors, I could have more flexibility to pursue graduate study and research and still fall back on design if plans change. \n\nSo my main concern is that I\u2019m not sure, if I decide to switch, whether I would prefer sociology or psychology and which would align better with my goals. I\u2019m definitely more introverted and socially anxious, but I\u2019ve had enough customer service experience where I feel pretty comfortable working with people in more relaxed and intimate settings and don\u2019t feel drained. I like the idea of being able to help or teach people, but I\u2019d prefer to not work closely with young kids. I enjoy writing and research; I really liked biology, environmental science, anthropology, geography etc classes. I like learning about different people and cultures on a societal level but I also enjoy studying cognition, perception, and learning on an individual level. \n\nIdeally, I\u2019d be able to find some intersection of art and social science, but it\u2019s fine if one takes a backseat to the other or becomes more of a passion that doesn\u2019t directly tie into my career. I\u2019m an INFP and I think my holland code is something like AIR or w/e. \n\nAlso please don\u2019t tell me to not major in either, I know they are popular majors and I know that none of my interests are particularly lucrative lol but I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of finding a really rewarding path and I\u2019m just kind of stuck on how to continue. I\u2019d like to decide soon so I can register for an intro class this summer and be on track to make a decision by the fall semester. I\u2019m not *that* late in the game and it\u2019s not the end of the world if I delay my graduation a bit but I\u2019d like to not waste more time and money than necessary", "author": "puffy-jacket", "created": 1557580013, "retrieved": 1632848284, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"en4f1md": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bnbv2r/thinking_about_switching_from_art_to_psych_vs_soc/en4f1md/", "text": "If you're interested in art and social sciences, look into UX design.
