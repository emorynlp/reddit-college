I\u2019m currently looking into the nursing major, sonography and medical laboratory technician. \n\nI go to a community college right now with a general education major but I\u2019ve been taking random classes trying to figure out what I want to do and just found out last semester I\u2019ll try working towards nursing which I have and now this semester I\u2019m looking into medical laboratory technician or sonography. I like lab work and helping people but I know nursing will be tough so I\u2019m viewing it as a fall back plan. I have to transfer schools this semester so I have to figure out which major would be beneficial to the future I want.
