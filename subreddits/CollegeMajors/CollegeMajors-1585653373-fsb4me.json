  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m currently on a gap year and I\u2019m still having doubts about what to major in. I wanted to do an internship or course that would\u2019ve made it easier to choose between careers,however, I stepped back due to the corona virus situation going on.\n\nMy interests include business and IT. But for some reason,I keep thinking about whether degrees related to this will become boring at some point; I do want something practical and creative but they don\u2019t pay well and most of the universities in my country don\u2019t have creative majors/minors. I do really want to learn about criminology/Basic law/politics but i fear that this would make the burden even worse and more heavier than it already is. Media management/ Journalism is also an option but I\u2019m quite not sure how I can pursue it without an proper idea of the careers in this path. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019m sure about is that I will hopefully take up MBA as my graduate program.\n\nI am also taking a course online for free on computer science to broaden my knowledge since I have nothing to do these days but I would love to know about your experience with these similar interests and suggestions about what I should do about this mess.",

      "text": "Just my 2 cents, degrees in management are useless. Nobody owes anyone a management position out of college. IT is hot and will probably always have value. Wish I coulda got more interested in computer science when I was young. Take advice from people actually employed in the field not kids on reddit!",

But thank you for this advice,I did take suggestions from people who graduated with the same degree! I am trying to get into programming/networking so hopefully I can figure out what I should major in.",
