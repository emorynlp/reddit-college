I want work towards another degree as well so I can go into it right after. My dream is to either expand upon my already existing  degree or  start anew into a different path. I have so many ideas for myself, some that personally I know can not happen . I hated business but I currently see it has a essential degree.\n\n I wanted to become a Specials Education teacher with a field for deaf or mute children ( I am learning sign language). Professional Business writer was another dream of mine. This is all good and dandy but my issue is that finding a job that pays above minimum wage that is available everywhere is hard. Being over qualified or under qualified  can out you at an advantage. \n\nWhere i live is pretty small so although I want to move; If I end up back ( like many others do) I want to be secure on my future. Also as an added touch, where I live is not as touch with technology as other places. So getting certain degrees does not not change your paycheck or job status in no significant way.", "author": "Deadfish234", "created": 1608168646, "retrieved": 1632847086, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gg3i84j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ken3tz/what_degree_should_i_work_towards/gg3i84j/", "text": "https://youtu.be/AkZw8KOLWKI\nWatch this and good luck", "author": null, "created": 1608170374, "upvotes": 1}}}
