I know that at most colleges you don't have to declare your major until your sophomore year so I am trying not to stress too much but I was wondering if anyone had any advice about double majoring. I have a friend who is and the more I think about it the more it interests me. Is it worth it? Does it help you in the long run? Do you even use both of your majors at your current job? I don't want to overwhelm myself with too much work but if it will help me have more job opportunities in the long run then I just might do it.

You\u2019ll also find that unless you go into a specialized job like a STEM field, education, or accounting that your major isn\u2019t really useful for most jobs.
