I've been taking various courses to see which courses interest me to no avail. Recently, I've been thinking I would try to pursue a linguistics degree and become a speech pathologist. However, to become a speech pathologist you need to attend graduate school (which with my low GPA currently, I'm quite worried about). Now, I'm worried that I can't get a decent salary with only a degree in linguistics or are there even any good career options for a linguistics degree.\n\nI appreciate any kind of advice.

Figure out what went wrong, and it's not too late to bounce back!\n\nI may be off the mark here a little, but have you considered majoring in a language instead? Language degrees tend to be easy to double major with (or, well, easier than most) and at the upper levels you can typically find some linguistic aimed courses. I've found that having a degree in another language (even one as common as French) has opened up some doors for me.", "author": "roonilxwaslib", "created": 1566433227, "upvotes": 1}, "exmefey": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ctoobr/need_advice/exmefey/", "text": "Mediocre advice manatee reporting!\n\nI got a linguistics / social psychology major with a TESOL cert thinking I was going to expatriate and teach English.  That\u2019s not what happened.\n\nI worked unarmed security for a while, then leveraged that experience with the psych part of my degree to get a job as, essentially, an orderly on a psych unit.  Now I\u2019m a stay at home parent.\n\nLinguistics is interesting, but it\u2019s not in hot demand.  I don\u2019t have a success story to tell you in the career department (although I have no regrets, we\u2019re well off, and I feel perfectly satisfied with my life, it was my wife\u2019s nursing career that made all that possible, not my bumbling clusterfuckery) but I\u2019ll happily be a cautionary tale about pushing through a degree when you don\u2019t have a solid plan.\n\nIf you do come out with a degree that doesn\u2019t get you the job you want, find a way to get some experience valuable to the job you do want and leverage it that way.  I didn\u2019t major in psych specifically because I had a bad gpa and didn\u2019t want to make an attempt at graduate school.  But had the most fun in my life working in inpatient psychiatry because of a lame security gig I slogged through.  That job paid great and I coulda done it into retirement.", "author": "hawtgawbage", "created": 1566429996, "upvotes": 3}}}
