Previously I was doing a CS major and switched to management but now I was thinking about switching back. I couldn't make up my mind on which I wanted to so I decided maybe I can do both? A bachelor's degree in business management AND computer science. That way I can do both majors I originally wanted and my job field I'm aiming for is as broad.\n\nWhat are your guys advice for me on this? I have no previous work experience in either fields. I also don't mind the time / effort that's going to be put in because the most important thing to me is the best option for me.\n\nThank You for reading and if you have any other questions feel free to mention them so I can answer.", "author": "VIllainLife", "created": 1543979987, "retrieved": 1632848225, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"eb51ae1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/a388pb/business_management_and_computer_science_major/eb51ae1/", "text": "I'm 66, retired IT guy, CIO. I have always believed that management education was crap, so congratulations for discovering that yourself, and so soon. Yes, there are valuable tools taught there, but far fewer, IMNSHO, as in CS. I believe that being a good manager is about people, and people is hard to teach. You learn to deal with folks by being with them. You learn CS/IT skills in class, first, and then of course by doing IRL. my two cents, YMMV.", "author": "prairiedad", "created": 1544019837, "upvotes": 1}}}
