This is my first post here so if anything doesn't make sense or I am doing something wrong, please let me know in the comments. \n\nAnyways, I am a high school student in America currently looking at colleges and trying to decide my major. The two I am looking at now are electrical engineering and computer science. I like these two majors because I enjoy coding and I find components of computers very interesting.\n\nI can already picture you typing out, \"Well, OP, why don't you look at computer engineering? It's like both mushed together!\" And my response is that I don't necessarily want to get a job that involves both disciplines, it is more that I would like to be able to choose. Maybe I want computer science, maybe I want engineering.\n\nSo with that said, I was considering a double major in computer science and electrical engineering. Most of the schools I have toured / attended-open-houses at, have said that is very possible and encouraged, and I think I am capable enough to do that. \n\nBUT. I was looking at the required courses for all three majors at my first choice school, and there is only ONE class in computer engineering, that I would not take if I did a double major with computer science and electrical engineering. Would it be possible to do a triple major? Would that make things a lot more complicated even though it only adds one class? I would be open to taking classes over the summer between years(more than I would already have to with a double major). Do schools even offer triple majors? Are they common?\n\nAs you can see I don't really know anything about this process other than the fact that I would only need to take one extra class. (The school is RPI if that makes any difference).\n\nThanks so much for looking at this!", "author": "throwaway9191925", "created": 1571630336, "retrieved": 1632848162, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f4k0or5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dkuwqx/help_with_computer_based_majors/f4k0or5/", "text": "So double majors are actually not at all uncommon. A major and a minor isn\u2019t either. That\u2019s typically where that extra class would come into play is whenever someone wants a major between two but kinda gives breathing room for sanity and makes it a minor. Now a \u201cminor\u201d as a title doesn\u2019t really change much credentials, it\u2019s relatively the same material just more generalized and covering bases. \nThree majors?.. I can\u2019t say I heard of it. I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s a college or university that offers it. You\u2019d probably have to do a search for it or maybe find a college or university you\u2019re interested and call them to find out more. However I\u2019d advise a double major or major and minor before I\u2019d suggest a triple major, that\u2019s quite the heavy load even if you believe it\u2019s just a single class more. \nBut hey if it\u2019s what you want, and you find it\u2019s entirely eligible- go for it just make sure your head is in the game before you make that time (and money obviously) investment. In the end just call around your potential future schools and speak to their counselors and see what\u2019s what :) \nBest of luck to you!", "author": "HollowRibcage", "created": 1571631280, "upvotes": 1}}}
