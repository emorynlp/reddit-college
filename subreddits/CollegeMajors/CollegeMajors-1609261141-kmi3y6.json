As I'm sure you can tell by the title, I'm considering a major in either History or English. I'm going to be honest, I don't enjoy English a whole lot, but I'm good at it and I do enjoy writing. As for History, I've always enjoyed History and I'm pretty good at it, however, I took an AP History class this year, and I didn't do as well as I would've hoped. My plan is to go to medical or dental school, and I fear that if I pick a major I'm not very good at, then I won't be able to get into a medical or dental school.", "author": null, "created": 1609261141, "retrieved": 1632955599, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ghgsolr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kmi3y6/english_or_history/ghgsolr/", "text": "I would recommend history. History majors require a lot of writing, tons of papers and research, so your skills from English would probably carry over.

You dont even like English so dont go for that. Dont let an AP test decide how good you are at a subject lol. History itself isnt a great bachelors without extra schooling, but since you plan on going to med school yeah youll be alright.", "author": null, "created": 1609279342, "upvotes": 1}}}
