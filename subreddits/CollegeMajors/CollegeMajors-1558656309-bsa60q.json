When I found out I could be an environmental epidemiologist, it was like a dream come true. The more I looked at the job, the more I fell in love with it. But there's one problem: I have no idea what my concentration should be.\n\nI am doing environmental science for undergrad, and epidemiology for my Masters and Doctorates.\n\nI am an incoming freshman, going to an out-of-state school about 5 hours away, because they have a super strong environmental science program, and I fell in love with the city. The girls in my dorm seem really sweet as well. I have family in the city it's in, so I'm not worried about it all that much, but I am super stressed about my concentration. Does my concentration even matter? If so which one would be best?\n\nFor reference, here's a list of concentrations my university offers:\nBiodiversity, Conservation, and Natural Resources\nEarth, Atmosphere, and Geological Resources (my current concentration)\nEngineering Science\nEnvironmental Health\nEnvironmental Policy and Planning\nGeographic and Cartographic Science", "author": "moymeoy", "created": 1558656309, "retrieved": 1632848281, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"eokwoe2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bsa60q/know_my_major_and_career_but_not_concentration/eokwoe2/", "text": "If you want to pursue Environmental Epidemiology, you should shoot for the Environmental Health concentration. \n\nI think your concentration matters, but it\u2019s not a be all end all if you choose the wrong one.
