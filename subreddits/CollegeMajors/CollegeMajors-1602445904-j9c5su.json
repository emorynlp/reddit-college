  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in high school right now and I\u2019m not sure what to major in. I know what I want to do but I\u2019m not too sure what major I have to have in order to go into this field. I plan to help develop neurotechnology. I told my counselor that my major was neuroscience. So should I stay in neuroscience or should I get a degree in something like computer science?",
