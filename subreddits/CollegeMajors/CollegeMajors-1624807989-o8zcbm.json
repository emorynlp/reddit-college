I recently completed my first year at college. During high school, I found the college process and latter years of high school to be daunting and intimidating. I struggled to find honest, free, and accessible resources to help me while I was going through all that. To help current high schoolers avoid the mistakes we made and reach the ridiculous stress levels we experienced, a group of other university students and I have created a YouTube channel sharing our experiences during the college process. Our videos cover the topics of choosing a major, specific major videos, choosing colleges, college applications, dealing with stress and more! If you think this is a resource that can be of help to you - please check our channel out below! If there are any specific topics you would enjoy feel free to drop a comment on our videos or here! Thanks a ton!!!\n\nOur Youtube Channel:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu063irMWPCQz4AkWkdwCBA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu063irMWPCQz4AkWkdwCBA)\n\nInstagram:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/jochi.info/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/jochi.info/?hl=en)", "author": "Jochi_info", "created": 1624807989, "retrieved": 1632846513, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {}}
