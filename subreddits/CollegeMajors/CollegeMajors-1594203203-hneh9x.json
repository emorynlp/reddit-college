That is, it\u2019s the study of motivations and the resulting impacts on quantifiable business metrics like demand, supply, costs, profits,etc. \n\nMacro is about international, national and industry level motivations and impacts; micro is at the company and individual level. Accounting and Finance are complimentary subjects that need to be taken as well, either as undergrad or in MBA. Even the smallest liberal arts schools tend to have Econ majors, some great teachers. So you don\u2019t have to go to a big research university or T10 to get this knowledge.\n\nMostly financial services industry jobs, especially Wall Street, but also others like non profits, education, consulting, etc. \n\nGood luck!", "author": null, "created": 1594234566, "upvotes": 3}, "fxbaiy9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hneh9x/how_is_economics_as_a_major/fxbaiy9/", "text": "Same with gender studies and communication.
