  "text": "Hello, everyone! I hope you are all well, especially considering the state we're all in.\n\nI'll try to keep this brief- I earned a Digital Media degree in 2018 with absolutely no goal in mind. I am now back at university in hopes of building a sustainable and interesting career for myself. I am 25 years old and I feel like I have wasted a lot of valuable time, so I am hoping to make beneficial decisions about my education as to avoid taking up any more. \n\nI am presently double majoring in International Affairs and Philosophy. My aim right now is to attend law school after I earn this degree in hopes of working for an NGO focusing on human rights for refugees and asylum seekers, primarily women or LGBTQ+ individuals from the Arab nation. I feel, at this point, it is necessary to say that I do not prioritize making a lot of money in my career goals. I just want to do work that I am proud of that will help people. I currently am working towards two certificates in International Human Rights and Middle Eastern studies alongside my majors.\n\nHere is my question- I have been thinking a lot lately about my Philosophy degree and wondering exactly what purpose it will serve for me. There is a ton of overlap between the two programs, believe it or not, and I definitely feel like I benefit from the critical thinking skills that come from it. However, I am wondering if I am really benefiting from it in the same way that I would from a different program. I am attempting to tailor my education around my interests and career goals without sacrificing any more of my time. I am considering dropping my Philosophy major to take on more minors that are relevant to what I want to do. Specifically, I would become a sole International Affairs major, earning two certificates in International Human Rights and Middle Eastern Studies, and I would also declare minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Anthropology, and Philosophy. Is this insane? Is it a smarter move to double major? It doesn't seem likely that I could pick up a different major (I would consider Arabic, Anthropology, or Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies) without adding on semesters to my projected graduation date. I just want to do this the right way, this time around. I want to set myself up to achieve my goals. Am I crazy? What should I do?\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this and provide any insight. I am hoping that someone who has experience in this field (Political Science as a whole) would be willing to give me a push in the right direction.",
