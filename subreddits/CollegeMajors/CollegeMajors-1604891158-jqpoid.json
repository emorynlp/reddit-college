I live in northern Colorado, and basically, I\u2019m having a hard time deciding wtf I want to do with my life. \nMy whole life I\u2019ve wanted to be an astrophysicist, but now, I don\u2019t know. I chose the right path (for me), I\u2019m getting a STEM-endorsed degree from my high school... but I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve heard all of the majors I\u2019m interested in are super competitive (physics, math, etc). I took an engineering course (we learned about robots, sustainable energy, and engineering, of course, kind of specified to environmental engineering) and I enjoyed it, but I don\u2019t think I could do it as a career. All of my engineering friends complain about stressful jobs and stuff like that. \nI mean.. I\u2019ve been watching and researching quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, and astrophysics since I was like 11 years old. But I\u2019m anxious to go into that field. It feels very selective and I\u2019m more research-motivated than teaching high schoolers-motivated, haha. \nIf any physics/math/anything related to those fields majors give me some advice?\nHow \u201cdifficult\u201d would you say your course work is?\nHow heavy is the workload?\nHow hard would it be for me to find a job in this sort of field?", "author": "vareenoo", "created": 1604891158, "retrieved": 1632956831, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"gec3wdi": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jqpoid/advice_on_choosing_a_major/gec3wdi/", "text": "This might help:  Try unpacking your interests a bit.  Why astrophysics?  What is it about astrophysics that you find so engaging?  I mean it is a bit esoteric...  It is the astronomy, distant worlds, edge of the universe stuff?  Is it the mathematics of space geometries?  Is it the tools (telescopes, radio telescope arrays, etc.)?  Where does quantum mechanics fit in here? (It is sort of the other end of the spectrum by just a few orders of magnitude.)  Is there a connection here?  Do you really want to conduct research, or just learn about it?  (Nothing wrong with just wanting to learn about something).  If you want to conduct research, have you tried looking up what the actual cutting edge research is?  (You don\u2019t have to understand the math, but read some abstracts from some current published research papers.  Does that fascinate you, bore the hell out of you, or perhaps just seem pointless?\n\nOnce you understand a bit better what it is about this material that is engaging your interest, then you can look to where that might lead you.  Do you like to build? Teach others? Work with your hands? Apply what you know to practical problems (e.g. quantum effects in computer chips as they get smaller?)  Work with tools (e.g. computers).  Do you prefer to play with the mathematics?\n\nIf you are truly research oriented, it is a tough path, Ph.D., post doc fellowship, crunching lots of data, and maybe never find anything terribly exciting.  Perhaps an assistant professorship and trying to publish for tenure. Of course you may be the one to figure out dark matter too.\n\nIf you are more applied, perhaps one of the engineering (mechanical specializing in optics), aerospace (look to the space and satellite industries), material or electical (semiconductors and nanotechnology). \n\nIf you love the math, math and business (finance) quantitative finance, math and statistics (actuary science as the gentleman below suggested), math and business (management science) data analytics.\n\nBest of luck with your search.", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606882505, "upvotes": 2}, "gc44kfd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jqpoid/advice_on_choosing_a_major/gc44kfd/", "text": "Have you considered studying to be an actuary? You can get a STEM degree in math or statistics and take some finance classes along the way! (That is, assuming your school doesn't have an actuarial program in the STEM department). You end up in business, so you don't have to worry about being stuck in a lab or doing research for the rest of your life if that's something that turns you away from physics and other sciences.. \n\nActuaries have amazing job security because they're the people business go to when they're in trouble and its basically one of the most desirable careers in terms of work/life balance. The only downside is that you have to take a TON of tests to become an official actuary, but you'll have plenty of entry level jobs to do before then (with bonuses every time you pass an exam). \n\nLet me know if you'd like more info!
