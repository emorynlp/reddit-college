Generally, an AA is mostly completed by students who wish to transfer to a four year after completing General Education classes such as math, science, social science, art, etc. Within those subjects you can see what different classes/levels there are. You can find these through your local Community College\u2019s catalog. Since you asked for some examples:\n\n\nMath: Business Calculus, Statistics, Calculus, etc.\n\n\nScience: Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, etc.",
