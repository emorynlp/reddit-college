I like both subjects.\n\nBut over the past month or so I've been rethinking if that's really the specialization I want to leave college with. I've never felt particularly passionate about any major subjects in particular, but I liked mine well enough. But now . . . getting close to the end it's made me realize I want to do something . . . creative in the tech sector, or maybe even go to medical school. I don't know why I didn't have this realization sooner, maybe it's just because I wasn't on the verge of leaving the chance to study those things. I'm considering staying to study Computer Science, and get the prerequisites for med school now. \n\nHow would you think about this if you were in my shoes? Would you just finish and take classes part time? Would you take on additional debt?", "author": "Mistral2299", "created": 1618510581, "retrieved": 1632956808, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"guorq4e": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mrkl39/rethinking_college_at_last_minute/guorq4e/", "text": "Do you know what specific careers you are looking for?
