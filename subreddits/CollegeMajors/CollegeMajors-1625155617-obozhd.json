  "text": "Hey guys, I'm an upcoming senior in high-school and college apps start today. I honestly have no idea what I'm passionate in and everything is just so complicated.\n\nI thought about getting into the business field and taking an accounting major in college, but my dad said maybe something to do with marketing might be more beneficial and I might like that.\n\nI decided on taking a major in marketing in something like University of Houston Downtown or University of Houston main campus. \n\nOut of curiosity I checked what reddit had to say about a marketing major and many people's opinions was not to take the marketing major. \n\nAfter hearing many people talk about it, im now uncertain in my decision again and I don't know what to do. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on whether I should take marketing or choose a different major? \n\nThank you",

      "text": "I wouldn't go to college if you do not know what you want to study. Especially if you are taking out student loans. It is far better to take something like a gap year or join the military to find out what kind of things you enjoy. In my opinion you should look for a career you enjoy, that won't be too easy, pays well enough to live a comfortable life, and offers stability. Think long and hard about what kind of job that entails. After doing that I would then try to decide if college is really necessary for that job. If it is then there you go, you have found your major.",

      "text": "Any college you sign up for has \"generals and prerequisites\" a student must take or else they won't be able to pursue another program.\n\nIn my situation when I started college in Fall 2019. I told them I wanted to pursue an AAS in Dental Hygiene but there were barriers blocking me. I had to finish all the gens and prereqs which were very boring. Lucky for me I had a lot of free time and can take 6 courses per semester to wrap up the General Studies degree, I pursued that degree until I felt comfortable exploring more options.\n\nIf a student wanted to pursue nursing, they would have to finish some generals and prereqs. To meet the program requirements Such as Biology 1, Speech, General Math, Basic Chemistry, English 101, Micro Biology, Biology Human Structure and Function 1 & 2, Sociology, General Psychology, Art, Music those are the general studies requirements.\n\nMost college courses can be transferred easily to any university if they accept and are not picky.  If you pass English 101 and 102, you can easily transfer those credits and never have to worry about taking those courses, if you despise English courses, which for me wee a nightmare.\n\nThe college advisor will tell you to focus on the general and prereqs until you find a passion you love.\n\nJust heads up some courses have to be taken sequentially, if you want to take Calculus 3, you have to pass 1 and then 2. Same for Biology you have to Pass English 101 to take most college courses, they have very strict rules on certain courses.\n\nCheers",
