I know I've got plenty of time to figure things out, but I like thinking about paths and possibilities, so humor me.\n\nThe Physics + Math and CS minors path has far less math, but obviously more computer science and programming. The math for the Physics side is Calc 1, 2, and 3 (Multivariable), and Ordinary Diff EQs 1. Add Linear Algebra, and that's the math minor. CS has Computer Science 1 and 2, Data Structures, Discrete Math, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe Mathematical Physics/Pure Math double major path is obviously more math intensive. For physics, it has Calc 1, 2, and 3, ODEs 1, Advanced Calc 1 and 2 (Real Analysis as far as I know), a calculus-based Probability course, and Complex Analysis. Add on top of that Transition to Advanced Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Mathematical Computation, Intro to Rings and Fields, and Intro to Group Theory, and that's everything for the Pure Math. \n\nBoth paths are only 5 or 6 more classes on top of the base major (Physics for the first, Mathematical Physics for the Second), but I think the second has more courses overall. I have AP credits to get me out of most of my gen eds, so I'm not overall worried about finishing the degree in time. I'd just like to hear some opinions on these options.

If you want to do anything where you might need to program, then a CS minor would make a lot of sense. If you're looking for more mathematical careers/academia, then I can't say. You have a lot of time though, so you could definitely try out different courses, see whether you like pure math or com sci more.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1621987913, "upvotes": 1}, "gzg1q0b": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nl0jxa/physics_major_math_minor_comp_sci_minor_or/gzg1q0b/", "text": "Pure math is based", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1621981674, "upvotes": 1}, "gzfw9o6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nl0jxa/physics_major_math_minor_comp_sci_minor_or/gzfw9o6/", "text": "To be honest the paths are so similar that I honestly see this coming down to whether you want a greater emphasis on math. In your freshman year, you likely will be taking courses that meet requirements for both majors so this should also give you further time to prepare.", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1621979099, "upvotes": 2}}}
