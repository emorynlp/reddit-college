Just depends on if it interests you as much as neuroscience. I believe you shouldn't double major unless you're truly interested in both subjects. Grad school admissions committees will care far more about good grades and research experience than they will about a double major. Wanting to double major because you're interested and motivated in two subjects is one thing, doing it for a better shot at grad school is another. Go for whatever interests you, and worst comes to worst, you can always drop the second major down to a minor.
