I know many incoming and current students have no idea on what career or major they should look for, and many other major related forums on the internet seem to spread misinformation and hateful speech about certain majors, and it's honestly very disheartening to read sometimes. I feel with a friendly approach and outreach, this subreddit can become the premier online resource for college majors.\n\nAdditional comments: When I first started college, resources like the main college subreddit really helped me out where my college couldn't, and I truly wish to make this resource be of great aide to others while maintaining a friendly environment. Along with that, I have great fun discussing and researching different majors with people at my college, and I wish to continue that on this sub.
