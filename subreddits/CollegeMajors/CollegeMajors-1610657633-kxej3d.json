Geographic Information Science and Information Systems with an emphasis in Business Intelligence are two similar majors that match my interest and experience. I am leaning towards the IS/BI degree. My only concern is getting stuck at marketing job after college where I have to over-analyze customer preferences on what color shoes customers prefer. I\u2019m more interested in fields that align closer to the public sector like space exploration, law enforcement, environment, etc. What are your thoughts?", "author": "OGSLCHyphy", "created": 1610657633, "retrieved": 1632847052, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gj9xvp4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kxej3d/gis_or_information_systems_with_bi_emphasis/gj9xvp4/", "text": "If your interests are more aligned with law enforcement and the environmental sectors, GIS is certainly the way to go in my opinion. Even outside of this, there are plenty of in-demand careers that will let you draft and analyze maps for your company. Now warranted, you have to really like cartography and geospatial analysis, but if you\u2019re considering a GIS major, you probably have some interest.\n\nI don\u2019t have much information on Information Sciences unfortunately, but I have learned a bit of GIS and I do work with GIS professionals on a day to day basis. It\u2019s pretty variable work. I believe to receive your professional licensure, you do have to get a Masters, but most GIS jobs don\u2019t actually require that apart from land surveying. Some companies may also pay for your certification too.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1610660844, "upvotes": 2}}}
