Great! I applied for Computer Science, but before making that decision in my application, I was extremely stressed out because I couldn't decide between Finance or Computer Science. At the end the person who was helping me fill out the application told me that I could change later and that it is very common, so I ended up going for computer science.\n\nI really like these two majors a lot and my whole range of interests are all mixed up in these two fields. I am fascinated with how money and the economy work. I want to learn everything about how money is used, predicting trends in the economy, understanding how investments are made and anything related to that is just fascinating to me. Even accounting is interesting to me even though some people say it's extremely boring and dry. I considered majoring in that at some point but based on what I've heard it doesn't cover the full range that a finance major would, but I'm still not sure how accurate that is. The only thing holding me back from just majoring in Finance is that someone told me I could do really bad because of my communication skills. I'm a very introverted person and even though I'm more interested in the technical aspects of Finance, the major is still a business major where strong communication skills are required. Some parts of Finance relate a bit with computer science, but I can't just major in two things at the same time, right? And even if I did what about my bad communication skills?\n\nNow, computer science is also a big interest of mine. Again, the reason I chose computer science over Finance was me being realistic with my communication skills. I know they're needed for computer science too but they're not such a huge aspect of it. I learned Python (In case you are not familiar, Python is a programming language) all by myself with some online courses, I like technology and solving problems. Sounds like the perfect match if it wasn't for my Finance interests. I feel that if I go with computer science I would be ignoring another \"passion\" of mine. They're such unrelated fields that it's hard to mix them up  enough to make feel comfortable and not like I'm ignoring it. It's odd because I do feel that I could be slightly happier with a career in Finance than Computer Science. I like technical stuff but there's a limit. Computer Science is very technical while Finance is not as much.\n\nI'm in need of advice here. I'm not even that familiar with how college classes will work. I don't know if I could have enough free time to maybe do both? Or if I could take classes on the side and at least get the knowledge... Maybe there's a hidden field in computer science that deals with Finance stuff? I don't know. That's why I'm asking here, and any advice is welcomed.

The important aspects for obtaining a career is not only being able to have the technical qualifications, but also having a good network and having excellent interview skills. You may be able to *perform* the job, but the interview is about demonstrating to employers that they *want* to work with you.\n\n>I don't know if I could have enough free time to maybe do both\n\nAll you have to do is ask yourself how hard you're willing to work, and you have your answer.", "author": "EggcellentName", "created": 1551024806, "upvotes": 4}, "eh5sr51": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/au50mv/i_cant_decide_between_computer_science_or_finance/eh5sr51/", "text": "You\u2019ll be able to set up your own schedule. I\u2019m a freshman and this is my second semester.

It\u2019s better to take your core classes at the beginning and take a few random classes sprinkled in to see what you enjoy the most. You can also double major if you want to. Also, don\u2019t be stressed out because it won\u2019t be as overwhelming as you think it\u2019s gonna be.

Can't say too much about it but I believe it's a business degree that also adds programming and coding. It's not a finance degree but it is a business degree that makes you take the basic Econ, and accounting classes and would probably be easy to add a finance double major. You're best bet is to look at the major map between both subjects and see which one interests you more. If you have electives maybe try to take a finance class to see if you like it. You still have time to change your mind and I really wouldn't worry that much. \n\nAlso I'd try to give more thought to Accounting as a major. You should try to research Accounting vs Finance and see which one interests you more. ", "author": "thekidboy", "created": 1550989588, "upvotes": 3}}}
