I am currently in my second year of pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering, at a university that is known for its various engineering programs. I chose to go down this path because I loved chemistry in high school (my first mistake was probably to assume chemical engineering would be anything like chemistry), I've always been good at math, I'm decent at physics, and my parents said engineering was a professional degree that I could get a job with in four years. I have no interest in going on to graduate school, and I don't think it's financially feasible for me even if I do somehow become interested in something at the Masters/PhD level.\n\nFor the last eight months, I have been second guessing this decision. Over the summer, I convinced myself that I should wait and see how the introductory chemical engineering class goes to see if I like it/am good at it. Now I am almost done with the course, and I am miserable. I'm even more conflicted because this year has been crazy and I don't know if I actually hate my major or if I hate online classes,  or if it's the lack of socializing and seeing my friends, or if it's just the quarantine depression/pandemic depression/election depression/regular depression/existential dread depression that is getting to me.\n\nI've been contemplating a bunch of other majors including chemistry, math, statistics, english, biochemistry, etc. My biggest problem is that I love all of the theoretical subjects that are \"useless\". I'm scared shitless to major in chemistry and english (my two favorites) because of the job prospects. I was good at statistics too, but I don't really have an interest in coding.\n\nI've also been really disenchanted with the world recently. I don't like the idea of working for industry, but I can't pursue academia either. A lot of the industries seem inherently evil, like big pharma or oil companies or large manufacturing corporations. I am not at all interested in those things, I'd say I actively dislike it. My worldview definitely doesn't match with other engineers, who seem to be interested in making money and furthering technology and being professionals, whereas I want to help people and live a small, simple, but content life. Honestly I feel like I've been turned off from STEM as a whole. Maybe it's the escapism talking, but reading, analyzing, writing, and critically thinking seems infinitely more exciting and useful to me in a broad sense, though it seems to be less valued by employers?\n\nI have talked to my parents about this and they don't seem very keen on me switching, but I literally cannot stop thinking about how horrid it will be to calculate properties of fluids flowing through various pipes and processes for the next 2.5 years in school and then later in my job too. I'm also contemplating taking a gap semester for Spring 2021 so that I can clear my head, avoid online classes, and figure out what I want to do with my life (as best I can since most people never figure that one out).\n\nI think I really want to be a high school teacher, preferably for chemistry/english? I know it's god awful sometimes and they don't get paid enough and high schoolers are the bane of most people's existence, but it seems like one of the most direct ways to make a positive impact, and I think I have the skills for it. At the very least I'd be motivated to try for my students, but with other jobs I don't even think I'd have the determination to do better. But I also don't want to become a teacher right out of school??\n\nI don't believe in \"following my passion\", heck I don't even think I have a passion; and I know I will ultimately work to live, not live to work. But I still want to do something I at least half enjoy? Something that I consider to be positively impacting the world? Is that too much to ask, is it wishful thinking?\n\nSo I basically want a degree that can get me a decent, moral job after undergrad, but also allow me to pursue a teaching license after a couple of years. That's where I'm at right now. Sorry for the rambling, I'd appreciate any advice.", "author": "beepboopidontknow", "created": 1604961520, "retrieved": 1632847141, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gdhv7a4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jr86x1/want_to_switch_out_of_engineering_but_dont_know/gdhv7a4/", "text": "I am an old business professor, who was a mechanical engineering undergraduate, so I may have a different perspective on this.  Hopefully also a useful one.\n\nFirst, regarding your introductory courses in engineering.  These courses are often weeder courses, made intentionally difficult to shake out those students who may not be fully committed to the rigors of the degree.  Because of this, they are often less engaging and interesting than your later courses.  I would suggest holding off on any decision to change majors until you get to at least one of the upper level elective classes.  This is usually where you discover the sub-disciplines of the degree that may engage you.  Changing from an engineering degree to many other degrees is usually pretty easy if you decide to move later.\n\nSecond, see if you can talk to some practicing chemical engineers.  Just because they need to be able to calculate fluid properties does not mean they spend all their days doing so.  Often the jobs are more related to monitoring processes, and then solving problems when something goes wrong.  Get a sense for the real work.\n\nThird, there are plenty of good people and good companies to work.  The belief that just because it is a business with a profit motive it must be somehow evil is something that deserves a little critical introspection on your part.  Most industries have at least a few good companies populated by good people, trying to be responsible actors providing the resources that people need to survive and thrive.  If you don't like big corporations, there are also many smaller family run businesses to work for as well.\n\nFourth, and last, all this COVID school shutdown stuff is very disruptive and not representative of normality.  I am personally struggling with delivering my classes in a new format, and even with 25 years of teaching experience, it is hard to deliver an engaging class remotely.  Your professors are in the same boat, perhaps without the level of experience and institutional support I have.  Try to keep your spirits up, engage with your friends out of class, socialize and try to be as normal as you can.  It is very hard to deal with the stress of college alone, so try to connect with others.\n\nHope this helps you a bit.", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606259543, "upvotes": 2}, "gbse7ls": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jr86x1/want_to_switch_out_of_engineering_but_dont_know/gbse7ls/", "text": "been dealing with the same issue ever since i took my course, one that i just chose because of full funded scholarship. i thought if i gave it a chance it would not cost me anything, i mean, what's 4 years if I can get a second degree afterwards? by that, i probably made the stupidest choice because i made myself unhappy (and i think getting a sec degree feels like a waste of time). when i see my hs friends doing really well in college and really enjoying their courses, i feel frustrated because i could have been doing the same if not better. now im on 2nd yr, thinking about the amount of time and effort ive poured already, it's just so hard to shift out halfway through when i have 2 years left and i just really want to get through college, perhaps find a decent job after. \n\ni say, if u got any choice of switching out of ur course, and ure definite that u wanna switch out, maybe its best if you take up something that would make you happy.
