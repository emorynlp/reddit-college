I don't have the best GPA (3.2) but I am bringing that up. I can't stress enough that I am *terrible* at anything regarding history so I'm steering clear of that.  I am very good at math (so far I've taken algebra 1 , hon. algebra 2, geometry, next year I am taking pre-calc and calc). I'm also good at English, I've gotten 90's+ in every english course. I am considering a degree in something in the business/finance world but I don't specifically know what/what I actually want to do after college. I don't want to leave school with a major I won't ever use. Anyone have any suggestions/recommendations on how to go about deciding this or even recommending majors?", "author": "bigant18", "created": 1587998163, "retrieved": 1632957943, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fpkwa1l": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/g91u92/100_lost/fpkwa1l/", "text": "Econ, CS,bio, chem, physics, engineering.
