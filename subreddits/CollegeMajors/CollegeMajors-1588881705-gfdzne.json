  "text": "Hey, everyone. I'm 24 years old and I'm ready to go back to college. I want to go to be a Clinical Psychologist (as I was a foster child and have been around different degrees of mental health all of my life) but I have a couple of problems. \n\nOne, being that I have mental health issues, myself. I was diagnosed with two anxiety disorders when I was a child (as well as PTSD from my childhood, and mild Fetal Alcohol Syndrome- thanks ma) so I will likely be using an IEP for my own schooling. I won't let my mental health hold me back because I take pride in how hard I work to manage my anxiety, but I know that I will be slowed down with my college experience to maintain. I know a lot of people are in school around 10 years before starting a job as a clinical psychologist- which means it could take me double that time. \n\nWhich brings me to problem #2... the amount of debt I will accrue. I didn't start college out of high school because I was horrified of debt. Life has already taught me that debt is normal and something that just needs to be taken care of, so I'm more comfortable in dishing money to make more money- but 100k is a HUGE average number.  \n\n\nHere's what I'm wondering... should I grind hard af for 20 years so I can have my dream job? Or should I consider other similar degrees? Or even- what can I do with a bachelors in psychology? Will the money I make be worth the debt in schooling?",

Best of luck to ya!!",

      "text": "Any major has inherent risk, and a psychology degree will have higher risks associated with it because it usually has a lower return on investment.\n\nTo do anything meaningful with psychology will require a PhD at a minimum so you are already looking at \\~10 years of schooling to achieve your goal. Before you can even think about a PhD program you will need to consider grad school first and that is its own bag of troubles. To break it down there are A LOT of psychology majors so competition for a funded grad school program is very competitive. For a STEM degree you could expect to be accepted into a grad program with a GPA as low as 3.0 as long as you have the correct work/research experience. Getting accepted into a psychology grad program you will constantly have to maintain a pretty high GPA and do a lot of undergrad research with your professors in order to be viable for a masters degree.\n\nA BA in psychology will get you absolutely nowhere in the realm of psychology, you might as well have gotten a degree in Art History. If what you say is true about 20 years to get your PhD then you will incur around double the debt of your peers for a less than glamorous job that is already oversaturated in the market.  20 years on anything to see a return on investment means you will end up being in debt for a good portion of your life, which is unequivocally never a good plan.\n\nTo get a PhD without any form of financial aid is around $110,000 if you take double the amount of time then you will be in debt for $220,000. The average annual pay for a clinical psychologist on the low end is $50,000 from that 50k take out taxes, mortgage, utilities, gas, child care etc. and that 220k will not be payed off for a very long time.  Compare this to an economical degree that only takes 4 years to complete like a mechincal engineer, which has a starting salary of $55,000, room for growth and advancement, and much much less debt.\n\n[https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-grad-school-debt-statistics/](https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-grad-school-debt-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Clinical\\_Psychologist/Salary](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Clinical_Psychologist/Salary)\n\n[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Mechanical\\_Engineer/Salary](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your goal is to help people consider Nursing, which is an in demand field that is an economical and well paying field that won't leave you in debt a decade after you graduate.",

              "text": "Hey. I know this is a little late but if you're interested in a career in clinical psychology/counseling you should also consider a major in social work. It's far more diverse than a degree in psychology and there are opportunities at the undergrad level and graduate level (though most people obtain their masters, and to do clinical social work one has to be licensed). \n\nThe only issue is that though it is a diverse field it's very mentally taxing and strenuous. Additionally, it's also one of the more undervalued occupations and social workers are typically underpaid below the clinical level.",
