I think by the end of this year i\u2019ll have a 3.2-3.4 gpa. My favorite subjects are english and science. I heard that engineering is a good major, but i don\u2019t know much about it. The only \u201cengineering\u201d class i took was intro to game development. Does anyone know a major which has good potential of employment that would fit my 2 subjects? I enjoy the biological/environmental side of science the most. I would also like to get an undergrad in Audio Recording if possible.", "author": "AirDizzyy", "created": 1631663250, "retrieved": 1632958006, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdmj7bd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/poek9p/what_should_i_do_for_college/hdmj7bd/", "text": "I think you should apply to a liberal arts college.
