However, I'm starting to realize that coding is not really my passion.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I was always crazy about computers. How they worked, how the operating system looked, the things i could do with it,, which grew into a fascination with tech overall--phones, televisions, cars etc. My love for technology knew no bounds.\n\nWith this, I assumed that CS was the way to go--the strong basis on software development and engineering and building operating systems, but I am starting to figure out that in reality, my passion is not for coding or the engineering behind technology, but the business side--quality control, and just being someone that provides new ideas for the technological world rather than to be the one to code it from scratch, and being a part of groups where designs and plans are discussed--like planning out the design and function of the next iPhone or Android phone.\n\nI've also had a strong interest in being a tech reviewer as well--I've been watching guys like Marques Brownlee and Mrwhosetheboss since I was in middle school, and every single part of what they do is something I've always wanted to do. I did some research and found out Marques Brownlee is also an Information Technology major, which is in line with the CIS curriculum. But I know how difficult it is to get to their level of prestige when it comes to reviewing tech, they're basically the 1-2% and those are the only few that can make it a career.\n\nThing is, I'm solid at coding, I know 3 programming languages already (Python, Java, Objective C), but I just don't really enjoy coding or do it as passionately as many in my classes do. They have their own githubs full of their pet projects while I don't have any pet projects. I have a few small projects such as device trees for Android devices that I'd on my free-time compile firmwares for from source code, but other than that, I don't really just want to code for the rest of my life.\n\nI want to be more of someone that leads product development from a business standpoint, while also using his technical background, rather than be the guy coding everything from behind the curtain. The whole thing just feels tedious and drawn out for me, and I feel like I'd be depressed from it after a while. \n\nI also suffer from anxiety and panic disorder, and coding does not help that much--being sedentary a lot and not on the move much makes my anxiety much worse.\n\nDo you guys think I should stay in CS, or go to CIS, or maybe pursue other options?", "author": "TheOriginalElTigre", "created": 1603606978, "retrieved": 1632847168, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ga1zeyr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jhor7h/currently_a_2nd_year_cs_major_but_thinking_of/ga1zeyr/", "text": "/u/ayham_abusalem  has summoned me, so here I am.  \n\n> However, I'm starting to realize that coding is not really my passion.  \n\nFine. You don't have to write code for a living with a CS degree. You can do damned near anything you want, but you might have to teach yourself some new technologies first.  \n\nThe recruiting pipeline for CS majors is stronger than any other degree.  \n\nIS/IT/CIS/MIS are all employable degrees. Totally legit. But the recruiting pipeline is always less strong compared to CS.  \n\nSo, if you switch majors, be aware that you're gonna take a small hit in that regard.  \n\n\n> With this, I assumed that CS was the way to go--the strong basis on software development and engineering and building operating systems, but I am starting to figure out that in reality, my passion is not for coding or the engineering behind technology, but the business side--quality control, and just being someone that provides new ideas for the technological world rather than to be the one to code it from scratch, and being a part of groups where designs and plans are discussed--like planning out the design and function of the next iPhone or Android phone.  \n\nHardware is no longer generally interesting. Everything is pretty commoditized.  \nSoftware is pretty much the only interesting part.  \n\nSoftware quality control is a Software Engineering skill, and a CS major would be pretty well aligned for that role.  \n\nNew product ideas is a design function, and that's a very difficult niche to get into.  \n\nConsider Jony Ive the former Chief Design Officer for Apple.  \n\nJony is the guy who basically invented the iPod + iTunes, the iMac, iPhone and iPad.  \nJony is kind of a big deal, and it was a huge deal when he left Apple in 2019.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive  \n\nJony has a degree in Industrial Design from Newcastle Polytechnic in UK.  \n\n\nIf you want to go down that path, that's cool. But you might want to do some more research into what that design path actually looks like.  \n\n> I've also had a strong interest in being a tech reviewer as well--I've been watching guys like Marques Brownlee and Mrwhosetheboss since I was in middle school,  \n\n\nThat's nice. There are already like a thousand bloggers / vloggers / social media personalities also working really hard to be successful reviewing technology.  \n\nI don't wanna say you have no chance, but you better have a unique approach if you really want to try to stand out.  \n\n> Thing is, I'm solid at coding, I know 3 programming languages already (Python, Java, Objective C), but I just don't really enjoy coding or do it as passionately as many in my classes do.  \n\nDon't care how many languages you think you know.  \nOnly care how thoroughly you've masters data structures & algorithms.  \nIf you've mastered the methods & concepts of how good code should work, the syntax of a new language shouldn't be rocket surgery.  \n\n\n>  I have a few small projects such as device trees for Android devices that I'd on my free-time compile firmwares for from source code, but other than that, I don't really just want to code for the rest of my life.  \n\nFine. Don't write code.  \nFind vulnerabilities in other people's code.  \nInfoSec research. Malware research.  \n\n> Do you guys think I should stay in CS, or go to CIS, or maybe pursue other options?  \n\nHard to say. You need to nail down your career path and align the education to match the career.  \n\nCS is most employable.  \nCIS is employable, just less so than CS.  \n\nI honestly don't know how employable design-focused degrees are.
