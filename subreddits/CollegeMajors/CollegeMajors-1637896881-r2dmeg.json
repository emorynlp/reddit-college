      "text": "Both majors should have a major map, take a look at that and compare. You should be fine to switch after the first year since it is generally the same Physics, Math, English, maybe Biology, maybe Chemistry, and maybe a single \"intro to engineering\" or \"intro to x engineering\" class.",

      "text": "Agree with second person. The first two semesters & most of the third semester of engineering is the exact same for my university's 10+ engineering majors, save for the bullshit intro classes that are easy points & just exposing you to older students & companies.",
