Find something that is of interest to you that plays to your strengths, would serve as a good fall-back of law school doesn\u2019t work out, and generally has higher admittance rates. Physics, math, economics, IR, engineering, chemistry, or a foreign language would all be decent options. \n\nI\u2019d recommend considering what kind of law you\u2019d like to study as well. Environmental law? Study environmental studies, environmental engineering, ecology, geology, etc. \n\nCommercial law? Economics, business, IT. \n\nHealth care law? Biology, philosophy, healthcare administration/management, health information, public health, etc.", "author": "slouchingbethlehem", "created": 1623594727, "upvotes": 6}, "h1mfdg0": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nyvibs/what_do_you_think_about_law_as_a_major_to_study/h1mfdg0/", "text": "If you are talking about wanting to study law for your bachelors and then continue to law school it will be hard to get in.
