      "text": "If your plan is to go to law school, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Find something that is of interest to you that plays to your strengths, would serve as a good fall-back of law school doesn\u2019t work out, and generally has higher admittance rates. Physics, math, economics, IR, engineering, chemistry, or a foreign language would all be decent options. \n\nI\u2019d recommend considering what kind of law you\u2019d like to study as well. Environmental law? Study environmental studies, environmental engineering, ecology, geology, etc. \n\nCommercial law? Economics, business, IT. \n\nHealth care law? Biology, philosophy, healthcare administration/management, health information, public health, etc.",

              "text": "His point is that you don\u2019t need a legal major to go to law school. You should choose something you like and opens up future options. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019re gonna be in 4 years, so provide yourself options. Your plans are going to change, might as well be prepared.",

      "text": "If you are talking about wanting to study law for your bachelors and then continue to law school it will be hard to get in. Law schools want to see you study something outside of the scope like business or a science or literally anything else. If you look up the stats for people who get accepted you will see that pre-law majors are the lowest percentage accepted.",
