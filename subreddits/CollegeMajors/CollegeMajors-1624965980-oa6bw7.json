However, don't expect any FANG or big tech positions as they typically only hire CS grads. Computer Science is a blessing and a curse in that your interview will speak more about you than your resume will. That being said, it will most likely be more challenging for you to land an interview in the first place. Definitely apply for internships while you're in school to try and stand out. \n\nMost likely you'll need to have an undergrad in CS to apply to a master's program (for any moderately competitive program at least).", "author": "VeryStink", "created": 1625002359, "upvotes": 2}}}
