  "text": "Hello! Right now, I\u2019m a head start teacher. I love it very much, but eventually I would love to be a child therapist/counselor or even a play therapist for children. I\u2019m kinda stuck on the options because there are so many different masters programs. Any advice? How do I narrow it down? I\u2019ve talked to some people at work, but even they are confused sometimes.",

      "text": "Most colleges have a counseling path in grad school that adheres to the states guidelines for professional counselor and mental health therapists. (Sometimes it\u2019s in psych and sometimes education college) \n\nFrom there you can typically choose courses within the program tailored to school counseling. Some colleges have totally separate programs for school counselors. \n\nI believe MSW degrees have similar path options.",
