Zoo-Wee Mama this is an *exciting* post. YOUR opinion will directly enter my brain, a STRANGER studying ChemE (sophomore) at the University of Texas at Austin. Are you ready for the prompt? Okay, it might be too original for you all. Here it is: \"What should I major in?\" \n\nAll memes aside\n\nThings I Am Interested In: \n\n* Money (slightly). \n* Exercise/physical health. \n* Meditation/Yoga/Spiritual awareness and health.\n* Marijuana/Hemp/LSD/DMT.\n* Psychology and Neuroscience.\n* Any physiology regarding Wim Hof (shoutout to the g)\n* Plants and Algae, farming, genetics, etc.\n* Ecosystems\n* Biomedical engineering \n\nThings I am good at but am not interested in:\n\n* Math\n* Chemical Engineering\n\nThings I Do Not Have A Particular Interest In:\n\n* Chemical Engineering O&G, Pharm\n\nOKAY, YOU MAY BE WONDERING: WHY? WHY DID HE MAJOR IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING? WHY NOT ANY OTHER DEGREE REMOTELY INTERESTING?\n\nWell, allow me to explain. I want enough money to have a family. To feel financially stable. To raise two beautiful babies. Nothing too much, however I have spent countless hours reading about the \"horror stories\" about not being able to find a job in other fields (BME) that end up either forced to go to grad or they get shafted by their engineering neighbors. For neuroscience, it is a must to do PhD/MD to have your own real, satisfying work not being stolen by your prof,\n\nAs a direct quote from \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, a neuroscience major responding to someone stating to \"Take classes you enjoy\":\n\n>\"I have a master's in Neuroscience, because I took the classes I was interested in. I'm now worrying about my \"eventual career\" and realize I should've picked a major that would've taught me more practical skills and prepared me for a job that is in demand. I'm sure others would agree.\"\n\nI do feel like the field that I am in completely opposes what I am interested in. Pharmacy is a huge monopoly game of corruption, O&G is for people that are mentally satisfied with life and just want to make  $$$, Biotechnology is a bit sketch as a potential career (correct me if im wrong).\n\nIt seems in the search for my undergrad major, it has boiled down to two options: \n\n1.) Slave away in Chemical Engineering, because it is SooOOOoo VerSaTile and lose half of my hair follicles taking transport, thermo, one of the hardest majors and play it safe. take bio tech electives to hope that one day I will have satisfied myself with the work I do. Have backup plans like industry, O&G, pharm in case my dreams never come true\n\n2.) Study a subject of interest (take another semester to graduate), commit going into the field, study shit that people do not recognize as a positive science/medicine (lsd microdosing, holistic health for chronic diseases, dmt, etc.) eventually having a low chance of financial success in the field because of the stigmas around it\n\nI did take ChemE mainly because I didn't know what to do, thinking that my major could open up possibilities for anything in the future for when I've made up my mind. But HOLY MOLY is it BORING. I dont understand how ChemE's go throughout their day without going on a Winter Soldier episode. Am I supposed to be excited? Should I follow my passion and risk basic financial security? Maybe chemical engineering has some kind of connection with something I Like? Maybe I should take the plunge and switch out?\n\nAny comments, constructive or destructive, are appreciated. I'm posting this on ChemE as well.", "author": "_COVIDGANG_", "created": 1611638043, "retrieved": 1632847036, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"gkw6kml": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l56x1a/chemical_engineering_is_boring_and_i_want_advice/gkw6kml/", "text": "I'm not an expert, but aren't there jobs in BME, but they tend to come at the graduate level?

Please listen to the advice I ignored. \"You are going to hate your job. Make money so you can enjoy the rest of your life.\" \n\n\nI wrote it off at the time as the words of an Indian Uncle who grew up in a different world. I was wrong. Have a **solid** career option. Then when and if you can afford it, go back for another degree. In the meantime, take elective credits or a minor for personal interest so you can have a shot at a grad degree in neuro or whatever. \n\n\nDon't overestimate the number of skilled labor jobs available. Engineering is one that should always have much wider access and availability. It pays well and has international options. Believe me, you don't want to hit hard times and find out that your only fallback job options are unskilled labor and all that goes along with it. Having a background in brain science doesn't matter in the slightest to a majority of employers and I highly suspect has been a negative on my applications at such places.", "author": "oddphilosophy", "created": 1611682648, "upvotes": 1}, "gksnz2j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l56x1a/chemical_engineering_is_boring_and_i_want_advice/gksnz2j/", "text": "I majored in English. Sounds like the epitome of joblessness and such. Pandemic happened. Worst case scenario. I have a good paying job that I got during the pandemic. Previously a MechE major too.\n\n1. Finding your passion is a huge part of the journey. Take a semester off or take general courses. \n2. Experience counts so much. Don\u2019t take classes in the summer, get experience.\n3.
