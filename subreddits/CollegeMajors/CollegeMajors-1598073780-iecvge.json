  "text": "Im in my freshman year of college as a interdisciplinary science major. Looking back I remember loving science but now I\u2019m scared that the memories are just me lying to myself. I also love language literature and history and I\u2019m absolutely terrified that I chose science because I didn\u2019t want to live of humanities (was planing of doing minors just for my enjoyment). The plan was to become a doctor vet of researcher. I love learning and solving problems I even wrote a monography on neonatal abstinence syndrome in junior year when I could have chosen any other topic but I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m making a mistake. I feel like i should say that I suffer from anxiety and have crippling self doubt if it wasn\u2019t obvious.",
