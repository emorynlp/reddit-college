Originally I planned on majoring in Computer Science because hey money, but more because it was the career path that interested me but still was a \"safe field\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am much more interested in the humanities and knowledge in general, and my skills lie in writing, speaking, and photography. However I am creative and smart (so I'm told?), and I probably could make it work in many careers/majors.\n\nAfter two semesters, I want to switch. I'm just not a math brain, I am barely passing Algebra. Caveat: I am unsure if I really dislike STEM or just because since I had to self-educate (I wasn't sent to high school) I gravitated to things I read.\n\nI am still planning on keeping CS as a minor if I can. Seems like a useful area of knowledge in the future and I'm hoping it will prove competitive on the ol' resume. Smart idea?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question is: now what? There are so many fields, I am getting overwhelmed fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been doing journalism recently, finishing up an internship at Tablet Magazine. But I don't know if I should major in Journalism, Communications, or perhaps go laterally into Marketing/Ad/English/History/Psych/etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone want to take a stab at unraveling this mess lol?", "author": "wiseupriseupeyesup", "created": 1620805360, "retrieved": 1632846558, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"gxx756a": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/naj623/cc_major_choice_compsci_comms/gxx756a/", "text": "If you're barely passing algebra, CS even as a minor might be tough. The CS minor at my school consisted of calculus, computer science theory, discrete math, linear algebra, and data structures/algorithms, as well as some other programming classes. It's my understanding this is pretty standard for a CS minor at most schools, meaning that you would need to take and do pretty decently in algebra and trigonometry as pre reqs before you could even take some of the courses necessary for the minor. Unless you are willing to put in serious time to make sure you get a very good foundation in algebra/trig/calculus, getting a minor in CS is going to be difficult. And it may not be necessary either, considering a lot of what you learn in a CS minor/major is going to be theoretical. If you want to do programming (which is not for everyone), that's something you can start learning straight away, and you can do a lot with it without needing a CS degree.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good start in journalism, especially with your internship. But yeah, I could see marketing, communications also being decent choices. Fortunately you're in community college, meaning you're planning on transferring, right? So that might buy you some time, you could look up the pre reqs that count for both communications and journalism and marketing, etc. and knock those out. But to be honest, I don't know how important it is. In many of these fields it's more about your past experience and skills than exactly what you majored in. So I would recommend finishing any pre reqs and using that time to focus on really what kind of things you find interesting, especially from your internship, and talk to people from different majors and see if you can find out what kind of jobs they had and what seems interesting.\n\nIf you are hellbent on learning programming though, I would recommend javascript, HTML, CSS, aka the languages of web design. If you end up working in marketing this could be useful.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1620865644, "upvotes": 2}, "gxunbxf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/naj623/cc_major_choice_compsci_comms/gxunbxf/", "text": "You cannot be a computer scientist without math. You can program, but the actual foundation of computer science is math. I would recommend really going back to the basics of math. There\u2019s no way you will be able to learn calculus if you can\u2019t pass algebra. You need to learn algebra, trig, precalc, calculus at least. Some hard books that will make you good at math are the art of problem solving math books. Khan academy, textbooks, ect are also good. You can definitely become a math person if you are willing to put the time in with good resources.", "author": "biggerarmsthanyou", "created": 1620826186, "upvotes": 4}}}
