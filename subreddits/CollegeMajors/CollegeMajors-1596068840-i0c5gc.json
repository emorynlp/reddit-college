Because of this, I need to be picky with what I take, as I can't let credits go to waste. So I came here, and I'll just list off some stuff about myself.\n\nI like science. A lot. Just researching it makes me happy. Specifically, biology and psychology (if that counts). But I despise chemistry. I'm just average at math. Never really liked it, never really hated it.\n\nI'm good at reading and writing. AICE English Literature was one of the funnest classes I've had. I love analyzing things from literary works, and I love discussing it.\n\nI've been told that I'm very empathetic. My history teacher said I should go into a social science, but I don't know if the job opportunities are the best. \n\nI would much rather work alone than with others. I know I'll have to work with people a few times during my career, that's unavoidable. But I'm socially awkward and often have a hard time verbally explaining my thoughts. I usually just text or message people about things than meet and talk in person. \n\nI also like politics and history. History more so. I've always wanted to get into programming, but I don't have the skills. I'm really good at learning how to use softwares proficiently if that's a worthy talent... I was able to get 7 of those certifications for Microsoft Office in a single semester. I've had similar experiences with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, and AutoCAD.\n\nAny insight into what majord may be good would be very appreciated!! Literally ANYTHING would be helpful.", "author": "itsyaboyscratch", "created": 1596068840, "retrieved": 1632847626, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fztwbgz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i0c5gc/unsure_of_what_to_do/fztwbgz/", "text": "I know virtually nothing about job prospects, but you could maybe consider economics as it's one of the more technical social sciences to my knowledge.
