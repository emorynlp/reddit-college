I enjoy teaching others and also training people at my job. I want to help people and have a job with variation. I want a career with alot of jobs available, and to be financially stable. The two degrees I\u2019m looking at are English Education and HR. Which one would be better? I know teaching doesn\u2019t pay much so I was also looking into School administration. People seem to like working with/under me (I don\u2019t mean to brag or anything, they\u2019re the ones that told me) so I could possibly go into that as well. Is there a future in that?", "author": "Blacksheep1205", "created": 1617758525, "retrieved": 1632958063, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gvccpwa": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mlqy5z/teaching_or_hr/gvccpwa/", "text": "You could always get a business degree and use that within a management position.
