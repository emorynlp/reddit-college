  "text": "I am currently majoring in Business Administration on my local community college. My current plan is to transfer to SDSU and get a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with emphazis either in Marketing or Entrepeneurship. \n\nI like the idea of owning a few small businesses, maybe a small caf\u00e9. At the same time, I would also to be part of something big and be part of creative team for a company, like a marketing or social media team.\n\nBUT the biggest thing that has been bugging me is that I am very passionate about films and creative writing. My DREAM jobs are to be part of a writing team for a tv show, work for a huge entertainment company, be a film producer, or work as a writer for the WWE (might sound silly).\n\nI believe that majoring in business will be a better option financially, since I don't know if I will be able to make a living if I major on communications, film, media studies or any related major.\n\nI am scared of majoring in business and then not enjoying my life in the office. I want to embrace my creative side, but then again, I am also scared of not being good at it or not being able to be financially stable.\n\nWhat would you recommend me to do? Will I be able to get in any creative job with a Business Administration degree? Does anyone have a degree in business administration, marketing, communications, or any of the majors I mentioned? What advice would you give me?",

      "text": "**You can always double major.** You only go to college once, might as well make the most of it. That is, if you can. I'm a communication major (also a double major in English) and a lot of my uni's comm coursework covers media studies, which has honestly helped me a lot in deciding what I wanna do as a career (becoming a professor), and the interplay with my majors has a lot to offer. If you do it right, I think you'll manage to hit that sweet spot between something you are passionate about and something you'll make money doing - comm degrees have a lot of applicable careers anyway, and having a double major could (potentially) make you stand out among other job applicants.",

I want to be an entrepreneur though so I\u2019m genuinely interested in business so I think my major\u2019s a good fit for me (hopefully). :)",
