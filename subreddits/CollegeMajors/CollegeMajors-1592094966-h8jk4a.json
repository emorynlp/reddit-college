  "title:": "Currently an English major, but considering a change. Help??",
  "text": "After graduation I plan to teach English abroad, most countries only require you to have a BA in something, they don't really care what. English is a lot of theories and discussing literature. I like to read as much as the next guy, but I hate theories, so boring. I like to write, create stories, much more into writing songs, plays, etc. I thought about switching to Educational Studies because that could lead to a teaching path. And I feel like 20 or so years in the future, I either see myself working in Television, like as a writer/producer type job, or running one of the Korean style study rooms (because I love the idea of them and more places should have them). I can see how English or Education could fit into these ideas. What do you all think? Stay English major, or switch to Education, or something else??",

      "text": "\\-English major won't qualify you to teach as you need a certain amount of student teaching hours to be qualified. \n\n\\- \"I like to write, create stories, much more into writing songs, plays, etc.\" Sounds more like a theatre program as outside of maybe a couple creative writing electives this won't ever happen through your regular curriculum. \n\n\\- Writing stories/songs/plays is also a hobby not a career, a major in English won't change this fact.\n\n\\- \"I feel like 20 or so years in the future, I either see myself working in Television, like as a writer/producer type job.\" This would require a long career in television/journalism, if you don't plan to do any internships or work studies in the immediate future involving this line of work then this is a pipe dream at best. \n\n\\- \" Running one of the Korean style study rooms.\" I hope you have family that live in South Korea, strong connections with people that live in the country, and have at least a C1 level of mastery of Korean for the CEFR exam to even be considered in a pool of a thousand applicants all applying for the same job.\n\n\\- Regardless of your choice (English or Teaching) I hope you are prepared for at a minimum to get a master's degree to make your chosen career path economically viable.",

          "text": "-I plan on taking the TEFL as well. I've done tons of research on this for the last several years, I know the qualifications. \n\n-I was a drama major before but this didn't seem to hold many job prospects. Also when I told Universities I was a drama major they kept looking at me with disappointment. So I switched. \n\n-Lots of people make it a career. Be more positive.\n\n-I don't know if I plan to do that. It's a consideration. \n\n-Well I plan on continuing to study Korean as long as possible and if I'm not fluent in 20 years that's a whole other problem. Also I said I'd like to run one of the rooms, I didn't said I want to run the room in Korea. \n\n-Maybe I'll get a masters someday idk.",
