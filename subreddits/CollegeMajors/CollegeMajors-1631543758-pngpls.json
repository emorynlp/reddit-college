I'd like some advice on possible majors alongside its career opportunities involving either research or analysis.\n\nBackground details about myself:\nI do not know how to code, do not have any known interests in any form of science, and am average in math, but better in English and enjoy reading.\nI've always liked researching a wide range of things throughout life. I would always be proficient at least in researching topics. This could range from simply me experimenting with different food recipes, trying to get it to a lower k/cal and same taste or even going down rabbit holes to find information for my friends. \n\nI don't know what type of analysis I would enjoy doing or try to learn especially if it involves technology as I am a bit scared to learn coding and go into advanced math topics.\n\nPossibilities: I was thinking of majoring in finance or business; with a minor in something that stands out, but is easy in the tech field. I am not totally passionate in any of these, but I am thinking that my interests will probably fall around these.", "author": "Comprehensive_Bid108", "created": 1631543758, "retrieved": 1632846496, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcqq34q": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pngpls/majors_career_opportunities_with_broad_interest/hcqq34q/", "text": "Are you me???
