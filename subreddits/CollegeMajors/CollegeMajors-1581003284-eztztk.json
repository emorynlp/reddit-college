Even becoming an English teacher in Japan, I'm not sure if I'd need a degree for English, Japanese, or in teaching.\n\nI am definitely interested in studying Linguistics or something to do with languages in general, with Japanese being #1, but I'm not sure if that would be useful at all when I move to Japan.\n\nAdvice?", "author": "Chopperman1415", "created": 1581003284, "retrieved": 1632957956, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fhi8299": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/eztztk/should_i_major_in_japanese_english_teaching_or/fhi8299/", "text": "There are usually majors in colleges like ESL (it seems somewhat rare, but not impossible to find).
