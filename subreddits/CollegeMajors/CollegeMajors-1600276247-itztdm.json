You make a ton of money and have the coolest job but don\u2019t get to be home as much as I want. I prefer being in one place and having a set schedule. Also due to medical conditions I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to be a pilot for a while because if your not in perfect shape they can fire you. If those couple thing were different I would 100% become a pilot but for now I want to be like my uncle and become wealthy and own my own plane. Good luck, I\u2019m sure your going to love what you doing.",

Also, medical wise, it is tough. As long as you can get an FAA medical certificate you're all good to fly. \n\nHopefully one day you'll have your own plane, it's a lot of fun. Good luck with college and majors and all that fun stuff!",

But with programming, you can start creating stuff immediately. If you take a CS class junior year and you decide you want to pursue programming, spend your senior year doing projects, so you have some shit under your belt and can start immediately applying for internships.",
