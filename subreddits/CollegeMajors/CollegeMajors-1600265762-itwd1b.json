  "title:": "Should I double major in Biotech and English?",
  "text": "So I've always waned to pursue a bio degree, but I'm aware that everyone and their mother has that degree so it's not in that much demand. I'm okay with the idea of double majoring, but I have no idea what the other major should be. I considered CS because it's a really good in demand degree, but I just don't think I'm really into programming. I considered engineering, but the amount of math classes scared me (and I'm relatively good at math). I'm enjoying the idea of doing English as my second major, but, from what I've heard, that's also a useless degree to have. \n\nI'm really panicked since I thought I had this whole college thing figured out only for me to start second-guessing everything in the last minute. I could really use some advice.",

Never heard someone said that.\n\nAnyway, you have fallen victim to a lot of false information, telling you that as a graduate student that has worked in an employment office non-profit. \n\nWhile CS is in high demand, it's also very saturated, meaning you will likely need a Masters to get a good-paying job. This of course depends on where you live. \n\nEnglish is not a useless degree, depending on how you use it. Ironically, it is more desirable for employers than other degrees. It's not the best in but it has a use in management, marketing, and journalism. Really depends on what you want to do. I know a lot of English Majors that have found desirable employment. \n\nYou said you are relativity good in math, that's a good sign. Maybe you should take Calculus 1-3, one extra proof-based math class like Linear Algebra and Statistics/Probability. It will benefit your bio degree as well. If you like 3/5 of those math classes, do a double major in Math if possible, or Engineering. \n\nRight now, college graduates are suffering due to increasing education requirements, so most likely to get a good-paying job, you gonna most likely need a Masters, so the major kinda matters less.\n\nPS: Maybe after taking your gen eds, there is another subject that caught your interest, got a good grade in and you can major in that. that's how I found my major. It wasn't Math, it was something else. Math is just Masters's.",
