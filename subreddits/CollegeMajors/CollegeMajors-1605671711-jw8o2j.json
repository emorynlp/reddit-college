These are my interests, but I\u2019m not completely passionate yet on one that I might want to do or if it\u2019s right for me and I don\u2019t know any career that might be good in these majors even with some research that last me in the future, but might be something I like. I just want advice or any info I\u2019m still in a process of trying. \n\nHuman development and family- I went into this because I\u2019m a very curious person about what affect people and how or why they turn out this way, but I don\u2019t what career this would be that won\u2019t end up like babysitting maybe research or something still debating \n\nRehabilitations- I\u2019m not specifically sure if the physical therapy part or helping people talk about their problems addictions because rehab your kind of like helping people back to almost normal and you are not really talking to a lot people just one on one session maybe so more less anxiety but I don\u2019t know if there more to it\n\nINformation science technology- well this is a recent thing I\u2019m trying because of the pandemic I\u2019ve been thinking hard what job and what might really fit me. I\u2019m new to this coding thing so instead of computer science I heard this was less intense. I\u2019m really mostly want to work remote if I\u2019m given and I\u2019m really an\nintrovert so I\u2019m not too well with people just small so yea.\n\nHuman centered designed and development- it kind of a new program your kind of seeing how people interact with technology and creating to have them use it their daily life so it does sound like I can have both, but I don\u2019t know any career since it\u2019s still new.\n\nI just want to look at the careers that you might suggest I don\u2019t mind dealing with pros and cons (maybe add that too if you could) because I\u2019m looking for internship soon and it my first work experience and don\u2019t know where to start.

You are very introverted, but appear to be most interested in fields that involve interacting with strangers in a stressful context.  You will get over your introversion to an extent, I am very introverted myself, but can easily teach a 600 seat lecture.  The problem with introversion is that interacting with people leaves you exhausted not energize, and you need time alone to recharge.  I don\u2019t think I could personally work with people 8 hours a day all week long.  Maybe you are different, but the first question I would ask myself is will I be energized with meeting with clients perhaps one or 2 an hour all day long? \n\nHow well put together do you feel?  You will need a strong center if you want to interact with people dealing with major problems, otherwise they will drag you down to where they are.  It is hard to deal with other people\u2018s problems if you have your own problems to deal with.\n\nAsk yourself, what are you good at?  Do you like working with people or things?  Are you better thinking things through logically, or do you \u201dfeel\u201d the right way forward?  Are you creative, would you like to design or build things?  Are you good with writing, math, getting computers to do what you want, fixing things, problem solving?  Does the answer to any of these questions suggest a path forward?\n\nSome possibilities such as engaging in research, or therapist often will require advanced degrees (at least a Masters or maybe a Ph.D.)  Do you have the desire, resources and ability to follow such a path?\n\nRegarding the human centered design, I would tend to avoid a new program, mainly because nobody really knows what hiring their graduates actually means.  What skills do they bring to the table, how will that help my business?  You will need to be really good at marketing yourself to get hired from these programs.  Maybe it could be a minor if you are interested in the subject.\n\nI don\u2019t really have a good bead on information science technology.  It could be quite a few different things.  It may be a computer science shadow program.  Shadow programs mimic a prestigious program at the university, but are run by another college (e.g. an arts and sciences program while computer science is in engineering).  They provide bodies and tuition revenue for struggling colleges, and an outlet for students that could not get into the prestigious program.  Shadow programs are usually not worth your time, as recruiters really only want the real deal.  On the other hand, it could just be a very different program from computer science, perhaps with more of a business information technology perspective.  If you want the straight story, ask somebody in computer science about it.  If they speak respectfully about it, it is probably a pretty good program.  If it is not, the computer science types will be happy to tell you why.  If it is not a good program, it is probably best to stay away or do computer science.  If it is a good program, look at the classes and ask yourself do these topics appeal to you?  If you saw an article in a magazine about the topic, would you read the article or just turn the page?\n\nI am not trying to discourage you.  You may actually really thrive in any of these jobs.  You might become a passionate physical therapist.  You might set your sight on becoming a psychologist.  I just think you need to look at yourself a bit more closely and ask what you are best at, what sorts of thing might it be best to avoid, and what sorts of things hold your interests.  Understanding this will make your choices clearer or perhaps suggest some other directions you have not yet considered.\n\nWhatever you do do, it will be hard work and you will need to apply yourself to it.  But, once you have a goal and a plan, you can get there. I know you can.", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606878968, "upvotes": 1}}}
