I have taken 1 or 2 chemistry classes in the past and I've done average in them like Cs or Bs. I want to go further and go to Dentistry school after majoring in either biology or chemistry, I'd much rather do chemistry but are there any chem majors who have any input?", "author": "juliabruv", "created": 1611078197, "retrieved": 1632956872, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gjwfyd7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l0ow8n/want_to_be_a_chem_major_but_bad_at_math/gjwfyd7/", "text": "Ok so the math in chem isn\u2019t particularly hard. It\u2019s much more conceptual modeling of chem. If you understand dimensional analysis and some properties of functions you should do fine, granted of course you truly understand chem. This doesn\u2019t apply to high level math classes like physical chem of course but if you want to learn math you need to start building up your staircase of math.", "author": "biggerarmsthanyou", "created": 1611108918, "upvotes": 2}, "gjw4lna": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l0ow8n/want_to_be_a_chem_major_but_bad_at_math/gjw4lna/", "text": "have a backup just in case but pursue what you want to do", "author": null, "created": 1611102866, "upvotes": 1}, "gjuv7p4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/l0ow8n/want_to_be_a_chem_major_but_bad_at_math/gjuv7p4/", "text": "Math, for the most part, is a skill.
