  "text": "I am currently a senior writing college applications. For UNC Chapel Hill, I have chosen physics as my priority major but I also has a good interest in CS. I've already heard from the admission office that the major choice on application does not play a role in acceptance. Once I get into college, what is the likelyhood that I will be able to change my major to CS?\n\nAny experiences from similar situation?",
