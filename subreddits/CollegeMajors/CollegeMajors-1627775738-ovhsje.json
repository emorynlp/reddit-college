Also does the career I explained have a real name?\n\nEdit: I'm from California, but schools anywhere in the USA is ok too.", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1627775738, "retrieved": 1632846504, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"h79zye8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ovhsje/looking_for_college_majors_and_schools_for_my/h79zye8/", "text": "start with thinking about the common point between your dreams or favorite hobby and college majors that may correlate with what u are doing. maybe looking into ones that have performing arts. the list of some universities should help u out in making decisions.
