So, I am actually considering to major in Accounting and data analytics/computer science. But, I don\u2019t know if i should do a double major or not. I tried programming for a while, but I don\u2019t think I want to handle a lot of coursework in college about programming. So, should I just major in accounting and minor in data analytics/cs, or should I stick with a double major?

First of all, to my knowledge at least, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of overlap between accounting skills and programming skills. Most accountants don't need to know how to program, right? And if you said you didn't enjoy programming, it just seems like there's no reason to double major in it, unless you have some really specific niche you want to go into (like creating accounting software or something). A major in accounting with a minor in data analytics sounds like it would be more suited towards your career goals.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1615252285, "upvotes": 1}, "gq8rekl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m0ccmx/help_with_college_major/gq8rekl/", "text": "Best double majors for accounting are finance, law, education, business administration, economics, and computer information systems.", "author": "Inalei_12", "created": 1615230664, "upvotes": 2}}}
