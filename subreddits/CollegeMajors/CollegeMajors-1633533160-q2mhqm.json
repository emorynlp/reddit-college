  "title:": "I want to learn how to make the blind see again and research/learn how amputees could regrow their limbs. What should I study in college?",
  "text": "My thoughts so far:\n\n* Be on the track to medical school to become an eye surgeon\n* Limb regeneration might require anatomy and physiology classes; perhaps study regeneration biology to understand how other animals do it\n* Maybe philosophy class to learn to be a better writer and thinker \n* Classes in computer science so I can work with smart technologies \n\nAdditional info: \n\n* I'm mainly interested in blindness from firearms and cataracts. \n* I want to advance both fields of limb regeneration/stem cells and blindness.",

      "text": "My first thought is biology, but this isn\u2019t anywhere close to my field. \n\nMy suggestion: look up recent research in these areas of interest and see what degrees those researchers have. It\u2019ll give you a good idea of the diversity one could have and what background is required. Based on a simple Google search, I found a researcher with a PhD in molecular biology, and her undergrad degrees were biology and philosophy.",

      "text": "Biomedical engineering! https://www.bme.jhu.edu/\n\nI also know of a professor in electrical engineering who\u2019s literally working on a retinal prosthesis: https://web.stanford.edu/~palanker/\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to recognize (as you obviously do) that you can attack one problem from many different angles. Maybe try out some classes in the things you listed and see what you vibe with the most, then develop expertise in that thing and apply it to helping the blind.\n\nYou could even, e.g., go into law or government or political science and influence people\u2019s lives for the better by improving disability law. Endless possibilities.",
