I'm a high school senior and I love to learn. I love to learn about anything and everything. English, science, pretty much anything! So I don't know what to major in. Almost everything interests me so I have trouble narrowing down what I want to do. I don't think I would make a good teacher, I'm terrible at explaining things to others and I don't particularly like children. I'm tempted to just major in business and pursue my learning interests outside of my career but I'm afraid I would get bored. Plus, what I'm interested in at the moment always changes. One moment I'm super into criminology, then I'm thinking about being a cook, and now maybe it would be fun to be a writer. I'm truly at a loss of what to do with myself. If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it!", "author": "jenbean-", "created": 1614028078, "retrieved": 1632847000, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gog8q8n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lpzyco/i_dont_know_what_to_major_in/gog8q8n/", "text": "Whatever you do, DO NOT major in business or some random major just because you can, you will severely regret it. It would just be you wasting your time, energy, and resources on something that you don't care for and never have cared for. You should major in something that you're absolutely passionate about, something that you would want to study for 4+ years and possibly make a career out of. Ultimately what that is, is something for you to figure out, but don't go to college just to go to college. Go to college for a purpose, a reason other than just because you want to, or you're told to, or because your parents/teachers/peers expect it out of you. \n\nYou have a wide variety of interests and you don't know what you want with yourself or your life, which is perfectly fine and normal, I was in your shoes too. My recommendation would be to go to a community college and just get your gen eds out of the way. If there is a subject that particularly has your interests over any other ones, you could try an associates in that and get a taste for what it has to offer. If no subject is any more interesting than the other ones, you could major in liberal arts which basically covers your gen eds while also allowing you to explore a variety of subjects. Community college would also be cheaper and most have agreements with some four years that make the transfer process easier.\n\nIf you want the more traditional college experience, you could just go into a four year as undecided. It allows you to knock out the gen eds and gives you more time to think about things. Most colleges force you to declare a major by the end of your sophomore year, but some don't force you to declare a major until junior year even. Going to a four year also allows you to meet and talk to a diverse range of new people and be introduced to subjects, perspectives, and life styles that you haven't encountered before.\n\nAnother alternative would be to just take a short break from school all together. Just work and get some money saved up. Let time do its thing and just think about what you want with yourself, your life, and just explore different fields of study and ways to live life. This can be a slippery slope however as it is not uncommon for people to never go back to school when doing something like this.\n\nUltimately just take a deep breath and relax. You're young and have plenty of time to figure shit out. You have little to no obligations from life or the people within your circle. The biggest thing is time. Just relax and let time do it's things. With time you will get a better understanding of what you want with yourself and your life. Your goals and aspirations in life change with age. Just don't go wasting time or money doing something just to do it. Hope this helps\u2764", "author": "jvst_joshin", "created": 1614080811, "upvotes": 4}, "goeg6l3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lpzyco/i_dont_know_what_to_major_in/goeg6l3/", "text": "Something I noticed in college was there\u2019s a difference between being interested in something, and being so interested in it you\u2019re happy to spend four years studying it intensely and possibly your life working in it.

Here\u2019s some advice though. Major in something you\u2019re passionate about and can see yourself doing as a job, as to not let that spark run out. If you\u2019re interested in a business major I suggest double majoring with sociology, Physcology, a creative arts, or a foreign language. That\u2019ll give you an up in your career, and if business doesn\u2019t work out for you at least you have another option. Good luck!!!", "author": "Inalei_12", "created": 1614029251, "upvotes": 6}}}
