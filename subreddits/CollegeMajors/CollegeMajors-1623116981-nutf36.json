So with this in mind, I am asking around several subs to get an honest opinion.\n\nCurrently I am triple majoring in Accounting, Finance, and MIS/BIS with a minor in Economics, but I have some credits to spare. Because Accounting was my original major, and I am going into it after, I planned on going to undergrad for five years to complete the 150 credits necessary to sit for the CPA exam, this has allowed me to start stacking up majors with the 30 free credits I needed to fill. \n\nAt my school, we have three fields of required classes, 54 credits of gen eds, 33 core business classes, and 15-18 of major specific classes, with 19 credits worth of free electives. All in all, this has allowed me to pursue Accounting & Finance with a minor in Economics in 120 Credits, 30 shy of the 150 mark. I know some of you would have recommended me do this and go to grad school, but I am going into my fourth year and have already committed to five years of undergrad.\n\nWith these 30 extra credits, I have started my third major in MIS, a field many of my professors have said will pair amazingly with accounting; bringing me down to 15 remaining credits. After speaking to my advisors and several of my professors, they agree this is not only doable, but some even recommend it with my situation. \n\nBeing me, I love education, and don't want to waste my money on a semesters worth of random classes, I would rather fill it up with an education that will benefit me in the future. The fourth major I am considering is management; with 12 credits worth of classes (after the two overlapping classes that are allowed), I feel like this is a very plausible option, but I don't know how employers will react. Will people believe quadruple majoring is too much, will they think I overworked my sell or missed out on opportunities other courses would have? In the end I am just asking for your opinions because I believe it will be beneficial for me, and I am willing to explain during interviews my logic behind it.", "author": "outboundsphinx4", "created": 1623116981, "retrieved": 1632846520, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h0zf8h9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nutf36/quadruple_majoring_with_a_minor/h0zf8h9/", "text": "I suspect many employers will not look closely enough at your situation.
