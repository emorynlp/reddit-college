I want your opinions on each major (pros/cons), which one has more income? which one is more needed in the near and far future? Those are the 8, they are all related to computers and data\n\n1. Informatics\n\n2. Information Science and Technology\n\n3. Information Systems\n\n4. Data Sciences\n\n5. CyberSecurity\n\n6. Computer Science\n\n7. Computer Engineering\n\n8.

The ones that need more math will make more money, as a generalization but they're so connected, most jobs will qualify you for more things. Computer science and engineering will probably qualify you for most jobs you will want with the degrees. \n\nconsider reading /r/itcareerquestions and /r/cscareerquestions - they will tell you about different jobs you can get. they can also link you to related subreddits.\n\nI'd avoid more specific degrees - such as cyber security and data sciences - because they pigeonhole you. At the moment, you probably don't want that since you haven't decided yet.", "author": "Worrosp", "created": 1582002613, "upvotes": 1}}}
