I have some questions about college/career. (I'm a 2nd yr in university):**\n\n1. Do you guys think a computer science and biology major is doable? I am a hard worker and I'm not afraid to put the work in. But I know my limitations (new health reasons).\n2. I recently got interested in Comp Sci, IT, & programming related stuff. However, I have never looked at anything comp sci and IT related (terms, school, careers, job outlook, salary, etc.). I have done health science related things (classes, school clubs, volunteering, internships, etc) since like 9th grade so I know everything about that but I do not know where to even begin with comp sci and IT related stuff. Could you guys help me out or guide me?\n3. What are y'alls opinions on doing a Biology and Computer Science double major?\n4. What can I do with a Biology major in computer science/IT/programming?\n5. What are y'alls opinion on taking Chemistry during the summer?\n6. What are y'alls opinion on taking a General Chemistry 1 class and intro Computer science class at the same time during the summer?\n\n**Thank you in advance!**", "author": "ceoofconfusion258", "created": 1589762850, "retrieved": 1632847719, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fqzmv2n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/glr8iu/bio_comp_sci_major_s_some_summer_classes_s/fqzmv2n/", "text": "I dropped out of my bio degree when I was a junior, and ended up in CS. \n\nBio is more of a stepping stone degree. You either do it for premed/dental school etc or to go on to masters or PhD.  Or to teach. \n\nFor CS, expect more math/programming.  For IT, expect more being in charge of a network/setting up accounts/hardware..that\u2019s selling it short, it\u2019s a huge field (and a subset of CS).  But you won\u2019t be doing much (or any) Programming/ software dev.  It\u2019s also certification based, so even with an IT degree, expect to have to get more specialized certs after. \n\nPersonally, I recommend taking the programming course, if you enjoy it and the math doesn\u2019t scare you (usually it\u2019s calc cycle + discrete and/or Linear algebra) - consider CS. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a point in doing both a bio  degree + it/CS. There are grad school programs for the healthcare side of IT you would need.  And for software dev, it\u2019s not going to matter (which is why I don\u2019t care to finish mine).\n\nEdit - \n\nThere are more specialized fields like bioinformatics, but I think that\u2019s it\u2019s own degree/grad school option, rather than double undergrad majors.", "author": "PianoConcertoNo2", "created": 1589770712, "upvotes": 2}}}
