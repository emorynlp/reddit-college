I plan to be either a Spanish teacher or translator, and I know my college has classes that I can try out towards both career paths. Does this sound like a good idea? I'll probably graduate with little to no debt, so I'm not really concerned about that.",

I'm leaning more towards teaching than translation, b/c I want to be able to spread my love for Spanish (probably to students who won't care all that much, but that's beside the point. Even if I can make a small impact, I'll be happy.) I know I can get a translation certificate from my school, so there may be research opportunities there. What sort of classes have you taken for your Spanish major? My school has a list of all the required classes that I need to take, but I'd like to hear about the experience of someone who has actually done it.",
