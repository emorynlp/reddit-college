So as the title says, I want to go to university and major in Nursing but I am not the best at math, and I was wondering if some of you could help me. What do you think is the easiest math class? From my Prerequisite list, there is College Algebra (MAT 110),  Quantitative Reasoning (MAT 114), or  Applied Statistics (STA 270). I don't know if I get to choose, but was thinking of Applied statistics; although I'm not sure how tough the course is. Any advice or thoughts would be helpful.
