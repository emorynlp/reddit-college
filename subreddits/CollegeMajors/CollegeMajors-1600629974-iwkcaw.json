  "title:": "Sophomore girl in college: I don\u2019t know what to major in anymore, I thought I would do Accounting, but now I\u2019m lost",
  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m a sophomore in University and I\u2019m currently in my first accounting class ever (ACCT 201), but I\u2019m starting to realize this may not be right for me. I like having a plan for my future, to feel more secure, but I\u2019m really struggling in this class.\n\nAnd not just like normal struggling that happens with any class, but like I\u2019m having a hard time with the basic principles and it takes a lot of energy for me to do mental math. I thought I would major in accounting, get my CPA and then do that for the rest of my life (I like the clear career path) but I\u2019m beginning to think that accounting isn\u2019t for me- so now I feel very lost.\n\nI\u2019m not great at math or science, and I\u2019m not particularly passionate about anything in school. I\u2019ve taken a lot of classes for the general Ed requirements and haven\u2019t officially declared my major- so I think I still have a little bit of wiggle room. But I have no clue what to do, and any advice/experiences you\u2019d like to share would be very appreciated! Thanks!\n\n\n\n(Also, in your opinion, is an English, psychology or Communications degree useless?)",

      "text": "I'm currently working on my Master's in Accounting. Not all of the accounting courses will be as tough as your first one, and not all of the accounting courses will be focused on math. You're just starting out, so of course it's going to be difficult, you're learning a whole new language! Once you get the basic principles down it will get easier as you get further along.\n\nHave you looked to see if your school provides an accounting lab, or supplemental instruction to help you learn, or have you tried to go to your professor's office hours, or asked the TA for assistance and advice? There are also some really good videos on YouTube that can help you learn the concepts (Depending on what class ACCT 201 is at your university, Farhat's Accounting Lectures are pretty good, though there are other YouTuber's you can find as well).\n\nAs for the other degrees you listed, you can always get a minor in something as well.\n\nYou can also see if your schools career center offers the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Career Report & the Strong Interest Inventory Profile (Strong) for free, as it can help you choose a major, and a career path.\n\nAs for your mental math comment, are you not allowed to use a calculator?\n\nAlso, have you considered it might be your study method? The same study method you use for your other classes might not be working for this class. Have you tried flashcards?",

      "text": "Some people major in areas they are genuinely interested in and end up working in those areas because they need that passion as a fuel for study/work (and they have decent job prospects so why not?).\n\nOthers major in areas they are interested in but find work in different areas, usually because of bad job prospects.\n\nYet others try to avoid majoring (or working) in areas that they are interested in because making their interests into work/study would make them hate such interests.\n\nAnd lastly some choose their majors to something they can get a solid job and wage, so that it would provide a solid support for them to pursue their actual interests in their free time. Everyone is different.\n\nWhy am I listing this? Because Accounting has a reputation of being in the last category, whereas English/Psych/Communication has a huge stigma of being in the second (in rare cases, the first).\n\nI think what you need to do right now is figuring out what values you are looking for in a job and in a major. Do you want to major and work in areas that you find passionate, even though it may have less monetary value in the end? Or do you want to have good working hours and a solid income that you can spend on your true passions? If you choose the former, you definitely need to change majors. Take a bunch of GEs and find your true passion. If you choose the latter...well, u/VitaMint123's pretty much explaining what you should do/expect.",

      "text": "I dont think any degree is useless it all just depends what you plan on doing with it. Like if a Mathmajor decides after college they want to teach music or become a commercial fisherman then that degree was useless. All I'm trying to say is dont really focus on the degree focus more on the job that requires that degree. As you said Accounting (I'm also majoring in that btw) see if you could shadow someone or try to do something to get a good look at what they do day to day and then you'll be able to tell if you enjoy that kind of job and then you'll be more motivated to get the degree for that job. (Also if you're not doing great in accounting its usaully the teacher and or the book)",
