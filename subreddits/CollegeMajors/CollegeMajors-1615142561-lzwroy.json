  "text": "For the past two weeks I've been kinda scared about what my future will look like career wise. I'm a freshman computer science major and last semester my python class was horrible and I'm not doing that much better in java this semster. I just feel like I'm not a good problem solver and my anxiety isn't gonna mix well with this major but problem solving is the most important skill I need. I just don't know how to get better at it. I look at a prompt sometimes and I know exactly what code to write and other times like today Im lost and I begin to think what if this happens on a job and I have a breakdown because then its not for a grade its for a living. And I know there's jobs I can get that won't require coding but Ill still need to be a good problem solver. It was this same way for me in math too. I either have or I don't, there's no in between. So am I overthinking it?",

      "text": "Programming and computer science are very different ways of thinking compared to what many people have done in high school and before. In my intro to CS class, probably like half of the students had never written a line of code before (I hadn't either, except for some really basic html sophomore year of high school) and for this of us with no experience, it was definitely a struggle getting into the programming mindset. I had taken math, history, chemistry, and English classes before, and was doing pretty well in those classes largely because I had been experienced to a similar way of thinking. My first real in depth assignment for my intro to CS class though, I had a very difficult time with grasping object oriented programming and almost missed the deadline. But even though my first class was rough, I stuck with the major because I thought it was interesting and challenging. My intro to CS teacher even told us there were people who got poor grades in his class but then ended up getting PHDs in computer science, and that this one class alone didn't determine how smart we were, or even our programming abilities.\n\nSo I would pass similar advice on to you. your first two classes may not mean much in the long run, it might just be a matter of getting used to programming. Or maybe I'm wrong and you just aren't cut out for it. But it seems like you aren't completely lost in your classes, so if I were you I would take a deep breath and continue trying your hardest. A very important thing for computer science classes that I've noticed is to start early. Because, as I'm sure you have noticed, there might be times you're scratching your head but the assignment is due in 6 hours. So schedule your time well, if you haven't already been doing so, and make sure to go to TA office hours when you are stuck. A personal anecdote is that I was taking a CS class that was supposedly very difficult and a lot of work, so I was really nervous the few weeks before school started up again. I was so nervous, in fact, that I went to every lecture in person, watched the lecture immediately afterwards to make sure I got all of the concepts, and started the programming assignments like the day after they were assigned. Because I was so prepared, I ended up doing really well in the class. Preparation and hardwork will make a huge difference.\n\nLike I alluded to earlier, people with a lot of CS background are going to breeze through early classes, so it might actually be that you're doing fine for your skill level, but you are actually doing below average because like half the class already knows most of the material. If this is the case, there's no remedy other than to keep programming a ton, and do personal projects in order to widen your skillset.",

      "text": "Yes you are over thinking it. Being a good problem solver is important but its only your first semester, you WILL progress, trust the system and be patient. You\u2019re anxious because of the unknown and not being confident in your skills. If you practiced coding and became confident i bet that anxiety will go away. Breaking down on a job wont happen because you spend the first few months being taught your job. School is just for a degree and your job is where you learn. Imagine after 4 years where you will be at. Yes u might still be anxious or worried about work but just look back at how far you\u2019ve come and look back at your first few assignments and how easy those are then. You\u2019ll get there just have to keep practicing and be patient.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a freshman CS major too but I\u2019m only in my first Python class right now. My advice would be to figure out what it is exactly that you don\u2019t understand about a problem and ask about it at office hours. Also there\u2019s a lot of Java/Python \u201ccrash course\u201d videos online to strengthen your foundation. I\u2019ve always struggled at math so I know how frustrating it is for people to just tell you to try harder when it feels like you\u2019re doing everything you can, but what finally helped me in math was: Going back over and correcting homework and quizzes, going to office hours (even if I don\u2019t have any questions, just for extra practice and to verify what\u2019s on the next quiz), and making a list of all the concepts that I\u2019m responsible for each module/chapter and making sure I understand all of it. Hope this helps.",
