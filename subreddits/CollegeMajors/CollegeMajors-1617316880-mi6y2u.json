  "title:": "Marine Biology vs Forensic Science?",
  "text": "I really want to study Marine Biology and go on to work on a research vessel, but I'm also very interested in becoming a Forensic Biologist and solve murder cases. I'd specifically love to solve cold cases. Absolutely none of the colleges in my state have Marine Biology as a major, so I'd have to relocate, which I'm fine with. Forensic Science is offered at at least one university near me. \n\nIt comes down to this: which one has better job security? Which degree is more likely to land me a career upon graduating? Can I even work on a research vessel with just a Bachelor's?",

      "text": "Both of those sound amazing! With marine biology, you'd be hard pressed to find a job without grad school. Jobs can be tough and you'll have to write grants and develop your own research ideas. That being said, studying the natural world is (in my opinion) one of the most rewarding careers out there. If you have the time, you can get hands-on experience as a volunteer at an aquarium, zoo, or rescue and rehab organization to find out if it's right for you.\n\nForensics might be a little easier to find entry-level work straight after your Bachelors, but to get a higher salary and better opportunities, you'd need at least a Masters. Forensics is going to be huge in the next few decades as tech and science play a bigger role in homicide cases. Thanks to shows like Law and Order, juries expect to see strong forensic evidence in court. You'll definitely want to work in a bigger city to get the best salary. It also takes an emotional toll you have to be very cautious and aware of, depending on your role.\n\nDisclaimer: Definitely check out your own research and follow your passions before taking any advice from an internet stranger.",
