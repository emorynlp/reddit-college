Altogether chill, but I overthink things. Something that has torn at my mind since my senior year of high school is my college major. I\u2019m now about to finish the second semester of my freshman year in college. I\u2019m a middle school education major with a focus in English. My senior year, I was so excited to start college and begin my education classes bc teaching was always something I had kept in the back of my mind but never fully considered bc of the stigma around the salary. However, I got over that bc I knew I was passionate about it and I am fortunate enough to not have any undergraduate debt yet. I keep worrying that I\u2019m on the wrong path; that maybe I shouldn\u2019t be a teacher. I\u2019m gay, which concerns me but my sexuality obviously isn\u2019t the topic of classroom discussion. However, everyone knows how parents can be. I have anxiety, probably why I worry so often but that\u2019s also another concern. I love interaction with others but often times it\u2019s draining. I would much rather prefer a career where I interacted with people in small groups rather than large. I had considered counseling/social work, but the more I looked into it the more I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m just lost and venting at this point, I could go on forever \n\nTD;LR: I\u2019m an education major, always worried about if it\u2019s right for me. Had a passion for it before, sometimes I still do. Big groups drain me, but I\u2019ve looked into things like counseling/social work and they don\u2019t interest me either.

You might consider working in a more liberal/diverse school district and you might consider working in a private school or in a school district with a lower student to faculty ratio. You could also be a private tutor, a museum or library educator, etc. I would wait until you get some co op/student teaching experience before you make any decision to give up teaching.\n\n It\u2019s totally normal to have doubts about your major - will you like it, will you do well, is it the best fit for you, etc. - just keep going forward and you\u2019ll figure it out as you go along.
