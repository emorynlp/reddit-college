It\u2019s growing pretty fast and job outlook is really good, so it would offer stability. You can absolutely use it if you find work in anthropology, but if you cannot, you can certainly find employment in something else with GIS. \n\nThis is 100% on computers though, so if you\u2019re not proficient or really like working on them, it might not be the degree for you. Even then, I don\u2019t really like working on computers, but will say that GIS is pretty fun to use and it\u2019s really satisfying to input data and see your results appear.
