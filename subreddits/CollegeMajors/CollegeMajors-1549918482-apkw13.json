I was there because I graduated in 2015 with a Master's of Art and a Batchelors of Fine Arts. Two useless degrees that I switched over from engineering to get.\n\nRight around Calc II I was frustrated at the little 18 year old kids (I was 22 at the time) just breezing along as if diff eq and whatever was addition and multiplication. Seeing that the Master's program I wanted to visit accepted engineering majors or art majors, I switched to art. To my credit, I did amazing in art. I buckled down, worked hard, and graduated and got a masters too.\n\nHowever, I realized after that I don't care about art enough to get a job in it. I self sabotage. So, I joined the army because at least there I'd get a good paycheck and they'd tell me what to do... AND I'd get a tech job. I scored a 97 on my asvab, high scores in all areas. If I went navy, I'd be in a Nuclear submarine working on the reactors. Then had multiple stress fractures and was discharged.\n\nSo, now, I have a chance to go back to school and get a degree that would help me land a tech job that I want. My problem is that I don't know what I should go for. I could get an architectural degree, major or masters. I like the idea of doing something with CAD. (You'll notice my other posts on reddit are all 3d printing related.) I'm not a programmer, that's still true as it was before. By my scores I SHOULD be amazing at it.\n\nI'm just now starting the research. Is product design a major? Ohhhh, it is. Hm. Maybe that would be good. That's what I wanted to do in the first place.
