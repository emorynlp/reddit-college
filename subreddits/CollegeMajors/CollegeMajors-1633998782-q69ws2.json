  "text": "I was gonna do communication but I saw data that said they have high unemployment. Don't wanna get an English degree either cause I think it's on a similar level. I was passionately interested in doing journalism for a long time and I still sorta am but I've heard becoming a journalist is somewhat difficult and they don't make much money.  I've been interested in animation, media criticism and media in general for years. My dad said I should do economics but I'm not very good at math. I made a google docs of jobs I think could be cool\n\n* Archivist\n* Librarian \n* Animation industry (Grueling work and hard to get in though so idk)\n* Journalist \n* Storyboard artist\n* Aquaculture (Specifically, working in a fish hatchery or something of the sort. Fish are cool)\n* Farmhand\n* Chef \n* English teacher\n* Art teacher\n* Mechanic(?)\n* Interested in art or music but don't see getting into any art thing as realistic\n* Interior Designer",
