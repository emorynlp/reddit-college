I am currently searching for business majors who have time to service a student-led organization called Beyond The Five that assists low-income and low-resource students by providing them free classes. Our courses are self-paced ranging from AP Latin to Microbiology to Shakespearian Literature to College Applications to even Complex Analysis. The courses are run on Canvas, and we use Discord as the medium to for office hours and general chatting. The course instructors are high school and college students who thrived in the given class. Many of our instructors are excelling undergraduate students from the highest of institutions, such as Johns Hopkins and Cornell. Business majors will advise the organization on further steps to take as well as any suggestions that you all may have. This is great practice for the major, as this is a real life application that you have been given! If you are interested, please DM me for further information! Visit our website at https://beyondthefive.com as well!", "author": "EOHFA", "created": 1587480179, "upvotes": 1}, "fn12idt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/fynrjy/i_have_a_bs_in_business_administration_looking_to/fn12idt/", "text": "Most masters programs are 2 years long.
