I love hands on. Love talking with people. Very creative but have taken a lot of STEM classes no art classes. If I went with biology or neuroscience would try to become a psychiatrist or maybe a surgeon. I would like the hands on aspect of a surgeon and the relationships with patients as a psychiatrist. I just would miss not being able to be creative and make/design things.", "author": "Glad-Employee6604", "created": 1602914161, "retrieved": 1632847184, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g9qoj9n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jcpw5c/help_with_majorcareer/g9qoj9n/", "text": "It sounds like you actually want 4 things: \n1.
