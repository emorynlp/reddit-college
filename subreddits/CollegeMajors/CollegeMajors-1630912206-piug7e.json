I\u2019ve worked part time as a teaching assistant for over a year and have thought about becoming a teacher more specifically a secondary Geography/English teacher. However I also have a deep passion for politics in particular social policies such as education and health care so I have also thought about studying to be a political analyst. \n\nIn high school I really enjoyed studying English, Geography (in particular human geography) and Psychology. I\u2019d like to help people and would like to stray away from pursuing a desk job. \n\nBefore I make my final decision does anyone have any other career/degree choices which would fit me?", "author": "idk_ugh", "created": 1630912206, "retrieved": 1632958211, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
