  "text": "Hello! I stumbled across this sr on a nightly journey of stressing about university and was surprised to see the frequent mention of Statistics. \n\nWhat is the outlook for that field? I'm currently a Computer Science major, plenty of time to switch if need be. I originally did this major because math is my jam, but I quickly, and stupidly, found out that there's a whole lot more to CS than I've been finding enjoyable. My university has a BS in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics as well as a certificate in Data Science. \n\nI think a large part of me is still stuck on the financial aspect of things and I fear switching to a major where I won't make anything after graduation, and it's putting a serious strain on the enjoyment of my studies. \n\ntldr; what is the outlook for a statistics major?",
