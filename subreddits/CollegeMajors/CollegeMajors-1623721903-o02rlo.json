If you are interested in working directly with high-risk communities, social work would work well. But please be mindful that you will most likely need a Master's of Social Work along with the proper licensing for most entry-level positions in this field. If you are interested in leadership roles in organizations or non-profits that support high-risk communities, I would suggest business administration as your major. But keep in mind that might have to get a master's in public administration to further your career. If you are simply interested in social justice but have no intention or are unsure if you want even to pursue careers in these fields, I would say you should major in sociology. You'll examine a lot of interesting things in the social justice movement.", "author": "strangercats13", "created": 1624937186, "upvotes": 1}, "h28dqs9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o02rlo/what_should_i_major_in_if_im_interested_in_social/h28dqs9/", "text": "Some colleges have a public policy major which might be your thing! You usually have to double major in something else so you could pick political science, psychology, sociology, a cultural studies major, but you can (at least where I go) tailor your classes to fit with your topic area.

You could realistically pick anything in the humanities and be absolutely fine. However, obviously this is a tricky field to base a career on so I'd want to be secure in your major choice.  I think u/SaltSnowball's suggestion of Economics is a great idea, it does have the Social Justice opportunity as well (See AOC) and it does have it's own merits.\n\nHowever, of course there are many ways you can influence this area that you're passionate about, so I would take some time to identify career paths you are interested in, independent of SJ, and view them in that SJ framework if you so chose. For instance, my Grandfather did a lot of budgeting work with poor families and received a Queen's service medal for it. There is a lot of ways you can work in this 'Field' of SJ without being directly connected to activism", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1623741515, "upvotes": 1}, "h1t9px9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o02rlo/what_should_i_major_in_if_im_interested_in_social/h1t9px9/", "text": "I\u2019d suggest pre-law, Economics, or social work.", "author": "SaltSnowball", "created": 1623730013, "upvotes": 1}}}
