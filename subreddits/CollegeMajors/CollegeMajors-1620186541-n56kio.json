  "title:": "Are communications or journalism majors worth it?",
  "text": "I was thinking that communications would be a cool major, but then I read that it was apparently a useless degree. So then I did some research and journalism seemed like something I would enjoy, but apparently that\u2019s a useless major as well. Are these degrees worth it? If I had to choose I would go with journalism, but I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "If you're doing Communications or Journalism, I would definitely feel uneasy going into the workforce with that piece of paper. These are fields that serve best as a compliment to another major, either as a double major or a minor. \n\nIf you want to go into Journalism, you're probably better off contacting your student magazine (If you have one) and see if you're able to write a piece. The portfolio is gonna look better than the degree in the long run\n\nBesides that, we need more info: What do you want to do for a career? Why do you think these majors will help with that?",

          "text": "For a career, I want to maybe write for a publication (like a magazine or news site or something), ideally. That\u2019s kind of why I thought journalism would be a good fit. Communications, I won\u2019t lie, just sounded cool, but it seemed like it allowed for some job opportunities until I did more research. Also I do not have a student magazine or newspaper or anything at my school. (I\u2019m still in high school btw)",

              "text": "Ahh, well maybe part of your uni criteria can be looking for one with a good student magazine. I definitely think Journalism + something that can compliment it well (Like any particular area you'd want to write about?) might be the right choice",
