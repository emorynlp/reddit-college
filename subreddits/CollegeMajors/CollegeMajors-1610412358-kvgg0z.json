  "text": "I absolutely love CS, finance, and electrical engineering. I plan on taking 5 years in college and doing a double major. Either CS,finance or CS, EE. The perks of CA and EE is that I make more money and get to work in the more computer side. CS and finance means i will be better at investing. Also can you double major at any school?",

      "text": "I would say go with Computer Engineering if your school has that. It\u2019s basically a mix between CS and EE. \n\nFinance is really just a business degree with extra math, and it doesn\u2019t really teach you personal finance or investing the way you think it does. You can learn all that stuff on your own without a degree.",
