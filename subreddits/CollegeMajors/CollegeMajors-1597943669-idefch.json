Considering switching my major to animal ecology with a fisheries and aquatic sciences option because I think I\u2019ll enjoy it more. After reading a bunch of stuff from people on reddit I think that agronomy would be easier to get a job in but I\u2019m not sure. Would anyone here know if animal ecology would be a good major to actually get a job?
