My interest in video game design led to me becoming interested in a computer science major my junior year, but I\u2019m unsure if that major is right for me, the main reason being I\u2019m terrible at math. I\u2019m in AP Calculus right now and it\u2019s really hard to keep even a B average. I have to do a lot of extra credit work to ensure my grade is an A/close to an A. I did alright in Pre-AP Pre-Cal but still struggled, pretty good in Algebra 2, and horrible in Algebra in eighth grade. I can understand the material if I study and practice enough, but it takes more time for things to \u2018click\u2019 for me than with others. I took two computer programming classes, one junior year and another this year, but they\u2019re really easy and the bare basics, so I\u2019m worried that when I get to college, I\u2019ll be biting off much more than I can chew. I\u2019m not sure what my concentration would be in, but I\u2019m leaning towards software development or cybersecurity. Game design still interests me, but I\u2019m aware that I need to be more realistic.\n\nAs a result of my indecision regarding computer science, I\u2019ve been considering psychology. I feel like I\u2019d be much better at it, as it doesn\u2019t involve nearly as much math. I enjoy talking to people and helping them despite being shy, so I would love to hear out other\u2019s problems. The aspect of psychology that scares me most, however, is giving clients advice; I\u2019m worried that I will unintentionally hurt them or cause more harm than good when attempting to console them. That, and my conversational skills just aren\u2019t very good. My favorite subject is English, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have much of a problem writing or reading about psychology. For this reason, I was thinking about going into forensic psychology or health psychology\u2014something where I can still interact with others, but not have them depend on me, if that makes sense. I hadn\u2019t taken a psychology course at all until this semester.\n\nPsychology has never interested me much in the past, though, and computer science seems like something I really want to do. I\u2019m just fearful of pursuing a major I know I will face serious difficulties in. I don\u2019t mind putting work in, but the courses that go with computer science seem so hefty and tedious that I\u2019m worried my attempts to succeed will fall flat, since I\u2019m not good at math in the first place.\n\nSome other information about me: I love to read, enjoy creative writing, drawing, and playing video games. I\u2019m interested in learning more about how people think and feel, and also interested in helping the environment. My biggest goal in life is to make something or contribute to something that helps people in some way.\n\nIf possible, could anyone provide some insight as to which major seems a better fit for me? If needed, I can provide more information.", "author": null, "created": 1582064914, "retrieved": 1632957375, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fi8p207": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/f603hd/trying_to_choose_between_psychology_and_computer/fi8p207/", "text": "You don\u2019t really seem into physch. Some schools have programs specifically for Game Design and other allow you to go into school Undecided and then switch into a Major. You also could be able to get into schools for computer science. Anyways I think you should follow that path. It\u2019s good to challenge yourself in math.", "author": "andrewmichaudd", "created": 1582245126, "upvotes": 1}, "fi1xr5j": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/f603hd/trying_to_choose_between_psychology_and_computer/fi1xr5j/", "text": "No major is difficult if you put the time in. Its a one time entry. You struggle for 4 years but will pay off forever once you\u2019re done. I\u2019m a comp sci major so im a little biased. The math part is difficult but dont let that shy you away. It does get repetitive and easier the better you get at it. In college you\u2019ll learn how to study and that will help u do well. For me it was always cramming and watching a bunch of youtube videos. It was my method of studying/learning and i do just fine. Game design and the game industry is kinda bad imo. Its prolly the worst field for a comp sci major so be prepared to hear that. Theres 100s of other things you can do besides game design that u might wanna do the more you learn.", "author": "VIllainLife", "created": 1582066977, "upvotes": 1}, "fi1uy96": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/f603hd/trying_to_choose_between_psychology_and_computer/fi1uy96/", "text": "Pretty much any major you go into will have subjects that are difficult to understand, you should just consider whether you\u2019d be willing to put in the time and effort to understand those concepts.\n\nYou\u2019ll be given the tools in a psych major to properly help people so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about giving people bad advice.\n\nI would personally go in undecided and shadow some courses (or professionals) in both majors while I decide.", "author": "Vivalasvegas614", "created": 1582065304, "upvotes": 2}}}
