The problem is, I don't know what else to do. I'm not particularly passionate or exceptionally good at anything, and if I am its not something I want to spend thousands of dollars on (ex. I like writing and philosophy but there is no way in hell I'm spending money on a degree like that). I always thought that something science related would be cool, but I've don't think I'm very good at that kinda stuff (I'm struggling with my college bio class rn lol)\n\nNormally, I wouldn't worry about it, but I'm got to start applying to colleges soon (after I retake my SAT because my ocd was acting up the day I took my first one and I proceeded to have a mental breakdown \\^: ). I was able to apply for scholarships and I have a feeling they'll ask me what I want to do and I at least want to have an answer.\n\nAnxiety has been creeping up on me lately because of this. I don't necessarily care where I end up going, but I know my family has high hopes for me.\n\nI guess I'm not really asking for advice on what to pick, but more so how to pick it and maybe some way to deal with college anxiety.", "author": "somethingeevee", "created": 1600325875, "retrieved": 1632847541, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"g6244u9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/iueb7a/struggling_to_decide/g6244u9/", "text": "First of all, deep breaths here.
