  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in college in aerospace engineering - but I\u2019ve recently come to realize that I just\u2026 don\u2019t give a fuck about it. \n\nI know people always say to \u201cchoose the major in which you\u2019re passionate about\u201d but on the other hand, is it really THAT bad to pursue a major that will pay more at the end of the day? \n\nCase in point, I\u2019ve been jobless, still looking for internships, while my girlfriend will be returning to Microsoft and will be salaried as opposed to being paid hourly as well as receive a 5K bonus check. To me, it seems like there are way more opportunities in the tech field as opposed to AE. I just feel like I\u2019ve wasted 3 years of my life so far in a major that I frankly do not care about. \n\nWhat do I do here? I don\u2019t think I can just switch majors as that\u2019ll put me through at least two more years of school (which I don\u2019t want for financial reasons). I\u2019m also thinking, maybe the grass isn\u2019t all that green on the other side, either. But the money is there, in tech - and because I\u2019m really regretting going through with my major. \n\nPlease help me out here! I\u2019m tired of looking for jobs that don\u2019t care about AE majors and constantly hearing about how my peers are making thousands in their tech internships.",

      "text": "AE is a pretty good major. People typically recommend going with a more fundamental/broad degree like MechE unless you are sure you want to work in Aero, but even with AE, you should be able to get a variety of technical/engineering jobs.\n\nYou should look at your school's catalog and see what courses are required for the fields you're interested in. The STEM majors have a good amount of overlap in the first couple of years, so you may be further along some of those other majors than you think. Depending on your school and how prerequisite-heavy courses tend to be, you might be able to start jumping right in to more advanced courses.\n\nAre you able to add a minor to your degree? A technical degree (such as in AE) with a minor in CS/CpE/Math/Stats/DataSci might be enough coding exposure to be able to get into tech. People routinely jump from unrelated STEM majors into tech by working on some personal projects/masters/bootcamp/studying leetcode. A minor in one of those fields that will give you programming experience every semester until you graduate might be a good way to get your foot in the door. Even if you can't go for a minor, once you are done with school you could look into work at the intersection of AE/ME and \"tech,\" like drones, satellites, software for use in aero like embedded, electric vehicles, consumer electronics, robotics, etc.",

      "text": "Maybe this is one of those \"the grass is always greener\" problems. Yeah, tech can pay very well in top tech companies, but a lot of those jobs go to very smart, highly motivated people. Do you think that you could force yourself to be that motivated and driven for something you are so-so about? Keep in mind that what's attracting you to tech is the compensation and benefits, which is fine, but you don't even know if you like programming. You might hate it, a lot of people do, but then again some love it.\n\nI'm a CS major, and let me say, there are a lot of CS majors who are so insanely committed to programming that is very hard to compete with. CS has a lot of extracurricular stuff associated with it, also. In order to get these jobs at tech companies, I've heard stories of people taking 6 months off of work, and do nothing but study technical interview problems in order to do well in the interviews and get the job. I know friends who pour 15+ hours a week into learning new software and frameworks, in order to get practical skills. This is often a necessity, since computer science is an academic discipline where the course material is more theoretical, and you have to learn the practical stuff on your own. This isn't to say you can't get a CS job with just a degree and not a large passion for the field, but in order to get those high salaries, you often do.\n\nI know CS majors who didn't do a lot to get internships or prep for interviews, and they aren't working at top top companies, making 6 figs. By all means try out programming, see if you like it, but there's plenty of money in aerospace, and CS isn't always as lucrative as it is portrayed.",

          "text": "I see what you\u2019re saying, but to me I\u2019m barely interested in AE as it is, so my line of thinking is more of if I\u2019m not going to enjoy either very much anyways, why not go for the field that is in infinite demand and has the potential to pay better? I know that eventually aero could pay off, but in the long run I\u2019d rather study for months in preparation for those technical interviews than continue to pursue jobs for a long time in an industry that has a couple of AE for their most complicated tasks and are only really looking for ME at best. \n\nI saw a post earlier today (and I\u2019m paraphrasing) that said that you\u2019re going to hate your job even if you\u2019re in the field you want to be in, so make money so you\u2019ll be happier in the future. \n\nI\u2019m aware that engineering in of itself will always pay well, but I don\u2019t think being greedy is inherently bad, especially for peace of mind in the future. \n\nAlso to address your comment about whether or not I\u2019ll like it, I\u2019ve been learning to like it a lot more than earlier. I had to take a \u201cCS for engineers\u201d class that was run pretty terribly which disillusioned me to programming at first, but now that I\u2019m taking a CS class for CS students I\u2019ve come to realize that yeah, programming is pretty cool. \n\nI guess the best word for what I\u2019m in right now is somewhat of a \u201cmid-college\u201d crisis?",

              "text": "CS is not really in \"infinite demand\" like people say. CS is actually really competitive because there are so many people majoring in it, hell, go to /r/cscareerquestions and you'll see people who have applied to 1000 jobs, done dozens of technical interviews, and still haven't gotten jobs. Not to say that this is the norm, but especially at the entry level, you could easily have a hard time finding a job with a CS degree, as hard as finding a job with an engineering degree I would bet.\n\nPlus CS CAN pay better than other engineering degrees, but I would really say that's like for the top 5%-10% of developers. It's really those top tech companies where programmers end up making 200k, and like I said, most programmers don't work there. I could say the same about finance, which pays more than CS at the top levels, but most finance people don't work at IB Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc. just like most software developers don't work at google, Microsoft. I wouldn't tell a guy to major in finance because investment bankers are making 500k a year after 4 years of experience, right? Because that's not the norm.\n\nIs it really true that you'll end up hating your job no matter what? Some people definitely like their jobs, or at least tolerate it. Although I think a lot of that has to do with workplace environment, and not necessarily even what you're doing. \n\nBut really, my main point is that whether you like CS or not should be the deciding factor. If you dislike programming, getting a job in programming is just not a good idea. But if you do end up taking more CS classes (like you have been doing), and you figure out you like it, then definitely do the switch. I would say at least take data structures and a couple of electives before deciding, if you can.",
