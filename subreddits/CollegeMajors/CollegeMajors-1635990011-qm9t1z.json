  "text": "Ok so i saw another person write something similar and since I've been struggling i decided to try it out.\n\nI'm a senior in highschool, with a gpa of 3.15? I think? Anyway i have no real passions or interests. I chose a BA with a major in bio with a minor in psychology (weird i know) because those where the only things i generally liked/found simple in highschool. Not very interested in the medical field (in terms of biology), if anything i guess  dentistry or veterinary.\nTo make matters worse i have anxiety and 0 social skills. And honestly not to sound like a bitch but i barely want to be a functioning member of society, but i know i have to do SOMETHING....anything. so literally any advise or opinions would be greatly appreciated\n\nEven if you got to the end and read all of this clownery, thank you.",

      "text": "Senior in hs here. Although I'm still struggling with choosing a major, I think I could give u some tips on the anxiety and social skill thing. I myself is a pretty quite and shy person and I used to believe I have 0 social skill. But this year, I've been trying to relax a bit more and not thinking too much (I still do but not as much as I used to) about when talking to strangers or people I barely know. When u feel relaxed, u can start talking to ppl normally, just try to be friendly and kinda act like u want to get to know them. U don't have to come up to them every single time. Overthinking can make these situations worse. It's a skill so u can train to get better. Anxiety, I have them too, but like I said, just chill out a bit, you will feel relieved or lighter I'd say idk if that makes any sense to u. So, try to do something small that u wouldn't usually do and start from there, it worked for me so I wanna share my experience, u can try to see if it works for u too. GL.",

          "text": "Yea i get what u mean. I've been pushing myself recently, especially since i just turned 18 and now have to start doing lots of \"grown up\" things by myself. I'm usually more relaxed at something when I've had time to get the hang of it but i worry that jobs aren't gonna be as patient as everything and everyone has been so far. Thank you :)",

      "text": "Go to community college first and take a wide variety of classes to see what you like and I meant a wide variety such as archaeology, human geography, oceanography, art, music, sociology, etc. it\u2019s less money and most likely when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have already earned a decent amount of credits and will figure out what you really enjoy.",

      "text": "Junior in college here. I was kind of in a similar position where I didn't have any real passions or interests, plus not much as far as social skills. I ended up going to college before I sorted all of that out and I regret it. It's been *very* stressful, and a huge waste of time and money. \n\nBased on my personal experience (so don't take the following too seriously), I would advise that if you have the opportunity to do so -- delay going to college. Maybe take a few classes at a community college first, or go to a technical school or go ahead and jump into the workforce. You can always go to college later on, once you've figured out what you really want to do.",
