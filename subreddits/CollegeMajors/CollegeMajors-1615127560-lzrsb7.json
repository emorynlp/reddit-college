I should be getting a clearer idea about what major i want to choose but it\u2019s been really confusing. Till now, i am great in biology and chemistry and decent in physics. In terms of my math grades it depends on how much work i put in but i am no genius in mathematics i get normal grades(not too high not low). The medical field has been really intriguing but my brother will almost finish med and that is making me doubt that choice. I am slightly thinking about veterinary medicine. Can anyone provide me with any piece of advice?", "author": "Illiteratemf", "created": 1615127560, "retrieved": 1632956866, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"gq4leal": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lzrsb7/major/gq4leal/", "text": "If you are not good at math, skip anything engineering related (ex: mechanical or biomedical engineering) What are you interested in?
