I know I want to major in math and also study computer science. In a perfect world I think I would go for a double BS in math and computer science, but that doesn't seem like it will work out due to other requirements/programs I am working on. \n\nCurrently I don't have a 100% clear idea of what I want to do in the future, but I do know that I would like to study math or computer science at the graduate level at some point in my life. I am interested in AI and human/computer interaction as well as algorithms and the intersections between computer science and math. I also wouldn't be opposed to working as a programmer for a while, and seeing if I like that. In general, I know I'm interested in these two subjects and kind of want to see where my life takes me, I don't want to settle on a plan too soon. \n\nWith that in mind, do you think math BS with cpsc minor or a double BA would offer me more flexibility and opportunities to explore my interests further on? Does a BA (as opposed to a BS) make it harder to get hired or get into grad school?
