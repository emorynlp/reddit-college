  "text": "Can anyone help me think this through? I have an opportunity to return to college. I took one semester of community college 10 years ago. I now am a stay at home mom to 3 kids. If I could pick anything at all, if money and time were not an issue, I would double major in finance and economics simply because I\u2019m very interested in both subjects. However I don\u2019t think taking out the student loans I would eventually need is very feasible since at most I\u2019d only be able to work part time unless I could manage to work from home. I want something to fall back on if something happened and I needed to support our family, and as much as I stress how important education is to my children, I want to set a good example for them too- right now I feel like I\u2019m all talk and no action. I haven\u2019t seen any trades I\u2019m particularly interested in, and I don\u2019t want to go into nursing. Any advice would be much appreciated!",

      "text": "Thank you everyone! I\u2019ve done some research, and it looks like there\u2019s a decent amount of accounting jobs you can do from home or only in an office part time. My community college offers an associates in business and works with an upper-level college (I guess is what you\u2019d call it? Only offers junior and senior level classes) to ensure that all of the credits you receive will transfer to them. I feel like an associates in business is a faster goal to reach- I want a piece of paper saying I did it as much as I wanted all the stickers I could get on my sticker chart in kindergarten so I guess it\u2019s just very motivating for me \ud83d\ude02. If I know it\u2019s a degree I can be relatively certain of using, the student loans are less of an issue although I still plan to avoid them as much as possible.\n\nHow do I go about finding scholarships? A lot of what I\u2019ve seen seems more applicable to people going directly from high school to college...",

      "text": "I'm also a 30-something returning to school.  It's doable!\n\nMaybe pursue a work study job while you go to school.  These are almost always part-time and very easy work, but I have heard of individuals, especially older students, getting regular work at the schools while they take their classes.  Send out some emails to different departments in whatever school you are thinking of going to.  Also, my college offers childcare on campus, maybe you can find a school that offers the same.",

      "text": "I\u2019m no expert, but here\u2019s what I think: I think it\u2019s entirely possible to get a college education while you are also a parent to three. It\u2019s going to be hard but there are easier ways to go about things than the conventional route. In my opinion, so long as you\u2019re picking a major that is something you can do, are willing to learn more, and is in demand, I don\u2019t think it much matters where you go to get that education. Of course program accreditation, good professors, and opportunities outside of the classroom are going to be helpful, but the main goal is for you to have an opportunity to build your skills in a field. Night classes and online university may be your best bets for management purposes. Some personal piece of advice: figure out what\u2019s important to you when it comes to your major. To some people, they may just pick a major that they know they can do and is in demand in order to better provide for their families. Be clear on your endgoal.",
