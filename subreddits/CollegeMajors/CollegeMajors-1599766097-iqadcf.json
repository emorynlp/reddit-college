Will appreciate any feedback!", "text": "College apps are approaching and i have a slight idea of what i want to do. \n\nA scene I would love to be is in a museum or a zoo/aquarium.  Id also wouldn\u2019t mind spending my life traveling working with organizations & nonprofits or traveling with research teams for wildlife expeditions.  \n\nNot very specific on what id do but those settings are ideal for me. Even if i start off on working at camp sites for kids. I just need to know what major to start on! \n\nMy set of skills are pretty basic. Im introverted but will speak my mind in small group settings. Im also very bad at math ... but very cooperative & good with others? \n\n\nI DO NOT plan on getting a masters or a phd. I probably plan to spend 2-4 more years of school after getting my GED\n\n\nThrow out any careers/majors at me, big or small", "author": "tommynooky", "created": 1599766097, "retrieved": 1632956840, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g4qfvh7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/iqadcf/undecided_on_what_major_and_career_i_should/g4qfvh7/", "text": "Expeditionary research is extremely restrictive, typically to either specialized individuals (think mountain climbing, whitewater, and other overlanding/expeditionary experts) or academics with a masters or PhD.
