Why not go for a psych major with korean minor or something like that? Minors seem like they mean a lot when you're in college, but once you graduate the value drops to basically nothing. It essentially tells your future employer \"I have a little knowledge in this area\". \n\nIMO minors are for what you are interested in. Minoring in a language might be one of the best majors because you could walk out knowing how to speak that language. \n\nI have a few friends who graduated in seemingly random majors and then went to other countries to teach english (not knowing the native language). They come back to the US with these amazing stories and experiences.\n\nUltimately your major isn't as important as you think it is. If I were you, I'd look into potential jobs that you would want, then head to LinkedIn or something and find people with that job title and see what they majored in.\n\n(I'm a software engineer and I have coworkers who studied computer science, physics, math, and bio-chemistry. It's important... but not that important)", "author": "travishummel", "created": 1580336470, "upvotes": 1}}}
