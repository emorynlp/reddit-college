I also like poetry and traditional art. (I'm not talented enough to go for an art degree however)\n\nI'm creative, and good at empathizing with people. However, I don't want to go into social work or anything in the medical field that involves direct contact with patients. I communicate better via technology, in person communication can be difficult for me. \n\nI've taken a forensic science course and really enjoyed that, but upon researching careers, I didn't find any I was interested in. I enjoy science, especially natural and earth sciences. \n\nI'm not any good at math, at all. It is my weak subject.\n\nI also have the odd talent of being able to analyze information and interpret it to others. My mother always called it the gift of \"dumbing things down\", not to offend. \n\nAny suggestion would be helpful, and I will research each one. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR I am creative, with an artistic mind, a love for the natural sciences, good communication skills, emphatic, but bad in-person skills. I work better alone. Please no math centered degrees, that's my weak point. Any suggestions would be helpful, thank you.", "author": "rascalsnags", "created": 1597887816, "retrieved": 1632847596, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"g39jeu1": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/id181r/degrees_for_people_who_suck_at_math_but_like/g39jeu1/", "text": "If you're good at \"dumbing things down\" and science you might want to consider technical writing as a career, lol. IDK much about the field, but my aunt works as one and that seems to be what the job is like: you talk to scientists/people who know a lot about a specific topic, and then you collate that info and write it in a way that's presentable to the layperson. I think a lot of medical companies need technical writers, so a double degree in communications/English and biology could be a good idea.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1598724517, "upvotes": 2}, "g27896i": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/id181r/degrees_for_people_who_suck_at_math_but_like/g27896i/", "text": "You\u2019d need to have pretty good soft skills to be successful as a comm major, but if you get lucky you could get into online PR that doesn\u2019t require too much in person stuff. But being successful in general does require you to do a lot of networking, so I would recommend trying to improve your soft skills during college, there are lots of ways to do this. But I do know of many introverted accountants, and accounting isn\u2019t very math intensive but not sure it\u2019ll please your passions in the natural sciences.", "author": "editedbylp", "created": 1597920342, "upvotes": 2}, "g26zcn4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/id181r/degrees_for_people_who_suck_at_math_but_like/g26zcn4/", "text": "If i were you i would probably major in chemistry or something like biology (preferably genetics). They offer a lot of career opportunities and they are not at all math heavy degrees though they are still difficult to obtain. Also having an artistic and an analytical mindset helps a lot with these majors so i think you would enjoy it.", "author": "nevermind0275", "created": 1597911053, "upvotes": 2}}}
