My highschool major is economics, law, and trade. I have a slight problem and that is, I can't decide what should I major in, at university. I'm thinking of majoring in either law (yes, I can get my undergrad degree in law here, unlike in the US or Canada), political science, or economics. Economics is my least favorite of the least, so I'm not sure why I even put it up as an option.\n\nI don't have a political science class in school, but I do have a law class, and I absolutely love it. I had a constitutional arrangement class when I was a freshman - which gave me an insight into government and how it works, thus why I also wanna go and study political science - I also loved that as well.\n\nAnyway, I'm really struggling to decide whether I want an undergrad degree in law or in political science, so it would be great if someone could point out the pros and cons of both majors.\n\nAlso, I think I can get into any top university (not that there are many here...) in my country because my grades have all been A's so far, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlso, also, I, at least currently, plan on getting a masters degree in whichever major I end up getting an undergrad degree in.", "author": null, "created": 1593555460, "retrieved": 1632957854, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fyu69i6": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hixlwd/should_i_major_at_law_political_science_or/fyu69i6/", "text": "An undergrad in Law only makes sense if you intend on going to Law School afterwards to become a lawyer", "author": "yellochoco44", "created": 1595389096, "upvotes": 2}}}
