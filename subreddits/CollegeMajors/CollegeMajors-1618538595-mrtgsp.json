      "text": "I don't know about Canada, but I study a BSBA Accounting and BSBA Finance (Banking) and General Economics minor in the United States as a college senior. From my experience in college (and studying Accounting on my own), the structure of financial statements and procedures are similar to all countries. \n\nLearning about investing and banking has helped me a lot financially in life, so assuming you can learn any financial literacy skills, you will be set for life.\n\nI should note that while I have both degree paths, I enjoy finance more than Accounting and plan to get a CFP (Certified Financial planner) or CFA (Charted Financial Advisor). \n\nThere are many certifications other than just CPA, such as Charted Financial Examiner (CFA) or Charted Managerial Accountant (CMA), etc.",
