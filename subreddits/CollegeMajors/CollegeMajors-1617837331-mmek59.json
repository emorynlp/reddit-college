  "title:": "I changed my major 3 times. Here's what I've learned from that experience",
  "text": "I began college in Fall 2019 as a linguistics major. Almost immediately knowing I wanted to pursue something else, I changed my major to political science a semester later. Another semester I switched to geology. Then finally, I stuck with computer engineering. I spent weeks trying to figure out the thing I felt comfortable with the most. In the end, this is what I learned:\n\n1. It's not about the degree, it's about the career. Always plan your career path first, then work backwards from there. Make sure you have this defined. You don't want to graduate without knowing precisely what you want to do with your degree. This is why you are in college. I have found the [BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm) helpful in looking at good careers. Use the search box to locate careers you would be interested in. Read about them. Check out the job outlook tab. A lot of interesting information can be read from that, among many other things. \n\n2. If you don't find your current major interesting but still find it employable, stick with it. This is of course so long as you actually don't hate it. College majors were never really meant to be interesting. They are mostly rigorous and usually somewhat mundane. It's your responsibility to make it fun. Pursue extracurricular activities related to your major, try out research, and get to know your major-related professors. \n\n3.  Speak with professional advisors affiliated with each major department of your interest. Specifically, those who teach courses in your major. In my freshman year, I did this around 5 times and I had the opportunity to meet so many interesting people. Ask them what your major of interest will entail. The most difficult thing about it, the most fun thing about it. Everything on your mind. In these times of covid, ask for a 15 minute zoom meeting. They will have a lot to say. \n\n4. Diversify your classes, except for those you absolutely hate. By this I mean if you're willing to get a taste of everything, take a course in physics/chemstry, mathematics, humanities, and social science. I took mostly humanities/social science courses freshman year and I do strongly regret that. It not only contributed to me potentially graduating late, but it didn't get me a new perspective.\n\n     &nbsp; - I hated math in high school. In fact, I dropped pre-calculus senior year. But when I entered college and finally decided to take a calculus course for the first time, I actually enjoyed it. The calmness of being in a lecture, not feeling pressured to learn new material every day, and learning at a steady pace has made me look at math from a completely different perspective. This got me to feel more comfortable with taking advanced calculus subjects later on. My experience can apply to any other other subject- humanities, life science, physics, you name it.\n\n\n5. Don't waste too much time second-guessing. Understand that the sooner you figure out your major, the better. Of course there is no rush, but at some point you want to be prepared to graduate on time.\n\nI'm pretty happy with my major of choice. It took me a while to figure that out, but I couldn't be happier that I finally found something that I know I want to continue pursuing. Best of luck to all on this academic adventure",

      "text": "Get a degree in what your interest is. Yes interest. I got a bachelor's in accounting but my interests are politics and economics. I had to take micro and macroeconomics like any business major but it wasn't until after graduation that I found out economics was the most interesting field to me. \n\nAccounting isn't my interest, nor what I'm doing as a job 3 years later. Economics is my real interest, but I can only say I should've been an economics major in retrospect.\n\nDisclaimer: that's not to say my accounting degree isn't useful, no it'll definitely help me move up in the company I'm at right now. But I'm not working in accounting, I'm working in sales and marketing and I could still be doing the same thing with an economics degree.",

          "text": "Yeah, I totally understand. I should clarify, the main reason why I said it's not necessarily important for your degree to align with interest is because the more fields you find interesting, the more likely you will end up switching your major repeatedly without having felt decided. This is sort of what I encountered my freshman year. I usually like to keep it simple. Stick to one thing, and if you don't hate it, don't quit it. This varies from person to person, that's true!",

I'm debating going back to geology, because ATM, I want to learn japanese and linguistics. Thanks for the link btw. I'm going to look at careers. Peace and if you do answer my question, I appreciate it.",

          "text": "No worries. I think geology is a good major and there are a number of paths you can pursue with that degree. It's just that for me personally, it wasn't as math heavy and technology-intensive as I was hoping for like in my current major. Feel free to check out r/geologycareers or read the list of AMAs [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/3bg9hj/list_of_previous_ama_posts/) as well. Japanese and linguistics is another good idea! I was originally hoping to pursue linguistics to teach English for international students but then realized my interests lied in STEM.",
