They say it will help them get rid of tedious tasks not replace them. \n\nWhat your though on this? You agree?",

As someone working towards their CPA rn you hit the nail on the head with how you described CPAs. Getting your CPA gives you a super strong base of business knowledge to go into a lot of different career paths. I have CPA colleagues going into financial audit, financial planning & analysis, IT advisory/audit, transaction and mergers and acquisition advisory, tax consulting, corporate finance. I'm not here saying the CPA life is glamourous by any means, but you definitely aint gonna be bookkeeping with a CPA lmao.",
