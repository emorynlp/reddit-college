  "text": "I am thinking about attending the university of Iowa and double majoring in these two subjects. Since they are quite similar, it would not be very difficult to fill credits for both. Would it be beneficial to double major, or would it be better to stick with one or the other?",

      "text": "I don't have a degree in either one of the two so I can't give you a good answer. It would all depend on what you will do with the degree. They both look at data but in a different way and they both make decent money. Looking at the website, they both degrees share a few courses, but it still might take an extra year to finish. \n\nMe personally I would stick with 1 degree until I complete the first year. If you can handle it, then I would minor or double major.  You should also ask around to see if you would need both. One degree might be enough for both fields.",
