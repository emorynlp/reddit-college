  "text": "What online colleges offer a Bachelors of Professional Studies Degree in Cybersecurity? I am looking into it because I would get to do more concentration based classes as opposed to a lot of GEN ED. I also already have an A.A.S, so I would be looking to bring that over. Any information would be greatly appreciated.",
