I, in the long term, want to own a wellness center: combine the physical wellness (Physical Therapy, personal training, etc) with mental wellness (psychotherapy, psychiatry, therapy). I believe the two are so fundamentally linked that to pursue the wellness of the mind, one must work the body and vice versa.\n\nI took a few psychology classes when I was going for my undergraduate as a SPED teacher, and I loved it a lot. Now, I'm pondering what is the best route for achieving this goal? I want to go back to school and get a certificate within the next year or two just so I can make some money and go back to school again. I am currently unemployed because of COVID, but will do something menial until I achieve the completion of such a certificate.\n\nIf someone can explain to me the pros and cons of PT/PTA work, what the best route for wanting pursue this full mind, body, wellness institute is. I know I need many certifications, but I'm not sure if PTA is the right way to go now or complete something else while trying to make money until I can go back to school.\n\nThis is my first reddit post. If I'm in the wrong sub, please direct me to the right place. Thank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCross posted, just in case.", "author": "kristinmabbott", "created": 1612555536, "retrieved": 1632957264, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzpszyz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ldfxzr/to_physical_therapy_assistant_or_not_to_pta/gzpszyz/", "text": "Current PTA here..piece of advice go to cheapest school that you can go into if you decide to go into physical therapy.
