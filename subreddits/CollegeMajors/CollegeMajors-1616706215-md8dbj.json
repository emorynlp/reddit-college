  "text": "My dream job would be working on a research vessel, like a boat or submarine. I'm definitely a STEM person and I'm great at science and love it, and I'm good at Math so I'm not worried about finding the major boring or difficult. However I do have a couple concerns. \n\n1. I've heard that it's extremely hard to get a job in the field without having years of unpaid volunteer experience and a PhD. Is this true? If all I want to do is work in a research vessel, will it still be difficult to find a job?\n\n2. As much as I'd love to travel, I'm getting married tomorrow and I want to have a family as well so ideally I'd have a job where I don't have to travel a lot, unless I'm actually relocating and can bring my husband and future kids along in the move. I'd also like to be able to come back home every night. Is this possible working on a research vessel though?",

      "text": "Honestly, there are a lot of jobs that aren\u2019t your dream job that aren\u2019t gonna care about which degree you got. Working on a research vessel, well let me give you a more reachable analogy. Getting a BA in your field is like playing high school sports, PhD and doing postdoc work? That\u2019s like playing in uni and a big name uni respectively. Getting the actual job is like getting into the NBA. It\u2019s highly competitive without a lot of opportunities. However, if you take a look at a pinned post on the subreddit, there\u2019s a series of links available that can give you some ideas of other jobs. There\u2019s a ton you can do with your degree, just maybe not all what you\u2019re hoping right now. So, time to do some research!",
