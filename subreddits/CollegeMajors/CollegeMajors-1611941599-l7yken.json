I am currently a freshman in college double majoring in Political Science and Public Affairs. However, after taking some of my required polisci courses, I have developed an interest in international relations as well. I was advised to double major as I was told that getting a job with my major is very competitive, and was specified to take Public Affairs. However, being required to take accounting this semester because of it, I have realized that this major focuses on management and budgeting with public or nonprofit organizations. This is not necessarily the path I want to take. Although I would like to work at a nonprofit post graduation, my main focus is to work within the realm of human rights advocacy. International Relations gives me the option to have a focus on Human Rights, and gives me the opportunity to study abroad as well. However, I am not sure if it is smart for me to switch my second major. Are polisci and IR too similar? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a minor in legal studies as I am considering going to law school after undergrad. I'm not sure if that's relevant. Thanks in advance for the help and guidance.", "author": "cinnamonpumpkinmuff", "created": 1611941599, "retrieved": 1632956941, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
