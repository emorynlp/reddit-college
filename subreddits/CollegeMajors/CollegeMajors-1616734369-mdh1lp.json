Eventually at some point when I have more money in my pockets (and hopefully a decent paying job) I\u2019ll return to get a Masters or Doctorate. \n\nSchool is easy for me if it\u2019s over subjects I enjoy as I\u2019m a pretty fast learner. With that being said, I also want to consider bachelor\u2019s degrees that will lead me into a decent paying job. Below are a selection of my favorite science subjects:\n\nPhysics\n\nGeology\n\nAstronomy\n\nBiochemistry \n\nExercise Science/Kinesiology\n\nWhich of these degrees are the best in terms of job opportunities for bachelor\u2019s degrees? Or is there a different bachelor\u2019s degree that I didn\u2019t mention that will give me the chance to focus on one of these studies?

Physics grads develop good problem solving skills that are very applicable to many fields.

I would have a different answer if you were anticipating on getting a master's or some other post-graduate certification afterwards.
