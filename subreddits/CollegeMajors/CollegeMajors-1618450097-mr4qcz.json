  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m currently on the fence about majoring in either **advertising, marketing, or graphic design**. My dream is to work in the ad or design industry, starting out in graphic design and eventually becoming an art director or creative director. Personally, I think advertising is my #1, and I would then minor in graphic design or some kind of digital media thing. But I\u2019m not sure if a marketing degree would be considered the \u201csafer\u201d choice. I\u2019d say I have a balance between creative and analytical skills, which was why the career path appealed to me in the first place. I perform well in math and science, and generally like analytical or left-minded things, but art/design is my real passion. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated!",

          "text": "Well, I'm on the fence about majoring in marketing because my main interest is in the advertising portion. I'm still doing research, but I am unsure whether advertising or another alternative would be better to specialize in, which is why I almost consider marketing a \"safer choice\" because it is broad enough to experiment with other areas or might be easier to land a job even if it isn't discreetly in advertising.",
