      "text": "All these majors have pretty good futures and all of these, especially nursing, radiology, and radiation therapy, have some ability to transfer. Understand that pay works differently in different countries and it all depends on where your sister wants to go. If I'm not mistaken, all of these jobs in the United States require licensure and continuing education to practice, on top of the degree, so be aware. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNurse - Average annual median pay in the US: $75,330 per year/$36.22 per hour\n\n\\+3,000,000 Jobs in the US - need a BS. It is a very hard job, but there is a lot of flexibility in specialization - ER Nurse (many openings), NICU, Elderly Care, Labor & Delivery (very hard to get into), school nurse. The hours for most specialities are hard and long - days, nights, and weekends - but you can find some jobs with easier hours or work part-time. There is a desperate need for nurses. Travel nurses and such are also a possibility. Lot of blood and puss and sick, dying people. It is hard mentally and physically. Lots of math for dosages for patients, too. As a positive , there are good positions with Doctors Without Borders and the PeaceCorps, as well as on various US military bases across the world (you'd work as a civilian, often caring for the spouses and children of servicemen).  \nRadiology technician - US $63,710 per year/$30.63 per hour\n\n\\+250K US jobs - only need an Associates to start. There are also specialities with this degree and various certifications to get for it - X-Ray/CT are basics, sometimes MRI, Ultrasound cert is good, cardio, I recommend Mammogram for your sister if she wants normal hours (all mammography jobs I've seen require a worker be female). This job is pretty good, overall. Like all the jobs listed, the UK has a healthcare and career shortage list with this on it that will fast track a work visa for a job with the NHS, for overseas work.  Ireland also has all these job choices fast tracked for a visa, I believe. You tend to work in a darker, sterile room, calmly explaining the equipment to patients and trying to get them to hold still to get good images. If you work in a calmer job, it is nice. For a faster pace, you can work with the ER and take imagery during surgeries and of injured persons.   \nLaboratory technician - US $54,180 per year/$26.05 per hour\n\n\\+338K US jobs - need an Associates (pay starts closer to $30K) but it is often easier with a Bachelors to start and the pay will be on the higher end. Outpatient centers will pay the most but are very busy and go-go-go. LOTS of chemistry, so she better be really good at it, and preferably like it a lot. You collect samples of body fluids and run tests on it - pee and blood and such. It saves a lot of lives. However, like with radiology, you are generally working in a sterile room, generally white and fluorescent, with no windows. Understand that this job will make or break a diagnosis and an erroneous false positive or negative from you could destroy the life of a patient that you'll likely never see or interact with. If you like interacting with people - that won't happen at this job. If you don't want to hang out with patient and prefer a more clean work environment with less sick people, this is a good choice. Generally this job has a set schedule of 40 hours per week, 8-12 hr shifts, weekends and holidays.     \nRadiation therapy technician - US $86,850 per year/$41.76 per hour\n\n\\~20K jobs in the US, but plenty more overseas. Only requires an associates to start,  but a Bachelors does look better and generally gets better pay. Radiation therapy techs administer radiation therapy treatments/drugs to cancer patients to treat their cancer. As it revolves around patients that place appointments, this job is generally considered regular hours with a dayshift, usually weekends off, but radiation therapy emergencies do occur and you'll likely be on-call (you can be called back in and have to remain close enough to work on your day 'off' in case they need you). Some job positions have very irregular hours. It is a very emotional job - all your patients are ill with cancer and that can be very, very hard. Sometimes, despite the care you give, they die anyway. This job also requires you to know complex math and chemistry to give patients proper dosages. \n\nIf your sister is that interested in working overseas, it may be better for her to consider going to university overseas as well. There are plenty of universities overseas with degree programs for the careers listed here and it would be far easier for her to get a work visa or job position if she obtained a degree and a university-given internship already in the country she wanted to work. Just a thought. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Best wishes for you both.",

      "text": "Well the only one guaranteed to transfer to other countries is a nurse. \nThe other majors take 2 years I think while nursing takes 4.\nEven becoming a physicians assistant does not always transfer to other countries, so I would say nursing would be the best.",
