Is MechEng a good choice? And what can you do with it? Engineering careers I\u2019m interested are designing and prototyping ai, robots, and especially roller coasters. Is this the right major for that? I have a heart/lung condition so I can\u2019t physically build large things myself. But I can learn to design things and would absolutely love that aspect.
