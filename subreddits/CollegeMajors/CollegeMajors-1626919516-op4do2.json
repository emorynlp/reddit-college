  "text": "Currently an English creative writing major but looking for something that will keep me more secure. Is MechEng a good choice? And what can you do with it? Engineering careers I\u2019m interested are designing and prototyping ai, robots, and especially roller coasters. Is this the right major for that? I have a heart/lung condition so I can\u2019t physically build large things myself. But I can learn to design things and would absolutely love that aspect. What is a good engineering or STEM degree?",

              "text": "MechE is very versatile. Anything that has moving parts (i.e. cars, planes, rockets, mechatronics/robotics, etc.) you can probably get into as long as you choose your coursework carefully. In many schools Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are joint programs. \n\nWhatever you end up choosing, make sure it's something you enjoy.",
