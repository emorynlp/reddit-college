  "text": "Hello! I'm a rising senior, and I'm trying to figure out what major to look into. I've always been a bit of a jack of all trades, and I don't have a specific subject that I love more than others. My strongest subject is math, but I'm also a great leader (according to others, at least) and I enjoy communicating with teachers and other students, which is probably signaling some business-related path. What majors should I look into, if I don't necessarily want to go into business?",

      "text": "A strong quantitative skill and leadership (esp. communication) is a very powerful combination. I would be careful not to be contrained in the mindset that STEM careers do not align with great leadership skills (which is the vibe I am getting since you think it signals business). In terms of your math ability, I would look into computer science, engineering, statistics, pure/applied math, etc. If your friends tell you that you are a great leader and you enjoy communicating with others, get involved with extracurriculars early and be a part of your community, the more people you have in your network is the better! Personally I'm biased but data science is a career you may want to look into -> requires strong quantitative readoning as well as presentational skills to transform data into actionable items for a business (tho similar arguments could be made for many other engineering disciplines... especially at the management level)",

          "text": "I second this as well. Data science is still kinda new in my school so I can't say for data science, but the computer science majors are definitely the competitive in terms of the leadership skills.\n\nI know many people from cs who have been very active with projects and school teams with amazing leadership skills. My school also has a double degree in general business and any engineering major and most of the cs majors have a track record to be very involved in school activities and have gone to well-respected internship programs that involved them to actively work in a team. \n\nYou also can take a look if some universities you're looking at has a strong foundation for entrepreneurship or support system for student projects.",
