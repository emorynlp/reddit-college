I'm a rising senior, and I'm trying to figure out what major to look into. I've always been a bit of a jack of all trades, and I don't have a specific subject that I love more than others. My strongest subject is math, but I'm also a great leader (according to others, at least) and I enjoy communicating with teachers and other students, which is probably signaling some business-related path. What majors should I look into, if I don't necessarily want to go into business?", "author": "CatSpecific", "created": 1624553886, "retrieved": 1632958044, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h2wl6yt": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/o7511k/what_major_should_i_go_into_given_strong_math/h2wl6yt/", "text": "A strong quantitative skill and leadership (esp. communication) is a very powerful combination. I would be careful not to be contrained in the mindset that STEM careers do not align with great leadership skills (which is the vibe I am getting since you think it signals business). In terms of your math ability, I would look into computer science, engineering, statistics, pure/applied math, etc. If your friends tell you that you are a great leader and you enjoy communicating with others, get involved with extracurriculars early and be a part of your community, the more people you have in your network is the better! Personally I'm biased but data science is a career you may want to look into -> requires strong quantitative readoning as well as presentational skills to transform data into actionable items for a business (tho similar arguments could be made for many other engineering disciplines... especially at the management level)", "author": "MasterLink123K", "created": 1624554430, "upvotes": 4}}}
