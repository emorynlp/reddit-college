              "text": "Because in accounting you learn an actual hireable skill. They are highly sought after right now because there is a lacking supply of them. \n\nIn business you learn a bunch of random stuff that mostly isn't applicable to any entry level job, only a small portion is applicable to most company's. Businesses aren't looking for management straight out of college. They want a skill that they can bring into their business (like accounting). \n\nA family member just went into her senior year. Accounting major. She currently has 5 amazing job offers from extremely reputable organizations. I'm jealous. \n\nAccounting doesn't mean you have to be an accountant forever. There is lots of good opportunity to pivot away from number crunching. \n\nI would major in accounting if you can get the grades for it, and minor in business admin.\n\nYou are almost guaranteed to get a job much more quickly after graduation and a much higher paying one than most business majors.",
