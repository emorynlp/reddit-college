Ive finished most of the pre reqs with great grades, but I began medical assisting and worked alongside registered nurses and it is a very rewarding and amazing career but I dont do well under pressure. Anyways I need to change my major ASAP so I can take spring classes in the new major. So i have decided on Marketing. For one I love makeup and am certified In it and I know I would love to do marketing in the beauty industry. I also am into social issues and nonprofits so I wouldn't mind doing marketing in that aspect as well. I also decided what to minor in since I love it a lot but I dont want to major in it because I dont think it will lead to the careers I have in mind but I figured it would useful to minor in it since its sort of a passion. I want to minor in sociology AND gender/women studies. Is this a bad idea? Will I be okay finding a job in marketing or no? Any opinions will be helpful.

Is there another related career that might be a little less stressful? Marketing is fine if that is what you want to do but I would not give up on an \u201cawarding and amazing career\u201d if there are possible ways to get around the issue of stress and pressure. I would ask around and see what other careers in health might be a better fit for you. On the other hand, if you feel the pressure is too much that is a perfectly good reason to bail early since it will probably not get easier in the future. \n\nAs for marketing: There are a lot of marketing jobs out there (but also a lot of people applying to those jobs), so you can probably find something but it just depends on the work you put into the degree both in and outside of class. If your school offers classes specifically in entrepreneurship you might want to look into those, as well as classes in sociology and/or communications (or women\u2019s studies, African American studies etc) to get a better insight on social issues and nonprofits. On the makeup side pair your cosmetology cert with an education and experience in marketing and you could have a really nice business going. \n", "author": "puffy-jacket", "created": 1553005944, "upvotes": 1}}}
