I know that I have till sophomore year to choose my major but I still want advice since liberal arts education will mean that it\u2019s not as much as an open curriculum as y\u2019all would think. By that I mean that I can\u2019t focus on one major and fulfill classes for those and then change my mind since that would prob mean staying an extra year to fill requirements. Anyways, I want to work abroad after graduation. I don\u2019t really have a country in mind, I could care less if it\u2019s in Latin America or Europe to be honest. What degree is most useful internationally?", "author": "idkloljustthriving-", "created": 1616926289, "retrieved": 1632846947, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gsme8e7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/meypj4/need_help_deciding_a_major/gsme8e7/", "text": "Have you considered if you want to continue your education beyond undergrad?
