  "text": "Hey all! I\u2019d like to work with the police as a forensic/crime scene tech. I live in a relatively small town and I know I\u2019d likely have to move to find a job and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m not sure what to pursue in college tho, criminal justice? Biology? Chemistry? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!",

      "text": "I had a talk with a Professor at my University, and he got a major in Biology and then masters in Microbiology and is now the head of a biology department in NY. I also want to become a forensic crime scene investigator, and he said for that the best major and minor combo would be biochemistry and criminology minor. I am as of now, a Biology major and criminology minor.",

      "text": "That\u2019s actually what my sister is doing! She\u2019s researched it well enough, and the best major for that is pursuing Forensic Chemistry, Forensic Biology, or Forensic Anthropology. All these are focus areas in their respective majors. It really depends on what you personally wish to do in the field. For example, if you want to identify and study bones of crime scene victims, Forensic Anthropology is your best bet. What\u2019s your preferred area? \n\n\n",

          "text": "Leaning more towards Forensic Chemistry, I think. I\u2019d like to work in a lab, comparing/analyzing bodily fluids etc, and I\u2019d really like to get to go out in the field at least a little bit. What about Forensic Psychology? Is that an actual field or something I heard about in a movie. Thanks for the reply and great info!",

              "text": "That is a real field! I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for though haha. I personally don\u2019t know too much about that, or most Forensic fields other than Forensic Anthropology, but it\u2019s much more focused on gauging someone\u2019s mental ability to stand trial and other matters similar to that. There\u2019s honestly Forensic everything, even Forensic Linguistics! The Forensic aspect is just regarding its conjunction with the law, and so it doesn\u2019t always mean analyzing blood stains. The \u201cgritty\u201d lab work that people associate with forensics is really found in the three I mentioned. \n\nThat being said, Forensic Chemistry is right up your alley. I\u2019d consider a biology minor along with that as well to bridge the gap between Forensic Biology and Chemistry! ",
