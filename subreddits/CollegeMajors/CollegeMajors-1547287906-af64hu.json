I\u2019d like to work with the police as a forensic/crime scene tech. I live in a relatively small town and I know I\u2019d likely have to move to find a job and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m not sure what to pursue in college tho, criminal justice? Biology? Chemistry? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

She\u2019s researched it well enough, and the best major for that is pursuing Forensic Chemistry, Forensic Biology, or Forensic Anthropology. All these are focus areas in their respective majors. It really depends on what you personally wish to do in the field. For example, if you want to identify and study bones of crime scene victims, Forensic Anthropology is your best bet. What\u2019s your preferred area? \n\n\n", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1547346840, "upvotes": 2}}}
