  "text": "Hello, I am lost and confused between these two majors. Some says both of these are useless .. some says choose business administration because it is employable and English is practically useless in real world. Actually I am planning to get a degree since I am not a degree holder yet. My highest education is high school diploma. So which major is more beneficial than the other? \n\nP.S planning to use some of my retirement funds to pay back the loan",
