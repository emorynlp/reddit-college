I'd really love to study Forensic Science I think. I'm a true crime junkie and love to watch shows and documentaries about murder cases. I'm also good at science and math and find science interesting. Overall, I think I would do great in forensic science both as a major and as a career. I would probably minor in Biology and become a Forensic Biologist. Anyone have any opinions? First hand experience? Any tips would be appreciated as well. Thanks everyone!", "author": "siriuslytired", "created": 1614841891, "retrieved": 1632846985, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gpobqb4": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lxf00w/opinions_on_forensic_science_major/gpobqb4/", "text": "Biology is a wonderful start!!! You\u2019ll need a science degree so you\u2019re good there. But you may need a masters degree or a doctorate to advance in that field, so I suggest doing something else with your degree while saving up for a masters.", "author": "Inalei_12", "created": 1614879505, "upvotes": 2}}}
