Finance and business are super interesting to me, but there are a lot better hours/working conditions, and a better starting salary in tech. I prefer to work in banking, investment securities, or corporate finance, so would MIS help in those fields? If anyone has any opinions on double majoring in MIS and Finance, another double major option, or what careers these majors might provide please let me know!", "author": "devinpatel5", "created": 1622657601, "retrieved": 1632846524, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h0t5a8d": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/nqsa3h/mis_and_finance_double_major/h0t5a8d/", "text": "Hello, friend. I, too, am also a rising junior in HS. From looking around the web, I\u2019ve heard finance and MIS are great paired together. Your question regarding how helpful MIS would be in the fields you mentioned, I would answer it absolutely would help. The only question is to what degree. MIS is a fairly open major, so taking Finance would help specialize you towards a career in that department. Plus, having MIS on your resume would give you the edge when looking for jobs in finance. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t provide any better advice or help, if I run into any helpful material I\u2019ll be sure to link them and send them to you. \n\nIn regards to careers or other pairings, I\u2019m looking more on the business side of MIS. I\u2019m thinking of either getting a double major or a major and minor in MIS and Business Management. Other options I\u2019m looking at are MIS and Marketing or Communications. If you\u2019re more of a tech person, MIS and CS are a good pair. \n\nHere are some sites that might be helpful:\n\nhttps://www.misdegree.info/faq/what-is-a-good-minor-for-a-management-information-systems-mis-degree/     \n(talks about other minor options that would be helpful)\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/management-information-systems-degree-466425\n(Relatively brief overview, but it does include some potential careers)\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/management-information-systems-and-services-major-overview\n(First source I looked at, I\u2019m not sure if this would help you. But, this helped me see if I would enjoy MIS as a major) \n\nOther ways to look around, I just browsed around looking through quora (I know, not very reliable) and searched more regarding MIS itself and how I could match it up with something more specific that caters to my preferences.", "author": "jpkuroneko-chan", "created": 1622997134, "upvotes": 2}}}
