I always wanted to do marine biology, but the pay is less than I want, and now, my parents want me to do something with computers, and I guess I could. I am taking a course in school right now for programming, and while I don't hate it, I don't have a huge passion for it. I do know that it pays more than marine biology though. I would also like to stay in my area (Raleigh, NC) and I have a couple of colleges near me that I could go to- Meredith College, NCSU, Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, etc. Money is not the issue, and I could do a double major as well.

You are only a sophomore, and you won\u2019t even be applying to college for almost 2 year, so you have time.  Your parent\u2019s advice to take a programming class is good, mainly because it allows you to explore a very different field of study.  So, it doesn\u2019t fire you up.  Good.  You know that about yourself now, and you developed some useful skills that can be applied to many other disciplines.  \n\nWhat you want to do with your courses in high school is to take rigorous courses that give you a firm grounding across the maths and sciences.  It really doesn\u2019t matter what you major in, this stuff is useful.  Also, make sure that you can write well, this is the important takeaway from your English classes.  The existentialist critique of Camus should be viewed a just an exercise to teach you how to structure your thinking and convey it clearly.  (If you like existentialism, well that is just a bonus.)  Try to find some interesting electives (like the programming class).  The point of your electives should be exploration, not career development.  Electives give you a chance to learn about some of the professional paths out there.  At a minimum, they will show you things that you don\u2019t want to do, which reduces the size of the problem. In the best case, you find something you actually really like.\n\nOutside of high school, you have two things you should be doing, learning about yourself, and learning about the adult world.  (I don\u2019t mean to sound trite, this will help you with your decision).\n\nWe all have different strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes.  Even if you are good at everything, there are some things you are better at, and some things that you just enjoy doing more.  What is your personality (google Big Five Personality Traits).  You should know your tendencies as a starting point.  Do you like interacting with people or would you rather work with things?  Do you like working in a team, or would you rather work alone?  Are you happy working at a desk, or would you rather move around or be outside as you work?  Do you like working with your mind, or your hands (or maybe both)?  Do you like project work where you have an objective and a due date, and they work towards that, and once you are done you move on to the next project?  Or, instead would you rather the work be more consistent over time?  \n\nTry also to separate out what you are interested in from what you might want to do.  I am interested in a great many things that I would have no interest in doing.  I am happy to learn about them, as they help inform the things I actually do.  For instance, I find clinical psychology interesting but have no interest in being a therapist.  I use what I learn to inform classes I teach on problem solving.  Don\u2019t spend money in college just to follow your interests, you can read this stuff for 1/100th of the cost.  You want to use your college to train for a type of work, and be credentialed in that to make finding a job easier.\n\nThat brings me to my final point which is start looking at the adult world you will inhabit after college in terms of the types of lives people live and the types of jobs they do.  Do you want a 9-5, steady pay and vacation time?  Would you rather have variable hours and pay?  Do you want to travel a lot with your job?  Basically what type of work seems to suit your personality.\n\nOnce you understand these things, you will probably have an easier time thinking about what you want to do in college. \n\nBest of luck!", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606922084, "upvotes": 1}}}
