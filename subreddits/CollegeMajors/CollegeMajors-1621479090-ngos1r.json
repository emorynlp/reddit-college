  "text": "I\u2019ve always been indecisive and never had passion for anything besides gaming but you really can\u2019t make a career out of playing games unless you become a streamer or something. I don\u2019t really want to do that and I want to keep my hobbies and job separate. The reason I want to do something computer related is because I\u2019ve always been fascinated with computers and I consider myself pretty computer literate. I\u2019ve even built my own gaming pc but I know that doesn\u2019t equate to much but it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve got to go off of. I know that programming probably isn\u2019t for me because I despise math and I\u2019ve heard people compare it to writing essays with I also don\u2019t enjoy. I don\u2019t really know much about IT but my uni doesn\u2019t even have it as a major so that\u2019s off the list. They have information science, which I know nothing about but I heard it\u2019s as difficult as computer science. Lastly, computer engineering, I don\u2019t much about this one either but it seems easier than computer science at least. What do you guys think? Which major is easier? Is there anyway I can find out what each major is about and try to see if it\u2019s for me or not without taking the respective classes and wasting my time? Thanks!",

      "text": "As a CS major I'll try to help clear this up. A computer science major does involve a good amount of math, in fact the academic discipline itself started out as (and in many ways continues as) a field of applied math. This means that you will be required to take algorithms, discrete math, CS theory and probably statistics/calculus/linear algebra as a bare minimum for a CS major. These aren't extremely advanced math classes, especially compared to like real analysis or something, but they are definitely things you would have to work at, unless you're naturally pretty good at math. Although these classes (and in particular, theoretical CS classes and discrete math) form the core of what computer science is, what most of your electives, and eventually your job, will probably center around is programming. There's not really a good analogue for what programming is like, I could kind of see the essay writing angle, but even that's not a great comparison, so to find out whether you like it or not, I would recommend just trying it on your own.\n\nInformation science is going to be pretty similar to CS, except for maybe a couple fewer math classes. Computer engineering is a mixture of computer science and electrical engineering (probably more math here than in a CS major, not entirely sure), and is focused on more low level stuff: operating systems, hardware, etc.\n\nHonestly, if you don't like math and don't like programming... well those are like the 2 main components of a CS degree, and therefore probably an IS or CE degree, lol. Like at this point I would ask, why do you even want to major in CS? Being interested in computers is pretty vague when it comes to picking a major. What do you find interesting about computers? Because CS isn't about being interested in computers necessarily, it's much more about programming and problem solving. You might end up liking programming, I would at least try it out if I were you, take some intro classes, there's some good online resources.",
