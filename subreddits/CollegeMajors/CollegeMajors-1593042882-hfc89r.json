  "title:": "[Unpopular Opinion] Your major actually doesn't matter (Recent graduate)",
  "text": "A little background, I graduated from college in 2018, had 5 internships, got a job offer from the Big 4 when I graduated, and create content on LinkedIn that helps students find jobs/internships. I also have talked to hundreds, if not thousands of recruiters and hiring managers over the past 2-3 years as I want to help as many college students succeed as possible.\n\nYour college major = a designation on a piece of paper\n\nWhat recruiters care about = do you have the skills to pay the bills?\n\nI have a finance degree but all of the work that I do today is in marketing and branding. I'm also probably more qualified than 90% of college graduates that have a marketing degree because I learned how to grow a brand and market myself while I was in school instead of studying the \"4 P's of marketing\" to get an A in my class.\n\nBecause of the internet, you can virtually learn anything online today (not including being a doctor or lawyer). From business to programing to video editing, it's all on Youtube University. Companies know this and are much more open to hiring people without \"traditional\" education in a specific industry.\n\nCombine Youtube and Google University with LinkedIn and you can genuinely network your way to any job if you put in the time and effort.\n\nNow saying all of this. A college degree is still important (or at least up until the point that you find your first job. Once you get your first job, no one really cares about your education, they care about results). You still need a college degree to \"show that you're willing to put in the time and the effort\" but the specification of the major doesn't necessarily matter.\n\nI've seen engineers get picked before finance majors for banking jobs, English and psych majors chosen before marketing grads for marketing positions, and many more examples.\n\nSo my advice for any student stressing about their major... don't. Find out an industry that you want to go into and build a project that showcases the skills that are needed for that position. Those skills are what will get you the job... not the piece of paper. That just makes your parents happy.\n\n\\*Caveat is for medical majors. Please get your medical degrees. But even with this, I've spoken to a cardiologist who said the easiest way to get into med school is to get your undergrad in business (much easier than a medical major) to boost your GPA, take the required bios, chems, etc. needed to get into med school. You can still apply to med school as long as you take the required courses and your GPA is much higher to get into a better med school compared to if you stressed yourself out with all of the other medical courses that are required for your medical degree. \n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "eh I think this depends. Business type jobs are definitely something you don't need a specific degree for, it's much more about connections and past skills. But in other fields, your major does matter. If you want to be an electrical engineer but you major in finance, you're not going to be able to find a job as an EE. yeah for med school your major doesn't matter, but if you want to work as a nurse, then you need... a degree in nursing.",

You may have seen English and psych majors get chosen before marketing grads for marketing roles but that doesn't mean it's likely. It's all about getting that first job, and your choice of major makes a big difference in whether you get the interview or not.",

          "text": "I went to host a career fair for my brand earlier this year geared towards helping marketing students. 0 marketing agencies attended because they only wanted to talk to English majors and psych majors.\n\nEnglish majors learn how to write (important in marketing)\n\nPsych majors learn how a consumer thinks (important in marketing)\n\nMarketing majors learn the 4 P\u2019s of marketing (doesn\u2019t really matter post graduation)\n\nThe employers were looking for skills and not the degree. The only companies that showed up were the ones looking to fill out their sales jobs, which technically you don\u2019t need a degree for. \n\nAre there certain tried and true majors? Yea a handful. But the majority don\u2019t matter because you don\u2019t learn the actual skill set that companies are looking for.",

      "text": "Interesting. So would you say that instead of going straight into a 4 year uni and pairing it with online education, it might be better to attend community college and pair that with online education? What makes a university better than community college when a lot of information can be learned online (other than the degree saying you graduated)? I\u2019ll be a freshman this fall, so I\u2019m still considering community in case corona virus worsens within this month (to an extreme of affecting my first two years), and I\u2019m mainly going to uni for the degree since it\u2019s becoming the new HS diploma equivalent for entry level jobs. I\u2019m not really sure what route I want to take for my major, but are internships truly better than major itself in almost all cases (minus medical fields ofc)? Also, I\u2019d like to know your thoughts on the prestige of a \u201cname brand\u201d school since you received an offer from the Big 4, since I often hear that prestige is important for finance majors and business majors. Assuming you didn\u2019t attend a prestigious school, would you say it\u2019s not important and you can still land internships and jobs in top finance/marketing roles? Sorry if this doesn\u2019t make sense lol just curious on your thoughts",

          "text": "If you can get into a top 25 school for your program do it. There\u2019s still value in those degrees.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t, then going to community college vs a \u201cprestigious\u201d school that costs $45k a year. I\u2019d go to community college for 2 years and transfer to a local university.\n\nThe reason is that your degree is going to virtually mean the same whether you graduate from the University of Connecticut or the University of Tampa. The only difference between the two is the cost.\n\nIf I were to do it again, I\u2019d go to the cheapest school and build something on the side. That \u201csomething\u201d is what will get you the job. Employers love seeing tangible assists vs a high gpa on your resume. Connections + skills is the ultimate formula that I talk about a lot on my podcast. \n\n[Declassified College Podcast](https://www.getchogrindup.com/declassified-college-podcast) .",

              "text": "Ahh just wondering since the school I\u2019m going to has a top business program, but you have to apply as a sophomore and I think they only accept 2/3 of applicants. I was never considering marketing/business as a career field until all my applications were out so I\u2019m still researching about it. Thanks for the podcast tho, I\u2019ll be sure to give it a listen once I can later today \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
