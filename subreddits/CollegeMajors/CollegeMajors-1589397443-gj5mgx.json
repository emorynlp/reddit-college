  "text": "Hey, what do you think would be the better choice.\n\nFirst of all I am in my last year before my final exams of secondary eduction here in Germany. I am really good at maths getting mostly A's in my classes and I also chose to focus on physics as one of my main subjects here at school. In addition to that, I also go to a class where we start working with university maths, where I also get mostly A's.\n\nNow the thing is: Lately I have been very. passionate about maths, but I have always been passionate about computers and programming too.\n\nIf I choose a CS Major I will only have maths up to Analysis II, Calc II and linear algebra II and the rest of the classes is focused on programming stuff.\n\nIf I choose a maths major I will have maths up to Analysis III, Calc III, linear algebra III, and I can choose computer science as \"area of application\". That means I will learn a lot about CS too, but the focus is on maths.\n\nShould I focus on maths? Is there so much difference between e.g. Analysis II and III or do I learn most important methods in Analysis II/Calc II/Algebra II?\n\nI'd really like some opinions about all of this!\n\nThank you!",

              "text": "A lot of the time employers very rarely pay attention to projects or really anything you do while in college, more so what you get coming out of college. Also math degrees are pretty straight foward and really easy to pair with other degrees. Talk to your adviser and have them come up with a 4 year plan for you if you do decide to dual major.\n\nAlways try to focus on what you are putting on your resume. It is reasonable to say \"mathmatics with a focus on programming\" (or the programming program you are talking about) however a lot of employers might just choose a Computer Science major because thats what they specifically went to school for. But those specific programs are really nice for grad school and usually have certain jobs that are already attached so don't count that out.",
