I am really good at maths getting mostly A's in my classes and I also chose to focus on physics as one of my main subjects here at school. In addition to that, I also go to a class where we start working with university maths, where I also get mostly A's.\n\nNow the thing is: Lately I have been very. passionate about maths, but I have always been passionate about computers and programming too.\n\nIf I choose a CS Major I will only have maths up to Analysis II, Calc II and linear algebra II and the rest of the classes is focused on programming stuff.\n\nIf I choose a maths major I will have maths up to Analysis III, Calc III, linear algebra III, and I can choose computer science as \"area of application\". That means I will learn a lot about CS too, but the focus is on maths.\n\nShould I focus on maths? Is there so much difference between e.g. Analysis II and III or do I learn most important methods in Analysis II/Calc II/Algebra II?\n\nI'd really like some opinions about all of this!\n\nThank you!", "author": "AlterionBlackthorne", "created": 1589397443, "retrieved": 1632956251, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"fvapuwq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gj5mgx/maths_or_computer_science/fvapuwq/", "text": "I have the feeling you\u2019d love UF, they required Calculus 1, 2, and 3 if you want to transfer to their CS program.
