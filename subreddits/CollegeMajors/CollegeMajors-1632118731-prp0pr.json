  "title:": "Too many interests",
  "text": "There are multiple areas I could see myself majoring in and doing as a career. I\u2019m not sure how to narrow down my interests into one field. I would say I\u2019m almost equally interested in  all of these subjects, except for political science I think I like it a bit more.\n\nMy top choices I\u2019m stuck deciding between are \n\n1. Economics -I really like economics especially macro and could see myself getting a masters and using it either in a business private sector type job or a government public position and be happy. I like how it combines my interest of science and finance. \n\n2. Political science -I have taken so many gov/political classes and clubs. I\u2019m VP of model UN at my school and I\u2019ve been told by my APUSH, AP gov, and Poltical Economics teacher that I have a brain for political science. It\u2019s so interesting to me and I am really passionate about politics. I\u2019m scared I\u2019d get burned out or discouraged working in politics long term however. There  are a lot of uncertainties in political science too because I\u2019m not sure how I will end up using the degree after I graduate. Also if I become exhausted with politics I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do with a political science degree. \n\n3. Urban Planning -another huge hobby of mine that I love learning about. I find urban planning so fascinating and ever since I had access to the internet as a little kid I would be planning city building  games, researching city planning, and of course as ive gotten older I have learned more about the political side of urban planning. \n\n4. Lastly, finance/computer and information systems -finance really goes with my love for the business micro side of Econ but also my love for entrepreneurship and management. I see myself running a business one day and I\u2019m entranced with the idea of creating a successful company out of nothing and I feel like finance or compute Information systems could give me a good foundation of information if I went forward to do that.",

      "text": "It seems like econ/a business degree could be a good group of majors to investigate, since they seem to align with your interests and have the potential to lead to high paying jobs. I will say I disagree with the below poster. Tons of econ majors get high paying jobs in finance/consulting after graduating. I will qualify this by saying that it definitely depends on what school you go to, however. If you go to a prestigious school that is recruited from by banks, insurance companies, and consulting firms, an econ or finance major will make you a very competitive candidate (assuming you have a good rest of your resume) for high paying finance jobs. Wall Street is literally full of econ majors from Ivy League schools, lol. If you do get into a school that is recruited from by these companies, then econ + political science double major seems like a good fit.\n\nIf you don't get into one of these prestigious schools, accounting might be a safer bet. Not to say that finance/econ majors don't get jobs, but I do think its harder, and accounting is more of a \"safe\" bet at a random state school. Accounting could also give you more hard skills if you want to start your own business.",

          "text": "Wow thank you! This is super insightful. I am planning on going to a cheaper in state school my first year or two then transferring to a better more prestigious school. I have good high school stats and ECs but definitely not Ivy League or T10 material. Do you think I should still major in Econ/Business or Econ/political science even if there\u2019re is a chance I won\u2019t get into a prestigious university as a transfer?",

              "text": "It's hard for me to say. I am not an econ/finance guy, although a lot of people at my school are so I only have somewhat second hand knowledge of this. Maybe you could look up the list of schools you are thinking of ending up at and see what companies recruit from them or what companies their finance/econ majors ended up at after graduation. Or send some messages to alums over linked in, or you could make a post on the school subreddit asking what companies recruit, how the econ/finance departments are, etc. I think this could give you better insight on how well you would be positioned to get a finance job after graduating. \n\nIf it appears that a lot of finance/econ people are getting good jobs, then one of those majors seems like a good option, although I would personally lean towards finance if your school has a business school. Part of the reason why econ majors are so widely represented in finance/Wall Street is because these prestigious firms recruit from top tier liberal arts schools that lack a business major/undergraduate business school, so everyone there who wants to go into finance majors in econ. So a finance major will give you more relevant background than an econ major for a finance job, but I'm willing to bet there would be an option of minoring in econ or double majoring or taking a lot of econ electives.\n\nIf it turns out the schools you're looking at don't have great placement for econ/finance grads, I would personally recommend the accounting route. Going this route you'll probably still be able to take finance electives, which could give you more background if you ever want to start your own business or anything, which appears to be the case.\n\nYou could also see if there's a way to double major across schools. So if you go into a business school, major in finance, but then minor/double major in political science. I think double majoring is a great way to get a well rounded education, so I generally recommend it to people if their open to it, have the option, and have the financial means. I WAS going to do this but I had to switch majors at the last second so I couldn't.",

      "text": "My best advice. \n\nThere's 1 of 2 paths to decide to persue. \n\nOne where you make great money, not necessarily do something that is fun every day. \n\nOne where you don't make good money but you do something every day that you enjoy. \n\nThe best is to decide what degrees you would persue based on those 2 things then pick between the two.\n\nIf you want to make money, I would pick accounting. You'll get alot of finance and econ knowledge doing that, you get a guaranteed high paying job out of college, and it will be a good stepping stone to whatever you want to do. Don't think of a degree as what you will do for the rest of your life. Rather what is the best stepping stone to get your foot in the door in an industry you want to work in.",
