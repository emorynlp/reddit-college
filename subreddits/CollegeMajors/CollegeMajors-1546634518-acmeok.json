I realize that I'm interested in creating business cards (if the company needs them to promote themselfs), making there website/managing it, making flyers,  making a video/editing one, etc. I'm interested in not just graphic design but making websites. I'm interested in technology and design. I know I could just do graphic design, but I feel like I'll be missing out on making websites, but if I do computer science I feel like I would be missing out on graphic design. I want to do a major that let's me do multiple technology art disciplines (like graphic design , video production, Web design, etc) while doing computer science. Sorry if you guys don't understand. Any ideas? I can explain better in the comments if you want.", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1546634518, "retrieved": 1632957397, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"edbazyd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/acmeok/ideas/edbazyd/", "text": "Just do graphic design and take some classes on web design.

I believe CS is geared towards programming and software development, not so much website design, although it seems that you can use some programming languages you'd learn in CS for website design. Either way, I think an entire major in CS would be overkill for what you want, and could possibly be the wrong direction for your goals.\n\nIs there any sort of concentration or major for Digital Arts in Graphic Design at your college? This is the field that focuses on visuals and video editing with various technologies, and I feel like this is more aligned with what you're interested in. Perhaps majoring in this, and minoring in CS would be your best bet for what you want to do. Even then, from what I've read, most people suggest just learning some of the programming languages on your own if you just want to focus on websites. Either way, I'd think minoring in CS would be a nice thing to put on a resume after you graduate, and it is relevant as far as programming goes for website creation. Again though, I'm not an expert in either fields, and I'd consult with someone from your college in CS and Graphic Design to make sure they align with your goals.", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1546638491, "upvotes": 1}}}
