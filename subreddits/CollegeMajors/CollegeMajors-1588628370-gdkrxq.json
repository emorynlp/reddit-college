  "text": "I'm completing two associates degree's in (Associates in Science and Associates in Arts) this semester and submitted a transfer application to ASU for their information science program . Unfortunately they did not accept me for that program but they did send a letter back stating they took the liberty of submitting and accepting me as a transfer for a BS in \"International Trade\" , i can see some descriptions as to what the degree is about but it is a bit vague. What exactly does this degree consist of? and what kind of jobs would i be prepared for after getting this degree? Is there any growing demand for this degree?",
