      "text": "Try courses for a few different majors and see how you feel about them. If anything in engineering, tech, or medicine sounds interesting to you, start with courses/prereqs for those since they tend to have more requirements than other majors. It\u2019s usually a lot easier to switch from STEM to a liberal arts or social science major than the other way around. Also prioritize architecture if you\u2019re interested in that!\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to sign up for related clubs/extracurriculars if you can. I started out thinking I wanted to study engineering and only realized it wasn\u2019t for me after trying an engineering club and seeing what the projects were like.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the majors you try initially, at least you\u2019ll be able to rule them out!",
