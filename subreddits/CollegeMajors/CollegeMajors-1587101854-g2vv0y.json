I'm not in any of these majors but do have friends who are, so I'll try to break down the differences as I understand them. Keep in mind that all of these degrees will cover these subjects, but will focus on a few more than the others. Computer science has a higher focus on computing logic and a lot of the high level computer science topics such as machine learning, artificial intelligence. Once again, that's not saying you couldn't get a job in AI with a degree in computer engineering, you absolutely could, it's just a tendency. Computer engineering tends to focus a bit more on the hardware, while still involving plenty of programming. Computer engineers usually directly work on developing hardware such as professors, graphics units ect. Another degree to possibly consider would be software engineering. Most people I know who are striving to be video game developers are software engineering majors. There's a heavier focus on the active development and matinence of stand alone programs, which leads directly into applications like video games. Keep in mind that you should be open to working outside the video game industry as it's an extremely competitive field. One friend has been out of college for a year now and still doesn't have a job (mainly because he refuses to apply for anything that isn't game development). As I'm sure you can see all three of these degrees are extremely close together. At least half of their courses are pretty much identical. I hope this explanation helps a bit. Best of luck to you.", "author": "Vasilas", "created": 1587655820, "upvotes": 1}}}
