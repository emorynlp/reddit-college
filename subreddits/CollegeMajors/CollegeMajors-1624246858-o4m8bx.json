Which emphasis is better, marketing or management?? I\u2019m interested in marketing because I\u2019m very creative and I like the idea of pitching my ideas to people and seeing them come to life. I\u2019m interested in management because I can take upper management roles at my current retail associate job because there\u2019s a lot of room for growth at the company. Which of these two business degrees, in your experience is best? I think I\u2019m more interested in marketing yet I believe I\u2019d have more opportunities with management, so I\u2019m having a hard time deciding.

Marketing is a soft skill. You don\u2019t need a marketing degree to be a marketing manager. From what I\u2019ve heard what they teach about marketing in college is kinda old school as well. The point is, marketing is learnt through experience not through academics.\n\nYou should major in a more hard skill major like finance, accounting,Information Systems etc.", "author": "smc23678", "created": 1624282854, "upvotes": 7}}}
