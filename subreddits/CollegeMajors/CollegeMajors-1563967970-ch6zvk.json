I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019m currently a university student myself- people with a degree hardly go about using it. I\u2019m in programming for animation. And yet I\u2019m thinking about a coffee shop. \nYou\u2019re looking at this very tactically which in some aspects is good, however it very well may bite you in the bum later on. \nGo get the degree that you\u2019ll enjoy doing. Whether there\u2019s a lot of people working those jobs or not, if you\u2019re good at what you do then you\u2019ll get a job regardless. Just don\u2019t choose something due to people telling you or for financial reasons. People live out of vans and travel like crazy and they survive simply by a blog or podcast. They\u2019re happy and live insane lives. It doesn\u2019t take much but don\u2019t over think it.", "author": "HollowRibcage", "created": 1563979011, "upvotes": 2}}}
