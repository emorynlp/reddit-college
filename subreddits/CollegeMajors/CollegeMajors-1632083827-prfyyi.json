I watched him a lot 3 years ago when I was deciding what major to go into. Math is tough for a lot of people (including myself) and it\u2019s normal for it to not come naturally as other topics. If you\u2019re really interested in computer science I\u2019d say look more into it & stick with the math! Once you develop the habit and skill of problem solving that comes with math, the rest of your future courses (other programming courses, future math classes) will seem more manageable. Good luck lmk if you have other questions", "author": "matteophysics", "created": 1632084211, "upvotes": 7}}}
