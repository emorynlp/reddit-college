My whole life I've struggled to find a passion. Always hated math, and loved English. That being said, my biggest interests thus far have been in law, politics, government, and largely international relations. At first, I thought I was going down the law path, however, I'm in the US and would love to move to another place out of college (Ireland or any Nordic country) So law no longer seems feasible, and thus I've landed on international relations. But there is little information about it that I can find, and am very worried about future job prospectus. Any research or major-specific tips would be great!
