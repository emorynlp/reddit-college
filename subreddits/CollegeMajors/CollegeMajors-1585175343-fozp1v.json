  "text": "Hi! \n\nI'm Laura, a college freshman trying to choose a major. I've taken intro courses in economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and calculus. I am interested in understanding and working on problems related to inequality and have therefore been thinking of majoring in sociology or economics but I'm not sure which one. I don't know what I'd like to do after college but can imagine something in government or law. \n\nDoes anyone have some advice? Other majors I should consider?",

      "text": "I say you should go with economics. Not only does it lay a similar base to careers in government and law as sociology does (imo it provides a better one), is that, if your ambitions change, there are much more opportunities to get other kinds of careers w/ an econ degree. You could work in business, like finance, management, and you would definitely have a better chance in succeeding in your own business. If you choose sociology, the only career I can imagine that you would be qualified for that an economics major wouldn't be are social work and teaching, which I don't think align with your current ambitions. Skills you learn in a sociology degree are critical thinking, time management, and knowledge of sociology. The former two are learnt in any degree program, and the latter is not very applicable to the 'real world'. In economics, critical thinking, time management, knowledge of economics, and quantitative analyzation. Knowing how to analyze quantitatively is very useful for many careers, and economics is extremely applicable to the common citizen, business personnel, and government professionals. If you end up choosing econ, and plan on going into graduate school, try to make sure you can get into the B.S. program versus the B.A. one (otherwise it's fine). Good luck!",
