I am a community college student going into my third year (unfortunately) and I need help. For the past two years, I have primarily focused on mathematics and completed all the requirements for a Mathematics major. I was accepted to every university that I applied back in March for in Mathematics but I have decided not to accept my offers of admission. I don't feel \"good\" enough to study Mathematics and don't see a lot of viable career options since I don't care for statistics (I can tolerate programming however). I have always had interest in economics and the social sciences as well as mathematics. What should I do?", "author": "_eigenvalues", "created": 1597106722, "retrieved": 1632847610, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"g1364ju": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i7hn9t/i_have_no_idea/g1364ju/", "text": "Major in maths, and minor in CS/econ/finance. Maybe even consider a double minor if you have the time and energy. When you have a maths degree, you are employable in a lot of different fields. It's not just the maths itself, but more so the critical and analytical thinking that is very attractive. \n\nIf you have a maths major and a econ/finance minor, you will be a better fit for econ jobs than econ majors just because you can solve a lot of hard problems (through maths). At least that is my experience.\n\nIf you have a CS minor as well, you can get a lot of jobs. CS is such a big industry and its growing all the time. If you can show you can write decent code, you don't need a CS major to get the job.", "author": "InterestingKiwi5004", "created": 1597140313, "upvotes": 2}, "g11yas5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i7hn9t/i_have_no_idea/g11yas5/", "text": "you should major in math and minor in econ or vice versa.", "author": "tha_oz", "created": 1597107227, "upvotes": 2}}}
