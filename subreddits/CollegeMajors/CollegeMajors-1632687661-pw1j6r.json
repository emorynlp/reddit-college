  "text": "guys pleasee im running out of time, college is starting after 2 weeks and im still undecided and it's been so long but my brain isn't functioning well >\\_<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshort summary about my current state: i had always been a nerd and i wanted to work in the medical profession but sadly my grades didn't help me achieve that and it was kinda unfair ngl because my score was toooo close, and my parents cant really pay me for a private uni to get me into any of these programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshort summary about me and my interests: not really sure, but i prefer bio/chem subjects over maths and physics. I like these subjects. I like creative writing. I like photography. I like to draw and paint but i don't have much patience for that. I'm a daydreamer and i'm always listening to songs and imagining those stories in my mind all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like helping people and feeling useful. Humans fascinate me sometimes. I like analyzing people, and understanding them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are possible majors for my interests and values that also have great career paths?",

      "text": "I may be biased as I am a community college student, but if your grades aren\u2019t good enough for the health profession currently you might want to try community college first. It\u2019s a lot cheaper, you can get all your pre-med/pre-health prerequisites out of the way, and some community colleges have great nursing or other pre-health programs. In addition, once you transfer, most 4-years will void your GPA so even if you don\u2019t get good grades in community college, only your grades in your 4-year will count.\n\nAs for majors, it doesn\u2019t matter too much when going into the health professions. Med, nursing, etc. school don\u2019t require you have a specific major. That being said, most pre-health students major in Biology or similar simply because it makes it easier for them to complete their prereqs. However, if you\u2019re more interested in people, social sciences like psychology (which is becoming more and more medical), sociology, and anthropology might be more your speed. In fact, many health professional schools (I know for the MCAT this is required, keep in mind my knowledge is mostly coming from med school admissions, as I\u2019ve done a lot of research on that, but of course there are many other health professions and I don\u2019t know as much about the requirements for those schools) encourage or require you to take at least some social science classes. Bottom line major whatever you\u2019re interested in and figure out how to shape prerequisites, test prep, and other admissions requirements around it. I will warn you however that if you are thinking about medical school, you are required to take physics, statistics, and sometimes calculus. If that\u2019s not your strong suit, you might want to ask for extra help in these classes, but if you can\u2019t get through them at all, that might be a problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out in college, I wouldn\u2019t fret too much about choosing your major right now. Hell, I\u2019ve been in CC for 3 years and still don\u2019t know what I want to do! Take some classes you\u2019re interested in and explore a little. There are plenty of non-traditional medical and nursing students so don\u2019t be afraid to take your time.",
