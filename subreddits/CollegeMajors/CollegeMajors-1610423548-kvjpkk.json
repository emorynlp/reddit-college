Right now I'm 18 and this my first year of community college and I'm working on an Associates in Arts Degree. I took alot of AP classes in highschool so in this first year second semester I'm going to be able to graduate and get my degree. The only thing is, I'm still unsure of what to choose as my major. I just don't know, I'm into psychology, also criminal justice/law enforcement (I wanted to be a cop as a kid), but I'm not sure if those would be safe majors for a career path, I've been thinking of economics or marketing, but just overall I don't know. I want a job that will be atleast something I like and won't get bored of doing but also assure safety in my career path and earn a decent amount of money but I just don't know what to pick or do.", "author": "FYCDT", "created": 1610423548, "retrieved": 1632957454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
