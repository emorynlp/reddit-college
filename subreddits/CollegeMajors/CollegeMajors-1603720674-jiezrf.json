I really wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I won't make through med school- I don't have a very strong stomach. I know that I can still become a psychologist or clinical psychologist, but I don't want to listen to people's problems, I want to work with seriously mentally ill people, or to be more clear, abnormal psychology. My dilemma is that I haven't found anyone (or any profession) who works in abnormal psychology other than psychiatrist. Do you guys know of any psychologist jobs that would fit my interest? What should I do?", "author": "littlemiss79", "created": 1603720674, "retrieved": 1632847166, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"ga68e9p": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jiezrf/i_want_to_work_with_mentally_ill_people_not_be_a/ga68e9p/", "text": "You don't want to listen to people's problems, but you want to work with the mentally ill?\n\nNot only that but you are assuming that's all of the responsibilities of a clinical/psychologist. There is research, diagnostics, and teaching.\n\nAnyway, I guess there is a social worker, personal assistants, nurse, research, non profit worker, but to work with the mentally ill, you need extra training/experience. Just stick with clinical psychologist, they specialize in serious mental illness.", "author": "DetectiveTacoX", "created": 1603724955, "upvotes": 5}}}
