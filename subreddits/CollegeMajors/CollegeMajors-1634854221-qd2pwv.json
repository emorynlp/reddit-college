      "text": "Can you complete those combos in 4 years? If you can then go ahead, both sound good, so pick the one you're more interested in. If not then you might want to consider doing just one major and one minor. Having 2 majors doesn't actually help that much in terms of job prospects so it's totally not worth it to get a double major if that means you'll have to spend more time and money in college",
