      "text": "It depends on what you want to do. All three of these are very employable. Accountants have great job security and decent salaries at most firms. CS is extremely high paying IF you are good enough to land at the right companies. MBAs typically go one of very different routes - top schools send a lot of people into consulting, investment banking, and private equity, and a few into corporate leadership development programs. Smaller routes (but big at some schools) are brand management or product management. All of these have salaries way into six figure territory, and top programs (T25) all have nearly full employment for MBA grads.",
