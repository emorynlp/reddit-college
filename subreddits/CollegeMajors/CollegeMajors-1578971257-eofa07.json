  "text": "What should I major in? I'm bad at Economics but it has a good career outcome. I failed an upper division class. And I'm thinking of switching. Currently a 3rd year right now.\n\nI like the theory side of Economics, but I dislike the math. My scholarship on the line after taking these type of courses. \n\nWhat major should I switch to?",

That just shows that Econ is a math based major.",

I have international affairs and pol sci classes that count towards econ but also is something I'm thinking of taking as major possibly. the career opportunities don't look bright, but I really enjoy the subject matter.",
