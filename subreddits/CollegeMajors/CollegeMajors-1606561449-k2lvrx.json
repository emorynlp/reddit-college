I would look toward majors that allow an expression of one or more of those interests as part of the work related to that major.  The professional majors tend to be the ones that remain in high demand because they are tailored to particular career paths (business, engineering, medical, law, some sciences, etc.)  \n\nThe international business mentioned below is a great idea for linking in with culture.  Industrial design or architecture, maybe even marketing or computer graphic modeling might provide more creative outlets.  Biology or maybe forestry, might be an outlet for nature.  \n\nMost professional degrees have some variant that crosses over arts, nature and/or culture.  Even engineering could hit some of these (e.g. acoustics of performance spaces, or designing a zip-wire course at a ski resort)", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606959970, "upvotes": 1}, "gdy4uxr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k2lvrx/creative_arts_nature_and_culture_majors/gdy4uxr/", "text": "International Business can be really good if you use it right.", "author": "Doglover2006", "created": 1606608010, "upvotes": 1}}}
