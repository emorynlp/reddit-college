I've always loved engineering, but I'm also really interested in biology. I'm currently taking electrical engineering and microbiology, and I would say microbio is my favorite class with ee in second (I think I'm more into mech e). As a result, I've become really interested in BME, but I heard that the major is too broad and it's better to major in mechanical and minor in bio. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "PandaChainz", "created": 1601916219, "retrieved": 1632847292, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g7tdmp3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j5mvne/biomedical_engineering/g7tdmp3/", "text": "Basically: Mechanical engineers can pursue everything related to biomedical engineering, but biomedical engineers can't pursue everything related to mechanical. I would look more closely into your long-term goals. If you are hoping to develop medical technology (i.e. prosthetics) in your future then I would go with either major, but just know that mechanical will offer you more broader career options.\n\nI would not say a minor in biology would be helpful alongside a major in mechanical engineering, the reason being is that both do not cover similar course requirements. That means you'll likely be taking 17+ credits each semester, and at some point you would end up taking courses like engineering statics, physics, alongside advanced biology courses all in the same semester. A better minor for a mechanical engineering degree would be anything technology or math related.", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1601923591, "upvotes": 1}}}
