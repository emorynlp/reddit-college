After highschool I went to CC for two years (4th semester was last March), and then when the pandemic hit I took a break altogether because the arguing at home made it impossible to just sit down and get anything done. I was doing homework in my car. I'm still struggling with that aspect because it hasn't stopped (I either sleep or go out to cope. Hoping the libraries open up so I'll have a place to just sit down and work.)\n\nBesides that, I've managed to narrow down my major choices to the following;\n\nOption A)\n\nPursue CogSci, take on est. ~$28,000 total in debt by going to a UC, have coding skills and try to get into UX/UI/front-end dev or any other kind design. CogSci as a subject genuinely interests me, ideally I would be focusing on design/interaction/HCI. My biggest concerns are learning the coding aspects and job security in the future. Ideally I'd like to do design/art while having a fighting chance with coding. And I like how I'll have relatively more options for jobs with this major as compared to accounting. Another pro is having a UC on my resume.\nOption B)\n\nPursue Accounting, take on est. ~$16,000 total in debt by going to a CSU, try to do freelance design on the side within the first 10 years of working while I'm still young to get experience in if I'm not completely burnt out by Accounting. Ideally switch careers once Accounting burns me out enough and have the finances to do so. Have a reasonably better chance of paying off debt/ fin security in the long run and be able to move out quicker but at the cost of having limited options constrained to business-type jobs and working something I'm not really in to. (I took the career-tech class for accounting in highschool and while I didn't find the coursework hard at the time, it felt boring).\nAccounting itself vaguely interests me but the perceived job security/wages interests me. If I majored in it I would go for a CPA and try to either make my own business or work somewhere until I get burnt out enough to try and switch to something else.\n\nThe catch;\n\nCogSci I will need to play catch-up. I've reached the 1 year break mark from when I was last in school semester-wise, but the last semester I was there I basically failed my CS/math classes due to issues at home preventing me from being able to just sit down and study. I will need to play catch up this summer then enroll in the fall if I go for it.\n\nThe other issue with CS is that I still know basically nothing, by the time the semester was over only 5 people total were enrolled in the professor's class. This was the introductory class too.\n\nI know I included fluff, and there's other things I'm not mentioning, but I'm just genuinely so lost/stressed/depressed right now. School counseling has not been of any help either.\n\nThe economy also has me uncertain, it appears to have been a mixed bag according to what I've read when it comes to how hard some places were hit. Other sources have said we've reached unprecedented levels of economic crisis, others say it doesn't matter what job you go for, some say tech and other areas are still thriving, etc.\n\nMorever though, it's hard for me to realistically see massive amounts of new jobs coming in the future. I feel like this issue of hundreds/thousands of people applying for a single job will only get worse with time.\n\nI just don't know if I want to major in something that A) can get me through school quicker and B) have a reasonable chance of regretting down the line for the sake of having an income/savings, AKA Accounting or pursue something where my only regret will be not what I studied but not having gone down a more \"convenient\" route at the potential cost of not doing work I find engaging.\n\nAny thoughts?", "author": "thrownaway1306", "created": 1615949000, "retrieved": 1632846969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"gr7at5n": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/m6q8yt/cogsci_uxui_vs_accounting/gr7at5n/", "text": "Try a sub like career guidance or find a path.
