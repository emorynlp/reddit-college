I would love to minor in a degree where I learn traditional textile arts like traditional weaving or other types of yarn/textile arts that cultures do. One of my small dreams is to make a traditional Peruvian outfit used for dancing. I've seen people wear traditional outfits from there own cultures/countries and I would love to learn how to make them. Is there a degree that sounds similar to what I want/looking for?", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1631220165, "retrieved": 1632846496, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcln651": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pl67gj/traditional_textile_degree/hcln651/", "text": "I doubt that there\u2019s a major for that, you\u2019ll probably have to take courses for clothmaking", "author": "Academic-Air-3376", "created": 1631475364, "upvotes": 1}}}
