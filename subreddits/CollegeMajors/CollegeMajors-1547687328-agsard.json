I'm currently in my first year (second semester), and I don't know what career I want to pursue in life, I don't think I'm ready to declare a major right now, I don't know if I'm even taking the right courses, I have no interests in any majors/careers, I'm just totally lost and all over the place. I want to give up entirely on everything. I need to find a major immediately or else I'll drop out.\n\nThis semester started a week or two ago and I'm not enjoying any of my classes. I hate them and I'm just wasting time on them. Other classes are already locked, and I was waitlisted for 3 classes the time I signed up, because I signed up later. I did this on purpose, because everything was useless to me.\n\nI don't have anyone to talk with and my family just tells me to major in whatever I like. They don't exactly know what's going with me. I don't like anything that's offered in college. I'm becoming very paranoid and frustrated. \n\nNot good at anything non-academic things either. I don't know what I'm good at. Doing nothing is what I am good at. If I drop out of college, I would probably waste my time doing nothing in my bedroom at home. That's what I do after my classes end. My family doesn't want me to drop out.\n\nI'm done with everything. I either have to complain about this on the Internet again and again or just go to advising office hours/career services and receive little to no help about my situation.\n\nThis sounds like I'm exaggerating a lot, but I'm very serious and telling the truth.", "author": "-Sky_Nova_20-", "created": 1547687328, "retrieved": 1632957394, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ehrzofg": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/agsard/should_i_continue_college_and_research_majors_or/ehrzofg/", "text": "Hey, it seems like you\u2019re going through some tough things in life and might be a bit depressed. That\u2019s totally normal, and being in school without direction can definitely complicate things (if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with you at all \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to project too much). \n\nI\u2019ve felt some of those things before, and have found that talking with a therapist has helped me a lot. I\u2019ve also grown remarkably through the use of cognitive/behavioral therapies \u2014 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy. \n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of them out there, and there are books and online resources that you can use to guide yourself if seeing a specialist is financially or logistically difficult/impossible. \n\nMy favorite at this stage is REBT, which focuses on how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are like one big system and each of them has an effect on the other two. It\u2019s helped me personally make a lot of progress with my own mental illness and addictions, and has led me towards academic achievement I never thought I\u2019d be capable of. Now when I get depressed, it\u2019s a lot less severe because I know how to bring myself up out of it (if I\u2019m willing to do the work). \n\nBut you don\u2019t need to be sick for these things to help. Anyone can benefit from them, no matter how big or small their problems may be. \n\nA great book I\u2019d recommend is [How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable about Anything \u2014 Yes Anything!](https://www.amazon.com/Stubbornly-Yourself-Miserable-Anything-Yes-Anything/dp/0806538058) by Albert Ellis, PhD. I know the title sounds hokey but it\u2019s scientifically sound and really well written. \n\nAnyway, if any of this sounds relevant for you, maybe consider doing a little research on those behavioral therapies. They might help you feel a bit better and harness some more direction. You have a lot more power and agency than you may realize. \n\nAnd from my personal experience, I had to forge my own interest in what I wanted to do with my life. I didn\u2019t give a shit about anything in college at first aside from a career that paid well. Before even deciding I wanted a high salary, I had often felt like there was no hope and I had no future. I couldn\u2019t see the point to anything and barely cared about being alive. But now I am really passionate about my studies, and while I am preparing myself for a bunch of bullshit in my field that I do not/will not enjoy, I am enthusiastic about starting my career. \n\nI first started college 10 years ago and stopped and started again a few times. You could say I\u2019m a late bloomer. \n\nSome of the periods in between were full of drug use and reckless behavior and unemployment. Turns out I had an undiagnosed mental illness. \n\nBefore finding that out though I had to make the determination to forge a path and force myself to take interest in something even when I couldn\u2019t see the point. I think of it now like exercising a muscle \u2014 if you do it enough it becomes habit and you see the payoff, if you don\u2019t, you might start to feel weak and sick. \n\nI still have to push through some of this stuff now, but I have really come a long way. \n\nI hope you can find anything in what I\u2019m saying helpful, but if not I\u2019m sorry that I missed the mark. I wish you luck in figuring out how you want to proceed. Every day is an opportunity. Some things may be out of your control, but it\u2019s how you respond to those events that shapes how you feel and what you do.

What gets you excited about the world/life in general? It's really best to start from there. You don't want to major in something that you'll dread learning about. You'll be miserable. Personally, I love politics, history, and true crime. I get excited about those kinds of things in life. Those interests and excitement led me to become a Political Science major. I went through all kinds of majors such as Journalism, Marketing, Film, and I even thought about Biology. I know how frustrating it can be.
