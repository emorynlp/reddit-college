It depends on what you want out of the degree.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting a job in a restaurant, from your school you\u2019ll get internships and then a job offer will come and it is 9/10 directly a manager job. Could you do that with a degree? Yes. Although you would need to work in that restaurant for 2+ years and even that might not get you it. Still even that degree is great foundation if you want to advance that into a General Manager/ Area Managing Partner/ Corporate Position.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for Hotel/Casino route whether general operations or food service. a degree is very important. The knowledge you learn about this industry does not come with any other degree and you can get a managerial job in a company like Hyatt, Hilton, MGM International with a degree like this from a nice university. Could you do this without a degree? eh, not as easy as restaurants. The hotels and casinos tend to put their prospects on a Manager Training path, these are people who they took in as interns and see great potential in them.\n\nI would tell you if this industry is something you love (I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for awhile and it can get hectic but managers have it much easier than all the hourly workers) I would do more research on this, read Kitchen Confidential and see if that degree is prestigious from your university T5 are Cornell, UCF, University of Houston, and UNLV.\n\nHope this helped.", "author": "Macsimusx", "created": 1595010243, "upvotes": 1}}}
