  "text": "I am in my first year of University and I have no idea what to major in. I took classes at a local community college during my last two years of high school and earned an Associate of Arts (AA). Now, I've \"transferred\" to a in-state university with 90 credits with no exact idea of what I am going to study. I originally wanted to be a history major in order to become a secondary social studies teacher, but I have been turned off of that due to reading about how those positions are very rare and extremely coveted. Moreover, my father scoffed at me when I told him I wanted to study history to become a teacher. History has always been a personal passion of mine, but it doesn't seem like it can be transferred to the real world with a high chance of employability\n\nI've gone to the school's academic and major advisors, but they haven't been very helpful. Maybe it was me or just the remote circumstances we are in, but I wanted to discuss the specific majors I am interested in (history or environmental science) and once the 30 minute session was up they wanted me to declare a major due to having over 100 credits. Thus, as of now, I am an environmental science major with an emphasis in geology, but I have no idea if that is something I actually want to study.\n\nMy parents are immigrants who never went to college so they can't really help me with college decisions. My older sibling dropped out of high school.\n\nI honestly feel like I have messed up my life. I am not even sure if I chose the correct college to go to as I was accepted into a more prestigious university, but declined due to the higher cost. Maybe the other schools I was accepted into had better majors for me.\n\nOn paper it seems like I succeeded, but in reality I feel empty and have no direction. I strived so much for high grades in high school/community college to the extent of being miserable most of the time. I graduated with a 3.99 GPA, but at what cost? My senior year was cut short by the pandemic and it seems like that part of my life just abruptly ended. Quarantine, remote graduation, and then time to go to university.\n\nIn all, I am kind of interested in a history major due to personal passion. I have declared an environmental science major, but I am not sure if it fits me. Nothing much else at this school interests me. Perhaps IT or computer science for secure career options?",
