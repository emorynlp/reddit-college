So I realized that I'm a person who constantly has ideas in her head and in the past I was a part of a club and even if I wasn't in a position at the club, I did come up with many ideas which I told the advisor about. I realized that now business administration should be my major, but I don't know what concentration to do. I'm also interested in leadership and in the past have wanted to be a president and in committees in a club, I'm in. I don't know what business admin concentration would fit me. If you all have ideas or any questions you wanna ask, then feel free to comment them.", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1592509502, "retrieved": 1632847673, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fvassu8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/hbli5s/business_administration_ideas/fvassu8/", "text": "which concentrations are offered?", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1592535255, "upvotes": 1}}}
