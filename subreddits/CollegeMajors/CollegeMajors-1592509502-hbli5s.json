  "text": "Hello! So I realized that I'm a person who constantly has ideas in her head and in the past I was a part of a club and even if I wasn't in a position at the club, I did come up with many ideas which I told the advisor about. I realized that now business administration should be my major, but I don't know what concentration to do. I'm also interested in leadership and in the past have wanted to be a president and in committees in a club, I'm in. I don't know what business admin concentration would fit me. If you all have ideas or any questions you wanna ask, then feel free to comment them.",

              "text": "I think being interested in leadership can apply to a lot of these different concentrations, since at any path there's always room for people who can successfully manage/lead other people. I would focus more on what you could envision leading other people in. Would you want to lead a marketing team who's about to launch a campaign for a new product (marketing)? Would you want to manage a team of analysts and IT people to find out what technology is best for the business(MIS)? Would you want to have control of recruiters who interview potential candidates for the job(HR)? etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt might be better then to focus on what aspect of the business/which of the curriculums you find interesting. The only major(s) I would recommend that you DON'T get (unless if you combine them with another major) are entrepreneurship and general management. The reasons are that you don't need to go to college to start a business, and if you do, you would want to major in something that gives you more concrete skills such as accounting, which would let you understand all the tax BS for your company. 2) general management is very vague and I bet you don't really focus on anything in particular.",
