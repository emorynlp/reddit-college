I have started to search for what colleges to go to and what to major in. I want to have a good school-life balance, and I am not sure what majors are right for me. I have always been interested in any types of science and I am good at math, but not necessarily interested in it. I think getting a engineering degree will be too rigorous and time consuming from everything I have heard. I am also considering environmental science, biochemistry, agronomy.
