  "text": "hi all, \nI recently start my 3rd year and still I don\u2019t know what to major in. I got helped from counsels at my school but it isn\u2019t looking as great cause I still not sure what to do. I was interesting different subjects but after I interact with it like if I took a class about it or so , I sudden lose my interest. And now I just really have to decide on a major because I already finished my general Ed, but I still can\u2019t decide on a major to transfer. They advised to go with liberal arts , however that\u2019s not something I can see myself doing. I don\u2019t know if you guys get like this too or been through it , if there any advice you guys can tell me it\u2019s be great and really appreciate it because I\u2019m just so stuck and hopeless right now. \nThanks all.",
