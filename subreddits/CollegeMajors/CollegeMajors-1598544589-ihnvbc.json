I got helped from counsels at my school but it isn\u2019t looking as great cause I still not sure what to do. I was interesting different subjects but after I interact with it like if I took a class about it or so , I sudden lose my interest. And now I just really have to decide on a major because I already finished my general Ed, but I still can\u2019t decide on a major to transfer. They advised to go with liberal arts , however that\u2019s not something I can see myself doing. I don\u2019t know if you guys get like this too or been through it , if there any advice you guys can tell me it\u2019s be great and really appreciate it because I\u2019m just so stuck and hopeless right now. \nThanks all.", "author": "celery_roots", "created": 1598544589, "retrieved": 1632847572, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g33eqlx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ihnvbc/cant_decide_on_a_major/g33eqlx/", "text": "Something in Business or Tech?", "author": "kooltrex", "created": 1598582321, "upvotes": 1}, "g31qazq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ihnvbc/cant_decide_on_a_major/g31qazq/", "text": "what are your interests?", "author": "whimsicalcreate", "created": 1598552111, "upvotes": 1}, "g31h7ya": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ihnvbc/cant_decide_on_a_major/g31h7ya/", "text": "If you are in your third year already I would just go with whatever you are closest to graduating in and cut and run to avoid wasting more time and acquiring more debt.", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1598548127, "upvotes": 3}}}
