But I don't enjoy it as much as I did before, maybe because it's the same subjects and I do tend to get bored easily and this degree requires 5 years for a master cause a bachelor is useless where I live so it's very long. So ive had thoughts of changing my major, but if I change again that means I'll be doing my first year of bachelor again for the third time (a new start with the new major). I feel like I'm just wasting my young years and not getting even one diploma that I could use as a backup to start a work life. Anyone who has experience with changing majors multiple times?

That\u2019s how I figured out what I wanted to do. Before that, I switched my major 4 times! \n\nIf all else fails, your advisors should be able to combine all of your classes into a degree called something like \u201cGeneral Studies\u201d or \u201cUniversity Studies.\u201d ", "author": null, "created": 1544128356, "upvotes": 2}}}
