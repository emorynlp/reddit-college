Some of my interests are marketing/psychology/business/tech. Math and science aren't my favorite subject but I'm not bad at them for example I'm talking AP stat and AP environmental science in my senior year. I'm also taking AP Computer Science this year and don't mind it. But what I really enjoy doing is finding out how people or things work, I also love to research things.

So if you want money go into tech, it's and industry that's only going to continue to grow. But that's just one random guy on the internet's take. Ultimately, you make the choice and if it's the wrong one that's okay that's life, you can always go back and do something else if you want it bad enough.", "author": "CroolSummer", "created": 1630034074, "upvotes": 1}, "h92xd51": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/p52ems/what_should_i_major_in/h92xd51/", "text": "I forgot to mention but being RICH is very important to me", "author": "Fun_Cover1100", "created": 1629063753, "upvotes": 2}}}
