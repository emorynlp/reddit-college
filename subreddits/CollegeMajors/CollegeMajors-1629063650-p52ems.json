  "text": "I'm a senior in HS, and I'm not sure what to major in when I get to college, I am probably going to go to the University of Virginia. Some of my interests are marketing/psychology/business/tech. Math and science aren't my favorite subject but I'm not bad at them for example I'm talking AP stat and AP environmental science in my senior year. I'm also taking AP Computer Science this year and don't mind it. But what I really enjoy doing is finding out how people or things work, I also love to research things. What should I major in",

      "text": "Almost any concentration in Computer Science/Tech(i.e. DevOps, Data Analysis, CyberSec, etc.) is your best bet for making money, I myself am heading back to college for a degree in one of these because my first degree was a bust in getting me anywhere for jobs. \n\nRecently heard of a lot of tech professionals that have the F.I.R.E.(Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement in mind, which would probably be something you might look into more if you want the money, also you may work a lot, but retiring early and enjoying your life, is not a bad thing. \n\nChoosing a career that \"makes you happy\" or \"do what you love you'll never work a day in your life\" is BS, you're going to have days where you hate everything and everyone at your job that you \"love\" but you can still enjoy it most days then that's where you should be at, because no career is perfect and you'll have good and bad days, cultivate hobbies outside of work and with the money you make, that is what will make you happy, not work. So if you want money go into tech, it's and industry that's only going to continue to grow. But that's just one random guy on the internet's take. Ultimately, you make the choice and if it's the wrong one that's okay that's life, you can always go back and do something else if you want it bad enough.",

          "text": "You need to choose your career based on happiness. But in case you do choose a career for money, we would need a little bit more information to give you a good answer. \n\nThe tech field would probably pay the most depending on which degree you choose in that section. If you go the tech route it would probably be best to go to 6 weeks to 18 weeks boot camp. Would save you a lot of money, but the starting pay would not be that great until after a few years of experience.",
