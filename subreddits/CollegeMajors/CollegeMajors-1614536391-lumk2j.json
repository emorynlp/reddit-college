Not only are they majors that lead to good job prospects in their own rights, but they complement sociology really well. You could probably do a lot of interesting data science work with data sets on populations, demographics, etc. which stats and CS are good for. Statistics is a little more limited in application, in my opinion, and it involves a lot more math (good or bad depending on how good you are at it), but it could be a great boon if you plan to go to grad school. Computer science would be more versatile, while also giving you the tools to work with large amounts of data and explore problems relating to sociology. I think either would be a great choice.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1614560689, "upvotes": 1}}}
