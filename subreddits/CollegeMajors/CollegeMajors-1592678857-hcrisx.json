  "text": "That is my question. I am going to a public university this fall and my official major is currently electrical engineering. However, my primary interests are in physics and philosophy. My college does offer this as a double major. Studying this combo would be a dream come true. My concern would be the job prospects of this combination. I\u2019ve heard horror stories about job prospects of both of these majors (one from someone who actually went to the same college that I\u2019m going to) which is why I\u2019m considering engineering. I\u2019ve talked to some advisors and they have told me that it\u2019s not really possible to do an engineering double major and really the only minor engineering majors have time for is math (or maybe physics). \n\nIn summary, this is a clash of interests and applicability. Also I\u2019d rather not just study philosophy in my free time; I\u2019d rather go deeper than that. Any advice? What course of study should I pick?",
