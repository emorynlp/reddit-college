  "title:": "Should I pursue a hard major if im bad at math?",
  "text": "Hello, I was originally thinking of studying an art degree, but I realized I definetly dont know how to draw, so I thought  that maybe I should add a hard major to the list since Im going to university to learn anyway.\n\nThe degree certainly is interesting and way more useful, plus it has many topics that im interested (A.I, Game Development and Design, Ethical Hacking, etc.). However, it has a lot of hard math and Im not really good at it. So I dont know if I should stay with the one im thinking or pursue the hard one.",

      "text": "I think a better question is what you want to do with your life after college. If you want to get into applied ML/AI, you might not need super in-depth maths. If you want to do ground-breaking research, you'll need a LOT of math. I'm a Computer Science major focusing on novel ML so I've needed a lot of math classes, but I have friends who are doing Algorithms or Systems design concentrations who have done well in applied ML with Calc 3 and Linear Algebra.\n\nBest advice: whatever you end up studying, take advantage of EVERY resource available. Professor office hours, TA/mentor office hours, tutoring, HW help, study groups, etc.",

      "text": "At what point did the math get difficult? I have a personal theory regarding math; not that all people are bad at it, they\u2019ve just got lost somewhere in the building blocks of it. Each course builds on the previous, and if you can identify where that point is, start back from there. School is such a small portion of you\u2019re adult life, and if you can find a way into a job you enjoy, you\u2019ll thank yourself later.",
