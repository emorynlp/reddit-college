  "text": "I\u2019m a 22 year old female and I spent the first twoish years of college knocking out generals and getting my associates degree. I had my sights set on a psychology degree for a while but prior to starting at a new college to finish my bachelors, I had a strong change of heart about the pay. I realized I didn\u2019t want to struggle in that way. \n\nIm wanting a high(er) paying career and right now the top choice is a UX degree. This is an option that still carries some creativity (a hobby of mine is digital art)  \n\nMy boyfriend (24M) of four and a half years thinks I should change my major to a mathematics degree and says I\u2019m more than capable but that sounds significantly more difficult and I\u2019m wanting an option that pays well without much difficult. \n\nAny sort of advice about those majors or careers or something better would help me so so so much!",

It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s less difficult than mathematics degree, and programming can be creative or used creatively from what I heard,and there\u2019s plenty of job opportunities. You can probably leverage that for UX jobs too.\n\nOr maybe something like animation?",

Yes I think you\u2019re right - and my college\u2019s degree path for UX includes some required animation classes so if I go that way that would be telling if I enjoy it a lot! \n\nI don\u2019t think Computer science is for me hahaha I wish computers interested me more but I get so bored. I considered it for a minute and my boyfriend is in that field but I don\u2019t think I could stand doing that for my career. My boyfriend suggested mathematics because I\u2019ve always excelled in school and math was never hard for me and it\u2019s more flexible when it comes to job paths.",

              "text": "I will say, I've rather enjoyed my math major. Have you taken math courses at uni yet? I presume a stats course with psych but not much else.\n\nIf you wanna get your feet wet into uni math, see if there's a first-year discrete math/logic/intro to proofs class available. That will be the most representative of your tenure in a math major, so if you enjoy it then food for thought.\n\nThere's also a lot of vector/matrix work in the algebra side (And there will probably be some math courses that dabble with code) so it could also be a good pairing",
