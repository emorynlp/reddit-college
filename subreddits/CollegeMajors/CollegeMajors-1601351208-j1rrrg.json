A good major that would combine the \"creating\" aspect of things as well as biology would probably be biomedical engineering - something that focuses on medical technology like prosthetics and such (or perhaps Elon Musk's \"Neuralink\"). Of course, every major is going to be difficult at some point in time but if you become dead set on that path then you will succeed. Engineering could be harder than most majors but I'd say that biomedical engineering is a more modern and growing field with great job opportunities.\n\nAfter doing some research I have seen some people not have a favorable view on biomedical, but preferring mechanical or materials engineering. Whether or not that's a path you'd like is up to you though!", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1601354735, "upvotes": 5}}}
