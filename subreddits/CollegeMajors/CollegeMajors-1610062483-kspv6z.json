I thought that I would go into Political Science because of this, but I can\u2019t really seem to find what jobs would even be available. I\u2019ve found \u201cLobbyist\u201d, but there is no way that I will ever do that. \nShould I look for a different major? What are some jobs that a Political Science major can get you?\nAlso I\u2019m still in high school, so I still have a year or two to think about it.", "author": "Marbinair", "created": 1610062483, "retrieved": 1632847064, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"gijxsgq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/kspv6z/political_science_majors/gijxsgq/", "text": "Politician, law school, grad student for political philosophy, policy, ect.
