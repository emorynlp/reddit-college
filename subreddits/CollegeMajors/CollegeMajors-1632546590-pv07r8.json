Even masters are replaceable in the industry so Ph.D. is almost the standard entry requirement.\n\nI am worried about my future career life and plan to pick mathematics, but solving abstract problems brings me no joy. Perhaps I can force myself to pass the exam by hundreds of hours of reviewing but what worries me is personal subjects and dissertation. \n\nI have to say money matters for me. I have to repay my family a huge amount of money (since I'm an international student I cannot get a low-interest student loan). I am worried if I can do well in mathematics but picking biology makes me feel so guilty. (In the UK minor is generally not permitted)\n\nPlease I really need some advice", "author": "washthegoldenbottle", "created": 1632546590, "retrieved": 1632958000, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he71ytr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pv07r8/should_i_pick_a_major_i_dont_like_for_job/he71ytr/", "text": "I studied mathematics, and I will tell you right now. Don't study mathematics if you have no interest in it. Please study something that you enjoy and are interested in. Every major has their own difficulties, but the most difficult majors are the ones that you don't enjoy.\n\nMy suggestion: study Biology, but tack on some CS and Statistics courses. This way, you get to satisfy your love for Biology but you get some practical/marketable skills along the way. Also, look into Bioinformatics/Biostatistics tracks.

In my opinion, if you can't see yourself working a job that involves mathematics in the future and think you'd be miserable and unhappy if you were to end up picking this major, don't pick it. You can find lucrative jobs in most other fields too, it's just that some will take longer to find than others. Not everyone has to major in engineering, medicine or mathematics in order to have a good future.", "author": "nosenseofdanger", "created": 1632551193, "upvotes": 1}}}
