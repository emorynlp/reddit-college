  "title:": "Should I pick a major I don't like for job opportunities?",
  "text": "I do like biology but almost everyone on the internet says a biology degree brings you poor payment and academia is filled with laboratory slavery. Even masters are replaceable in the industry so Ph.D. is almost the standard entry requirement.\n\nI am worried about my future career life and plan to pick mathematics, but solving abstract problems brings me no joy. Perhaps I can force myself to pass the exam by hundreds of hours of reviewing but what worries me is personal subjects and dissertation. \n\nI have to say money matters for me. I have to repay my family a huge amount of money (since I'm an international student I cannot get a low-interest student loan). I am worried if I can do well in mathematics but picking biology makes me feel so guilty. (In the UK minor is generally not permitted)\n\nPlease I really need some advice",

      "text": "I studied mathematics, and I will tell you right now. Don't study mathematics if you have no interest in it. Please study something that you enjoy and are interested in. Every major has their own difficulties, but the most difficult majors are the ones that you don't enjoy.\n\nMy suggestion: study Biology, but tack on some CS and Statistics courses. This way, you get to satisfy your love for Biology but you get some practical/marketable skills along the way. Also, look into Bioinformatics/Biostatistics tracks. Good luck!",

          "text": "Thank you. Since I'm a 2022 entry I already decided to learn some basic programming skills during the year. \n\nJust curious--what degree did you get in the end? Is your major helpful when finding a job? I heard a bachelor's degree in biology is useless when seeking a job and that worries me a lot.",

      "text": "This is a topic that's very often debated among college students. In my opinion, if you can't see yourself working a job that involves mathematics in the future and think you'd be miserable and unhappy if you were to end up picking this major, don't pick it. You can find lucrative jobs in most other fields too, it's just that some will take longer to find than others. Not everyone has to major in engineering, medicine or mathematics in order to have a good future.",

          "text": "That's the problem. I don't even know if I can hold my passion after hearing all these disquieting facts. I've stayed in a wet lab for a month and I liked my work, but what about staying in the lab for years doing repeating work, dealing with endless lab reports and seminars? Will my interest become torture in the future? Can I pay my bills? None of these questions I can answer.\n\nIt sounds like choosing between \"the one you don't like for sure but probably offers you a promising future\" and \"the one you like at the moment but brings an unpredictable future\". Making this decision brings so much anxiety that almost drives me mad.\n\nThanks for your reply.",

      "text": "I think you should consider a major in biology but self-teaching programming, algorithms, and cs concepts. If you can do statistics (ANOVA at the most complicated) that would make you an asset to a lab, and maybe allow you to work with people in fields like bioinformatics, biophysics, and computational biology.\n\nSpeaking of which, have you considered a less abstract field like CS or physics and then applying it to biology in your undergraduate research?",
