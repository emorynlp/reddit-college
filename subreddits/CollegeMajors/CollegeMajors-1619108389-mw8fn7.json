How much work is statistics vs other stem majors, particularly bio? Does anyone know about the overlap with premed/prevet required courses? Workload-wise, would it be feasible to pick up a minor in something biological? Vice-versa, could I get a good statistics-related job from majoring in bio and minoring in statistics?", "author": "emu_alice", "created": 1619108389, "retrieved": 1632957574, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gvgxany": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mw8fn7/stats_major/gvgxany/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1619113809, "upvotes": 1}}}
