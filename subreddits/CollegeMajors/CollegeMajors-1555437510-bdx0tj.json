I have be diagnosed with ADHD since the sixth grade, grown out of the H a bit, but still have a hard time focusing. On my meds I am good with numbers and science, but off of them I can't seem to want to pay attention. I have been studying German for about 4 years now. I took three years in high school (was nothing special), but as I entered university I was placed in a higher class (2nd and 3rd year classes). I also very extroverted and am very comfortable with public speaking, always did the presentations for classes and even once gave a speech for 400 people (a girls camp when I was 17). I got a 25 on my ACT, 80 on ASFAB, and always was a great test taker. Not the most phenomenal grades because I was never one for homework. I also am quite the history buff and enjoy reading up on anthropology. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am really at a loss of what I should do while not disappointing my parents. College is one of the hardest things I've done and i don't want to owe this school my arm and leg because I dilly dallied on picking a career path. Thank you if you took the time reading this and even more if you lend advice!!", "author": "GreatBigWorld427", "created": 1555437510, "retrieved": 1632958173, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"el2t0r9": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/bdx0tj/adhd_speaks_shabby_german_and_enjoys_public/el2t0r9/", "text": "Well, my recommendation is to always pursue something you\u2019re interested in rather than something you aren\u2019t. Have you considered pathways in History or Anthropology? There\u2019s quite a bit in both that you can pursue as a career in my opinion, but of course I\u2019m more knowledgeable about careers in Anthropology than history, so I can\u2019t give you too much about the latter. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m more than happy to discuss anthropology if that\u2019s something that interests you. Can I ask what area of it are you interested in?", "author": "The_Max_Rebo", "created": 1555473774, "upvotes": 1}}}
