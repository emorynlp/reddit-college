I want to learn them all, but I'm stuck between Swedish or Japanese. I am unsure if I can, because I am going to go back to school in my  thirties, will be able to learn a language. There's also the fact that I know a decent amount of Spanish (or did) and I'm wondering if I should just retake 1-4 as a minor to become proficient. \n\nI like Japan and the culture and the language is beautiful. I would love to be able to read in it, but I'm afraid my age will hinder learning the characters. I am using Genki rn to learn words and grammar, but with Swedish, I am unable to pronounce things on my own, so I'd need a teacher (and I'd need one for Japanese too). \n\nAnybody have any advice? I'm open to questions.\n\nThanks in advance!", "author": "ManicTypist", "created": 1590985207, "retrieved": 1632847691, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ft552z3": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gudsa8/unsure_of_language_to_choose_and_sociology_vs/ft552z3/", "text": "Tech school, become a carpenter", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1591460531, "upvotes": 1}}}
