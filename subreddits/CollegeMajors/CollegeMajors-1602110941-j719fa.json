  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI don't know what to major in, but I have a strong feeling it will be in the arts or teaching (bc I know that sometimes art doesn't pay that well).  And even though art may not be in my future, I can't decide what I would want to major in. I know definitely that it would a major in some form of 2D art in TV media, but what that is I'm not sure what specifically. How do I make a GOOD art portfolio in 2 months that covers the basics of 2D relating to media and animation?\n\nAlso, what are some good art schools that you went to or a friend went to?\n\nThank you for reading!",

      "text": "find local gesture drawing classes with nude models. you need to draw nude models. if the drawings are good put them in your portfolio. go to a pre college program at your top choice. completing this program without expulsion will almost guarantee entry to whichever school. scad is the best art school thats easy to get into. all others are very hard on entry or aren\u2019t as good. definitely shoot for scad with a quickly put together portfolio. good career support too. when i applied to college portfolio was actually optional there and only for scholarships it may still be. the masters that review applications can tell how long your port took. scad will have you and give you amazing resources. for you check out saic, cca, sva, massart, and various art institutes. the -best- schools but very hard to get into are risd, nyu, parsons, and cal arts. foundation year will burn like hell but you will come out if it a whole new soul.",
