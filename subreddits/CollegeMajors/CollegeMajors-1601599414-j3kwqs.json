Either one would only be 6 more credits and they seem to be of comparable difficulty. I'm more interested in neuroscience and it ties in well with what I want to pursue with ph/bio, but I think info systems would provide me with more useful and in demand skills. The info systems minor is also within a professional college which provides a few more networking opportunities.\n\nI know minors don't have a huge impact on career prospects, but I'd like some feedback about what's a more suitable minor.\n\nThanks in advance :)", "author": "xsbean", "created": 1601599414, "retrieved": 1632847322, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g7cuohr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3kwqs/minor_information_systems_or_neuroscience/g7cuohr/", "text": "Do you plan on going to grad school?", "author": "infjetson", "created": 1601604146, "upvotes": 2}, "g7cmq4v": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/j3kwqs/minor_information_systems_or_neuroscience/g7cmq4v/", "text": "What are the courses exactly?
