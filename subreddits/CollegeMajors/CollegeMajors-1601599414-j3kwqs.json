  "title:": "Minor: Information Systems or Neuroscience",
  "text": "Hi, I'm a junior public health and bio double major at UNC, and at this point, I can add either an information systems or neuro minor. Either one would only be 6 more credits and they seem to be of comparable difficulty. I'm more interested in neuroscience and it ties in well with what I want to pursue with ph/bio, but I think info systems would provide me with more useful and in demand skills. The info systems minor is also within a professional college which provides a few more networking opportunities.\n\nI know minors don't have a huge impact on career prospects, but I'd like some feedback about what's a more suitable minor.\n\nThanks in advance :)",
