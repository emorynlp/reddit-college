I am enrolled as an engineering undecided student but am unsure regarding if engineering is truly a route I wish to go. Conversely, I am also enrolled in computer science courses and would possibly want a computer science degree instead of an engineering one, but I do not want to sit in front of a computer all day. I am intending on taking two semesters of computer science to see if I like it and I intend to take pre med science courses in the scenario I need to switch.\n\nCould anyone offer some advice?", "author": "kush2610", "created": 1564541789, "retrieved": 1632848254, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f0gtkvn": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ck2f35/undecided_engineering_major_and_more_confusion/f0gtkvn/", "text": "Little late to the game but they have information systems and it degrees now.
