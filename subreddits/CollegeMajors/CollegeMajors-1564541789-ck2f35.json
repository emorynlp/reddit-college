  "title:": "Undecided Engineering major and more Confusion",
  "text": " \n\nHey yall,\n\nI am currently on the fence about majors. I am enrolled as an engineering undecided student but am unsure regarding if engineering is truly a route I wish to go. Conversely, I am also enrolled in computer science courses and would possibly want a computer science degree instead of an engineering one, but I do not want to sit in front of a computer all day. I am intending on taking two semesters of computer science to see if I like it and I intend to take pre med science courses in the scenario I need to switch.\n\nCould anyone offer some advice?",
