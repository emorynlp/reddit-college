  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m debating on what to major in during college so I can base my hs courses around it, but I am seemingly unable to decide between psychology and medicine. It\u2019s always been my dream to be a surgeon, and I know it would make my parents happier, but I am a lot more interested in psychology than anything else, and I feel like it would make me happy. However, I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to find jobs in psychology, or if it pays well. Does anyone have advice?",

Doesn\u2019t matter which bachelor. \n\nand also, why does your input from your parent have to matter a lot? Choose a career you\u2019ll be satisfied with.",
