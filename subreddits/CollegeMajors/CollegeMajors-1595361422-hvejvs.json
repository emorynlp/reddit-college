I really enjoy science classes such as Chemistry and Physics, and was thinking of going that route. However, the job aspects and the level of education that I would need is not in my favor. I don't mind going for a PhD, but I am not sure if I would want to do that when that future comes when finishing undergrad. After further research I decided on engineering as it uses those physical sciences and apply them to actual practical applications, which allows for someone to graduate with a bachelors, and get a job easier. I was thinking of Aerospace Engineering, but I don't really care for the applicable side of this major, with the mechanical aspects and how different appliances work together. I've came up with a major that I might be interested that I have found to be the most sciencey of all the engineering disciplines: Materials Science and Engineering. From what I researched I can go into the work force as an 'Engineer' or go for a PhD and study the more theory side of this major. Any thoughts about this major? Any similar majors like this one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks", "author": "MattNyte", "created": 1595361422, "retrieved": 1632956156, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
