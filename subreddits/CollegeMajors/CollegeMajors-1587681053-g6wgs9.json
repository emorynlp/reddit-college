I've been considering a lot of jobs, such as nursing, being a vet, marine biology/zoology, neuroscience, criminology, even marketing/business/communications. Before i was really into criminal justice and really wanted to major in that, but i just dont know anymore. I want to be of help to people and society, of course make a decent amount of money, and have a stable job. Ive been doing tons of research for the past month or so and im still so uncertain. I just dont know.

Getting as much exposure to professionals in different fields will give you a good idea of what to expect. Don't be afraid to pick something, dive in completely, and then change. I don't see the point in sitting in indecision for too long, I'm a much bigger advocate for committing to something and then switching. You won't really know what it's like until you are in it.\n\nAlso, don't think that your major will decide your profession (to some degree). It looks like you would be pretty good if you started out in Biology or Business. You could start out in one of those and see if you want to pivot into the other ones. You pretty much have 4 years to decide. For now, my advice is to meet professionals. In 2 years, pick a major and if you don't like it, pivot.", "author": "travishummel", "created": 1587747583, "upvotes": 1}, "foeh8zu": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/g6wgs9/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_do/foeh8zu/", "text": "I'm a recent grad with a degree in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, and a minor in Marine Biology.

The first year is usually nothing but general classes like math, English, and science. The first year would be the perfect time to research careers. Some colleges even offer career counseling and even a whole career exploration class. I would suggest doing both of these. Try speaking with a counselor at your high school. They can help you explore careers and figure out what you like. Also, research majors that interest you. Ask yourself whether you would enjoy taking the classes that may be required for that major. Do you like Science? Then, maybe a science major may be good for you. Do stuff like that. The more information you get, the more you will know yourself. \n\nAs a sophomore, I wouldn't stress too much about it. You've got time. When I was in high school, I thought I knew what I wanted to do, but realized that I didn't when I got to college. Honestly, I didn't discover my true passion until my first semester of college. It was an eye opener after 4 years of thinking I knew what I wanted to do. So, the same might happen to you. I still am not 100% sure as I approach the end of my second semester. I have a back up plan in mind in case I decide to switch. Good luck!
