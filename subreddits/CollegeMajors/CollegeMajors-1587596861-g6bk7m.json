I feel like I don\u2019t have many options that I\u2019m passionate about anymore. I am considering engineering because I am good at math and physics but I don\u2019t want to be stuck at a job I don\u2019t like and wishing I had pursued music. Any advice from those of you that took a more practical major instead of your passion?

Often you find that if you try and you really have the passion to work, you\u2019re better than you think. But if you don\u2019t think you can handle the full rigor of a Performance Major, there are plenty of other options. You could go for Music Education, which would train you to be a music teacher, it\u2019s slightly different and less performance-focused. Or rather than a BM you could go for a BA in musical arts, which is less rigorous. Or you could go with a music minor, not giving up your passion but not going for it completely as a career.", "author": null, "created": 1588784906, "upvotes": 2}, "fo8va4c": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/g6bk7m/i_love_music_but_im_not_good_enough/fo8va4c/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1587604571, "upvotes": 2}, "fo8r0cj": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/g6bk7m/i_love_music_but_im_not_good_enough/fo8r0cj/", "text": "I am currently an engineering student and honestly I hate it.
