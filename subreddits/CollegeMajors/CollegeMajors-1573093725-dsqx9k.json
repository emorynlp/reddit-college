              "text": "There's a few reasons. First, film is a very specific major that if I wanted to go into a field that isn't media related, I want the psych major there too since it is more broad and can apply to any kind of career. Also, I want to work with people and be like a coordinator/manager type thing for a tv/film production company, which would involve a lot of human interaction and understanding how they think (hence the psychology). But mostly, I'm really just interested in both and I am confident that the skills in both programs will be really helpful for my career :)",

My university has many different types of undergrad business degrees, so I\u2019m sure you could find one that would fit that job as well. Hope this semi helped!",
