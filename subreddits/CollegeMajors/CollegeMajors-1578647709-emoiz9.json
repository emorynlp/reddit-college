I\u2019ve always been interested in politics and done lots of research especially international relations and affairs. Up until now I\u2019ve wanted to major in polisci but I heard it\u2019s a really bad major and just looks good on the surface and it\u2019s hard to score good jobs with it. I\u2019m very interested in the political field and would like to pursue my career in that (not necessarily a politician), so I was wondering what are some majors that will score good jobs and could maybe even lean towards the political field? Thank you for your time and any advice would be appreciated.", "author": "Superpar1231", "created": 1578647709, "retrieved": 1632847943, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fdtbs7w": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/emoiz9/seeking_correct_major/fdtbs7w/", "text": "Economics would be a good major for job opportunities and would give you chances to work for the government", "author": "cdubu111", "created": 1578714526, "upvotes": 2}}}
