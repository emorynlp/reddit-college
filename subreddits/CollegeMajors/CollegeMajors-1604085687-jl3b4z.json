I\u2019ve been debating whether I should major in Physics or Engineering when I start school next fall (current HS senior). I\u2019ve always been interested in astronomy (since 5th grade) and wanted to pursue an astrophysics career (however I\u2019ve recently begun to realize that jobs in that field are super competitive). Would it be better to pick an engineering discipline and then IF I still want to, transfer to a physics track for my undergrad?  I heard doing that is much easier than switching from a physics to engineering major. Computer science and computer engineering are also quite interesting to me. How do I choose?", "author": null, "created": 1604085687, "retrieved": 1632847161, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gamw3oj": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jl3b4z/physics_or_engineering/gamw3oj/", "text": "I would suggest engineering with a physics minor, or a major called Engineering Physics.
