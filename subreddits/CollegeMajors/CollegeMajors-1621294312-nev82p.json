I received my BS in mathematics education and I'm currently a high school educator. I noticed many websites encourage students to get a BS in Biology or Life Sciences to have a foundation for their masters/doctoral degree. \n\nI'm concerned that if I pursue a master's in biology I won't have the foundational knowledge since I studied mathematics in undergrad. I only took Environmental Science to complete my science credit in college, and the last time I took Biology/Chemistry was in high school (about 6 years ago). \n\nAny advice would be helpful! Thank you :)", "author": "mahalkita0612", "created": 1621294312, "retrieved": 1632957435, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {}}
