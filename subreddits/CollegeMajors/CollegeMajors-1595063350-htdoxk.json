I feel like its gonna take me till my Senior year to get in from where I have to take many difficult classes so I'll end up graduating in 6 years for a bachelors. Just wondering if I'm the only one or if there are other cases where people don't get into their major until senior year.", "author": "JV2022", "created": 1595063350, "retrieved": 1632847645, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
