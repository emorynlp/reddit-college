I\u2019ve always wanted to go into the medical field and I narrowed it down to pathology a few years ago. Is biology the right major? Or chemistry? And should I do pre-med if I want to be a pathologist in the future? Any insight would be very helpful! Finding the right school has also been challenging. My stats are below if anyone wants to help or currently goes to a school they like for the med field or good biology programs out there. \nthank you!\n\nStats: \n1330 sat\n5 APs\nWeighted GPA: 4.16\nUnweighted: 4.0\nClass rank: 13th\nLots of extracurriculars", "author": "abbsjohnssn", "created": 1632804894, "retrieved": 1632846493, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hek8drl": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pwyzsn/need_help_on_majorcollege_search/hek8drl/", "text": "Senior engineering student here, and firstly I must tell you that it depends on a few things where you should apply. Here's the list of priorities you need for choosing a college in order:  \n1. How much financial aid do they disburse to students?\n\n2. Where do you want to study (in-state, out-of-state, internationally)?\n\n3. Where is their program ranked nationally?\n\n4. What college just sounds the most fun? You're gonna be there for 4 years or more, depending on how your studies go, so pick a place that's a good mix of fun and academic.\n\nAs for your major, this is the perfect time for you to try a variety of your interests. You're gonna end up taking a bio and chem class anyway, so whichever one you prefer more, make that your primary field of study.\n\nJust a last note, though. This is, um, my personal opinion, but uhh college chemistry is nothing like the chemistry you've experienced in AP classes. They are on a much different level, so be sure that if it's something you like, just be prepared for what may come. Also, a last last note, I would uh like to advertise either Texas A&M University or UT Austin. Hands down, you've got a pretty decent shot at one of their pre-med tracks, so take away from that what you will. Good luck.", "author": "TAMUVIBEZ", "created": 1632806061, "upvotes": 3}}}
