I know that I love technology and helping others fix it when something goes wrong. I love learning new things and how they work, helping people and I want a career that will be exciting. I used to be a biology major but I realized I didn't really feel passionate about the sciences or pursuing a medical career. I was thinking of going into computer science but I am not sure if I would like programming I don't even know what that is really. I guess what I am asking for advice on is if you have any advice on careers that sound like they could work for me?
