Dealing with weird feelings of regret over my major and not sure why", "text": "So originally when I had applied to colleges back in my senior year of high school I applied to a few nursing programs but I wasn\u2019t sure of what I wanted to do. I was accepted into some of the programs but I turned them down because I overthought everything and didn\u2019t think I wanted to be a nurse. But now I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019m currently majoring in kinesiology and am planning to go into exercise physiology or physical therapy but I\u2019ve always wondered in the back of my head if I\u2019d be happier if I was doing nursing. Even though I know nursing school is extremely hard and stressful, for some reason I just feel like I regret not going to nursing school and can\u2019t stop imagining what my life would be like if I had. Any tips on dealing with feelings of regret or how to figure out what career is best for you?", "author": "ray-29", "created": 1578296341, "retrieved": 1632957378, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fdfw20k": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ekqsha/how_do_i_figure_out_college_dealing_with_weird/fdfw20k/", "text": "I actually have been rethinking my major as well. All throughout high school, I wanted to get a degree in Biology to work with animals. Well just last semester in college, I have doubted doing this career. I love English, so now I'm thinking about teaching English. I'm not 100% sure though on whether to switch my major. I think the only way you can truly decide is by reflecting on yourself. I would recommend talking with your counselor or career counselor, if they are separate. They can find you some insights into what the nursing career would entail. Also, you could do some private research of your own about what nursing school requires. Yes, it's a lot of schooling, but it may be worth it if you love to do it. Also, try talking with a family member. Ask them if they think you'd be a good nurse. Finally, you could volunteer at a senior living home. You might not be able to perform all medical involved tasks, but you could definitely observe nurses and still be taking care of people. This would give you some insight about whether you would enjoy the career. That's the best advice I can give you.
