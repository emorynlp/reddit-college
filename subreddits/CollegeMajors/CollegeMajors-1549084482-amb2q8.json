So I am currently 18, a sophomore in college (I started a year early) Ever since I started last year Ive had some trouble deciding on the career path/major I want. So I started as Pre-Nursing and wanted to get my BSN and maybe a few years after get my nurse practitioner degree. Last winter break (2017-2018) I started to doubt it because I thought the medical field was not for me because I am extremely into social issues, human rights and all of that. so I began considering switching over to gender and women studies/ psychology or English major and obtain a law degree. I read online that lawyers are underpaid these days and struggle to secure jobs, I shadowed at a law firm and it wasn't really social justice based like I thought.. I'm still pre-nursing right now and can begin the RN program next fall if I pass the classes this semester. I would like to include that my strong subjects are definitely not bio/chem/math I have been really struggling with these classes.i even failed anatomy 1 and am retaking it.  I really enjoy English, psych and sociology classes and always got As in them. I worked as a medical assistant for a few months to obtain experience in the med field and I didnt love it nor hate, I just didnt feel fulfilled. if I were to switch over to women/gender studies and English would I be able to get a job after? would I be able to teach that if I continued my education and got a masters? I know nursing offers financial security and that switching to the social sciences and humanities is a risk, but I know its what I love and it drives a passion in me. can anyone tell me what they would do in my position? and if you think I should pursue women/gender studies what kind of jobs can I get with a BA? im sorry for the lengthy post I just really need an opinion. what would you do?", "author": "ma18L_", "created": 1549084482, "retrieved": 1632958186, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"efltr4d": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/amb2q8/stuck_between_2_paths_and_indecisive/efltr4d/", "text": "Have you thought about going into nonprofit studies, business management, or political science?

For bachelor degrees:\n\n\\- Registered nursing: 87% found employment straight away with an average starting salary of $59,000.\n\n\\- Gender studies: 54% found employment at avg. $39,000.\n\n\\- English: 58% found employment at avg. $37,000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom a purely economic view, I think it's pretty clear that nursing is by far the better choice.  But I will say that it is a very difficult job and requires a lot of commitment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's very normal to be unsure about what you want to do. Heck, I'm still not sure and I graduated years ago and have a career. Just be careful about taking on too much student debt in the process!", "author": "Goksun", "created": 1549110998, "upvotes": 1}}}
