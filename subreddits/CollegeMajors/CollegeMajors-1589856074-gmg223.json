I honestly have no clue and I\u2019ll be entering college this upcoming fall. Everyone keeps pushing for STEM. I don\u2019t dislike science or math, however, I\u2019ve never been exposed to those classes on a higher level. Many people have also said business wasn\u2019t the best idea. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don\u2019t understand why so many people hate on business majors when it\u2019s apart of everything we know. People also say \u201cwhat do you like?\u201d Well, I feel as if my interests don\u2019t particularly fall into one concrete area. I\u2019m clueless. Please help. \n\nCan someone explain the benefits of STEM vs the benefits of Business? Job projection? Pros/Cons of each field?", "author": "hotnoodles18", "created": 1589856074, "retrieved": 1632957936, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fr5fqq2": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gmg223/dont_know_what_to_major_in/fr5fqq2/", "text": "STEM vs Business\n\nWhile I am not in the fields, here is what I can offer. \n\nSTEM careers are a pretty vexing field. They require the passion and dedication for the subjects you take on. They take a lot of time to study and work up to. \nThey have a great outlook, *having a job outlook of an estimated one million new jobs between now and 2028. \nMost people do not pursue them because of the workload and ever changing duties they hold.\nI would suggest taking up this field if you have good control over your mental and emotional health, good organization, and excellent written and communication skills. \n*\u201cThe skills students gain in STEM fields go beyond number crunching and technological innovation. \"Engineering degrees help students develop creative problem-solving techniques,\" says Jennifer Stephan, associate dean of undergraduate advising for the school of engineering at Tufts University in Massachusetts.\u201d \n\nDepending on the subject you pursue, the demands vary but, the overall approach to it requires a very detail oriented mindset.\n\nBusiness on the other hand is a common field because it is what make the world on its toes. It\u2019s usually what people major in when they have sport scholarships because the concepts are simple and creative. \nI personally enjoy it, but if you do not have good communication, solid goals, and an out of the box mindset, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for you. \nIt is combined with many different subjects and is great information to know universally as an adult. *The job outlook is estimated to increase 7% between 2012 and 2022. \n*\u201cEntrepreneur.com says creating jobs is a good reason to go into business for yourself. \u201dThere's nothing like the satisfaction of knowing you're responsible for the success of your employees. Your ideas provided them the opportunity to earn a living, provide for their family and fulfill their own dreams.\"\n\nI would recommend making a pros and cons list for yourself and what you think you would benefit from. \nIf you think you are still having a difficult time approaching your career choice and personal passions, I recommend visiting sokanu.com to help narrow your skills down.\n\nJust remember to look inside yourself. It took me a while to understand what I wanted out of life and how I need to approach my future. Although your goals will change overtime, I recommend that you take some time to reflect on who you are and what you live for. Knowing yourself is a great first step to finding a good career.\nI hope this helped. Good luck and stay safe.\n\n\n* STEM job outlook-\nhttps://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2014/spring/art01.pdf\n\n* Business Job outlook- \nhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/mobile/home.htm\n\n* 7 reasons to go into Business for yourself-\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/gingerdean/2016/05/29/7-reasons-to-go-into-business-for-yourself/amp/\n\n* Determine whether a STEM major is the right choice-\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2017-10-24/determine-whether-a-stem-major-is-the-right-choice", "author": "holciamp", "created": 1589907824, "upvotes": 3}}}
