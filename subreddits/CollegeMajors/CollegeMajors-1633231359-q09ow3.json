  "text": "Hello, I was thinking about majoring in computer science and I was wondering what do I really need in high school to get in since it is a very competitive major. I'm in my senior year and took my first intro comp sci class so I am not very confident since I didn't take AP comp sci, but since freshman, I've taken all honors or AP classes. Considering the experience I have in comp sci Idk if I should apply to competitive UCs with that major in mind. (I have the same feelings about applying to another career in STEM such as engineering)",

      "text": "Technically, there are no requirements to major in CS in high school. That said, AP Comp Sci (which it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken) would be a good introduction to the field. Also you might want to take AP Calc AB or BC and maybe AP Stats, because you\u2019re going to need to know a lot of math for CS. Most UCs accept AP credit as long as you achieve at least a 4 on the exam. However, you can take the equivalent classes once you\u2019re in college, so there\u2019s no need to worry. Also if you\u2019re from California (I will probably sound like a broken record if you\u2019ve read other posts of mine), I highly, highly recommend taking classes at your local community college. That way, you can take more advanced CS and math classes and complete some of your requirements before you even enter a UC!",
