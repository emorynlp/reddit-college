  "text": "Hello, I was thinking about majoring in computer science and I was wondering what do I really need in high school to get in since it is a very competitive major. I'm in my senior year and took my first intro comp sci class so I am not very confident since I didn't take AP comp sci, but since freshman, I've taken all honors or AP classes. Considering the experience I have in comp sci Idk if I should apply to competitive UCs with that major in mind. (I have the same feelings about applying to another career in STEM such as engineering)",

      "text": "Technically, there are no requirements to major in CS in high school. That said, AP Comp Sci (which it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken) would be a good introduction to the field. Also you might want to take AP Calc AB or BC and maybe AP Stats, because you\u2019re going to need to know a lot of math for CS. Most UCs accept AP credit as long as you achieve at least a 4 on the exam. However, you can take the equivalent classes once you\u2019re in college, so there\u2019s no need to worry. Also if you\u2019re from California (I will probably sound like a broken record if you\u2019ve read other posts of mine), I highly, highly recommend taking classes at your local community college. That way, you can take more advanced CS and math classes and complete some of your requirements before you even enter a UC!",

      "text": "Depends on which UC and which program. CS at any UC? The gpa/sat scores to get in, at minimum, and maybe some meaningful extracurriculars (not necessarily cs realted) Berkeley EECS or MET? That would be a reach for you, but I would recommend applying to L&S CS if you have the GPA for it.\n\nFun fact: the list of feeder schools to top tech companies in CA in order are UCB, USC, UCSD, UCLA, and then SJSU.\n\nCA community colleges are also very affordable and have good academics and there is an awesome transfer system so you should consider attending one if finances after aid aren't looking well.",
