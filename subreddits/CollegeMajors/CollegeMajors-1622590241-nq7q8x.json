I am currently going into junior in high school and I\u2019m debating on what I should start majoring in. What are some majors you guys recommend? Speaking for myself, I\u2019m interested in something in the medical field or something business related. I\u2019ve been doing some research on being MDS, PA\u2019s, business management and a couple more. I\u2019m basically wondering what you guys are majoring in, and the pros and cons of the major. Anything is helpful, comment anything!
