As it stands now I've been weighing my options for majors. Basically, I've been deciding between Education (TESOL), Cyber Security, and something more traditional \"computer science\" related, if that makes sense.\n\nBasically, I'm really interested in the idea of teaching as a career, and I would want to teach English in Japan. However, to be accepted into something like a university, you'd most likely need a Master's in TESOL at a minimum. I'm worried about trapping myself and ruining employability in other fields if I find that I don't really want to do it as much as I thought. Plus, my college doesn't offer a TESOL specific major, so I'd need to put in extra effort to coordinate taking classes now that would count toward that type of degree in the future. I could also major in that while teaching myself programming and stuff in my free time, but I'm not sure.\n\nSo I'm thinking it might be a better or safer option to major in something that seems more versatile while still being something I'm genuinely interested in. It's also important to note that no matter what I do, one of my main goals after I get my degree is to move to Japan.\n\nThere's a degree at my school offered called \"web development and programming.\" There are a lot more programming classes offered at the start covering multiple languages, with less mathematics courses over all than a typical CS transfer degree. One of my huge things is that, like a lot of people in CS majors I've seen in my research, I suck at math and want to deal with it as little as possible.\n\nSome things I'd be really interested in with this degree is working on things like freelance website design, software engineering for a company (especially small/medium companies), working on some aspect of game development, or finding some way to apply it to my other hobbies and interests like music, language learning/teaching and linguistics.\n\nWould anyone be able to provide some insight as to whether this would align well with my goals? Or even just if you think a Web Dev/Prog degree is a bad idea based on my life story? Should I go for the education degree instead like my original plan has been? Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Finishing the first year of college really sucks since you have to actually start deciding which path you want to go toward :')", "author": "KansaiKanpai", "created": 1606239689, "retrieved": 1632955642, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
