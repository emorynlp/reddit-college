I have been trying to find a interdisciplinary major that encompasses Computer Science/Software Engineering & Finance (preferably also a Political Science). So far the only options I have is to double major in Software Engineering, & Finance with a minor in Political Science, though I feel like I am setting myself for failure for this. I have looked into Financial Engineering (Computer Science + Finance) as well, however, that is only an option as a masters degree. I have also looked into the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics major to be paired with a Software Engineering major, but that doesn\u2019t specialize in Finance and I don\u2019t really know how good of a major PPE is. If you have any recommendations or ideas, please comment! I\u2019d greatly appreciate it.", "author": "Anonymous_2121", "created": 1591855082, "retrieved": 1632956201, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ftqriuc": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/h0t9th/college_major_help_needed/ftqriuc/", "text": "Computer Engineering, congratulations on your new major", "author": "Reav101", "created": 1591913520, "upvotes": 1}, "fto4i54": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/h0t9th/college_major_help_needed/fto4i54/", "text": "You want a job quickly?
