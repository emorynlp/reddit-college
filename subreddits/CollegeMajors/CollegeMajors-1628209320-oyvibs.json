  "text": "Currently in high school.\n\nI feel like I enjoy way too many things, and most of them are unrelated. I enjoy my science classes, but also enjoy history, international relations, philosophy, and politics. I love reading about diplomacy, solutions to modern world problems and conflicts(hence my involvement in Model UN), as well as the latest breakthroughs in science and technology. I love reading anything and everything really!\n\nI want something that can challenge me but is still employable. \n\nI think I also want a degree that will allow me to solve problems that matter. \n\nI have a love-hate relationship with math. I get pretty good grades at school, but I am really not too great at applying the knowledge(working on it though). I don't like computer science, and I get pretty bored of programming. \n\nThanks in advance, and let me know if you need any additional info :)",
