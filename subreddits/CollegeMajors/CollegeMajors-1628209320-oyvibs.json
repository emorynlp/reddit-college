I enjoy my science classes, but also enjoy history, international relations, philosophy, and politics. I love reading about diplomacy, solutions to modern world problems and conflicts(hence my involvement in Model UN), as well as the latest breakthroughs in science and technology. I love reading anything and everything really!\n\nI want something that can challenge me but is still employable. \n\nI think I also want a degree that will allow me to solve problems that matter. \n\nI have a love-hate relationship with math. I get pretty good grades at school, but I am really not too great at applying the knowledge(working on it though). I don't like computer science, and I get pretty bored of programming. \n\nThanks in advance, and let me know if you need any additional info :)", "author": "bigthink45", "created": 1628209320, "retrieved": 1632958024, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h8gzeah": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/oyvibs/help_me_find_a_major/h8gzeah/", "text": "I was going to suggest Public Policy or Law, but I'd speak with those in the field already to get their perspective.", "author": "Mathguy656", "created": 1628638032, "upvotes": 1}}}
