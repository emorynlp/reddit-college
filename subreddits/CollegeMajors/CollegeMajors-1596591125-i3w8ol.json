I really like bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, I've done some cybersecurity which is kind of interesting and I think I'm okay at coding in general. I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in.\n\nIn CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests.\n\nI have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major. If someone could help me decide if CS or CE seems like a better fit (maybe even recommend some schools :D) that would be so helpful.", "author": "ideklol347", "created": 1596591125, "retrieved": 1632847617, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g0f8oy7": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/i3w8ol/choosing_a_college_major_ce_or_cs/g0f8oy7/", "text": "from reading this, I think youd like computer engineering more. \n\ncomputer engineering doesn't necessarily mean your career will be on desktops or PC, it can mean any technological hardware. it'll focus on circuitry of various types and its very hardware focused. it'll be good if you want to enter robotics/ hands on building. its true that you need to know how xomputer systems work , but the knowledge is applicable to other devices such as robotics. \n\nif you dont enjoy learning programming languages and algorithms, you're not going to enjoy your courses at all. computer science courses mainly focuses on programming and programming projects. even for machine learning/ AI, most peoplee would need to go to grad school to specialize anyway\n\nI also recommend looking at safety tech schools as well since CS CE is much more competitive in Ivies compared to any other major. in the end, as long as you go to a decent school and build your profolio/personal projects and make connections, youre going to be on the same footing as everyone else", "author": "Siery", "created": 1596614243, "upvotes": 3}}}
