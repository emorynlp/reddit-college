Have no idea what to major in", "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm sorry if I don't really have a specific question to ask you or if this sounds more like a vent, but I recently found this subreddit and wanted to know if anyone has any tips or insights they could give me.\n\nI've been thinking about what to major in for 2 years now, and I still don't have a conclusion. I live in a place where the school system is a little different, and I basically focused in studying Arts in high school - that only made me realize I don't think I'm suited to work in the arts field. One of my problems is that I like a little bit of everything, from science to humanities, arts and social sciences, and I can't focus on just one thing. I tend to get super interested in something for a short period of time during which I'm not able to care about anything else, and then move on.\n\nEven though I don't think I could work in Arts, there are still some arts-related-majors I think are very interesting, specially focused on Drawing and Animation (as you can see, I also have a hard time discarding options). On the other hand, for the last two years I've been really into other unrelated things that I considered studying, like Psychology, Mathematics, Anthropology, Programming. I've done pros and cons lists, deeply researched every option, and I still can't get to a conclusion. I've tried thinking about jobs as well, but there isn't much I picture myself working on. I'm really bad with social skills and talking, and one of my biggest fears is not having a job or having one that doesn't allow me to move out and have an independent life. I'm also really scared of going for Maths, for example, and not being good enough at it to succeed. I am not particularly good at anything.\n\nI just want to move on with my life, and decide this so I can start working on my future, since this is making me really anxious... Once in a while I'll tell myself \"Okay, I made a decision! I'm studying \\[insert major here\\].\" and get really relaxed for a couple of days, but then I'll just come across the fact that whatever I decided is not the right decision, and find 1001 reasons why I should think about it a little more. I'm just afraid I'll end up deciding on something and then realizing it's not where I want to be, or that I can't do it.\n\nI'm sorry if this turned out to be too long or vague. I wish you all the best!
