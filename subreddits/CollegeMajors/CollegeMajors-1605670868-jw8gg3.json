A BA would focus on less rigorous math and science courses but would likely make you take a foreign language sequence. \nIn the science world, a BS degree is more respected.  However, if you really want a microbiology degree and think that foreign language classes would be easier to complete, the BA might be a better idea. \n\nApplying to medical school is less about what major you take, and more about GPA and that you complete all the necessary prerequisites.\n\nBest of luck!", "author": "muchagracias", "created": 1605705281, "upvotes": 2}}}
