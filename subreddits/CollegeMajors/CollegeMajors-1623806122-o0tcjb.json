      "text": "I would avoid both if employability is a priority; I majored in Poli Sci myself (and regret it despite success in a business career) and many of my peers never landed professional roles. It\u2019s always awkward seeing a classmate with the same B.A. in political science that I have (from a good state school) waiting tables more than a decade later.",

      "text": "With those two majors in particular it's definitely dependant on who you know or where you are working. I knew someone who got a bachelor's in poli sci and his first job out of college was in a local hospital warehouse. He told me how useless and stupid he felt for working hard on his grades just to be in a warehouse. His boss took note of his work ethic and connected him with the supervisor of IT at the hospital. He gets the job and a few years in he decides IT is doable but it's not his passion, he wanted to be a United Nations diplomat. He decided he wanted to get a masters in public administration and when his supervisor found out they were able to cover a good 50 to 70 percent of his entire tuition, plus they gave him a very good pay raise. All he needed to do was stay with the company for at least 3 years following his completed mater's. I don't know how useful this information is but I hoped it helped to see how majors sometimes connect to completely unrelated fields and still leave you with a good paying job that you would not have if you did not take that risk with higher education.",
