Help :(", "text": "I need to figure out what colleges I want to apply to very soon, and I have run into a big problem. I\u2019m asking for letters of recommendation at the moment, and I thought I had my intended major (biochemistry) figured out and knew which colleges I wanted to apply to. However, some recent stuff I\u2019ve run across made me rethink, and now I might want to consider biological and chemical engineering instead? I\u2019m trying to figure this out soon because I need to tell my recommenders where to send my letters, and if I do decide to go with engineering route, I\u2019d like to expand my college applications to include more engineering-focused colleges. \n\nIf someone could give me some insight on the difference in the kind of work that biochemists would do versus biological or chemical engineers, that would be helpful. I know the pay differences and the differences in curriculum and difficulty between the engineering fields and sciences, and I would be fine with either option as far as those two factors go, but I just can\u2019t get a good idea of how jobs differ between these disciplines, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to go into engineering and realize it\u2019s not at all what I though it would be.", "author": "plshelpimsolost", "created": 1599003778, "retrieved": 1632847567, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
