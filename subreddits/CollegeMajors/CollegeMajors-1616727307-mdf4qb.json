I'm currently an Astronomy major but have been told that won't really be a good choice...plus I got D+ in a Physics class twice.\n\nI thought about switching to Data Science but I'm not sure if its for me. I like the generalist aspect of it and the coding is fine, but I haven't really learned the statistics yet so its hard to say. Also, I'm really afraid I might make a mistake on the job.\n\nThe problem I'm having is I really don't know what I want to do. I don't really have a dream job so to speak.  \n\n\nOne thing I found out recently is I like to document things. Not sure if that makes sense.\n\nAnother issue I have is that I feel that our generation got the short end of the stick and now some of us will have to sacrifice our dream jobs in order to do good things in the world. This has me boggled down some more because it makes me feel I need to major in something that will save the world, even if doing so isn't on the top of my dream job list.\n\nAny advice?", "author": "ZitiRotini", "created": 1616727307, "retrieved": 1632846949, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"h1p6whr": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mdf4qb/im_struggling_to_choose_a_major/h1p6whr/", "text": "My apologies for arriving late to the party.
