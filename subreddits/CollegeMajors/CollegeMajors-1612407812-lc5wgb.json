I was on the philosophy path then got into political science while at school did the international MNUN, its not my passion but im good in that area.. philosophy is ig my passion really into theology... would even do ministry work. Before this though ive grinded hard af to finish my associates not because school was hard but life is and so committing for two more years, i really want to major in a field that will bring me a good income and promising work. I dont care if its not my passion i will not do it forever i use my work to invest into other sources of income etc. So with all of that, do you guys have any suggestions from experience of what to major in to make pretty good money with a four year degree .? \n\nThanks .", "author": "AirUpThare", "created": 1612407812, "retrieved": 1632847024, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"gm27cj5": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lc5wgb/23_wtwo_year_degree/gm27cj5/", "text": "Of course it's hard to give a definitive answer, but generally engineering (civil, electrical, computer, mechanical are safe choices), computer science, nursing, IT/information systems, accounting, and finance are decent choices.
