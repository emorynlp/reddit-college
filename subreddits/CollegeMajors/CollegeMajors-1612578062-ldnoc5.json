The ones I would like to teach and study is Christian, Islamic, and Judaic theology but I feel like it's better if I want to study the theology to just get into in English graduate school because religious studies programs incorporate not only the theology but also the politics and the history and theology is a very minor part.", "author": "JoylessDeer", "created": 1612578062, "retrieved": 1632847019, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
