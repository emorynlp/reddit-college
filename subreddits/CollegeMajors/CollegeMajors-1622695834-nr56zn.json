  "text": "\nHi guys! I want to do my master\u2019s in an interdisciplinary program that involves both biotech and management. Ik that UCI offers one such program. But it\u2019s good to have options right. Looks like there aren\u2019t many universities in the US which offer similar programs, so I\u2019m thinking of applying for MS biotechnology as well. However, I don\u2019t want to get into research after MS. Rather I want to work in business, marketing, management and related areas. Since I\u2019m an international applicant, it is important that it is a STEM course too. \nGot any advice for me? Thanks in advance",
