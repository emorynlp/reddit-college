  "text": "I\u2019ve been floating around in the community college system for about 4 years now and I have finished my general classes but I still can\u2019t decide what I want to do. I love film, being a director was one of the first things I wanted to do, but later lost interest in it. Digital media was also something I wanted to get into as well but wasn\u2019t so sure about it. Recently I\u2019ve been wanting to work for social media, but I don\u2019t know where to begin. I would appreciate the help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
