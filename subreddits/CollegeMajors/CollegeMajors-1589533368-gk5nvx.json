I\u2019m attending college in the fall and have narrowed down my potential majors to either bio or comp schools. I\u2019m interested in both but am unsure which to choose. I feel like I\u2019m more interested in pursuing a major in the healthcare field but the debt I would have to take to go to med school is a huge turn off for me. Idk what to choose. Any help would be appreciated.
