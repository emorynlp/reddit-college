I really want to become a lawyer, but I\u2019m also interested in working in a gov department, becoming some kind of detective/agent, forensic psychologist, or something around those lines. \n\nI just have no idea what to Major in. I love debating, politics and history as well. I was considering majoring in history, but I\u2019m not sure if there would be a better choice. I\u2019m so stuck that I\u2019m even considering double majoring. Any suggestions? I\u2019m not really into STEM degrees. The only kind of STEM I like is science, but only certain kinds.\n\nIs there any good degrees for law/crime except for CJ? I was considering political science, but I don\u2019t know how well that would work", "author": "OkFondant0", "created": 1604070551, "retrieved": 1632955683, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"galxdpm": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jkyicn/want_to_be_in_the_crimelawgov_field/galxdpm/", "text": "-----STEM options with minors-----\n\nMajor:\nComputer Science/Cyber Security\n\nApplied Mathematics\n\nData Science\n\nMinor:\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nPublic Policy\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPublic/Business Administration (Public preferred) \n\nHistory\n\nPhilosophy (Great Combo with Computer Science or Mathematics)\n\n\n-----Non-STEM options-----\n\nPublic Administration (Best Option IMO)\n\nPublic Policy\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPhilosophy (Perhaps Double Major with a STEM)\n\nPsychology (Route Specific, Might Require Masters)\n\nCriminal Justice (Masters Most Likely Required)\n\n------Masters (In Case Competition is Tense or Masters Required)-----\n\nPublic Administration\n\nCyber Security\n\nPublic Policy\n\nCriminal Justice (Choose Concentration)\n\nData Science\n\nForensic/Psychology", "author": "DetectiveTacoX", "created": 1604072097, "upvotes": 2}}}
