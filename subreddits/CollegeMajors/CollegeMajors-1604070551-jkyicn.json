  "title:": "Want to Be In The Crime/Law/Gov Field?",
  "text": "I already know I want to be in the law, politics, crime, and government field. . I really want to become a lawyer, but I\u2019m also interested in working in a gov department, becoming some kind of detective/agent, forensic psychologist, or something around those lines. \n\nI just have no idea what to Major in. I love debating, politics and history as well. I was considering majoring in history, but I\u2019m not sure if there would be a better choice. I\u2019m so stuck that I\u2019m even considering double majoring. Any suggestions? I\u2019m not really into STEM degrees. The only kind of STEM I like is science, but only certain kinds.\n\nIs there any good degrees for law/crime except for CJ? I was considering political science, but I don\u2019t know how well that would work",

I also did say I was considering doing a double major. \n\nI am definitely not doing a STEM degree, unless it\u2019s something like biology or forensics.",

The Law Degree complements. \n\nIf you were not going to Law School, then Choose a different major and then do a Masters in Public Administration/Management.\n\nPS: A select few law schools will allow you to get both the Masters in PA and Law Degree.\n\nFinal Remarks:\n\nWhen it comes to Government positions, \n\nSTEM, Public Adminstration, and Public Policy Degrees are highly regarded. \n\nI forgot to mention Public Policy as an option for a government position, apologies.",
