I love politics, law, crime, and history. Basically anything in that field. I like making a change, and leaving an impact. Fighting for justice and what\u2019s right. But unfortunately, the degrees I\u2019m interested in aren\u2019t in demand, and don\u2019t have good employment rates. \n\nI don\u2019t want to waste my time going to college, and majoring in something I don\u2019t enjoy, but at the same time my interests aren\u2019t really going to get me anywhere. I plan on being a lawyer in the future. I want a degree that can get me a steady job if law doesn\u2019t work out. I want a degree that could have me making $70,000 or more. I\u2019m a high-achiever, and very ambitious. I love gaining knowledge.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m atrocious at STEM, except for science. I was thinking maybe a business degree, but I don\u2019t know if they have good job turnouts either. I was thinking about economics, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be good with that math. I\u2019m good at basic math/algebra.", "author": "OkFondant0", "created": 1590783315, "retrieved": 1632956843, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"fw3dnwz": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/gt0ec1/need_help_deciding_my_major/fw3dnwz/", "text": "I have all the same interests as you!
