  "title:": "Need Help Deciding My Major?",
  "text": "\nSo, I\u2019m struggling with trying to decide what to major in. I love politics, law, crime, and history. Basically anything in that field. I like making a change, and leaving an impact. Fighting for justice and what\u2019s right. But unfortunately, the degrees I\u2019m interested in aren\u2019t in demand, and don\u2019t have good employment rates. \n\nI don\u2019t want to waste my time going to college, and majoring in something I don\u2019t enjoy, but at the same time my interests aren\u2019t really going to get me anywhere. I plan on being a lawyer in the future. I want a degree that can get me a steady job if law doesn\u2019t work out. I want a degree that could have me making $70,000 or more. I\u2019m a high-achiever, and very ambitious. I love gaining knowledge.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m atrocious at STEM, except for science. I was thinking maybe a business degree, but I don\u2019t know if they have good job turnouts either. I was thinking about economics, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be good with that math. I\u2019m good at basic math/algebra.",

Cause if you get a job in NY, for example, you\u2019d make a higher amount of a salary than somewhere like Texas. But it also depends on your capabilities, ofc. And being a forensic psychologist requires a lot of schooling, but like you, I\u2019m very dedicated and I have the potential to spend more years to study to get my masters/PHD. :-)\n\nHowever, lol, I am taking a sociology and a psychology class online over the summer to get a better understanding if that\u2019s a career I want to go into. I\u2019ve always been interested in crime and why people commit crime, but I\u2019ve always kept it at the back of my mind because my parents want me to go into the STEM field, which is not what I wanna do. I love mathematics, so I am currently pursuing a BS in math, but I greatly dislike biology, chemistry, etc. I wanted to go into CS previously (as a minor), but after taking a CS course in the spring semester, I quickly realized that that wasn\u2019t for me, much to my parents disappointment. :D as of right now, I\u2019m thinking about pursuing a dual degree (a BSA in math with a BA in psychology and a minor in sociology that is more directed towards criminology courses).",

I would major in criminal justice or history, anything like that, but those aren\u2019t looking too good job wise. I\u2019m trying to find something that I might like that\u2019s reliable, but I can\u2019t find a single thing. I was thinking about economics, but I\u2019m not sure. This is a huge stressor for me.

                      "text": "I\u2019m not sure about double majors, to be honest.. the thing is, I\u2019ve taken a lot of AP classes in hs and got the credit for them, so it won\u2019t be a lot of work for me to graduate in 4 years. Like, the max credits I would take per semester would be 15/16 hours, and the min is 12/13 hours. Plus, I\u2019m taking a lot of summer classes rn (12 credits in total), so it really helps out with the course load!! and honestly, I think it depends on your uni about the cost/course load. for my university, psychology requires a minor and a BSA in mathematics requires a minor, so if I combined them together and take sociology as a minor, it\u2019s like hitting two birds with one stone. And yes, lmao, can\u2019t stand STEM, except for math. :D\n\nAnd yes - that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. Everyone says psychology is a much easier major to get, and it\u2019s the number one popular major at my university sadly... I don\u2019t mind getting a PHD, because I like school and studying and learning new things! If I knew I didn\u2019t want to get a PHD, I definitely wouldn\u2019t pursue a Psy major as it isn\u2019t useful without a PHD. But I feel you. I\u2019m trying to find something that is reliable as well! Fortunately, forensic psychologists is a new field and it has a high growth rate (and more job opportunities) within the next ten years! So, there\u2019s a pro with that. ;-)\n\nI\u2019d definitely go for a criminal justice major if I could, but like you said, those aren\u2019t looking too good job wise and my uni doesn\u2019t offer it. The only CJ courses they offer is through the sociology classes!",
