Do you guys know where I should look? (X-post from r/EngineeringStudents)", "text": "So I just can't do a full-on engineering degree I would not be able to handle the stress and work all at once. The stuff I am interested in (Biology, English, etc.) are not lucrative or are oversaturated, so I thought a BA would be a good middle ground. It's not easier, but it will give me more room to take more buffer classes. Problem is, I'm struggling to find out which schools offer BA in Materials Science and Engineering (I want to work in biomaterials). I know Rice and Northwestern do, but are there no others?\n\nWhat other schools offer a BA in this area? Is there any website you would suggest as a good place to look for this type of info? If not what other degrees would you advise I pursue? I'm sorry if I seem like a loser for not being willing to do a full-on BS, but I have a good idea of how that will go and just can't see it going well. I'd really appreciate your help.", "author": "Regular_Enthusiasm57", "created": 1601318068, "retrieved": 1632955741, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
