I\u2019m new here and I really just wanted to see if anyone had any advice that could help me out in making this decision. I am currently in my third year in college and so far I have been switching back and forth from economics to finance and accounting, but not really for any particular reason. I just really thought about it and realized I am definitely not studying something I am interested in. So if anybody could please help me with any majors that you think would suit me? I am great at all math and love chemistry as well as have a great interest in psychology and neuroscience. Thank you in advance! :)", "author": "confusednhungry13", "created": 1604312424, "retrieved": 1632956832, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gayht8l": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jml0s3/college_junior_thinking_about_switching_majors/gayht8l/", "text": "Seeing that you're interested in psych + neuro and is good at math, maybe a cognitive science major? (if your school offers it) However, I think it's best to take some time and figure out what you want to do as a career. Think ahead: will you be happy with the careers a major will lead you to in 10 or 20 years? Additionally, there are plenty of resources out there to help you decide on your major, for instance, like others have said, your school may offer advising. Or you can take personality tests and career quizzes to see what kind of major fits you. No one but yourself knows what you want to major in, so like I said, think about what you want to do. Good luck!", "author": "SnooOpinions7975", "created": 1604365734, "upvotes": 1}, "gay2zhm": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/jml0s3/college_junior_thinking_about_switching_majors/gay2zhm/", "text": "I was in a similar situation. I was a Business Management major and I switched to Computer Science, then switched back to Business Management then finally switched back to Computer Science. For me personally I knew Business was very boring, easy, but the job I may get might not be rewarding. Computer Science was interesting, hard, and I knew it was gonna be rewarding.  I think Comp Sci is good for you because they have a wide range of jobs and different fields. Without really looking up the name there's probably a field that mixes chemistry + comp sci. You take a lot of math courses as a comp sci major too so if you're good at it that's a plus. There's even topics of neuroscience in Computer Science like AI, machine learning and a few others you can look up.

Third year is difficult time to switch, but if you're careful you could probably def build up with it. Business is also an option that has to do with econ, finance, and accounting. If you really wanna go into neuro, that would tie in with the biochemistry and compchem interestingly.\n\n/ The reason I recommend CS so much is that you can go pretty far through Data Science topics as well, \\[intersection between CS, business, econ, finance, stats, etc\\] to tie with your other interests and make a pretty interesting degree. It's basically applied math, but it doesn't really feel like math.\n\nI have a problem with how much time I spend staring at my undergrad schedule and at different courses, minors, and majors \\[even now that I think I've figured it out, haha\\].
