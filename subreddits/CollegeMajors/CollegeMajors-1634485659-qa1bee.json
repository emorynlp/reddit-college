  "title:": "Major vs Minor?!",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am a prospective liberal arts college student and had a few questions. First of all, I was told by my peers and teachers that my intended major, CS, is usually the most competitive for most colleges and would require CS-centered extracurriculars and over-the-top grades. However, people on Reddit have been telling me that that is not the case for liberal arts colleges, where you don't have to declare a major, so I don't know if I can get into a CS program without having any CS extracurriculars.\n\nThe second question is, I'm planning on taking either a double major in math and CS or CS major with a math minor. I don't really know what the difference would be realistically (I have done my online research).\n\n(Sorry this is long) But also, what do you guys think is better for employment opportunities after graduation, math or statistics?",

See if you can get any info on what percent of CS applicants are rejected, average GPA for admitted students, etc. \n\nCompetition levels depend on the individual college. Typically the more well-known/highly regarded/close to a major tech jobs center the program is, the more competitive it will be. Liberal arts schools usually aren\u2019t known for their CS programs, but it depends on the school.\n\n2. I\u2019m told that whether you double major or minor in math/stats won\u2019t make much difference for most CS jobs, but it depends on what you want to do with your degree. For a typical software engineering career, it probably won\u2019t matter which of those you choose.",

Judging from the various people who have already graduated from liberal arts colleges with statistics and math degrees, especially owing to their international nationality, big companies are rejecting them simply because of their passports. Most go back to their country of origin or go on to pursue a master's degree, which in that case, they will be able to easily get employment.
