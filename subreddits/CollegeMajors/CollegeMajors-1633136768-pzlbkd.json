  "text": "Hi, this is my first time posting here. I'm a canadian senior in highschool with only a few months left to decide which major to choose.\n\nI think I'm pretty interested in health sciences, especially occupational therapy/physical therapy so I may take physiology. I'd also absolutely love to be an English teacher, but teachers are a bit oversaturated here in Ontario from what I've heard and it takes several, several years to find a good stable job. I'm also willing to open up to dental hygeine, especially since it takes not too long and the salary is great, plus I think dental care is both scary yet interesting, but I've only recently considered it and the whole idea of it is frightening to me. There's also the path of taking information science masters after any undergrad to become a librarian, the only issue is that I think my undergrad should be strong enough on its own to support me rather than be a stepping stone for info science. \n\nMy question is, is anyone in these career paths or has wanted to pursue what I'm currently considering have any serious trouble in their journey? Is there anything I should avoid, seriously assess myself about, or reconsider? Is there anything I should know about what I'm considering? I'm a very indecisive person, so I feel like I need to know the cons and pros of every possible thing to make a final decision.",
