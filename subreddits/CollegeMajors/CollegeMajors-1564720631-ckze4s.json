I am all over the place I have thought about business, finance, nursing, biology, communications, social work and many more. I originally wanted to do nursing but worked as a CNA and did not like the nursing environment for the most part. I have thought about pursuing med school, pa school, but feel that these will have similar work environments. I have always loved writing and have recently thought about journalism and would love to work for a news company like the new york times but many people say it is very competitive and a dying industry. I have thought about business but it seems so broad and my college doesn't have a very good business school. I can't really see myself working a corporate job going to business meetings every day. I have also thought about clinical laboratory science which seems like it might offer me a healthcare-related job without the patient care that I did not like a CNA and the saved time from extra years of school that an MD would require. I do like working with people but the patient care tasks were not for me. If journalism was a booming industry I would pick that, but I want to have a stable job. If anybody has advice about a communications degree and/or job market please let me know as well as any information working in a medical lab or corporate job or any advice at all.", "author": "paulmick2", "created": 1564720631, "retrieved": 1632957982, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"evscoa8": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/ckze4s/i_am_so_undecided/evscoa8/", "text": "If it makes you feel any better, I am also a freshman who has no idea what to do.
