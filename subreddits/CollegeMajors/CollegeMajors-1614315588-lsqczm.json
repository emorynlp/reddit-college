The reason is that I think a lot of schools will have finance in the business school, whereas computer science will be in the engineering and/or liberal arts school, and IDK how easy it is to double major in subjects from 2 separate schools. A lot of Econ majors go into finance anyway, and finance jobs are much more about who you know and how prestigious your school is than your exact major. So I think CS+econ would be the easiest, plus Econ is often math heavy so some of the math classes you take for the CS degree (calculus, probability, and linear algebra) will probably also satisfy requirements for your Econ degree. I think that combination would give you a ton of options in terms of career paths.", "author": "BetUrProcrastinating", "created": 1614475174, "upvotes": 1}, "gou3fhq": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lsqczm/comp_sci_or_finance_or_double_major/gou3fhq/", "text": "Obviously Math and Com sci", "author": "biggerarmsthanyou", "created": 1614352082, "upvotes": 1}, "gosyaqo": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/lsqczm/comp_sci_or_finance_or_double_major/gosyaqo/", "text": "CS/Econ double major, or CS major + econ minor.", "author": "user4684784124", "created": 1614321639, "upvotes": 6}}}
