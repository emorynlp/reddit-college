Can't decide between minor in Museum Studies or Urban Studies", "text": "I'm currently in community college and am on track to transfer to a 4-year university near me where I plan to get a bachelor's in Historic Preservation. I'm deathly afraid of making the wrong choice when it comes to education and career and I'm torn between two options for potential minors. The first minor I'm looking at is Museum Studies and then hopefully a career working in a museum managing collections. The other option is Urban Studies which would lend itself to building preservation/conservation and urban planning.\n\nAll the career options related to this major really appeal to me but I'm torn on which to work towards. I'm just not sure which is the best fit for me. I'm aware that simply having a degree in Historic Preservation probably grants a lot of flexibility within the field but I'd like to specialize in something.", "author": "C_Splash", "created": 1629897664, "retrieved": 1632846499, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"habgrcf": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/pbb34v/historic_preservation_major_cant_decide_between/habgrcf/", "text": "I would consider Urban Studies.\n\nAn understanding of land-use planning, and the various tools that governments use to manage growth will provide insight into the development process. \n\nHistoric preservation / heritage designations are often decided at the government level with planners, the general public and politicians.
