For example, my university has a microbiology and medical lab major which is just all microbiology courses and all the courses usually listed to receive CLS certification is under the medical lab part with the major.  \n\nYou will also take enough chemistry courses with a microbiology major anyway. But I\u2019m not sure how it is for the school you are trying to attend. Let me know if you have more questions. :)", "author": "twin0912", "created": 1595356238, "upvotes": 1}}}
