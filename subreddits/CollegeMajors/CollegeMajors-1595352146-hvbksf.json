  "text": "Hi! \n\nI apologize to begin with if any formatting or anything like that is strange,I have never posted anything to Reddit yet ,So please be patient with me.\n\nSo, I am attempting to go back to college to get a degree where I would be able to work in a laboratory studying disease and looking for cures.\n\nTo start,is this possible to do with a bachelors degree or do I need to aim higher?\n\nI have been working towards \"Medical Laboratory Science\" as my major thus far but am wondering if a Chemistry major would be better suited for what I'm going for?\n\nPlease let me if you have any suggestions or input for what I should consider. Thank you for reading!",

      "text": "I think microbiology major would be best. For example, my university has a microbiology and medical lab major which is just all microbiology courses and all the courses usually listed to receive CLS certification is under the medical lab part with the major.  \n\nYou will also take enough chemistry courses with a microbiology major anyway. But I\u2019m not sure how it is for the school you are trying to attend. Let me know if you have more questions. :)",
