I originally wanted to double major in Archaeology and Classics,  but my family doesn't have enough money for a double major. Also, you have to go to graduate school and get a P.H.D. to become an archaeologist. I also researched it and the job market is very bad. Now I am kinda discouraged because we do not have enough to double major and I'm second guessing what I'm doing. Should I do it, or should I try another major? Here are some majors that I would be fine doing.\n\nArchaeology\n\nClassics\n\nEconomics\n\nPhilosophy\n\nGlobal economics\n\nBioengineering\n\n(By the way, my interests are kinda history and thinking, like philosophy and classics. I also like economics because I read a book on it and I found it interesting, and Bioengineering because genetic engineering sounds fun. I'm fine with a moderate amount of writing.)\n\nThanks for the help", "author": "croc133", "created": 1606847043, "retrieved": 1632955633, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gezbc1e": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k4qoui/i_need_help/gezbc1e/", "text": "Hm. Is archaeology like a concentration within anthropology, or is it its own major? Anthro itself is extremely versatile, and most intro classes will expose you in some way or another to the 4 disciplines of anthropology (sociocultural, linguistic, biological, archaeological) that you may want to explore. It's nice because you can take a leaning whichever way you please with anthro (like if you want to focus on classics, for example, there are often classical archaeology projects offered through anthro departments - I'd be on the lookout for those if your uni offers anything like that). Just my two cents, though.", "author": "phantomramen1", "created": 1607372655, "upvotes": 1}, "gefaxni": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k4qoui/i_need_help/gefaxni/", "text": "If money is too tight for a double major, I will assume that advanced degrees are also out of the question at this time.  What you need is a degree that will pay off with a decent job at the bachelors level.  Be careful not to confuse what interests you with what you might want to do for a living.  They are not exactly the same thing.  Many of your interests you can pursue at 1/100th the cost by reading about them.  College is meant to train your thinking and credential you for particular types of work.  Economics or preferably business administration is a good generalist major if you are interested in economic activity.  There are quite a few majors within the degree to suit different people.  Bioengineering will be a very science oriented major, and most engineers are in demand with an undergraduate degree.  I don\u2019t know how much genetic engineering you would be doing.  Engineers are not really researchers, they apply the science to solve more immediate problems.  If you like fixing problems, perhaps engineering would be a good fit.  Classics and philosophy are risky.  To a business, it is not really clear what skills they are hiring.  I think they can train you to think and construct arguments, but they tend to lack those skills that can be immediately put to work that are found in the professional programs.\n\nThe bioengineering and business/economics are like apples and oranges.  They are very different types of programs suited to different types of people.  Try to research the types of courses and what they teach for each major before you decide.  You may find that one is a really good fit and the other would be horrible for you.  If so your decision Is pretty easy.  Good luck!", "author": "dmstew", "created": 1606948954, "upvotes": 2}, "gea9drx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/k4qoui/i_need_help/gea9drx/", "text": "Honestly the job market even for biology is pretty grey. And my major is biology with an emphasis on biotechnology/medical technology.\n\nWhat helped me determine my major was how much more time and thought I gave a particular subject rather than another. It kinda plays a role into whether or not you would be motivated to get your work done or not.\n\nI would focus on that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I was a philosophy major when I got into college but after researching, philosophy is that kind of major that really just prepares you for law school primarily. Yes, you can do other things with it such as be a teacher or office work, etc. Philosophy is a very broad subject and part of the major requires history of greek philosophy, symbolic logic, ethics, intro to philosophy as well as critical thinking and writing courses.\n\nSo I changed my major.\n\nUnless you genuinely are ready to learn about how to think, analyze and seperate fallacies from the truth as well as learn to analyze really REALLY good, then go for it because that is what it focuses on\n\nMajors involving business and economics are fair game and can land you in many places such as administration work, running a business, and so on.\n\nAs far as bioengineering goes, biology and chemistry courses are really by nature very dense but at the same thing really fascinating. You need to pay attention to the little details and the big picture at the same time. I know biology requires calculus and anything with engineering requires math above such as calc 2 and 3 or even beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more if you need more clarification or want to ask more specific questions", "author": "PopCandy420", "created": 1606848181, "upvotes": 1}}}
