I'm new on reddit and hope I'm doing this right hehe.\n\nI am very concerned about my current major and I'm thinking about changing it. However, that decision is very difficult and stressful for me, as well as the conversation I'll be having with my parents about it. So before reaching any conclusion, I would appreciate if I can get some advice.\n\nI'm currently in the second semester of bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, and I feel like that I've lost all interest in it. The reason I chose this major was because:\n\n1. I have always been good and interested in math and physics. In high school, those were my best subjects. Apart from that, I've never been really interested in the Engineering work itself, e.g. the innovation or \"helping the society advance\" part- instead, I've only ever been interested in the mathematical analysis part of it. I thought given my interest in math and physics, this career would be an ideal one for me.\n2. Because I'm not very good at public speaking- I hardly ever spoke up in my high school, and hence I ruled out the major that I had always loved, Law, because that would require me to be able to be reasonably better at public speaking than an Engineering major would.\n\nHowever, recently, I've lost all interest in it. I started to realize that a bit in my first semester, a bit subconsciously at first, but I ignored it completely. I honestly think that an Engineering major is not what I had imagined and I can't bring myself to be as motivated as I had been in High School. It seems immature of me, because I knew and chose what I was getting into, but still, I am completely hating it. To a point where I can't use my skills in math and physics properly at all, and although I passed all of my subjects in the first semester, my grades weren't good. I feel no motivation to even hand in my assignments or read up on the material.\n\nIf I switch, my most obvious major would be Law, which I always had a passion for. Either by choosing another major that would go well with Law School if I study in US, or by starting Law School as an undergrad in Europe. The reason I never considered this was because of my bad public speaking skills. My parents, too, thought that I am very suitable for Engineering given my skills in Science.\n\nMy question to Law students (or people aiming to get into Law School), is how much of public speaking is required in that field? Would it be reasonable of me to change my major from Engineering (which I do have talent for) because of lack of interest and motivation, to Law (where I might have to work very hard on the public speaking part)?\n\nI don't think my parents would be happy with that choice and I might disappoint them greatly. That's why it's really stressing me out, to a point where it's affecting my physical and mental health.\n\nI know people don't know me here personally and can't give a precise answer, but some general advice is really appreciated. In the end, I'd be the one taking the decision, but I do want to be be as sure as I can this time to not waste more time (money is not an issue since I'm currently studying in Europe where there is no fees).\n\nThanks in advance :)", "author": "jaegercult", "created": 1618015659, "retrieved": 1632846733, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gwilobx": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mnumcg/changing_major_from_engineering_to_law/gwilobx/", "text": "For the states, the largest factor for entry is the LSAT, so taking a major that promotes the skills necessary to do well is probably important. Considering you're thinking about doing law in Europe as well, doing Law as a major is probably a good shout.\n\nHowever, I'm going to recommend the major that I went into university with (Dropped Law due to mental health over the lockdown) and that is Law and Math. Math will give you those logic and problem-solving skills that law schools seem to love (Go watch legally blonde to see the kind of questions that can apply well here) , and you can apply your previous skills in Math well here.", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1619851212, "upvotes": 1}, "gu021fd": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mnumcg/changing_major_from_engineering_to_law/gu021fd/", "text": "As someone who is also trying to decide what to major in, from what I\u2019ve gathered, law has a wide net. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in Europe, but in the States, there is different types of law that I assume would require different levels of public speaking skills. I also have poor public speaking skills, so I have a gravitation towards transactional law (contract drafting, real estate acquisition, intellectual property affairs, all that stuff). Someone can correct me if I\u2019m wrong but public law would in general require more public speaking skills than the private sector.\nAll in all, I would say law is a broad category and you have many options to choose from. Studying law doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have to defend a case in a trial.   I would say educate yourself on the different types of law and find a major that would complement the area of law you\u2019re interested in. Good luck! I feel you on the struggle of these decisions.", "author": "Keylin_J", "created": 1618020340, "upvotes": 1}}}
