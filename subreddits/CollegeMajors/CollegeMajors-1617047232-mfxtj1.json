I've always been interested in history and politics. I've known what I wanted to do since I was 5 years old. Since middle school, I always thought I would major in political science, get an internship with a Member of Congress and work my way up the ladder. Little did I know that those internships are **highly** coveted, saved for the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Not to undercut my academic ability, but I'm not gonna be a Harvard grad.\n\nOnce I figured this out (a few months ago), I started thinking about maybe going to law school. If you look at the U.S. Senate, most of the members there are lawyers but many of those people never actually practiced law! Law school is highly expensive, however. I'm not sure if my family's affluent enough to afford law school. Everything seems so risky and no matter what I choose, it's not a done deal that I can get into politics.\n\nI've done volunteer work. I've done campaign work, I'm currently working with a group of Gen Z Americans trying to get more young people involved in the political process. I'm confident I could get into most colleges that I apply to. I'm considering some state colleges (I'm from South Carolina) like the University of South Carolina or the College of Charleston, and some out-of-state schools in Washington, D.C. like American University or George Washington University.\n\nSo, my question is what major would be my best bet to land a job for a Member of Congress, someone in the state legislature, or just getting into politics in general. Should I get a law degree? Major in political science? Or something else entirely? Any help I can get from you all is appreciated and I thank you for your time!", "author": "aarons51125", "created": 1617047232, "retrieved": 1632846945, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gsq3xuv": {"link": "/r/CollegeMajors/comments/mfxtj1/unsure_about_what_major_i_should_go_with_to_get/gsq3xuv/", "text": "In the end all I have to say is it really doesn't matter. We have engineers, doctors, and lawyers in Congress. Some don't even have a college degree. I also think the internship thing isn't necessarily a huge deal per se, probably the only reason why it would be competitive for you specifically is because you are in high school. I honestly think it's something within range of possibility once you enter college. You could also broaden your search to local politicians as well. I understand that a lot of people with political science or communications degrees can end up working on political campaigns if that is something up your alley.", "author": "Acrocane", "created": 1617048546, "upvotes": 1}}}
