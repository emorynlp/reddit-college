Need Reputable Sources...", "text": "Hello! I need to write an essay on a topic with two articles as my sources cited. One article is to be *for* my topic of choice, the other *against* the topic. I'm having a hard time finding reputable articles that fit my potential topics. Our instructor told us to use [theconversation.com](https://theconversation.com/), but I'm not finding much on there I can use.\n\nTopics in question:\n\nlegalization of prostitution\n\nComprehensive sex education vs abstinence-only education in schools\n\nsleep deprivation is romanticized in pursuit of the american dream: how our drive for individual success is slowly killing us.\n\nIf you have better topic suggestions or reputable sites I can use to find articles, that would be super helpful!\n\nEDIT: PLEASE DO NOT OFFER TO WRITE MY PAPER FOR A FEE. THAT'S UNETHICAL AND NOT WHY I'M HERE.", "author": "maddsjanep", "created": 1632938586, "retrieved": 1632945355, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
