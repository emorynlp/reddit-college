I failed my entire winter semester and had to file an appeal to get my financial aid back. I won my appeal and I have received my financial aid package, but there are no classes open anymore for registration.

Will it not matter if I take full-time classes for the next semester?", "author": "Mayassmai", "created": 1632191175, "retrieved": 1632946713, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
