  "text": "Hello everyone. I am an international student. To apply to American college I need to write an essay, The topic is the title of this question.\n\nI need a piece of advice. Should I write that I want to return or it'll be better if I write that I want to stay in the US. Which one will give me better chances to get accepted to college? What usually works best with the American colleges?",

      "text": "Not return is absolutely the wise answer. However if you're not applying for any scholarships to sponsor you during college or to high rank universities, the entrance essay is not really a big deal. Schools charge international students much higher than resident students and that's why they want you choose them instead of other schools.",
