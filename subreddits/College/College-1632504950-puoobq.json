I\u2019m in a frat and we have exchanges with sororities weekly. At these exchanges, I talk to a few girls but am always unsure on how to flirt with them and eventually make a move. Like I\u2019m fine talking to girls as friends, but how do I do something more than that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m definitely more attractive than some of the other kids in my frat who\u2019ve been getting a lot more action than me. How do I approach talking flirting and eventually making a move on girls?", "author": "Busy-Pineapple9453", "created": 1632504950, "retrieved": 1632946068, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "comments": {"he897kt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puoobq/how_should_i_flirt_with_girls/he897kt/", "text": "Its pretty simple to measure if a girl is willing to get more physical, while your talking to her, touch her shoulder while leaning and talking into her ear if there is a lot of music, if she seems into it, and doesn't pull away, then after a while ask her if she wants to dance, and then go from there, and try to push it, but if she shows any resistance, back off, you don't want to be known as the creep. Its all about reading body language.\n\nIts a numbers game in the end, there are some girls at parties that want to go home with a guy, you just need to find that girl and show her that you are interested in getting physical.", "author": "2001MThrowaway", "created": 1632582440, "upvotes": 1}, "he48mxw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puoobq/how_should_i_flirt_with_girls/he48mxw/", "text": "First of all, stop thinking of yourself as a \"kid.\". Just thinking that way can lead to you being very unattractive. But honestly, just keep it simple, sounds like you have no problem talking to these girls your interested in, sounds like you just need to get them away for that first date(Definitely don't call it a date tho). I'd always ask if they wanted to grab a coffee together at some point, that alone makes your intentions very clear and isn't too intrusive. \n\nHit her with a text a few days later to set up a time, if she's interested she won't make any excuses, if she makes excuses, well, on to the next girl.", "author": "TediousChipmunk", "created": 1632505785, "upvotes": 6}}}
