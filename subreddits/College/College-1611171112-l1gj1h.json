I also think it\u2019s helping me get into the swing of school again (first semester since dropping out at 18) so it\u2019s actually helping with my anxiety just starting in the comfort of my own home. \n\nI know this semester is going to be tough y\u2019all but try to pick out the positives no matter how big or small \ud83d\udc9b good luck fellow students!",

Online is the worst.\n\nLast semester 3 of my 4 classes were in-person, but 1 class split us into 2 groups and we could watch the lecture on Zoom. A geology lab was one week in-person and the next online and so on, and we could watch the in-person lab on Zoom. I ended up being lazy and just watching everything online. My other in-person class was once a week for 3 hours with no Zoom but I always went to that class and I enjoyed that. So really, I only went to campus once or twice per week and it sucked. I pretty much woke up at 1:00 PM every single day. \n\nThis semester 3 out of 4 of my classes are in-person again but this time I'll be going to campus 5 days a week for sure. Hopefully, it stays that way.",

These Zoom classes are more of a hybrid than an actual online class. I wouldn't be able to balance my work with these Zoom classes like I could with actual online classes",

WTF am I paying for? I could have just checked out books from the library and skipped out on this loan debt. This semester, at least 2 of my professors took the initiative to post lectures. Of the 5 classes I'm taking only 1 has a zoom meeting where we can actually interact with a professor and ask questions. And the real kick in the ass is that I'm not even returning to the work force. I'm getting a degree for personal satisfaction and I'm not getting anything out of any of these classes. There is no way this would have prepared me for this field.",

I know so many people who are dropping or have dropped out this year because the first semester was just awful. And honestly I\u2019m not having a good time either, it\u2019s a struggle to sit in one spot and look at my screen for hours on end and my grades are reflecting that. So I just pray things get back to normal and I can have a regular 3 years of college. And can actually enjoy going to school.",

Keep in mind that you need at least a quad core processor for it to work (this usually isn't a problem since almost all newer computers are equipped with quad core+ but YMMV with older ones). IF you have a computer that isn't quad core, you can use a green screen (or pieces of green paper) for the background. There is a checkbox option on the bottom of the video setting dialog.\n\nMost professors shouldn't really complain about having a virtual background since they have no reason to see your environment (save test days for \"academic integrity\" or something like that if they really wanna be arseholes about it).\n\nHope this helps!",
