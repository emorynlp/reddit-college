  "text": "Hello, I am currently a junior in high school. I plan on majoring in International Business (or whatever the equivalent of that is in which college I get accepted to)\u2014 a major that shows a lot of potential for growth and financial security.\n\nHowever, I understand that most jobs require a certain amount of experience that I doubt I\u2019d have without getting a head start in my career now. So what tips can you offer me about getting a jumpstart?",

      "text": "Make contacts - find businesses you\u2019re interested in, learn more about them, see if they have internships, etc. My parents worked for the same company since I was in 6th grade. I was interested in design and my Dad mentioned they had an in-house design team and got me in contact with them my junior year of high school so I could do a one day job shadow for an assignment. The next summer I interned right out of high school. Went to school for a year, came home for the summer and emailed my old boss asking if he needed anyone. He put me in touch with a department that needed a dedicated designer for their training materials, and I ended up working part time for them (while finishing my degree) for the next six years, then transferred to full time for another department for six and a half more years.",
