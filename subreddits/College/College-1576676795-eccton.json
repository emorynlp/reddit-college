However, ArrayList double their sizes once they are  completely filled leaving a high scope of having unfilled spots or in other words \"wasted memory\", which in case of Trees is not a issue because insertion just involves creating a new Node and connecting previous nodes to it. Speaking of time complexity, insertion with ArrayLists typically involve shifting succeeding elements, which in itself has a Big-Oh of `O(n)` in the worst case.

(The pastor was allowing them to do this, but the board of the church was against it, so they took it over as a demonstration). They occupied a hospital and gave people medical treatment.

The basics is that if an animal is getting too much protein, it results in nitrogen build up in their intestines, and nitrogen being released into their environment through their waste. The animal will excrete said protein and nutrients into the environment in a cycle that goes like this: \n\nExcess nutrients leave the body via defecation or urine ---> enters or transforms in the environment as NH3 (which can get into the air or the seas) ---> turns into NH4+ (which can get into the water) ---> the NH4+ breaks up and now we are left with NH3 and H+ again, which can enter the air or waters. \n\nSo as mentioned before this happens when farmers up the protein intake in their animals, for whatever reason (usually growth). *But* some farmers can get the results they are looking for by lowering their excess protein intake, and upping their base animo acid/protein consumption by learning about what amino acids their animal might be low in.(E.
