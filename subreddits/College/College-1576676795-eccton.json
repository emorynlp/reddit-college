  "text": "Now that classes and finals are coming to an end, I thought it would be nice to reflect on the semester by seeing what interesting/fun things you learned about in one of your classes this semester. Sometimes, the stress of school makes us dread going, but I always look back and find there's at least one class that I feel like I learned something really useful or interesting in each semester.",

Also female hyenas give birth THROUGH their clitoris, which actually looks like a penis on the outside. Whales, when they open their mouths to engulf water, can take in up to 133% of their body weight in water in a SINGLE gulp that then gets filtered! We also learned about imaging techniques, horse biomechanics, and why humans ended up this way anatomically. These were extra lectures after we finished the main anatomy content that the profs found interesting. \n\nHonestly anatomy was the best class I've ever taken to this day, it was so eye-opening and awe-inducing!",

This is thought to be implicated in learning new informations.\n\n\\- Schizophrenic patients have a huge problem of \"predicting\" obvious outcomes. If you touch a table with your hand, your will know that you will encounter the table with your hand, well for schizophrenics patients it's not that obvious and it seems that this is at the core of the disease.\n\n\\- One of the earliest signs of ALS before motor dysfunction could be abnormal weight loss. We still don't know why tho.\n\n\\- Microbiota seems to be very much linked with onset of neurodegenerative diseases which opens news possibilities for future studies\n\n\\- Parkinson patints who takes dopamines supplement to correct the motor deficit can experience Schizophrenic-like symptoms",

      "text": "The most cooling thing I learnt was about Binary search Trees. When someone needs to perform operation on sorted data, like insertion, or deletion, Binary Search Trees have more efficient time, and space complexities. Since, Arrays in Java have a fixed size, they are not the right data structure, if you want to perform insertions or deletions, and ArrayList might be a better choice. However, ArrayList double their sizes once they are  completely filled leaving a high scope of having unfilled spots or in other words \"wasted memory\", which in case of Trees is not a issue because insertion just involves creating a new Node and connecting previous nodes to it. Speaking of time complexity, insertion with ArrayLists typically involve shifting succeeding elements, which in itself has a Big-Oh of `O(n)` in the worst case. However, in the case of Binary Search Trees, if someone wants to insert a data, they go to that spot, and just change the links of the nodes.",

It's one thing to read and memorize it in a textbook, then another to actually pretend to be kids in a professional setting and practice with classmates. \n\nThen throughout this semester we were constantly prodded to use the mediation strategies with children in conflict in a real classroom setting. Now it comes naturally to me, and I can easily identify the problem, how NOT to solve it- but guide children to begin to solve their own problems and strengthen independent problem-solving behaviors. Like telling another student there are more toys, they don't need to take. Probably the single most handy thing I've learned in my teaching career so far.

The only way they make a net profit is through their membership because it virtually has no cost. In order to make customer renew they offer great customer service and products, paying employees higher salaries equate to this, their generous refund policy and warranty reflects this too. Another way that they save money is not having display products like how Walmart does, instead they offer it in containers saving cost. Costco only offers 4000-6000 SKUs per store limiting assortment but having the ability to buy bulk which results in lower cost.\n\nPrivate Labels (generic, store brand) provides a higher gross profit for retailers, virtually saving themselves. Since they control most the process of products they save a lot of cost which means a higher gross profit. If Costco didn\u2019t make Kirkland they would not be thriving.

      "text": "Around the same time as the chicano movement, there was a small organization in New York City called the Young Lords Party morning that was dope as fuck. It was mostly Puerto Rican second gen students from NYC, but they accepted everyone and responded to the same criticism of machismo in the movement that the Chicanos had with much greater grace. They were sort of styled after the Black Panthers. Had a newspaper to fundraise, very theory heavy, but also totally community service first.\n\nThe first thing they did, before they even had a name, when they were just college-age kids sitting around talking about how neglected their barrio was by the city, was the Garbage Initiative. They wanted to do something, anything for the barrio. So they went around and asked people- what do you need? and the same thing kept coming up- you know what? the city doesn\u2019t pick up the trash here. It\u2019s dirty. We just want it clean. \n\nSo for a few months every Sunday they\u2019d come out on a certain stretch of blocks that I forget and clean. Bag up trash, sweep. One Sunday they realize they have a group going. So they go to the sanitation dept and they\u2019re like \u201cHey so you guys aren\u2019t cleaning our streets, but we\u2019ve started this regular neighborhood cleanup. We know you have brooms for this. Can we come take them, use them, and return them on a regular basis?\u201d and the city was like lol fuck you no.\n\nSo they stole the brooms! Then realizing Sanitation wasn\u2019t picking up the trash they gathered, they blocked a major avenue the buses went down with the garbage. Some of it got lit on fire. \n\nFrom there there\u2019s just more and more incredible stories. There was a tuberculosis testing truck from the city that wouldn\u2019t go to their neighborhood, even though they were at higher risk. So they took the goddamn truck and learned to test for TB themselves! They took over a church and used it to organize a free childcare center, so the moms in the neighborhood could work more easily. (The pastor was allowing them to do this, but the board of the church was against it, so they took it over as a demonstration). They occupied a hospital and gave people medical treatment. When a protest/riot broke out at a prison in the city, the Young Lords were CALLED IN to help negotiations. (The prisoners just wanted better/humane conditions and treatment).\n\nAll of this and the organization didn\u2019t even really last very long. But they changed lives. For even more people, at least made life a little easier, a little better, for a little time.\n\nMakes you want to organize and take down the system. You don\u2019t have to dismantle the government to stick it to a shitty system and help the people who need it.",

Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway or even the fashion designer Elizabeth Hawes- odds are if they made a name for themselves prior to the 1940s, they hung around in a coffeehouse. \nPart of this is the simple explanation that coffee houses brought together young people and the atmosphere encouraged conversation, but there's also something much funnier behind the intellectual reputation of the coffeehouse. Think about it- before the British were known for drinking tea, what did they drink? It certainly wasn't water from the filthy Thames. \nBefore people started drinking coffee and tea, beer was the drink of choice, with some wine, ale, brandy, etc. mixed in for funsies. The entire country of England (and the rest of Europe to some extent) essentially went from being a society of functioning alcoholics to being suddenly sober and hopped up on caffeine, meaning that a lot of people were suddenly thinking clearly and feeling energized for the literal first time in their lives!",

If it's a humanities/liberal arts class than your likely course work will be a quiz and discussion post for every chapter/section, and than an online unit exam/paper.\n\nImo, online classes cut out the unnecessary fluff of being in a class. Your quizzes will be open book, so a lot less effort. Instead of being forced to participate in class and care about the content and your classmates opinions, you just do the assignments as laid out and that's it. What would normally be 6hrs  in classes/hw/commute for a literature class got cut down to 1hr online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's a math/science class your notes for the section are online, the hw is online on some hw program, your quizzes are online, but your tests are proctored. I did have one math class (Diff Eq) where everything is online, including exams, except for the final which was proctored.\n\nI prefer my technical classes online because I learn a lot slower than others at times. I may stare at a problem for an hour and finally get that Eureka moment, but for me that's satisfying and I feel motivated. When I'm in a class I feel pressured to take notes at the speed of light, feel bad when I don't measure up to my peers or professors expectations, and just feel less motivated to do well overall. Class just feels like a waste of time and a hit to my self-esteem bc I don't learn anything anyway. I took Cal 3 in class and made a D+, retook it online and made a B for reference. I also made all A's and B's this semester as well compared to semesters where they were all in person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say this though, the online classes worked greatly for me bc I have a laid back desk job with my own cubicle, so I just did hw all day. If I didn't have a structured, quiet environment I think the classes would have been harder to maintain (but still better overall) bc I can't study well in my own home. It was very easy to lose track of 5 classes assignments even with a planner, calendar, and the course due dates calendars spread out on my desk. You can still maintain a good professor student relationship for networking, I recommend online classes, but I've never done one with a lab portion.",

I recommend still setting up a time everyday to log in, check on assignments, etc so you don\u2019t get behind. This will also make you more disciplined and focused. \n\nI don\u2019t start school again until Jan 21 (thank God), but every school is different. Just stay on top of things and stay focused; you can do it!",

              "text": "Thought I'd chip in here too, I've taken 2 online courses and am doing a third over winter break. Psychology course, linguistics/anthropology course, and now an environmental studies issues in restoration course. Since none of these were really math/hard science based, they all really relied on discussion boards. Usually I'd have to watch a lecture from the prof or read (quite a bit) from multiple sources and then write 2ish posts for the discussion and respond to 2 classmates. A few quizzes thrown in there (easy because you can use your notes) and the midterm/final is either just similar to the quizzes (multiple choice/short answer) or an essay you arent timed on. Sadly I expected my classes to really be a \"do at your own pace\" thing, but since they have all been discussion based, the assignments usually open 2-3 days before it's due but everything else is locked until a certain date. Good luck!",

Turns out there's no right answer to the issues we're discussing and my thoughts were valuable to understanding the whole stories. \n\nBesides a lot of really interesting info about sustainable farming, animal neurophysiology, and the history of American veganism, I learned to be unafraid to be myself and respect my experiences as long as I have respect for my place and space.

The basics is that if an animal is getting too much protein, it results in nitrogen build up in their intestines, and nitrogen being released into their environment through their waste. The animal will excrete said protein and nutrients into the environment in a cycle that goes like this: \n\nExcess nutrients leave the body via defecation or urine ---> enters or transforms in the environment as NH3 (which can get into the air or the seas) ---> turns into NH4+ (which can get into the water) ---> the NH4+ breaks up and now we are left with NH3 and H+ again, which can enter the air or waters. \n\nSo as mentioned before this happens when farmers up the protein intake in their animals, for whatever reason (usually growth). *But* some farmers can get the results they are looking for by lowering their excess protein intake, and upping their base animo acid/protein consumption by learning about what amino acids their animal might be low in.(E. G. Lysine is a common limiting acid for pigs due to their diet. And to clarify, a limiting animal acid is the acid that is available in the lowest concentration in relation to the body's needs. I would post a picture of the barrel concept because it's way easier to understand visually, but I don't know how to use Imagur yet)\n\nI might be explaining it a little off, but I hope y'all understand.",
