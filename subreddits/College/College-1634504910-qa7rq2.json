  "text": "My roommate and I get along well, but they aren\u2019t able to fall asleep without their giant TV on and also snore very loudly. \n\nBecause of both the light and sound factory sleep has been taking a massive hit and I\u2019m at a loss for what to do. The only solution I\u2019ve though of has been ear plugs, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll sleep through my morning alarm because of them. \n\nAny advice is welcome. Thank you so much.",

      "text": "You need to tell them that having the TV on, while helping them sleep, is preventing you from doing the same. Assuming they are a reasonable person they should understand where you are coming form on this. From there, I'd recommend that your roommate get headphones (so that the noise isn't an issue for you) and that you consider getting a blindfold, so you can mitigate the light from the TV.  \n\nAs far as the snoring goes... I really have nothing there. It's a medical issue, so really the most you can do is bring it up to them and hopefully cooperate on finding a solution that satisfies both of you.",
