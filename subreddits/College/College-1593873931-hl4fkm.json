  "text": "I'm 32 and finally decided I'm tired of retail jobs and want to do something meaningful. I'm starting my bachelors in psychology this fall, then possibly going on to a masters in social work. In the past I struggled with some mental health issues and was far too focused on relationships and other non productive things, but I've always worked hard. Can't help but feel sometimes that I'm too old for this though. At this rate I might be 40 by the time I establish a career. Anyone out there who started a career later in life? Should I worry that employers might frown upon my lack of experience at my age? Just looking for some encouragement, I'm doing this regardless because it feels right.",

      "text": "I'm a few years older than you and going through something similar.  I already have a bachelors and graduate studies in a field that while I've enjoyed I'm planning on a career change.  The career change requires the education, similar to how the masters in social work does for you.  If it's something you want to do then I say you should just do it.  Yes there will likely be loans and/or other life challenges that are different in your early 30s vs. early 20s, but if you don't do it now you may regret it or struggle even more to do it later down the road.  I think if you're still in your 30s it's easier to get employment still unfortunately compared to someone even older.  A lot of people switch careers and take a while to figure it out.  I think you'll be surprised to find a few other older students and co-workers with similar stories.\n\nGood luck!",

The one advantage you\u2019ll have is that you have previous work experience (granted it\u2019s not on your field) but it\u2019s more experience than some of your peers. That\u2019s a plus you can use on your end. Other than that I don\u2019t think too many companies frown upon someone\u2019s age. The hardest part is getting in and then maintaining it should be easy because it\u2019s all about the work ethic. If you have experience working in retail then \u201ccustomer service\u201d and \u201cteam player\u201d would be specialties already listed in your resume, you would just have to be confident about yourself. \n\nLastly, good luck. You\u2019ll make it happen with some hard work.",

      "text": "Please read my post. \n\nIn contrast to what everyone else here is telling you, I do not think going back to school is a good option during your later years. \n\nFor one you are investing time and money you might not get back. Bachelor's and master's? That's going to be about 6 years and will cost anywhere from 5k to 50k per year. In 6 years you will owe either 30k or 300k in loans. \n\nSecondly the field you're trying to enter is oversaturated and does not pay well. Best case scenario you get your masters before you're 40, how much do you think social work pays hourly? It's not a lot and in fact very little. Most positions are just above minimum wage. \n\nSo basically you are going to work insanely hard for the next 6 years and borrow a lot of money just to make a little more than you do now. And there is no certainty that you will even get a job in your field or with your degree. Many college degree holders continue to have difficulty finding work years after graduating. \n\nDo yourself a favor and use the skills you have now to do something else. Don't believe the hype. The same people egging you on in this thread will be posting about their unemployment and financial problems a few years from now. After they downvote  this post to oblivion of course.",

I've researched jobs in my area and there are many available in the human services field, and many of them only require the bachelors. They pay 4-8 bucks more than I'm making now. Plus, you're talking to someone who's been poor her whole life. I don't need much. I'll make sure I do more research as far as getting the masters goes though, thank you.",

And everyone starts their career out of uni with more or less the same experience.\n\nI would like to say that if you're interested in going into social work, psych may be a longer root than you want to take. There are many roads you can take to get into social work so I hope you've found the best one for you. Also know that you'll probably need to get quite a bit of volunteer experience so start looking into programs in early days. \n\nWish you all the best with school!",

I have a 4.0 because I want to show that when I did this as an adult I did it with purpose. I figure if age is a knock against me, my grades won\u2019t be.  But also I have found that in the social work world, it\u2019s a motley crew already. One of my professors didn\u2019t become a social worker until her mid 40s. A lot of people who are drawn to social work aren\u2019t your typical business major super competitive by-the-book types, but instead are people who for whatever reason decided helping others is more important than the rest. They get it if you\u2019re a late starter. It\u2019s like the exact crowd that would get it because they\u2019re used to dealing with people who need second chances in life to make big life changes.\n\nI would also add I\u2019m a 34 year old bald guy so it\u2019s blatantly obvious I\u2019m not 18-22. My professors love me and I\u2019ve never had a single problem with my classmates, who tend to rely on my experience and willingness to take charge more than anything\n\nIf you want any other advice just pm me.",

      "text": "I\u2019ll be finishing a degree in my mid 30s and I think my prior work/life experience gave me an advantage in getting an internship. Teachers and administrators will treat you like the adult you are and will not treat you with kid gloves the way they would with 18 year olds but expect you to have the maturity to rise to the challenge and not constantly be asking for extensions (something I didn\u2019t know existed until I went back to school)!  Also, my biggest motivation was that I didn\u2019t want to wait any longer to establish a career and I\u2019m really glad I did it when I did. I had to put old life on pause, and eventually grew into a new life as a professional. Going back to school definitely reshapes you\u2019re perception of the world in many ways. It\u2019s hard to explain but I think you\u2019ll understand what I mean after you\u2019ve been in it for about 2 years. I\u2019m so grateful that I pushed myself to go back regardless of incurring student debt at this age. I considered it a lifetime investment in myself and it has completely transformed who I am. I am much more mature with respect to diet, sleep routine, sleep/work/study balance, I eliminated all of my vices except for video games, but now I spend all of my free time with my girlfriend or exercising. In some ways it was the impetus to change everything in my life for the better. I found myself about a year in struggling with remedial classes and had to quickly establish whether I wanted to fail out or sacrifice all activities that weren\u2019t conducive with finishing my degree. Don\u2019t wait any longer to do it, but appreciate that your life will change in uncomfortable ways because you will need to determine what you have time for in your day. I had to program myself to stay on a decent schedule mentally. As in, I would tell myself every day I have 24hours. In should sleep for at least 6 of those (which doesn\u2019t always happen), I have class for x amount of hours, I have to work a few hours in the evening and I have x amount of homework to get done. There isn\u2019t much time left over depending on your course load! \n\nI have no doubt that if you have made the decision to move forward to better your life that you will succeed. I can speak from experience, I wanted to get through those undergrad years and just get done quickly. That\u2019s not the correct attitude. You will finish it, but it will take a while so always remember to embrace the opportunity and don\u2019t try to rush through it. There will be a lot to learn and countless hours of tests, studying, assignments, etc., so just remember to take pause every once in awhile and be grateful that you are living life and enjoying doing what you want to be doing and that there is light at the ends of tunnel. I though I was going to be putting my life on pause for a few years.  I was wrong. I was beginning to live my best life and loving every minute of it!\n\nEdit: spelling",

No one will really care. \n\nI am going to warn you on your major and mental health issues. (1) You can't do much with a psychology degree. (2) To practice in mental health you will need a masters in social work or LCPC license. Get a Masters in Social Work. Avoid a masters in counseling. Why? LCPC's don't always get reimbursed for Medicare while LCSW usually will be reimbursed for Medicare. \n(3)Past mental health issues. Sometimes having mental health issues and dealing with people who have mental health issues does not always mix well. Social work can be a high stress and high burnout field and having your own personal mental health issues can lead down a path of burn out. Talk to a professional about this and/or someone in the field to get their take on this. \n\nTLDR: Be ready to get a masters if you get a degree in Psychology. Talk to a professional about your past mental health issues and becoming a provider.",

Most of them will value your experience and respect you for where you are in your life, and your friendship can grow from that. It does become a little weird when a 30-year-old tries to let on that they're 20, and then people find out their age later. I've seen that happen too, and it was pretty uncomfortable. As for employers, I don't think they care at all. As long as you have the experience they are looking for in the position you are pursuing, there shouldn't be any issue with getting hired.

      "text": "I went back to grad school in my late twenties with the goal of teaching at a community college, then worked as an adjunct professor (for terrible pay) for years. I couldn't get full time because no one was hiring anything but more adjuncts so I left the field, worked as a tech writer for a few years. Then just before I turned 40, I got a full-time teaching job. It was absolutely worth it, because now in my early 40s I would be so much more discontent with my life if I still wasn't doing something I found more meaningful.\n\nHere are a few things I have learned along the way: jobs that require advanced degrees often have older folks getting into the job because many people don't take a linear path at 18. Those that do take a linear path at 18 don't have as many skills to bring to the table because they just don't have as much work experience (of any kind). So, figure out how to leverage the skills and experience you have from other jobs when you are applying and it will work to your favor most of the time. \n\nAlso, figure out how to do things that are adjacent to what you want to do -- like volunteering a couple of hours a week somewhere that relates to the kind of work you want to do as a social worker. That kind of experience can be a huge resume booster if you are afraid your for-pay work won't look as good on a resume when you get started. \n\nOne of my friends gave me excellent advice once, so I'll pass it onto you for this scenario: You're going to be 40 eventually anyway, whether you have a new career or not. That really helped me reframe the whole situation about feeling too old to start something. Good luck!!!",

I just finished my medical degree, and I started my Ph.D. this summer.\n\nFirst, and while I may have misunderstood your point, I feel compelled to say that relationships are not non-productive. Toxic relationships are, but not relationships in general. In fact, without strong partnerships, I would have dropped out years ago.\n\nWhat you will discover, if you haven't already, is that most students and faculty today are very supportive of learning disabilities and mental health issues. The maturity of the average college student today is leaps and bounds of that of when I completed my undergraduate 20 years ago. Literally, every single day someone far younger impresses me.\n\nAs far as employers might perceive your experience level, it would help if you reflected on how you got back to school. You didn't drift in a void and land on the doorstep of college admission. You lived life. A life of experiences that employers can't teach. You can't show others how to have compassion or focus. You can't educate someone into having drive. You already have 30 years of experience, but it's up to you to explain how it applies to the job you want.\n\nI have had to hire various positions (often for which I was not qualified to perform) for three different companies, and formal education is often just a filter. There is this old semi-joke that half of what you will learn in school will be wrong, and the issue is that we don't know which half yet. So I don't look for someone who can do the job 100% on day one because even if you are skilled, you don't know exactly how we as a team want it done. So what I have looked for is someone with a base level skill who can show me how they have used their knowledge to adapt. I don't need an applicant to show me an example of something in their field. Instead, I am more swayed by hearing how you solved issues in your life that I can relate with.\n\nGood luck with school, but please, see it as the next step of your life and not a redo of it. You are the sum of all of your experiences, not just the ones with a seal and signature.",
