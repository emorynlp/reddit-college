I had always thought that professors were being overly lenient when grading my writing over the years, but I don't think this is something an instructor would have an incentive to lie about. I am unsure what benefits that would have for me in the immediate future, but the proposition by someone that I immensely respect both as a scholar and a person has me glowing right now. \n\nIt was a religious studies capstone on the American Catholic Church during the Regan Administration primarily.", "author": "pseudophocles", "created": 1622863388, "retrieved": 1632802756, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 610, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h0p57uu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nsmixn/my_senior_capstone_advisor_wants_me_to_consider/h0p57uu/", "text": "congratulations!!! this was low key a \"dream\" of mine when i did my capstone!!!", "author": "kickitlikeadidas", "created": 1622908712, "upvotes": 1}, "h0p1swt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nsmixn/my_senior_capstone_advisor_wants_me_to_consider/h0p1swt/", "text": "This actually sounds like something I want to read!

If you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d suggest talking to both your advisor and someone in your campus\u2019 undergraduate research and/or scholarly publishing offices - that might be in the library, or maybe in the administration offices.\n\nYour advisor can be a great help in finding a reputable journal to submit your thesis to and can help you understand that process. But if you can talk to someone from scholarly communications or your institution\u2019s research/publishing office, they\u2019ll be able to help you understand your rights as an author. They can also help you figure out how you want to make the article available for readers, and what rights you want to retain as the author.\n\nSome questions to ask, research, and think about - do you want your article locked behind a paywall in order to get it in a specific journal, or do you want to publish it as an open access article and make it free for anyone to read, but maybe not get the same citation metrics or the prestige of a specific journal title? Or is gold open access an option (where the article is paywalled for an embargo period and then free to read after that)? Do you want to have a copy archived in your institution\u2019s repository, if it has one, and how do you do that - and what kind of copy does the journal you choose allow you to archive, pre- or post-edit? Will you still have the right to share copies or present on your thesis later if you want to, per your agreement with the journal you choose?\n\nI don\u2019t mean this to be overwhelming - I just know that these are things we don\u2019t always talk about with students like we should. Usually students are so excited to be published that they\u2019ll just go with the process - but you\u2019re as much of an author as anyone else, and you deserve to have a conversation about your rights as an author and how you want others to be able to access your work.\n\nCongrats again - this is an awesome thing and definitely something to be proud of!! Your advisor is gonna be talking about you and your work with their colleagues for a long time.", "author": "lifebrarian", "created": 1622905769, "upvotes": 3}, "h0oud7k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nsmixn/my_senior_capstone_advisor_wants_me_to_consider/h0oud7k/", "text": "Dude that is incredible!!
