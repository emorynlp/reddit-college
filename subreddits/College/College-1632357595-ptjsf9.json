I am redoing the plan for my classes and wanted to know if it is recommended I take basic economics before taking Macro and Micro. I will not have taken it at high school and if I take ECO 1000 (basic economics) at the college but pass Macro and Micro (which I intend to do), the 3-hour credit is void. I want to know if it is necessary for me to take this course for me to continue as a prerequisite or if it will just be a big help in each of these classes.
