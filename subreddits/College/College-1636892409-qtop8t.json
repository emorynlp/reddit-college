  "text": "Ok so I've been a good student all 3 years of high school and have a good enough GPA to most likely get into Towson UMBC and other maryland schools and UMD is a little Iffy. My Freshman year gpa was a 3.4 weighted than sophomore was a 3.7 weighted and than during online during junior year i took harder classes and got a 4.6 weighted. But now Senior year wow my AP stats class has been getting me I have a D in it first quarter and I think overall im going to end with a D in it. If I do get accepted into most of those schools do you thing I will get rescinded even though i had all A's beside that one class?",

Like, you could take a dual credit class at a college (or online) and it would be easier. Or you could just not take stats.",
