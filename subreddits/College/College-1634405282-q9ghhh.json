Students see college/university as a series of hurdles to jump through to reach an end goal, not as an opportunity for academic growth, self-reflection, learning, etc.\n\nThe latter is how it started. The former is how it's going. Credential inflationism is a bitch. As more people need to go to university for PSE for post-industrial jobs, it becomes a game, rather than an experience. On our end of things, it gets exhausting. Students are less interested in *learning* (which is why most or many of us even get into teaching to begin with), and more interested in *performing well.* I get it. But they're not mutually inclusive.\n\nI understand why homeboy here is saying what he's saying, but I don't agree with him taking it out on individual students. Really boomering it.",
