  "text": "Hoping to graduate from undergrad in a year. A majority of my classmates feel deep resentment towards the school and (engineering) department.  Primarily because the failure rates are so high, it is unlikely you haven't retaken the same course a few times.  At this point, it feels like students are just getting the short end of the stick...\n\nDo you guys feel this way?",

      "text": "Just my opinion -- I don't think that your feelings are that unusual.\n\nOf the three degrees that I have earned, I would say I only enjoyed getting one of them. \n\nNot that I didn't have good times while earning the other two degrees but the process was a bit of a grind. And when one has their nose down to the grindstone, one tends to see only the grindstone.\n\nYou've earned your engineering degree. As you gain experience, you will acquire more information. \n\nAs you acquire more information, your perspective on your college experience will evolve... How it will evolve we don't know.\n\nAnyway, Best of luck!",

      "text": "No, its not normal.  It sounds as though you and your friends are blaming the college and/or your major for your academic difficulties.  I would offer you made some poor choices in earlier years.\n\nDifferent schools and different departments have differing degrees of academic difficulty.  A student should chose a university at which he finds it challenging  to get good grades, but is not so difficult that he struggles to barely pass.  Similarly, considerations for choosing a major should include the student having aptitude and enthusiasm for the subject.\n\nBased on your message, you and your friends are in over your heads at this particular college.  Transferring years ago to a less academically challenging school may have solved your problems.  \"The fault, dear Brutus, in not in the stars, but in ourselves...\"",

If the student hated his school, regardless of the reason, he should have transferred several years ago.  Instead, you approve of the fact that he sat around being miserable, repeating classes, and blaming others for his lack of positive steps to correct his problems.",

      "text": "my case, its going to be blamed on the schools time period. 5 years from now, professors will leave or new president.\n\nI was a 5th year, who was almost expelled twice. I was gas lit as a freshman and had a lower gpa. I was thrown around departments that I graduated with a BA in history, and 2 minors. I had my college keep my scholarship because of the abuse and the 5th year funding I had to let go, because of the wording to the rules. My old president was anti 5th years and said if it was their issue (that they caused) then its free. I would have to graduated with 1 degree to get them to pay for it. \n\nReality, (graduated 3 years ago). I do not regret a small college. I use all my degrees despite the abuse. I like the history of the college. \n\nI am cleaning up my transcript at 2 different community colleges before applying for my MS. and am getting my CPA license due to employment (just have a business minor). \n\nfor me its weird. I would love to go back as me now in that atmosphere but I am happy that I never found my side hobby then versus now.\n\nI am a person who gets gig hired to see the conditions of stores. IE, forever 21 sends me to make sure deposit forms are filled out and stuff tagged. There are 3 in my city so its $150-$200 every other month. I get to see if a x type of alcohol is on the shelf at X store sometimes, get paid back for the alcohol and take 4 pictures of what you saw. \n\nI know my toxic friends (I was so depressed these were the people I was around) would have taken total advantage of me.",
