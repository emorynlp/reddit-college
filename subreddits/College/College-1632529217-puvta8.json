In my interview, I was told that dining would cover my early move in charge (768$ for 12 days early, so about 64$ a day). I scheduled my orientation for the same day as my move in but when I got there, I got sent back to my dorm after bringing the wrong documentation for my ID, and I had to reschedule a different orientation date for a week later, and then I had my first shift three days later. Now, I was reviewing my bill and waiting for the financial aid and stuff to be factored into my account, and only 4 days worth of the bill was brought off my account, when it should have been the whole thing. The 4 days started I guess on my rescheduled orientation date despite me not having a choice in what date. So now I'm on the hook for about $500 even though the only reason I *one:* moved in early, and two: *was approved to move in early at all* was because I'm a dining employee. I was also told during my interview that my university ID + ssn was fine until my ID came in, so when I went to orientation, I did not anticipate being sent back. I don't understand why the entire move in thing is not being waived and don't understand if maybe I'm just in the wrong. I want to ask my supervisor about it and get that email sent to housing but I'm scared if I press her about it she's going to fire me or something. If anyone has any input I'd be really grateful.", "author": "bittersweet_teaa", "created": 1632529217, "retrieved": 1632800365, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hefbiqy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puvta8/am_i_wrong_in_wanting_my_early_move_in_fee_to_be/hefbiqy/", "text": "If your school is like mine your dining halls are so short staffed they will do just about anything to keep you on", "author": "Maleficent_Unit_7928", "created": 1632708875, "upvotes": 1}, "he8gmm4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puvta8/am_i_wrong_in_wanting_my_early_move_in_fee_to_be/he8gmm4/", "text": "No. You were given incorrect information, and acted on that information.
