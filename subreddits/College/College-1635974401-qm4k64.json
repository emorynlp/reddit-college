  "text": "I\u2019m a computer major and one of my courses that I\u2019m taking this semester is java application with databases. The course basically teaches OOP fundamentals and works with a MySQL database using Java. This might sound like fun and it honestly did when I first saw the course listing. But the way the Professor has us do the coding exercises is weirdly convoluted. I don\u2019t know how to fully explain it but every exercise he has us implementing a ton of different classes, packages, enums, etc. that are then unexplainably interwoven into each other. I understand the concepts he\u2019s trying to teach but the exercises seem so needlessly convoluted. I feel as if there\u2019s a better and more straightforward way to teach it. I honestly get the feeling he\u2019s trying to weed out students. His grading policy does not allow for any partial points either. And it seems like every assignment he gives us always has some sort of curveball.",
