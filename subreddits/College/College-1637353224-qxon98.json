  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI am new to reddit. I actually joined this community to have someone to ask for advice, because I don't have anyone else to discuss it with.\n\nSo I've been struggling with perfectionism my whole life and Ive been diagnosed with ADHD, but tbh I don't really care for these labels, I've learned that a strict environment with strict course subjects and with strict deadlines is just not compatible with my nature. I always get completely stressed out with deadline and anxiety makes it worse. It debilitates me and clouds my intelligence or creativity. And I ALWAYS get in horrible situations. Always making up excuses for more time and missing deadlines etc... It completely wears you out...\n\nBut this time it's about my thesis. And I've been WAY over my deadline. And I haven't made much progress and somehow I always come in this loop of procrastination making my anxiety worse --> more procrastination.\n\nOn top of this my supervisors are mailing me with if I have any updates and I ignored them for more than a week... Which is very unprofessional. So I just wanted to ask is there anyone that sees anyway out of this or can relate?\n\nI can only thinking of making any excuse with family and corona or something like that. But this time the shame for making up excuses is just overwhelming.\n\nAny advice would be golden for me. I wish everyone the best!\n\n\\[Please don't tell me to tell my supervisors about the anxiety, because we all know in these modern universities there is absolutely no room for personal suffering or circumstances. \\]",
