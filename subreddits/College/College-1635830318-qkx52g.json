  "title:": "Can I still graduate without finishing my declared minor?",
  "text": "So I'm currently a junior majoring in film production but since the field is sort of hit or miss, I was thinking of declaring a minor in marketing since I've done two internships before where I was a marketing intern and helped with social media and enjoyed the experience and realized that managing social media is something I enjoy.  I felt that marketing could go well with film and could potentially result in producing advertisements or media related to advertising. So anyways, would I still be able to graduate without finishing a minor? Is there any penalty if I didn't finish/fulfill my minor? I only ask because I may or may not have enough time to finish the required credits for my major. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",
