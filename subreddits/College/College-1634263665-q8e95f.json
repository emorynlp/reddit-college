  "text": "I\u2019m a full time college student living three hours away from my family. But my family consists of my mother who is in chronic pain and my sister who is mentally disabled. I come home whenever I can to help out with things around the house and to care for my sister. Recently my sister had an injury where she can\u2019t walk, I need to help her get to the bathroom and dress herself because she is too heavy for my mom. We don\u2019t have any family friends or anyone who can help. Is there a way I can reach out to the school to get some sort of leniency on deadlines that would make my situation much more manageable?",

      "text": "How much leniency are you looking for here? You could probably get deadlines extended a week at most, but not much more than that, if anything. Its really unfortunate, but it wouldnt be fair to other students if you got so much extra time to complete assignments. I know the situation isnt your fault and its great that you want to help your family, but from what I have heard its just not likely to get a ton of leniency for something like this",
