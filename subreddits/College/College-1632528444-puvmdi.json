Right now I make the same and even more than I would with a basic degree. Would it be smart to go back to college to make sure I will always have a job? Or should I focus on what I have going? Going back to school would make it hard to grow what I have so I\u2019m not sure which to choose. \n\nIf I do go back to school, is a marketing degree useless? I basically do affiliate marketing at the moment so it would help with my experience. Or would you suggest a finance or management degree?

I would recommend going to college part-time, so you can continue to work on your current business.  If you do need to work for someone else at a later time, a degree is crucial for obtaining a professional level position in business.  You evidently are already in marketing, so getting a degree in that subject will provide the education to match your experience.\n\n\"...to make sure I will always have a job?\"  A degree will not ensure you will never be unemployed.  Its not uncommon for large companies to suddenly let go thousands of mid-level managers.  That degree, however, will help you find a replacement position should you be laid off.", "author": "taxref", "created": 1632533402, "upvotes": 2}}}
