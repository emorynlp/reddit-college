  "title:": "Looking at Web Development with DeVry... Is Devry a scam?",
  "text": "Greetings all,\n\nLooking for some advice and feedback here. I really want to get into web development, and DeVry University offers the course and certification online. It seems like a good program and after talking to them I like the idea. \n\nThen comes the internet. Everything I google search says not to go there, that because they're a for-profit institution that nobody takes seriously in the professional world. I will be using my GI Bill to attend, and thusly also have the luxury of not being constrained by tuition expenses.\n\nWhat I'm asking here is: Does anyone have any experience in dealing with DeVry or a for-profit institution? Is DeVry legit? Are there better institutions available to pursue Web Development training? Any and all advice is very valued and appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

But I also know it's the current trend to bypass college due to costs or seeing it as worthless, but with the GI bill, costs wouldn't be an issue. Unless you are opposed to a CS or CS-related 4-year program.",

Also, be careful of what you sign in either case.  Some technical schools will demand you sign a loan agreement for the full course and if you drop out early you still owe the full amount.",
