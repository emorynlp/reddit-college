  "text": "I was here before to get everyone\u2019s opinions on going back to school after a shitty undergrad experience and online school is my best option at the moment. I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019m doing my research and I found quite a few options. My choices so are Penn State, SNHU, DeSales (a small private Catholic school in my state), and Columbia College (not the Ivy League school). So far, Penn State is the best one. Any other online schools that are good?",
