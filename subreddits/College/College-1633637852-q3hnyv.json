  "title:": "Roomate\u2019s girlfriend is staying over all the time",
  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and it\u2019s my third week here. I live in a triple and one of my roommates is a nice guy. Trouble is, he already has a girlfriend and she spends every waking moment in our dorm. This includes the nights. I don\u2019t think she has ever slept in her own dorm before.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert so I like to have my own time every once in a while so this is kind of a problem when their annoying flirting and making out is in my space. It gets even worse when I have a hard day and I\u2019m tired and want to chill in my bed but I can\u2019t go inside the dorm because they are having sex.\n\nAnd the girlfriend is super annoying too. She\u2019s the type of girl who is really mean to everybody and thinks she\u2019s the funniest person in the world when really she\u2019s just an asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten really bad over the last couple of days. Lately she has been staying at the dorm even when her boyfriend isn\u2019t even here. Apparently she is having trouble with her roommate so she can\u2019t stay go to her dorm. So there is a lot of times I come in to see her sleeping in bed so I can\u2019t just relax. My other roommate isn\u2019t in the dorm that often so I can\u2019t really talk to him about this because I feel like he would take her side. What is a way I can tell her to leave without sounding like an asshole or her yelling at me?",

That being said, you should learn how to communicate with whoever you\u2019re living with. The RA is there to help facilitate if someone is consistently breaking rules or being unreasonable. So if you haven\u2019t talked to him about it, do that. If he doesn\u2019t listen, it\u2019s not snitching. He\u2019s disregarding your campus housing policies on top of not respecting the space you are paying for or listening to your reasonable boundaries\n\nEdit: all of you, including the gf, need to communicate with your roommates. Her roommate problems are not yours to solve they are hers and she is impeding on your space. If she tells you it\u2019s no use, tell her she should request the help of an RA. \n\nA tip for asking her to leave: say you want to take a nap, say you want to be alone, you need a quieter less populate space for hw, or you need to make a private phone call. If she tries to argue tell her it\u2019s your room and you\u2019re asking her to leave please. If she doesn\u2019t that\u2019s when you can let her know you can and will make a complaint to the RA. She has to know she\u2019s wrong for staying there when it\u2019s not her room. Any argument she makes is automatically trumped by the room being yours.",

My roommate at the time wasn\u2019t having sex in the dorm room but he had guests over constantly, to the point where there was a couch in the middle of the room for a few weeks. \n\nMy advice would be to sit down with your roommate at a time when his girlfriend is not around and tell him your not comfortable with her being around so much, and you have the right to feel comfortable in the room your paying for. \n\nIf he responds badly, then I\u2019d say go to the RA or a staff member you trust for help navigating the situation.",

Still have roommates but now I make sure to talk out any issues we have. And if nothing changes then you\u2019re just forced to talk to someone higher up. Don\u2019t worry if your roommates doesn\u2019t like you then, you didn\u2019t come to college yo be buddies with everyone.

Lots of people who are living with roommates for the first time do not understand boundaries, and having three people stuffed into one room does not make it any better. \n\nFirst course of action is to just have a serious talk with your roommate. If that doesn't work out then ask the RA to intervene. Their job is largely about resolving disputes exactly like this. Is it going to irritate your roommate? Yes. But I'm afraid that's just the card you've been dealt here - your roommate is the one causing the problems here, *not* you.\n\nI would also try to see your other roommate's opinion on the matter. If problem roommate can see that both of you AND the RA are pissed off then *maybe* he will realize he is being an asshole. \n\nIf I were the RA here I would try to find a student in a single dorm and see if they are willing to swap with your roommate. Then you get to stay, roommate and his girlfriend get to bone in peace, and she won't be bothering anyone by staying over.",

My dorm was pod style, so there were three rooms to a pod. Basically, I had 5 roommates. I liked to wake up early, while they stayed up and did hw because they procrastinated. I tried to accommodate and be understanding of their loud noise, but at the end of the day, I was there to get an education and get some sleep. I confronted them multiple times because I knew we wouldn't be friends after freshman year. Do what you need to do, if they haze or harass you for speaking up, then report them again. \n\nOn a side note, I'm sorry that you are going through this. Hope it gets better!",
