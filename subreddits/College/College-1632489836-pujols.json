But there's so many resources, which I know is usually a good thing, but I don't even know where to start or what I should focus on. We have the textbook and textbook, and then the OWL Cengage homework with assignments just for extra practice, the professor's powerpoints, and extra practice exams on blackboard. Where do I start??

So don't worry so much about which particular resource you're using; pick one that looks helpful and stick with it.  If and when you reach a point in that resource where you're confused, then switch to one of the other resources to try to fill in the blanks.
