  "text": "Not getting laid is itching me. I'm not looking for a girlfriend and I just want to get laid but I'm having such a hard time. It's been week 1 of school and I've gotten couple girls numbers in class but everytime I try to ask them if they want to come over for a drink they ghost me or give me some excuses. Fyi, I'm not a very attractive guy since I have pretty bad acne. I've been working out and eating alot healthier and my skin is improving. I just have bad scars and couple cystic acne. I feel like my acne is the problem but do girls in college really care if a dude has acne? Btw, if I can get a girl to answer this it might be helpful.",

      "text": "here\u2019s some advice from a girl. very few girls like the mindset of \u201ci only want to get laid.\u201d it\u2019s very unattractive. it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want a relationship, but at the same time, my current 3 year relationship started out from a guy who \u201cdidn\u2019t want a girlfriend.\u201d now we\u2019re talking about marriage. you have to be open minded to experiences. \n\ni would be weirded out if a guy asked for my number in class and so early. i would recommend going to a party, or inviting a GROUP of people over/out. it\u2019s hard to start something with a girl when ur not friends, or even acquaintances. women deal with a lot of paranoia since the world is so dangerous for us. they have to TRUST you before they consider doing something like that. \n\nbuild relationships. i always think of the episode of the office (i\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve seen it) where michael really likes holly after barely knowing her. jim tells michael \u201ctake is slow. get to know her first. pam and i began our relationship by eating lunch together in the break room\u201d\n\nif you are seriously looking for a random hookup, i\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s apps for that. u could use tinder and say \u201cjust looking for a hookup/fwb\u201d type of thing. i\u2019ve never done that but i\u2019m sure there\u2019s more options out there. \n\nchange the mindset dude. no girl likes to be used as an object for your personal pleasure.",

      "text": "Some advice from an (admittedly inteoverted) girl:\n\nIf a guy in my class I didn't really know gave me his number and asked if I wanted to come over to drink I'd be a bit weirded out, just because us girls are all hyper-aware of all the nasty things guys can do to girls when alone/drunk, ESPECIALLY in colleges. I'd recommend going to a few parties (that follow plague regulations, mind you) or hangouts and strike up a few conversations with girls. Maybe even invite a couple friends over so the girls you invited feel comfortable knowing where they'd be going beforehand, safely in a group of other people. If it's sex you're more looking for, not necessarily a relationship, I'd recommend trying dating apps that are more geared towards that.\n\nDon't worry about your acne-- a lot of girls are more focused on the person than the face, ESPECIALLY relationship-wise. Just shoot your shot as respectfully as possible and understand that most college-aged girls have boundaries when it comes to people they don't know very well.",

      "text": "Alright. First of all, asking for numbers in class, during the first week of class? Not the best move IMO. One, these girls don\u2019t really know you yet. Two, you\u2019re asking them in a very public space where they may not feel comfortable saying no (could be why you\u2019re getting ghosted).\n\nAs for the acne, it depends on the girl. I\u2019ve known plenty of dudes with acne or other physical imperfections who have been successful in dating. Me personally, it\u2019s definitely not ideal but for the right guy I\u2019d look past it. But to circle back: these girls don\u2019t know you yet because it\u2019s the first week of class. They don\u2019t have much to go on beyond physical appearance. PM me if you want some skincare recommendations.",
