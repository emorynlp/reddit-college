I\u2019m getting a minor too but have no idea what\u2019s a better field to get into to make good money.",

I\u2019d say look into Sociology specifically, as there is a lot of variety in that major that has to do with helping others. However, if your dream is to become a nurse don\u2019t give up on it!!! Do what feels right for you.\n\nSource: am a Sociology major",

Hearing that you\u2019re interested in nursing, health, and environmental health is awesome because public health is related to all of those things in one way or another!

      "text": "My suggestion if you have a lot of interests is to list them categorically and then see which category appears to contain the bulk of your interests. Then choose a major in that category to start for. The reason for this is because, once you get into it, you may find you prefer another. Since they would be in the same general field of study, you're more likely to have common major requirements between them. That way you can change/add majors as you go until you settle on what you truly want to study without needlessly taking classes that will eventually become useless. I would, however, not pick a major based on job salary. You are more likely to make money if it's something you love because you'll want to keep pursuing it. Trying to do something you don't particularly enjoy just for the financial prospect is a recipe for disaster.",
