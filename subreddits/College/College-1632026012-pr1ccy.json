I love everyone in the band and I really enjoy making memories with them. Every weekend, the whole band goes to a party on friday and they always have so much fun. I\u2019ve lied my way out and opted out of going to these parties because I get so nervous in that kind of environment, I don\u2019t know why. People are confused why I never show up to these parties because I am very outgoing within the classroom. It\u2019s frustrating because people are having great times, wishing for me to be there, when I\u2019m in my dorm knowing I should\u2019ve gone to the party. Do you guys have any advice for people in my kind of situation?", "author": "hUeHuEhUeHuEhUeHu3", "created": 1632026012, "retrieved": 1632801504, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdgnq1d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr1ccy/i_never_go_to_parties_or_hang_out_with_people_and/hdgnq1d/", "text": "Just go at least one time.

She's not a party person and neither am I, but we didn't regret going. Right now it seems you already regret not going, so what do you really have to lose by going?
