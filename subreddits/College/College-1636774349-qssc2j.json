  "text": "I just missed out on this dance/dinner that\u2019s happening tonight hosted by a club at my university.  Basically, the tickets for it sold out and a few friends I know are going and I feel bad that I didn\u2019t ask them if they were going.  I wasn\u2019t really trying to go alone because that was gonna be kinda pointless.  I feel bad because like I don\u2019t really have much to do this weekend anyways.     \n  \nHowever, I did end up biting the bullet and asking them if they were going to this one other concert in a few weeks and they said yeah and I got a ticket for that so I\u2019m excited.  However, I still feel bummed about missing out on the stuff going on tonight, especially since I could have just asked and got the ticket a couple days ago.  \ud83d\ude41   \n  \nIdk, I just feel like I haven\u2019t hung out with my uni friends at all outside of eating dinner with them and just talking in clubs.  Also, is it bad that I don\u2019t want to go alone?  Usually I can recognize people. But, I don\u2019t want to just join my friends if they are with people idk, especially if they are coupled up.  But whatever.  I need to catch up with sleep anyways.",

      "text": "One of my biggest regrets from college is how much \u201cFOMO\u201d stressed me out. As someone who is now done with college, let me just stress how much it doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t waste your time regretting how you missed out on x event, it\u2019s not productive and really doesn\u2019t bring anything positive to your life. If it\u2019s really stressing you out, just try and attend an event next time you have a chance (which it seems like you did with the concert!). \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird to not want to go to things alone. I\u2019ve been to a few events alone before and I only didn\u2019t regret one of them- most of them sucked and I have a much better time going to things with at least one person I know. I admire people who can attend events alone but it\u2019s not for everyone and that\u2019s fine.",

          "text": "Hearing it from you, it does sound stupid to stress out about FOMO.  Like, the ship has sailed and there\u2019ll be something else that I can go to, if I really want to.  \n  \nAnd, I\u2019m a freshman.  That event is gonna be held again in 12 months so I can go then.  Also, now I\u2019ll be aware of it and I already have some guys I can hit up ready to go 12 months in advance.  \n\nThanks for the insight!",

      "text": "Honestly, I wanted to go out tonight, joined the pre-party, and they took too long to get going. You\u2019re not missing out on much honestly.. I became bored and left. \n\nFrankly, it\u2019s different if you\u2019re hot and socially outgoing but I don\u2019t really care honestly.",
