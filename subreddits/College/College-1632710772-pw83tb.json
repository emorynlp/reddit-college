I\u2019m sharing a room with a nice roommate but I can tell that they wish I wasn\u2019t in the room all the time. But I\u2019m not really... Some days I have all my classes and I have sports practice every singIe day. I appreciate having alone time so I usually do homework in my room so I can focus (math - I get distracted if I go to library and talk with friends). I guess I didn\u2019t realize that I was only doing my homework in my room and that my roommate wanted time alone there too. They are a bit more social than me so whenever I get back from practice or class they\u2019re usually not there anyways so I always just set up and get to work. I thought they liked going to the common space but maybe they were going there so they could do their work without me in the same room? I guess I don\u2019t mind working on homework in same room as someone else. On Thursday I was studying in library with someone else and they asked if they could have the room to themselves. I was like yeah I\u2019m not even there anyways. Should I ask them what times they want to be alone? I totally get wanting to be by yourself in a dorm room and I just feel badly for hogging the room and not picking up on hints", "author": "ejsfsc07", "created": 1632710772, "retrieved": 1632800199, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"heh4urk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw83tb/am_i_hogging_the_dorm_room/heh4urk/", "text": "I don't think you have anything to feel terrible about.

They may be social but then like time alone to decompress and recharge. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest that there are places in the library where you have to be quiet and you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with your friends.

Maybe your roommate is similar? Just ask them if they want time alone and maybe when they\u2019re in the room just work in the common areas and let them have the room for a bit. Obviously don\u2019t feel pressured as it\u2019s your room and you have every right to work where you want however it is also their room. Communication is the best way to go when it comes to roommates. \n\nOn my campus there are tons of places to hang out that aren\u2019t dorm hall common areas or the library- I usually go to one of the academic halls and hang out in the common areas there. I don\u2019t have to worry about talking to people cause everybody does their own thing and minds their own business. I just listen to music in my earbuds and do my own thing. There\u2019s probably places outside you can go as well. But yeah just ask your roommate what they prefer because maybe they do prefer to be out of the room in which case you don\u2019t have to feel bad about being in there. But if the latter there\u2019s always other places you can go and not be too distracted.", "author": "taliaaw", "created": 1632711747, "upvotes": 13}, "heffvjk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw83tb/am_i_hogging_the_dorm_room/heffvjk/", "text": "\u201cI always just set up and get to work.\u201d \n\nDo NOT change what works for you.
