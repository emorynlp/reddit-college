  "text": "People who major in computer science or computer engineering how come you chose that major? I want to switch my major to computer engineering because I took a coding class in high school and I enjoyed it. Also I\u2019m always on my phone and my MacBook Pro, and I\u2019m curious as how the inside of my MacBook or phone works. Is that another reason to major in computer engineering?",

I liked building computers and wanted to know how it all worked and enjoyed my coding classes in hs. Will say that for computer engineering you need a pretty good grasp on mathematics/physics or be willing to put in the effort and time as it is with any engineering major.",
