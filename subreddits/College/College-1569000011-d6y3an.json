  "text": "I'm finnish and the more I read and hear about the problems United States has the more I appreciate the nordic welfare model. The student debt situation sounds so bad with people paying their degrees off for years and years. How did it get so out of hand? Why does it have to be so gigantic sums? I'm not sure byt apparently no other nation has a situation like that.",

      "text": "Our colleges are not run like European ones, which run on a shoestring and focus on teaching.  They're bloated bureaucracies and administrations that run like Gilded Age companies.   To the point they rely on adjunct professors to do the actual teaching and pay them almost minimum wage.  So college costs have been out racing US inflation for decades.  They don't give AF about the students and encourage clueless parents and kids to sign their financial lives away.    \n\n\nI keep saying a visionary Republican administration should use US tax money to pay all college costs.  At the rate US college bureaucracy and entitlement are growing it'll outpace Pentagon spending in a few years.  Then we're just one Republican administration voted in by outraged tax payers from mandating colleges teach only \"mandatory\" college curriculum like business, medicine, science, engineering and ditching \"unnecessary distractions\" like art, humanities, environmentalism, and (of course) gender and ethnic studies.  Despite faculties and students being liberal, the administrations will cave in a heartbeat.  And at a stroke the US college institutions will stop being bastions of liberalism (at least in teaching and curriculum).  Fortunately, we haven't had any visionary Republicans since Teddy.",

What you can spend student loan money on is virtually anything.  And thats what MOST of the funds ARE used for - not 'college'\n\n2) If you find someone actually paying college loans back- congratulations you just found a unicorn. I'd say less than a 25% are actively been paid back.  I even run across teachers that don't bother to pay loans back.\n\nThe realist in me sees that the real situation is this- it's a massive give-away/welfare program disguised as something positive.  It's easy to see why some politicians want to forgive student loans- it's a bread-and-circuses thing and doesn't have much to do with people actually going to college.",

What is expensive is buying all the excess shit kids think they need to create the \"college experience\". Realistically coming out of a 4 year degree with around 40-60k is honestly pretty reasonable considering you aren't actively inceasing your net worth over that 4 years. And if you're aggressively paying it down after college you can drop that debt in 1-3 years. In conclusion \"college\" is expensive because its giving a lot of money to stupid people who dont know how to spend said money.",

          "text": "I\u2019m not sure if maybe you don\u2019t want an answer, but that\u2019s a common misconception. I can answer one by one. Source: am Finnish \nBasically, the Nordic model of assistance is based on the idea that only people with income can make purchases, pay bills, and pay taxes. Debt in the form of unpaid bills slows the economy, and the economy is not healthy if people are saving instead of spending. While debt is profitable for credit card companies and banks, overall it slows tax revenue and is a drain on society. Therefore, the government assistance is set at a rate that allows people to pay basic bills but not much else. Yes the government gives money monthly, but the receiver isn\u2019t saving it for a vacation. Nearly every cent is going right back into the economy. It\u2019s a lot cheaper to give cash and make people responsible for their own survival than to provide different services like food stamps. \n1) Unemployment can only be provided for a set period of time and the receiver needs to provide proof of applying for jobs. Unemployment is NOT enough to live long-term. Also, they need to see your bank account to make sure unemployment is your only source of income. There is no making money on the side. If you do a one-time job that earns you 150\u20ac your unemployment gets cut by 150\u20ac for that month. \n2) college is tuition free but students are responsible for own bills, own housing, own transportation, everything else. At least in Finland since 2016, that \u201cfree\u201d college stipend is in the form of a government-backed private student loan. It\u2019s low interest, but a loan is not free. I get 250\u20ac in free government stipend and 650\u20ac from a loan, monthly. In the governments eyes (and the rest of the world I guess) they provide me with 900\u20ac monthly, buuuttt I\u2019m still leaving school 20 000\u20ac in debt so I\u2019m not exactly convinced.\n3) I would love me some of that free Finnish healthcare the rest of the world keeps talking about. You don\u2019t need to take out a loan but you do need to pay appointment fees, prescriptions, copays. I\u2019ll use myself as an example again. I see a therapist. The therapist charges 100\u20ac per session. The government pays 70\u20ac and I pay 30\u20ac per session. This was calculated based on my income (which is the 900\u20ac a month I mentioned earlier). To get approval for this, I needed a doctor to write a \u201cprescription\u201d for the therapy. The appointment was 40\u20ac and there was a 60\u20ac fee because she emailed the paper to the government instead of me sending it in the post. So that\u2019s 100\u20ac in fees and then a 120\u20ac monthly bill. \n4) Free homes. There is a government stipend you can apply for to pay rent. It is based on your rent and your income. There is a cap. I believe the maximum of this benefit is 80% of housing costs up to 400\u20ac. So the most you can get is around 300\u20ac. Anyone who qualifies for this benefit is almost definitely getting unemployment or student benefit as well, so you need to use those benefits to pay for the part of rent that this benefit doesn\u2019t cover. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty impossible to live on government assistance forever. You would never be without housing, food, and healthcare, but the assistance eventually runs out. Life is expensive and eventually you would need to pay a speeding ticket, you would need to move, you would need new winter boots, you\u2019d break your phone. Just because the government is allowed to let you die in the cold doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not poor.",

      "text": "Im the little fairy whos stopping in to add that not enough education about how to make sensible choices about what school you go to and how youll pay for it all is made. If people go to school amd make.it out debt free, its because they thought of a way, not really that theyve been taught. We are not taught how loans really work, how to avoid paying hella expensive tuition, that university isnt the end all of education (colleges and community colleges are fine), that we may have to work to make it through or pick a school closer to home, and so many other valuable pieces of advice that would help us in the long run. \n\n\nOn top of that people are pressured to go to school very second they graduate highschool, which leads to people picking majors they dont know if they want or not, people picking majors that are their \"\"\"\"passion\"\"\"\", majors that wont work out for them in the long run i.e.  not helping with their student debt should they take a loan, and so on. \n\n\nMost of all i blame the stigma about going to a school thats not extremely popular and well known, as if its impossible to get a job if you graduate from a school not everybody knows. Theres literally people out there picking schools just because their parents went there or because its more popular for heavens sake omg\n\n\nJust hope you know, OP, theres definitely ways to be smart about spending for tuition and theres even grants(money you dont have to pay back) that are available, please dont go around thinking or saying that every single person in the USA is in debt from going to college because thats not true",

      "text": "We are facing a perfect storm of colleges charging more and more for tuition and people too stupid or naive to realize that they are requesting and receiving immense loans which they have no chance of paying back. Why? Because they are getting useless degrees which are valueless and they often fail to research exactly what their earning potential will be when they graduate. Don\u2019t feel too badly for them. Many people are doing it better by going to less expensive schools, earning scholarships, taking advantage of work study opportunities, joining the military which pays for college or even postponing college to work and save for college. This is the reasonable, responsible, mature and smart way to do it. I will vote against any candidate who promises to shift the debt of the irresponsible folks over to the responsible ones. The only crisis we have is people promising to pay back money they borrowed and then whining that they can\u2019t pay it back.",

      "text": "Part of my problem is \"expected family contribution or EFC\", the Government likes to assume that your parents will contribute a certain percentage of their net worth for your schooling. The problem is, if your parents are relatively wealthy (mine have 2 houses, worth over $1 million combined and my Dad makes a healthy pension and retired at 52) yet they refuse to help fund your education (thanks to my Mom), than your screwed. I only received about 3k in Pell Grants from the Govt. due to good grades and EFC. So I had to come up with the rest of the ~$15000 for the fall semester myself. I work full time in retail but have nowhere near that amount saved up. So I had to take out a loan, got about $8k subsidized from the govt. $5k unsub, and had to take out $3k from private loan lenders.\n\nGuys, if you do need a loan. Fill out FAFSA yearly and get what you can from grants first (dont need to be paid back), than get as much subsidized federal as you can, than unsubsidized, and only take out private loans as a last resort (almost always have higher interest rates)",

To them, you're a \"rich kid\" and they don't want taxes to help \"rich kids\".\n\nThe most feasible solution is to make it easier to become an independent at a younger age (like age 20). If you can prove your own income and your own sustainability from the time you graduate high school to the time you're 20 years old, then it's fair to bring the EFC down to zero. Even if your parents are multi-billionaires, that kid should be considered independent if he can prove it.",

If you not trying to reason with your parents I don't give a shit. There a reason why the government is not going to paid for every kid that has wealthy parents.

Private loans know that this is a fairly safe \"investment\" since student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, so getting enough loans for tuition is usually not an issue.\n\nThe student debt crisis is a side effect of reduced public funding on higher learning.",

I can't speak about the student debt issues the country is having because it genuinely doesn't affect me, however, I know that the reason the education's so much more expensive is because it so much better. All of my friends back in Norway who're studying at Norwegian or European universities (studying in the same field that I am) have such vague and incomplete understandings of their majors. When we talked about it they admitted that the university is not as good as American ones, that they should have gone to the US, and that the only reason they won't transfer is because it's cheaper where they are. \n\nI think that's the same reason there is a student debt issue. American educators know how much their teaching is worth and they charge for it. People desperately desire that quality (because there are much cheaper options) so they take a loan out if they can't afford it and don't get enough scholarships or financial aid.\n\nI don't want to offend anyone but that's the understanding I have from my own experiences and the experiences of friends.",

Couple that with a few recessions and a labor market that relies more and more on knowledge rather than trade, and you have a recipe for increased tuition. \n\n2) the increase in for-profit colleges and their lack of oversight. Federal policy shifts allowed for profit \u201ccolleges\u201d to receive federal money with no oversight in how it was spent. Students apply, the for profit college pockets the cash, the degrees mean nothing, the college folds, and students are $200,000 in debt with no degree and no job. Loans from for profit colleges are a big part of the current national outstanding debt numbers. \n\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not a policy shift: \n\n3) student loan interest rates: students loans are unsecured debt (not tied to a house or care that can be repossessed) and as such interest rates are way higher than other types of debt. This means many people are unable to make any meaningful payments towards their principal debt, owning money forever, even as they make large payments. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s a perfect storm. Couple this with a lack of financial literacy, shady and sometimes illegal practices of lending companies, and the Great Recession of 08 and you can see how bad the situation is and how it got there.",

Lots of folks go out, go to fancy college when a less fancy will do, live the college life, and then, after it all, not getting that 300k first job start thinking, fuck them, im not paying that shit back?\n\nThat said, In my opinion, the issue was the ease by which money can be borrowed for school have contributed greatly by having more money, which the schools are happy to accept. They get bigger, the faculty expands and layers deeper, and the administration more expensive. They must provide a greater college experience to attract the money, and on it goes. \n\nEconomics and government intervention helping make that loan more available are a big part of the issue",

          "text": "Thank you for bringing up Reagan, because first and foremost, the shift from public funding to individual funding (i.e. tuition) is one of the biggest factors. Reagan did it under the premise that individuals benefit individually from a college education, so they should bear part of the costs. What Reagan (and subsequent administrations) totally failed to recognize were some of the larger societal impacts that actually may be more important than increasing an individual's ROI. For example, people with a college education tend to be healthier (and have health care), tend to have fewer children (and as such, less strain on social safety nets like welfare), tend to be more civically active, and of course, tend to create many jobs. And back then, Pell Grants could cover most or all of a college tuition. Now they don't even cover half.\n\nReagan's argument of shifting costs to the individual basically gave states the permission to start slashing funding further and further and further, increasing the reliance on loans. Some states have such small contributions to their state university system that there is really no practical difference to how they are operating (financially) to a private school. Louisiana State University is one example. The University of New Hampshire is another.\n\nNow take that and combine it with this (which a lot of people overlook).\n\nCosts in higher education were bound to go up faster than inflation because of something called [Baumol's cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease), which is a theory that industries largely based around labor-intensive sectors (education and healthcare are two of the biggest ones), that technological innovations won't keep up with salaries in reducing costs. It's very difficult to automate education and healthcare vs. manufacturing and farming for example. So college costs were always going to increase. Without stable funding, like from state and federal governments (remember: Pell Grants lost efficacy over time), college tuitions had to skyrocket. For some, enrollments are the only way to stay solvent, so they began building more and more amenities (frills so to speak), to woo more students to come. Of course, these came at a price, so tuition would go up even more.\n\nFor all of the reasons about the increasing costs of college, so much of it ultimately traces back to the Reagan's administration beginning to remove the government involvement and increase reliance on individuals taking out loans because they would be the primary beneficiary of the college education (according to them). There are other reasons besides this, but his actions are the cataclysmic event that really started the rapid rise. \n\nAnd now you wonder why the GOP is so focused on defunding public education - because they don't see education as a societal benefit. They see it as an individual benefit. Why pay to educate someone else if I don't benefit? Except this attitude ultimately (and perhaps conveniently) forgets the societal reasons why education is so important. And here we are today, in 2019, and nothing looks like it is getting better.",

If you work for the government or any non-for-profit, you only have to make 120 income-contingent payments and the rest of your loans are forgiven. It didn't start until around 2010 and I didn't know about it for about two years. I have paid 10's of thousands of dollars in student loans since 2001 (including LOTS of interest). I am in year 8 of the 10 PSLF program years and CANNOT wait until I hit my 120th payment. The income-contingent part sucks because they take a significant % of your income and do NOT adjust for your local cost of living. I like in NYC and pay lots because I make more but my rent is crazy. So, I'm still feeling it. But, I'm not complaining. I calculated everything and I am still saving money by using the program versus paying a less severe monthly student loan payment over the long haul.",

I'm not against the idea of higher education needing a loan and being somewhat personally paid but the amounts in US are just crazy that I don't think it can be justified.\n\nHere in Finland you can get a government backed student loan for living expenses if you want but it really is just a few thousand euroes max and the interest is minimal, plus the government reduces the debt if you graduate on time. Most people won't go to university and a lot of just get the 3 year degree. I'd argue that higher education is a public good because the need for educated professionals just keeps growing and growing.\n\nEverything costs something so paying education and health care through taxes makes sense. Right now America seems to an outsider a place where you can be comfortable only if you are so well off that you don't need to worry about health care or education and that level just seems to get higher and higher. That's pretty scary.",

              "text": "That\u2019s very true. The OP posted a solid comment, but he or she still advocates for *increasing* the availability and ease of obtaining student loans and pushing even more people towards higher education, which baffles me. A major part of the problem is that colleges are taking advantage of the ease of availability of student loans, plus the fact they can\u2019t be discharged through bankruptcy.\n\nIn essence, because of the easy availability of federal tuition dollars, students\u2019 inability to ever discharge their loans, and a popular expectation that you *need* to go to college at all costs, even to study a non-marketable field, colleges are only encouraged to raise tuition as there are few ramifications on demand for doing so \u2014 the loans will still be made, prices are going up across the board, demand won\u2019t really change as students are willing (or think they must) go to college and pay them, and there\u2019s no way to get out of paying them... so why would a college not increase prices?\n\nAmong other things, this has helped create massive bloat and unprecedented administrative bureaucracy, as colleges can get away with charging what they like while students are forced to foot the bill. Students lose and colleges win, even and especially with unprofitable programs with few job prospects (think some of those fringe humanities degrees) that wouldn\u2019t survive if students\u2019 tuition loans didn\u2019t have to fund them.  I don\u2019t foresee this changing until this easy lending and, really, exploitation of borrowers is reduced, the perceived need for college in the public mind is reduced, and colleges are subsequently forced by the market to reconsider their policies. You can\u2019t say *more* predatory lending sponsored by the taxpayer and *more* degrees with bad job prospects (and thus, a bad financial future and ultimately debt trap for their holders) will fix the problem.",
