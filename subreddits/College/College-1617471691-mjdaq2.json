I hate how our system\u2019s set up. Like just school isn\u2019t enough bc you also have to be the president of a club and do research and volunteer etc etc. I\u2019m fucking TIRED. I went into premed bc I wanted to be a doctor not because I wanted to be a president. It seems like the hurdles towards getting a decent job just get bigger and bigger. Now you basically have to cure cancer to get into med school. I hate this fucking education system and the job system which requires you to have 10 yrs of experience for an entry level job. It doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that we\u2019re HUMAN BEINGS. Doesn\u2019t the quality of our lives matter? Is it all just about work and making money for these stupid corporations?",

      "text": "Well, I am a medical student in Germany and we have a few American nationals here. It is fairly doable to get into med school here as an American college student pre college graduation and I recommend you get yourself informed about it unless studying abroad is a total no no for you. Bonus: There's no tuition fee, only 600 Euros per year. You can do the Usmle steps as a German medical students which will qualify you to work as a physician in the USA and many other countries. And best of all, barely anyone gives a goddamn eff whether you've been in any club at all. You are practically guaranteed a job here after graduation, and only a select few competitive fields look at your grades and final exam grade (Orthopedics is only competitive in university hospitals, \"normal\" hospitals employ whoever they can. You sometimes need to decline job offers for entry level jobs because you got one before. Same is true for fields belonging to Internal Medicine and Visceral surgery).\n\nVisa stuff is doable too. All my med schoom friends from other countries say it was the right decision to move to Germany for studying. I can only recommend it. So yeah, if it sucks too bad over there, really feel free to try it here.\n\nLiving costs average at around 1000 Euros per month  depending on a lot of factors. If you live and study in a smaller city, your whole life can be livable with less than 10000 Euros per month. Consider applying for a dorm room many semesters ahead in the cities that may come into question. Those are way cheaper than a normal appartement or shared rooms in an appartment. Although international students get dorm rooms way easier, it can't hurt to apply early. It is almost always free to apply and it is very normal here to apply for housing many months before you even get admitted into (or have even applied for) a university.\n\nAbout the lectures and everything, sure there are some few lectures in English but most are in German. You can get almost any literature in German. Luckily, German and English are very similar and it is easy to learn one or the other language when you already speak one. We often use English study materials too. Simply because of abundance and ease of understanding.",

Of course that's not per month (unless you shower in Fiji water and make sofas out of gucci bags) but per year! Duolingo sounds like a good start. And keep in mind that in many circumstances it is easier to get into German med schools before you got your college degree. It might be a bit different for international students, but people who have a German Bachelors Degree have an extreeemely hard time getting into med schools even if the high school grades were awesome (we don't have college / pre med here. You mostly join med school after high school or another non-university education job like nursing. Joining med school after graduating other studies is a pain in the ass and often fails (\"Zweitstudiengangsquote\"). That is for sure like that if your first studies were in a German or other EU country university, I'm not sure about extraeuropean graduates).",

You can guide us but all the work falls on the student ,and of course you as a teacher work hard as well difference is your making money probably not enough if you can actually guarantee a student will learn new data from your class or a skill. All the work falls on the student not to mention security work exercise etc. Probably some details ive missed i dont want to belittle any teacher ,but you know the system doesn't work othwrwise i wouldn't see the complaints of students on this forum feeling depressed hating school etc. Its not the teachers fault either education is hard to teach ,and engaging a student to enjoy material isnt easy. everyone knows we need a new school system for the future of humanity it may need to private institutions with a community of teachers thatbare experts in their fields ,and want to make a difference in the world \ud83c\udf0e the world get better if we are all educated to thenhighest degree possible to make a real difference in the real world \ud83c\udf0e.

These were values my family members look up to and want ME to become. I wasn\u2019t living LIFE for myself, I was living life because I want to achieve all these \u201cgreat\u201d things so family members can finally approve me. (Oh I thought...) \n\nWell growing up in a physical,emotional, and mentally abusive household, I didn\u2019t know better. It wasn\u2019t until I moved out that I started to find myself. To live life on my own terms etc.\n\nOh and trust me. Money can give you stability, and a certain amount of happiness for sure. However you don\u2019t need to aim to be filthy rich. When you are actually depressed, no amount of money can actually ease the pain. I never have to worry about money growing up, however I was still extremely miserable due to a dysfunctional family dynamic. You don\u2019t need outrageous luxuries to live a quality life. Just having the freedom to purchase the necessities/sometimes a bit of extra here and there is what you can aim for. \n\nIt will be a whole different story if you want to become a medical personnel because you want to help people. But just to keep this in mind, you still can help other people without being a doctor. \n\nSide note: Doctors tend to see people that are already super ill. The patient will be looking for treatment, not a way to prevent bad illnesses happening in life. Think about this, will you go and visit your doctor if you are in great health?  \nThis is why I decided to dedicate my craft into helping people to improve on their day to day life quality (fitness, nutrition, and psychology). I used to want to be a doctor just so I can help the sick, however I realized there are much more ways to contribute",

They were then forced to apply to work in a lot of entry level jobs, and a lot of companies would require this to weed out newgrads and prioritize people with experience. It just never really fully went back because as it turns out, industry liked paying more qualified people less money. \n\nAlso, everything is getting too saturated. We have almost *too many* students/graduates with good qualifications, which raises the expectations for those who get selected. It doesn't exactly help that a lot of the people pursuing these programs/jobs/etc are going after the best ones (reasonably so) which have very high requirements to make it in. \n\nHonestly, you're right for feeling this way. This shit sucks. The pandemic doesn't help because it's very hard to build resume skills and such when mentally this pandemic is taking a toll on all of us, and distance learning is just not for most people. If I weren't as far in my program as I am, I would have dropped out until the pandemic is over tbh.",

Getting professional help for my depression has really helped me to improve my outlook and the amount of energy that I have to put into the whole process.\n\nSecond, I think it might be helpful to explore why you want to be a doctor. Figure out where your motivation is and use that as the source of your action. Look at Masters and PhD program requirements and figure out how much you need to do to get yourself there. \n\nI'm in the last semester of my senior year and my major requires we attend weekly seminars with staff from other universities. There's been a good deal of discussion about what schools are looking for in masters and PhD students, particularly with the difficulties of COVID keeping us off campus, and what I am hearing programs say is that they are looking for students with with drive and excitement as much as grades and experience.\n\nFind what drives you.",

Ever since I sat down and prioritized my mental health and what I want for life I decided to go pre-pa. It might be something to look into OP. \n\nI would also advise you to start thinking about ehat you want for yourself in life even if you don't meet these goals and what would still make you happy. Don't forget to take care of yourself first and remember even if you aren't a doctor you still kicked ass. Its okay not to become a doctor and your mental health and happiness are first priority. Just remember at the end of the day life is about LIVING don't slave away and miss everything because your so focused on the future. If you need to take a break take a break it will be okay I promise you it will be.",

I was sick and tired of the never ending abuse that students have to go through to become doctors, and wasn\u2019t looking forward to 4 more years of constant stress to hopefully match to your desired residency. I was terrified of the prospect of not matching, or being forced into a field I didn\u2019t want to go into. Not to mention spending 6-10 years constantly feeling worked to the bone before even making a legitimate paycheck. I am now in my first year of PA school and couldn\u2019t be happier. My program is associated with a med school and we share professors, anatomy lab, etc. After 15 continuous months of classroom work, I\u2019ll enter a year of clinical rotations and then be able to sit for boards and choose any specialty I want to go into. I will start earning what I am worth the minute I start working, and obviously get raises as I become more experienced. Meanwhile my peers will still be in medical school, or have just graduated and will be looking at an insane amount of loans and be working for essentially minimum wage during residency. It\u2019s no surprise becoming a PA was listed as the top profession by USNWR.",
