It is fairly doable to get into med school here as an American college student pre college graduation and I recommend you get yourself informed about it unless studying abroad is a total no no for you. Bonus: There's no tuition fee, only 600 Euros per year. You can do the Usmle steps as a German medical students which will qualify you to work as a physician in the USA and many other countries. And best of all, barely anyone gives a goddamn eff whether you've been in any club at all. You are practically guaranteed a job here after graduation, and only a select few competitive fields look at your grades and final exam grade (Orthopedics is only competitive in university hospitals, \"normal\" hospitals employ whoever they can. You sometimes need to decline job offers for entry level jobs because you got one before. Same is true for fields belonging to Internal Medicine and Visceral surgery).\n\nVisa stuff is doable too. All my med schoom friends from other countries say it was the right decision to move to Germany for studying. I can only recommend it. So yeah, if it sucks too bad over there, really feel free to try it here.\n\nLiving costs average at around 1000 Euros per month  depending on a lot of factors. If you live and study in a smaller city, your whole life can be livable with less than 10000 Euros per month. Consider applying for a dorm room many semesters ahead in the cities that may come into question. Those are way cheaper than a normal appartement or shared rooms in an appartment. Although international students get dorm rooms way easier, it can't hurt to apply early. It is almost always free to apply and it is very normal here to apply for housing many months before you even get admitted into (or have even applied for) a university.\n\nAbout the lectures and everything, sure there are some few lectures in English but most are in German. You can get almost any literature in German. Luckily, German and English are very similar and it is easy to learn one or the other language when you already speak one. We often use English study materials too.
