Remember that you are paying to be there. The class is providing you a service. You responsibility to others there is only to be respectful. If you are quiet when you are moving in and out of the class, then you're doing nothing wrong. Outside of that, your only priority is too learn as much as you can. If you need to leave to regain your composure, then that's ok. Adhd people learn so differently from neurotypical people that it's pointless to compare yourself to them. For example. My math profs always post the class notes. I have bad handwriting and can't both copy down the notes and understand them at the same time. What do I do? I don't take notes. They're posted, and I use class time to absorb the content. I'm one of a very few people that don't take notes, but again, you have to prioritize your own learning. Class time is NOT about fitting in and feeling like you're doing something wrong if you're not doing the same as everyone else.", "author": "Vlistorito", "created": 1632764876, "upvotes": 3}, "hehcqz9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwjhq4/advice_on_sitting_through_classes/hehcqz9/", "text": "Xanax?", "author": "xnnyboi", "created": 1632756568, "upvotes": 0}}}
