  "text": "This might sound like I am procrastinating but I am not joking when I say my computers class has three projects, three homework assignments, and three tests all due next week.  The homework assignments all take like 2 hours each, the projects 2 hours, and the tests about an hour each as well. So, I am dedicating an entire day to do them. \n\nNow I was having an issue accessing Canvas because the school is migrating the website and our home internet has been spotty (but hey we have only two ISP's in the area and both suck) and I can't exactly pop over to campus because its a 45-minute drive each way.",

              "text": "That doesn\u2019t make a difference as far as managing your workload is concerned. The response is likely to be that you should reduce your course load if you cannot handle the combined workload of the courses. It sucks, but everyone else has a lot of stuff on their plate, too, and it\u2019s unfair to grant an extension due to another course\u2019s regular workload. You can still try to ask, but be prepared to be told \u201cno\u201d if you get a response at all.\n\nGood luck!",

If I were you, if this computer class was not absolutely necessary for your major, I would drop the class if you're able. I had a Geography class very similar. I had to read 25+ page chapters each week, learn the keywords, take quizzes with only 20 minutes to do them, study maps, watch the video lectures, participate in discussions, and do projects. It was insane. And the professor didn't even offer to help me before reporting my failing grade to admissions. If you have a good professor, I am sure there is something they can do. A good professor is in it to help students learn and succeed.",
