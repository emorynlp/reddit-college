As of right now, my school plans on reopening in early September for in-person classes, with two weeks of online classes after Thanksgiving. Social-distancing will be in effect, which means most social gatherings and clubs (ie. theatre) will not occur. I'm scared that our school is going to go virtual mid-semester, meaning I will be paying for sub-par online classes. I'm equally scared about my social life. I'm usually a pretty reserved person.  I was hoping the social events at college would give me a push into new friendships. My school isn't even giving us roommates. I don't want to be so secluded that my already crappy mental health takes another plunge. That being said, I'm not sure if staying at home will be better or worse. I know all I will do is spend time with my family and work- I've even been offered a position as a supervisor at my job, as long as I'm still at home. My parents think that, since so many people are taking a gap year this year, I will have an advantage in the job market after college. This is probably true, but I also think it would be a bad idea to pay for an education that is not the experience I would otherwise have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what to do.

Also it's really hard to pay attention for more than an hour to online videos and lectures. I did 4 classes last term and had to drop one. It was easy but jesus christ it felt like I did nothing but sit infront of my computer 24/7. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I say to take your non-degree classes because the quality of these classes (in my experience) has been lower than in-person classes. You simply don't get as much out of them as you do as in-person classes. This is totally fine for the bullshit extra stuff the college makes you take that has nothing to do with your degree. But for degree related classes, you're really going to benefit in your upper division courses if you get everything you can out of your lower division courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of the classes has been borderline jokes. For an archaeology class we're suppose to do field work but because of the lockdown we just had to visit a website. For a communications class a classmate told me how instead of a speech they just had to record themselves giving the speech. For an architecture class we're suppose to go on field trips but because of the lockdown we just had to go out and drive by the building.

As a matter of fact, you might actually struggle, because no one wants to be the first to take a chance on a 19 year old grad. Thus, take advantage of any real opportunity you have TO move forward, but also use your advantage to be more thorough with your education. \n\nI took a year and a half gap period- I moved out, became financially independent, traveled a lot, learned a language, started a nonprofit in my field (that I discovered my love for in my gap year), got experience in other fields, and, at the end of it, was excited to go back to school - because I had an extremely clear vision of what it is I needed to learn, and went back to university with incredible force that had lasted me to my accelerated graduate degree. Now I read books and study my coursework and article citations like mad, so COVID was, as horrible as it is to say, fantastic timing for me to just focus on my studies.\n\nIs it possible for you to do a semester or two and then take a gap year, when there\u2019s more things open?\n\nI\u2019m curious - why are you already thinking about being an asset in the job market? If anything in the world was possible, and success was guaranteed, would this track your looking at be the one you take?\n\nOne thing if you take a gap year; make sure you are the type of person to actually go back.

TBH despite all the big plans I expect *all* colleges will end up going virtual again if they are allowed to open residence halls and face-to-face classes at all.

That will reduce costs by about $8K/semester (room and board) if they open the campus; if they do *not* open the campus I anticipate a 15-20% tuition cut as well.  Students should note, however, two things: 1) faculty have been working hard this summer to make online classes better than they were this spring, and 2) teaching online costs *more* than teaching regular classes. Based on my own experience (I'm a department chair and am on the board of trustees of my school) the spring online mess took 2-3x the hours for each class, additional tech, additional support, etc. So if some schools do not cut tuition for online instruction that is why.\n\nIf one of my kids was scheduled to start college this fall I'd 100% tell them not to do it. College will be there in another year.

Don't just sit in the basement.
