  "text": "Basically the title. My last final is on Dec 11 (i know a Saturday :/ ) and according to my academic calendar  i go back jan 10th. This seemed really early but then i remembered last year we got an extra week of winter break because colleges didn't want ppl traveling for spring break. Just wanted to know what everyone else's is looking like lol",
