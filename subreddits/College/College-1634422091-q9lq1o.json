  "text": "so currently I am a food science major at my university and they also have a minor for dairy science. dairy science was one of my top choices when applying and i did want to double major, except i wouldve had to take around 28 extra credits to get the double major. with food science, i am only 2 classes away from getting a minor in chemistry as well so i decided to do that. however, i dont have the time to double major in food science and dairy science and minor in chem. its either double minor and one major or double major only. any thoughts?",

      "text": "What do you want to do after college? If working in the dairy industry is something you're definitely interested it, then I would double major in dairy science and drop the chemistry minor. \n\nIt's worthwhile to check out some real job postings for entry-level food science jobs, and see what employers are looking for. If the jobs that are most appealing to you seem to involve a lot of chemistry, then the double minor might make more sense.",

Which option do you think will benefit you the most? Talk to your friends, family, and school advisors about the pros and cons of each option. They can\u2019t choose for you, but talking about it over and over with different people can help you figure out the answer for yourself.",
