  "text": "In my psych 101 class 80% of our grade is simply based on 3 exams!!! What?! I just got my first exam score back and I got a 70%, I\u2019m freaking out a little bit. Ive never been a good test taker even if I do understand the material (I studied and understood the material). Im just not good at taking exams. Classes like these are what\u2019s going to kill my gpa. How can I overcome this? (I would like to get at least a B in the course)",
