  "text": "Like the title says, my roommate has tested positive for the flu. I\u2019ve been pretty lucky to not get many of the colds she\u2019s gotten, but the last time she had something nasty, it took two weeks for me to get it (she had it for at least a month and it was pretty severe, mine was only about a week and milder). Unfortunately I\u2019m seeing my family and long distance bf in two weeks for thanksgiving and getting a flu shot Saturday. I\u2019m wearing a mask and sanitizing my hands in my dorm. Is there anything else/things that you all recommend for trying to keep off the virus as long as I can?",

      "text": "I am not a medical doctor, so you should probably ask your medical doctor for guidance.\n\nIMO, the flu shot won't do much for you. You have already been exposed to the virus and the vaccine is very likely a different strain than the virus your roommate has.\n\nThe general steps you can take are the same for most viruses. Keep your distance from the infected person. Sanitize surfaces before touching them. Wash your hands often. Avoid touching your face. Wear an N-95 mask and do not reuse masks. Take Zinc, Vitamin D, and Vitamin C to help boost your immune system.",
