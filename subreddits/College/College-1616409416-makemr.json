  "text": "After an anxiety-driven 5 years, constant tears and stress from university, I am glad to say I'M FINALLY GRADUATING!!!!!!!! it has been the longest, most painful ride of my life and I hated almost every fucking second of it but I'm finally graduating. I took 1 year off to do an internship and realised I am not cut out for a corporate job so I am not even going to apply to companies, instead I'm going to do something that I like (not very well-paying) but at least it's something I like.  PEACE OUT",

Majoring in international relations & possibly going to teach abroad for a year after graduating if I hear back about any acceptances for a few positions I\u2019ve applied to! then I\u2019ll come back home and possibly work for educational nonprofits (bc I\u2019m also NOT about the corporate life) and grad school will likely be in my future. I loved college pre-covid but this past year has been hell. Thankfully I\u2019ve had family & friends to support me along the way. Again, congrats \ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88",

I took 1 year off to do an internship and realised I am not cut out for a corporate job so I am not even going to apply to companies, instead I'm going to do something that I like (not very well-paying) but at least it's something I like. PEACE OUT \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni relate to this so hard but still have a year left and am failing 2 classes and withdraw from another. you;re soooo lucky.",

I need legit life advice and you seem like a supportive person. lol. ive been feeling really down lately. here's my issue. im struggling with severe health anxiety, covid only made it worse, severe lonliness and cabin fever, havent really left my small apartment in a year, and severe stress from really mean professors who give me tons of work and not even getting good grades. im dealing with extreme social isolation and my therapist doesnt even respond to my emails. also i have actual health issues which makes my anxiety even worse. no one even really responds to me on reddit. i honestly dont know what to do. im not trying to make it all about me i know lots of people are having a tough time right now but i genuinely dont know what to do, my life sucks right now. i had to drop a class because i was failing it, wasted thousands of dollars, and im probably failing 2 others because of the insane workload. and i dont even have money for a psychiatrist they are 200 dollars without health insurance.",

              "text": "Hey! \n\nI'm sorry that you've ended up in the situation you're in. It sounds to me like things are building up around you faster than you're able to knock them down - that can be super draining. I am glad you reached out. Even when it seems as if there is no one listening, I promise there are people who care about you. \n\nNot to be too cliche, but I totally understand where you are coming from. I failed all of my classes last semester, and I also struggle with physical and mental illnesses that have made this pandemic especially hard. \n\nI know that it is overwhelming. Just because others are having a tough time doesn't mean you aren't too. Here are a few things that have helped me (I am in no way an expert, but just sharing some sunshine from my corner of the world):\n\n* Break things up into small tasks: if there is a long list of things you need to do, break them in to VERY small pieces. For example, if you need to clean your room because it has turned into a place that adds to your stress, then start by putting all of your dirty clothes on a pile, or gathering up dishes left in your room. Even if you just end up gathering them and not washing them, you have accomplished something!\n* There are websites that host things called focus rooms which are zoom calls for people to study/just exist on. Some have audio enabled, and others do not. These help to take some of the pressure off of you having to motivate yourself - they help others to hold you accountable.\n* Know that there is not one \"right\" way to complete college. I just changed my major after failing a semester and I changed my job. Changing my major the year before I'm due to graduate was a scary thing to do, but I am now in a program that supports me and that I enjoy.\n\nMost importantly, though, know that you are not alone in this. Even if you feel that it is just little old me from small-town Wisconsin backing you up, know that you do not have to run this race alone. You don't have to run it at all. You can jog, walk, crawl, or do somersaults down the path if you want, I know it gets better.  Stay strong, you magnificent human being :)",
