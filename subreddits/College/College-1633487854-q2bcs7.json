  "text": "so i\u2019m 19 and a sophomore and just started college like a month and half ago. this is my first time on campus bc i was online for all of last year making it really difficult to socialize. i really want a boyfriend to do things with and be with but i\u2019m really scared to put myself out there. how do i go about getting guys to notice me? especially in college? my last boyfriend i was dating for a year before covid happened and he ended up cheating on me and said it was because he didn\u2019t like the way i looked anymore. so that was a real blow to my barely there confidence and now i can\u2019t stop thinking that\u2019s what every guy sees. anybody that can help please help :)",

      "text": "I\u2019m gonna give you the answer you don\u2019t wanna hear, and that\u2019s to not look for a boyfriend. Whenever people specifically seek out a partner they tend to put on blinders and get with someone who they don\u2019t work with. Additionally, getting a partner will only mask some of the things that you\u2019re insecure about, it won\u2019t be a fix. You\u2019ve gotta at least patch yourself up and be in a stable condition before a partner can add to you and help you grow. Whenever you\u2019re able to do that, boys will take notice of you, and you\u2019ll be capable of a great and healthy relationship. Best of luck to you!!!",

      "text": "What a horrible thing to say. Men can be such hoes at times, but not all of them are like that. Normally, I find at times like these people have told me to \"focus on myself\" and the right person will come along. For you, I think you should do a hard refresh on your mindset. I'll be honest, I can't really imagine how much it must've hurt when you were treated like that, and it's hard to not let it get to you. But you seem strong, and you should also find confidence within yourself to show off. Something I've learned is that there are so many aspects of life and relationships that we can't control. We can, however, control our responses to situations like these. So respond in a way that puts you in the best light. Go out there and try to socialize, and you'll find yourself on a path you had no idea you could travel down this time last year.\n\nHope this helps and lol thx for listening to my TED talk, but also if you do need a friend, feel free to dm! I'm usually pretty quick to respond.\n\nAlso, last note. Guys will only see what you show them. I also realized that in the past I personally haven't come off as confident, but instead I've looked intimidating. I don't want this, so I've been working on that. For you, definitely try to find anything that causes you to have a positive outlook on things, and showcase your confidence like a boss!",

      "text": "As someone who is a non-traditional college student because I did college, over 6 years of military, some life, and then back to college, I have been around the experience block. I got married for the first time at 23 when I was in the military, and am now married again many years later. My advice to you, speaking generally because there are always exceptions, is that guys in your current age range are awful. Late teens and early 20s guys are the equivalent of 13-15 year old girls, only with more sex and alcohol. They think they are God's gift to the universe, yet don't realize how stupid they look to everyone else. My point is that I wouldn't be seeking out a relationship. I would have fun and get it out of your system. The chances of having your self-esteem further crushed by a douche canoe are at their highest odds at this stage, so just try to get through it and have as much fun as you can. Save the serious relationships for when they grow up a little, think 24-25ish, because it makes a HUGE difference.",
