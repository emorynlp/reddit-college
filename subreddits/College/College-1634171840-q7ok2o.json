  "text": "Currently I\u2019m a sophomore in college with a 3.9GPA. In the future I aspire to be an internal medicine doctor or an anesthesiologist which means i have a lot of work to do. This semester I\u2019m taking 7 classes, one of which is a lab, so I have a pretty loaded schedule, but one of my classes is simply terrible. I currently have a 78.6 in it and from my current perspective it seems to be completely possible that I end up with a C. It is a class worth 3 credits. Now with this information noted, I am wondering if any of you fellow redditors could give me some advice and perhaps a outlook on the future if I did end up getting a C in this class; specifically referencing acceptance to Med-school and how it might affect my GPA.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who shared their insight :)",
