One of the group members wrote a significant portion of the report on his own while we did other work. He did it surprisingly quickly which made me feel a little uneasy but hey I don\u2019t know how much free time he has. Earlier today I got a feeling like I should make sure he isn\u2019t copying from someone else so that we won\u2019t get in trouble. \n\nHe had copied several paragraphs of the abstract from a study by MIT and just threw it in as our first 2 pages. Needless to say I\u2019m fucking mad and we\u2019re basically doing all his shit over again. We can\u2019t even trust any of the work he\u2019s done so far because of this so we\u2019ve removed him from the groupchat and starting all of his tasks from scratch.

We had a guy in our group that would turn up to group meetings but would literally just sit there on his phone and not say *a word* (I'm not exaggerating, he was an international student and wouldn't say anything). We'd try talking to him and he'd respond with either \"Yes\" or \"No\". He made no attempt to work with us, despite all of our attempts we made to include him.\n\nDay before the group presentation and we're updating our presentation slides on google drive, he spams the group chat in all-caps with shit like \"WHAT AM I READING OUT TOMORROW? WHAT SLIDES CAN I HAVE? WHEN AM I GOING TO SPEAK?\". He frantically spams for the entire evening and we all ignore him (I felt kind of bad, but he did nothing all year and expected us to do his work for him). Day of the presentation comes and he turns up (I don't know why) with some crap that doesn't make sense or isn't even relevant to our presentation, which was all of course copied off wikipedia. The slides he added last minute made no sense at all. He came, spoke nervously, looked like an idiot, spewed shit and looked like a total embarrassment in front of the entire class. \n\nWe informed our tutor every seminar of our progress as a group, including this particular member's lack of contribution/group work. Our tutor said that he'd deduct marks from him so we didn't really think twice about any of it. \n\nMonth later he released the marks online and we all got the same mark, including the guy that did nothing. I learnt that whatever happens at University, sometimes you have to take things into your own hands and act independently. I regret not confronting him or my seminar tutor for letting this guy breeze by on our hard-work. Thinking back it makes me so angry... (for the record the guy dropped out after his first year, to no surprise).
