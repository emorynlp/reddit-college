  "text": "I don\u2019t get along with my 3 roommates. We used to all get along and be friends but they all stopped inviting me to stuff and now don\u2019t talk to me at all. No idea why they\u2019re mad but they\u2019ve just done some passive aggressive, petty things to me and I can\u2019t handle it anymore. Living with them has caused me so much anxiety I hate not feeling welcome in my own place. I usually stay most nights at my boyfriend\u2019s house. I\u2019ve never confronted them about it but it is very clear they don\u2019t care for me so I don\u2019t really care to try to make it work any more. I have decided I\u2019m going to move out and find a new place with people I actually get along with. I rarely see them and I\u2019m subleasing my room out to someone they don\u2019t know so they\u2019ll probably be mad about that. Should I tell them or just move all my stuff out during holiday break?? I\u2019d rather do that but feel like it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the new roommate moving into my room. if I do tell them beforehand how should I go about doing that?",
