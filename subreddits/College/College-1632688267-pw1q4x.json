I have a very good GPA but this course he docked points on my first assignment even though I followed the rubric to a tee and then he did not leave an explanation for why. I thought okay if he does it next week on the similar type of assignment I will ask him for clarification. Then we had an open book test that had a lot of questions and was timed, it felt like half the questions were not in the text or powerpoint notes (which he did not create they came with the textbook) and there were questions namely pointless statistics that could not be found. You could scour everywhere only to not find them. Or things like 'In 2012, what was the average life expectancy of someone in the US\" the textbook or powerpoint notes does not provide anything regarding 2012 just a brief sentence saying the average life expectancy of a male in the us is 75 and female 79. see how his question is incorrect? So what I did was average the two numbers and give that answer which was wrong.\n\nIf you are giving your students open book tests with trick questions you as an instructor do not have the most important concepts that YOU want them to know. You students shouldnt need a textbook to pass an exam they should know these concepts well enough to answer on a test. He doesnt actually teach though not one lecture uploaded (its online), powerpoints arent his summation, just nothing he just makes trick questions and expects us to scour over it.\n\nSecondly, physical fitness is really just a collection of studies regarding the act of wellness or exercise. I do not think its importance is through a text book but rather actually working out the class should be structured around that. It is like taking a driving course but instead of actually driving you have to scour text books for facts that are irrelevant to YOU in driving. It is a shame and this instructor should really stick to only \"coaching\" because clearly that is where his interests are.", "author": "cute_diplomat", "created": 1632688267, "retrieved": 1632945961, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.17, "comments": {"hee47t6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw1q4x/physical_fitness_course_may_cause_me_to_get_b/hee47t6/", "text": "the professor is an academic leech. period. full stop. and i dont care due to professional reasons i would never tell him but someone whos passion is coaching should not also be botching science classes and 'offering' a class in which they dont teach or do any work (academic leech).", "author": "cute_diplomat", "created": 1632688825, "upvotes": -2}}}
