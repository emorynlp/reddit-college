  "title:": "If I just got a Misdemeanor Charge After Sending in my Applications, Will the Colleges I Applied to See The Charge?",
  "text": "I recently got a misdemeanor charge, and I'm worried it's going to jeopardize my chances of getting into college. So, I've already sent in my application to five schools, one for early decision and four for early action. I'm supposed to hear back for my early decision application on December 15th, so within a month from now. I just got this charge two nights ago. Will the colleges I applied to see this charge I got, or am I ok? I already sent the application, and before this, I've never had a charge of any kind. So the application I sent in says I have no criminal history. Also the charge was for marijuana possession. What do you think?",
