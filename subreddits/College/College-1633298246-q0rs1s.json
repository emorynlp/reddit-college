  "title:": "This is the first time I've taken a Loan and I'm terrified!!",
  "text": "I'm afraid that I will run out of money to live and that working will interefere with my studies. I am so happy that I do not have any outstanding bills and responsibilities. I only pay rent w/ utilities, my phone bill and groceries. I do not have a car, and I don't plan on getting one until I graduate (2023). \n\nI only taking 15 credits this semester, I'm having a hard time enjoying my life because homework has taken over my life, and I know that if I fail it's game over. I can't repay these loans with interest after 6 months.  So I am doing my best to make sure that I stay on top of my homework. \n\nThe issue is that I can't find time to work! I've calculated my cost of living on a monthly basis, and my free time is non-exisistant basically. I have no time to work!!! I don't want to reach for another loan!! And work study is not enough! 7.25 an hour is not enough! \n\nHow do I look for scholarships or a source of income? Should I just sacrifice my sleep and find some type of overnight shift?? I really don't want to work fast food anymore! That's why I'm in college!! I want a job that gives me experience that pertains to my degree! What do I do?? \n\nI will take constructive criticism and any tips/advice! Thanks!",
