  "text": "Delta covid cases are popping off in a lot of states. You also apparently have a 1/10 chance of still catching covid even if you\u2019re vaccinated. This is one nasty strain, and it shows no signs of stopping. Cases are rising in all 50 states, and the CDC has now recommended masks again.\n\nI\u2019m worried that we might get another online school year. I just graduated HS and I want to live life again. My senior year was completely ruined, and I don\u2019t want to miss out on my freshman year of college. Anyone else worried? I don\u2019t think they will do another lockdown, but I do think that the CDC might recommend to return schools to virtual learning and implement social restrictions.",

Small things like these make the quarantine bairable for me and while i realize I've missed a huge chance by having an entire year of school online, chance to meet new people and such, ive also strengthened  so many relationships and grown to find a huge understanding of myself that i just wouldn't take back.

At first it was hard to adjust but I was very glad I had some understanding teachers that helped with the whole process of being online. It wasn\u2019t bad more boring if anything I missed going to campus seeing all my friends. But the school work in general was not hard just had to spend some time every day working on it. Zoom classes can be boring and drag on, just make sure you go to them and apply yourself. You will realize you have a lot more time on your hands if you space out the work. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, be ready to have to adjust to online learning and that\u2019s about it! You will be good",

I'm about to begin my third year of college, so I have only had a semester and a half of traditional college (which I am very thankful for).  I am also starting my second semester of nursing school, where part of my learning comes from clinical experience. Last semester, our clinical experience was done through simulation on our computer. An absolute joke. We got our clinical placements yesterday, but I fear that as hospitals become full again, students won't be allowed, and understandably so. \n\nBut my school is in an area where vaccination rates are sub 30% and the vaccine is not required for attendance. Masks aren't either (as of now. I expect this to change). I can see no situation where we can safely go back to the way the school was in the Fall of 2019.  Maybe that's just me being pessimistic, but all the literature I've been reading seems to, unfortunately, support that fear.",

Compromising my education for the first year may have been fine as it's basically a blow-off year where I'm from (but I still missed out on the partying and trips away). I'd be seriously concerned about my future career prospects if the garbage quality of education from my first year were maintained though. I don't mind large classes (over 100 people) being online, but anything else seriously needs to be in-person, ESPECIALLY exams. I swear if I have to do an online exam again, I'd seriously freak out. \n\nI know myself too well know from the pandemic and how unmotivated and unfocused I am in online environments. I seriously don't know how anyone manages to be productive, maybe if you are dead certain of what you want to do in the future, but still, the lack of human beings really really wore me down and this is coming from someone who is an introvert. After all, no one can hear you scream if you're feeling depressed in that environment. \n\nI don't even think comutting is really a problem, I mean, if it is by bus, you can quite easily get work done during the commute. It actually really makes me happy as it forces myself to exercise and actually see sunshine. Going by car could be a pain though.",
