  "text": "Hey friends of Reddit,\n\nI\u2019m currently in Year 11 (12th grade for the American readers) my grades for maths, English and science are sitting at C grade. My GCSE\u2019s are obviously approaching. \n\nI\u2019m stuck at a crossroad for the next stage of my life - do I stay at my current school (anonymous for obvious reasons, however, this school is extremely recognised for it\u2019s game design syllabus and connections to the \u2018industry\u2019) and study Game Design a-level. My Game Design grade is about 7/8 (B+/A) grade.\n\nOr!!! Do I go to a new place to study my A-Levels and study Politics & Law? Something I am fairly self-educated in and have a deep interest in but not sure if i\u2019d be any good at studying and answering comprehension questions on it.\n\nWhat do I do?!\n\nThank you,\nT",
