  "text": "So my potential roommate posted on my college Facebook group pictures of her and her two friends stating that they were looking for one more roommate for next fall about a week ago. I was def interested so I commented on the post and told her that I messaged her. She never replied to my message on messenger but followed me on insta and then messaged me lol. We talked for a bit and then I asked if she was still looking for a roommate. She said yes but was currently not at the college and in different city, so she had to talk to her roommates first before confirming anything. I told her that it was alright of course, and to just let me know when she does have the chance to talk them. It\u2019s been exactly one week and she hasn\u2019t messaged me back. Her and her friends seem so fun and sweet and so I would absolutely love to be their roommate so I\u2019m really hoping she does eventually DM me back. Should I just message her and ask her whether she had the chance to talk to her roommates yet, or just wait and see. Just need some advice. :)",
