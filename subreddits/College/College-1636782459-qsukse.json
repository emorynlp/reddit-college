  "text": "November is a hard month for me. I'm tired. Projects are due and finals are coming up. It's a lot. I get overwhelmed. It's the weekend and all I can think about is school. I'm still trying to learn how to relax. I know there's other students that feel the same pressure. I've been doing this for 5 years and I almost can't believe how long it's been and it's crazy to think I've put in half a decade to see this through. Make sure to take a break and do you things. Take care of yourselves. Give yourselves rewards and break free from school every now and then. I admire your hard work and tenacity! Cheers to finishing another semester strong!",
