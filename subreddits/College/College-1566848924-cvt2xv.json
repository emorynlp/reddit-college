  "text": "Hello /r/college,\n\nMy father passed away last Friday and it has been really hard on me. On top of already suffering from PTSD, it's definitely a really difficult time for me to get through. My mother offered to sit in class with me as support. Not chatting or anything, but her being near is the only time that I feel comfort. It feels like the only way I'll be able to get through the first few weeks of the semester without withdrawing.\n\nIs it strange that I want this? The professors I have emailed so far seem to be fine with it. But I get the idea that people are probably going to look at me negatively.\n\nBest wishes.\n\n\nedit\n\nI appreciate all the feedback guys. I have already emailed all of the professors and got the go ahead. I just wanted to know what others thought about it. I'm a very anxious person.",

You shouldn't feel like you have to either come back now or withdraw if you aren't ready. Withdrawing is also fine if you need it.",

At first I felt like I was losing my chance to get out on my own in college and it was just going to be high school: the sequel, but honestly I was extremely happy to have them there during such a difficult time. There\u2019s nothin wrong with having your mom sit in, I also had my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) sit in on classes with me from time to time and it was nice having people I loved around since I was in a new city and school and didn\u2019t know many ppl yet. Don\u2019t worry about what other ppl think. A lot of ppl wouldn\u2019t want their mom in class with them but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to feel that way too, and it definitely shouldn\u2019t make you feel self conscious about how you do feel.\nUltimately, if it makes you comfortable then it will help you do better in school and that\u2019s all that matters. I recommend doing anything that helps you feel comfortable and let\u2019s you focus better as that will likely translate into better performance and that\u2019s the most important thing for you to worry about.\nSo don\u2019t sweat other ppl, as long as you aren\u2019t interfering in their work then you do you. Good luck : )",

People who understand will take the time to listen and will be caring and compassionate.  People who look down on it aren't people you should have in your life anyway.  Consider it a service they're doing for you to out themselves now as jerks who are best ignored.  \n2. I had a baby in college (non-trad student, was 28) and I breastfed him in class no problem.  Everyone has stuff going on in their lives and I'm glad your professors are accommodating.  Don't worry about what's \"strange\".  Guaranteed, no matter what you can come up with, someone's done something weirder.  I mean...I was showing boob in class.  That's pretty weird!  lol\n3. You're going through a hard time right now.  Be kind to yourself.  This will only be temporary.  Once you get used to your courses and schedule as the term gets going, you'll gain more confidence and won't need your mom there anymore.  It's hard to lose a parent, especially when you're young and just trying to strike it out on your own.  Grief is different for everyone.  Take your time and do what you need to do for yourself.",

I\u2019m proud of you though for still wanting to be in school and doing what you can to make things work. When my dad passed away, I jumped back into school as a way of coping and distracting myself. School could be a good way to take your mind off of things. About having your mom there, I would just say talk to your professors, as I\u2019m sure they will be okay with it. And contact you school\u2019s accessibility office about the PTSD and see if there are things they could do to help. If your school has a mental health center, I would seek that out too. They most likely have counseling or therapy you could attend.",

Dealing with separation anxiety was huge for me as well and I clung onto my mom (and still pretty much do 8 years later!) I just wanted to let you know it does get easier.  I know it\u2019s cliche but as someone who\u2019s gone through this, it\u2019s true.  The anxiety may linger but on a brighter side you start to view life in a whole new light.  Every opportunity is so exciting because you know the preciousness of life! And your relationships become stronger because you know how quick that can be stolen from you.  I do promise the pain will subside and you\u2019ll become such a loving and full of life person because of it.  It may seem morbid to look at the \u201cbright side\u201d but it\u2019s helped me a lot\ud83d\udc96",

Most people will 100% not notice or care that you have your mom with you. A few years ago, it was my freshman year, I was 16 (I skipped 11th and 12th grade so that\u2019s why I started early). During spring break, we ended up taking in a extended family\u2019s newborn due to some drug issues / unstable bio mom. Both of my parents worked full time, and I literally brought a newborn baby with me to every college class for 3 weeks (until the baby could start daycare) without anyone saying anything to me. Most people are there to learn or are so absorbed in their own lives/problems to notice things. But I like what some have suggested, maybe letting your professors know would be a good idea!",

That's normal and ok in the wake of a loss like yours. Keep the lines of communication open with faculty, use your Dean of Students if things get bad, keep going to counseling, and let your friends and family be there for you. You will pull through this.",

Everyone would notice immediately, including the professor (in the class I taught today we had 18 students and 19 chairs, so there wouldn't even be a place to sit). We also have a clear campus-wide policy that nobody who is not enrolled can be in the class, with exceptions made only for visiting prospective students. I'd be happy to talk with a student proposing this, but we'd almost certainly not allow it as it would be intrusive (for the other students) and creates potential issues with privacy, especially if the \"visitor\" is not vetted, enrolled, or otherwise on record.\n\nOP, I'm sorry for your loss and hope you are getting the support you need. Just make sure this will be allowed on your campus-- it would not on mine but we'd have other ways of providing support. It's also *fine* to take some time away under such circumstances-- I've had students lose parents and told them to take a couple of weeks if need be, we can always make that time up but they need to be with their family.",
