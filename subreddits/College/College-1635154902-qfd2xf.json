I would imagine an accounting degree being more useful in my personal life but I am happy with my decision in pursuing CS. Just because you have a piece of paper that says accounting or computer science doesn't mean you can't learn about things in other disciplines in your free time (especially if you'll find it useful in your day to day life.)\n\n\n\nAnd I get you are trying to find more things to weigh both majors against, but this is definitely something that would be the least of my worries.",
