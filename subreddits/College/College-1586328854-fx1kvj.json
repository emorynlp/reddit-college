  "text": "here's mine. I was doing an assignment that was due in 30 minutes in the library. 5 minutes left, i quickly print my assignment, write my name on top and hurry to class and turn it in. Few days later, my professor emails me saying that my assignment was identical to another person and that i will be getting a zero for the assignment. I was like WTF? because I don't talk to anyone in the class and I knew i didn't cheat. So I said ok i will talk to you in the next class.\n\nso in next class, me and this girl stay behind and the professor hands us our assignments. and they were exactly the same! Apparently she printed hers in the library before me and i guess she printed an extra, and i accidentally picked hers up and just saw the top and assumed it was mine lol.\n\nBut luckily, the assignment was two pages and I somehow took her first page but my second page. So that kind of told the professor that I didn't mean to cheat, since we each wrote about a different topic. I was able to print mine again and turn my assignment in lol.",

      "text": "Every year at my university they have two fire drills a year at night. Unfortunately both those times they went off at the worst possible moments.\n\nFirst time: I had just gotten out of the shower and had put on a gray clay face mask. I was chilling on my bed doing homework in nothing but my robe when the fire alarm went off. I quickly threw on my sweats, a t-shirt, and a jacket before I ran down 4 flights of stairs and outside. We gathered with our respective RA. It was October in Oregon and it was freezing out. Suddenly one of the girls from my floor started laughing. I realized I forgot to take off the mask. We all laughed about it; I still have a Snapchat from that night to commemorate it.\n\nSecond time: I was having sex with a former partner, and it was getting really good. The sound of the alarm pierces the air. We turned to each other and started to laugh. We stumbled around in the dark and I hit my funny bone on my desk as I found my shirt. Eventually we got outside assembled as usual. It was the middle of February and it was really cold, and I didn't bring a jacket. So I froze my ass off instead.\n\nTL;DR: The two annual fire drills happened once when I had a clay mask on my face and another time whilst I was in the middle of having sex.",

You could hear people fucking four doors down. \nThere was usually a group of girls whom sat in the common area which was right outside our door, and that of the RA. It was four am. And these girls were being loud af. We kindly asked them to keep it down because we were trying to sleep. It took four times asking them to be quiet, then them banging on our bedroom door and the RA telling them to shove off for them to relocate to the room beside us where they continued to be loud. We overheard one girl saying \u201cI lost my virginity at fifteen years old.\u201d My roommate then yelled \u201cYOU WHORE!\u201d I fell out of bed laughing.",

After about two weeks, we decided to turn our run-ins into a war of tag.\n\nThe best tag was on my way to the tech building one evening for a proctored exam. I saw red hair across campus and texted him: \"so if this isn't you then I'm the biggest creeper, but if it is then 5-1.\" He responded with: \"WHY ARE YOU STILL ON CAMPUS\"\n\nHe also only wears grey converse, and is about 6'2\" so even when he would try to hide and tag me, it would end in me seeing him first. Had corona not happened this semester, we would probably still be at war. Hoping to continue in the fall.",

      "text": "I'm taking online classes, so covid hasn't really affected me that much. The only difference is that I'm a bit busier.\n\nMy math professor had opened all of the assignments ever back up again for a bit. I was at my grandparents house when that happened, but (I'm in California) that was when the governor issued the quarantine notice. No leaving the house unless it's absolutely necessary. I had my laptop and charger with me, so I wasn't that worried. Unfortunately, their WiFi is really bad, and Matlab wouldn't load.\n\nSo I stayed the night there, and left in the morning once I heard the quarantine was loosened a little. When I got home, I emailed my professor, explaining what happened and asking if she could open the assignments up for another day.\n\nI'm not really sure exactly what happened, but I think she opened them up for another week for the whole class, which was really nice of her. On the last day of the week, I went onto Canvas to finish up. (And by finish up, I mean do half of them. I'm bad at managing my time, and on top of that, I'd been super busy helping out and running errands.) To my dismay, it wouldn't load. It stayed down until after midnight.\n\nAfter some internal debate, I (and I assume others) emailed my professor again explaining that Pearson's servers were down. So she sent out an email to the class, explaining that we would get an extra day to work on it because of the server issues. I was grateful, and went to work on it the next day. But the servers were down again. She sent out another email, extending the last day.\n\nThis happened so much that we ended up getting a whole extra week because of this.",

      "text": "First semester of freshman year. I had a class that usually met MWF at 9am. However, the final was at 8am for some reason. I had studied, felt confident, and tried to go to bed at a reasonable hour but I couldn\u2019t really sleep. \n\nSo my genius solution to that was to take a NyQuil around 1am. I only took one, so I wasn\u2019t expecting the shit show of events that happened on the morning.\n\nI wake up to my phone ringing. First of all, I notice it\u2019s unusually light outside. I look at the phone and see that it\u2019s my friend from the class whose final I was taking today. Why the hell would she be calling me? Then it hits me. I look at the time.\n\nIT\u2019S SEVEN FIFTY A.M. Unbeknownst to me, the NyQuil has knocked me out so hard that I didn\u2019t hear my alarm go off. I answer the phone in hysterics as I\u2019m desperately pulling on a bra and shoes and sprinting down the hallway of my dorm. (Side note: my professor was very strict and she had previously told us that she would be closing the door at 8am- no exceptions.)\n\nI live all the way across campus, naturally, so I\u2019m running as hard as I can, in tears, texting my friend to tell the prof to keep the door open, that I\u2019m almost there, and I genuinely believed I was going to fail the class if I didn\u2019t make the final so I was worried about that too.\n\nThe clock hits 8 and I break down. I still had a solid 5 minutes to go, so there was no making it. My friend texts me, however, and says to BOOK it because the prof was keeping the door open.\n\nI break out in a full Usain Bolt fucking sprint and don\u2019t stop for a solid minute or so until I get to the building where the final was. I run in the room, everybody looking at me like I\u2019m an escaped zoo animal, and try to keep my breathing under control as I take the paper from my prof. (My friend later told me that I was unbelievably sweaty and breathing like a maniac.) She tells me I\u2019m late (oh wow, I didn\u2019t notice!) and I nod my head and take the exam. (Got an A, by the way!)\nI thanked her profusely for letting me take the exam after I turned it in, and I basically owe my life to her.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it pays off to go to class regularly, actually put in effort throughout the semester, turn in assignments on time, and show a genuine interest in the class/prof! Because they\u2019ll save your ass if you fall into a NyQuil-induced coma and nearly miss the final.\n\ntl;dr: I took NyQuil at 1am the night before an 8am final, overslept/woke up 10 mins before I need to be there, sprinted like a madman across campus, prof kept the door open an extra minute or two because I was generally a good student.",

      "text": "**TLDR:** I didn't know what clove extract was and I ruined everybody's experiments.Story from my Analytical Chemistry lab last year:\n\nWe had to do an experiment to determine the \"antioxidant ability\" in different food products. We designed a reaction where if the reaction went from clear to purple, that would indicate better antioxidant ability. We tested this on clove extract, cranberry juice, and green tea.\n\nMy TA asked me to make the clove extract for our entire section. The instructions were just to put the cloves in some water to let it soak for 30 minutes, which I did. Afterwards, I asked my TA if I should use a filter to remove the cloves, and she was like \"Oh, you can just pipet the water out\".\n\nWhich I did. I pipetted the water out, but INTO A WASTE BEAKER. I was supposed to throw away the CLOVES, not the water!!\n\nI didn't realize this until I went up to the front counter with a beaker of cloves, and I stared at everybody else's containers....and I realized: Wait, cranberry juice and green tea are liquids.....but I'm carrying a solid!\n\n(So at that point I realized I messed up, and I realized that clove EXTRACT meant the water that you soak cloves in, not the cloves themselves. My 1st language is English by the way, I just never realized what clove extract meant before that day)\n\nOkay so now I'm in panic mode because I wasted 30 minutes and everybody is waiting for my cloves. As I'm putting the cloves into water again, the worst thing happens: I GET A SPONTANEOUS NOSE BLEED!\n\nBlood is gushing out of my nose, my lab coat is soaked in red, and I have to leave the room. I told my lab partner that if anybody asks why the cloves aren't ready, it's because when I got a nosebleed I panicked and accidentally knocked over the extract (total lie, but I was in too deep)\n\nSo my nosebleed stops after like 15-20 minutes; when i return, the lab is back to normal, the clove extract is almost ready. I take out the WATER this time and throw out the cloves.\n\nBut....when we do the experiment, our clove extract reaction didn't turn purple. At all. Which is weird because we KNOW cloves are antioxidants.\n\nAfter we left the lab, I was talking over what happened with my lab partner. When I got to the part about putting the cloves in water a 2nd time, she stopped and said: \"Wait...you put the SAME cloves in water???\"\n\nSo yeah, that's why the experiment turned out bad. I re-used the same cloves for the 2nd experiment. It didn't occur to me that after soaking them once, the cloves would have lost some \"clove juice\" to the surrounding water.

The fact that it is scheduled 7:30 AM in the morning didn't help either.\n\nOur professor asked us to introduce ourselves in a unique way for only a minute. I don't like activities like these because of the following reasons:\n\n1. I don't like too much attention. \n\n2. I'm not good with introductions. \n\nI'm not talented but I can dance. When my name was called, I went to the front and stared at the audience because I know this will be awkward and weird as hell. Thanks to the \"last minute weird but can help you get out of sticky situations\" kind of ideas. \n\nI started dancing like the Swedish guy who auditioned for the Sweden version of American Idol. I improvised by adding some robot moves (Just search \"A funny Swedish idol meme [Mai Ya Hee]\" on YouTube for reference).\n\nGuess what? People laughed and applauded me.\n\nI never felt so awesome my entire life.",

      "text": "The college I attended had a lot of distinctive features. For being a small, liberal arts college, we have a lot of \u201ctraditions\u201d in both formal and informal manners. Formal being the events that take place, informal being the things that students do. The center of campus, called the pine grove, is a huge hang out center whenever the weather is nice. It would not be uncommon see 10-50 people doing homework there in February when it was 40 degrees and sunny outside. In the pine grove, live these lovely little squirrels, black squirrels to be specific. And they\u2019re beloved. \n\nSide note: most of the dorms on campus are co-Ed. While there are 3 all female dorms there is only 1 all male dorm. That all male dorm has a history of being...rambunctious. And also having traditions. One of which is called a \u201cChapel Run\u201d, in which the inhabitants of the dorm strip off their clothes and run to the chapel. I never found out what they did in the chapel then, but I don\u2019t need to know. This typically happened around the library would close (midnight) so it was also a crap shoot what you would encounter on your walk back to your room. \n\nAt one point, some dudes from the dorm decided they wanted a pet, so they captured a black squirrel. Can\u2019t remember how many days they got away with it but I think it was quite a few. Also they don\u2019t have shower curtains cause they ritualistically rip them down at the beginning of each school year.",

I get pretty angry and follow him and was like \"what's wrong?\" and he tells me that he saw something in the motherfucking woods and it's coming after him. i looked back at the woods, back at him, back at the woods, and back at him, and said \"what the fuck are you talking about\" and then tried to convince him to just walk with me and i could take him home so he felt safer.\n\ninstead, he ran away from me. and he didn't know where to go because he generally lacks directional skills. he was relying on me from the get-go and yet wouldn't even trust me to get him to safety. and he's FREAKING out now. i even tried to calm him down with a blunt and he threw it and ran.\n\ni was genuinely worried. and also pretty fucking mad that he wouldn't just follow me. so i kind of just left. am i a terrible person? maybe. but i was getting really fed up with babysitting my boyfriend when i just wanted a night alone.\n\nso i get out to the alumni field. shits getting melty and i'm finally enjoying myself for a minute until i realize that my ex is still out there losing his motherfucking shit. i was torn; do i follow the protocol set in place for RAs to call public safety when someone seems dangerous or just let him live it out there alone. both felt like i was throwing him under the bus (i feel way less bad about it now and tbh would have probably just left him if it was current me, but then i certainly was torn because i cared about him). but because he felt to me to be a danger to himself and possibly others (he was sincerely delusional when i left him; it was kind of scaring me), i called the pub. my personal mistake was reporting it and then sticking around. they would have never known i was on drugs if i had left... or kept my composure. after placing the report call, i was sitting in the field and enjoying myself until i got another call. i thought it was my boyfriend because his name came up. turns out, it was his FUCKING MOTHER calling to YELL AT ME about how i PUT HER SON IN DANGER. y'all. y ' a l l.

HE COULD HAVE SAID NO AT ANY TIME AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE HURT ME ONE BIT. \n\nso anyway back to me crying like a little baby. makeup smearing all over my face. bawling. was really mad at the same time. so while my waterworks are working at full speed, the pub rolls up and hears me crying and they get super concerned super quick which is, like, not what i wanted. they seem to start thinking this is a domestic abuse case or something since the call i placed was basically \"my boyfriend and i got separated in the woods and i don't know where he is and i think he's lost and confused.\" they ask me if he's been hurting me, if i need help, etc. and finally, it just comes out. \"we're both tripping on acid. he lost his mind and i left him out there to handle it on his own.\" \n\nthen, they start freaking out. they call EVERYONE. ems, fire, police. the whole nine yards for this search team. the search takes, like, an hour. the police officer was surprisingly the only person that was nice to me. he brought me two bottles of water and a blanket and was like, \"you seem to be handling this okay\" and i responded \"dude, i don't even know what i am doing here right now.\" and he laughed and told public safety it was in their hands now (public safety has total jurisdiction for campus crimes. didn't know until this day) and left and told me to have a good night despite this mess.\n\nother stuff happened too after they found him (it took, like, an hour), such as a trip to the public safety interrogation room in which they interrogated us under the influence of drugs and got nothing really from us because WE WERE ON DRUGS. but, anyhow, that's the story of how i got fired from being an RA before my job even started and the downfall of my first go-around at college. hope it entertained someone out there.",

      "text": "A lot of my stories are either inside jokes or really inappropriate, so I'll settle for this one that happened a couple of months ago.\n\nSo this apartment company I'm renting from is your typical slumlord agency. Whenever I have the opportunity to tell people that go to my school to avoid them at all costs, I do. Not only have I been paying on average $60 for water every month, they lied about about promotions, and every time I put in a service request, their employees would leave mud on the carpet and not clean up after themselves. \n\nSo around Christmas time, they sent out a mass email talking about a Christmas Wishlist Giveaway. All you had to do was put some random wishlist items down. So, me being the smartass I am, I put down a variety of items as a joke:\n- An all expenses paid trip to Europe\n- Your employees at least put bags over their shoes and not track mud all over my apartment. Also have one of them dress up as Santa and give me $500 for the time I spent cleaning after them and feeling paranoid when my stuff was moved out of place. \n- Spring Tuition & Fees paid for\n- a microwave with $1,000 stuffed in it\n- Non-perishable food to give to the pantry...  and also $1,000\n- $500 Target giftcard and a bottle of eggnog\n- Paid storage unit for 5 years so I can put all of my extra shoes and clothes in there. Or maybe I'll live in there. \n\nI completely forgot about it until a couple of weeks later, I got an email from them saying that they will be giving me one of the items on my wishlist! I am completely bewildered because all of my responses were expensive jokes. So I went about my daily life until one day I walked into my apartment after work and saw a neatly wrapped box 24\" x 12\". \n\nNot gonna lie, a small part of me got a little excited. I ripped open the present to find... a microwave. With a little hope left, I opened the microwave to see if there was any money or checks. Nope. I honestly felt like I got rickrolled as I looked up at the built in microwave above the stovetop that came with the apartment. I ended up giving the microwave to a friend who wanted one and having a good laugh about it afterwards. \n\nTl;dr: the slumlord apartment company that I'm renting from gave me a fucking microwave as a joke for Christmas.",

          "text": "This reminds me of a college story happening last semester. Before I start, obligatory mobile user. To start off, every year by college grants Christmas wishes to students a week or so before fall semester ends. One year they gave away full paid scholarships, free parking spaces, etc. my Christmas wish was to put a pasta bar in the cafeteria since my college doesn\u2019t have the best cafeteria food. The reason I specially put this was because I heard they had a pasta bar there before I was a student, which I really wish they had kept. Anyways, we get to the Christmas chapel and my name is the first name called. I was so excited they chose me and the room was so loud I couldn\u2019t hear what they said, but they basically said that they can\u2019t grant me my wish but they have something better, which was 2 plates of pasta for me and one person to eat while they give the rest of the wishes, so I chose the first person I recognized who really wanted pasta, and we sat on stage eating cold spaghetti that had some weird kick to it while the college gave the rest of the wishes away. The best one being a Mac laptop. I\u2019m bummed the pasta bar wasn\u2019t added cus everyone would enjoy it and it\u2019d save the school money by having pasta and not the weird food normally at the station, but still a funny experience.",

Beside the gym is the only significant hill on campus and I see three drunk girls at the top all on high heels and skirts. So, I\u2019m just watching them when they all decide to sit down on the sidewalk. \n\nHave you ever watched the Winter Olympics when the athletes perform the [luge event?](https://youtu.be/nIn9vmzWWSE) This is what the girls were doing. One of them was carrying a skateboard and they all got on it like it was a luge. Well, they go down this hill at a whopping 5mph, digging their heels into the ground the entire time. \n\nThey get near the bottom and completely eat it. Two girls are on the ground crying and the third is to the side throwing her guts up. They finally collect themselves after a minute or so, look at each other, and walk right back up the hill to do it all again. \n\nThere was a girl who was also leaving the gym who saw the whole thing. We just looked at each other to make sure we weren\u2019t losing our minds and then went on our way.",

Went to a party with my derelict brother (who i foolishly roomed with as a freshman) and drove home about midnight bc I wanted to be ready for class. \n\nAn hour later, I'm standing in our living room, eating a bowl of cereal (as any tipsy college student would), when i notice police lights flashing outside our window. Look outside, and see the campus cops with my bro pulled over in the driveway. Cop told him, \"Walk a straight line,\" and pointed at a crooked crack on the street. He started arguing with them, and the cop said, \"All right, put your hands behind your back.\" \n\nHere's where abrupt chaos starts. My idiot brother takes off running. (Yo, my dude: You're parked in front of our house, and you're driving a car registered to you.) Cop tackles him and proceeds to punch the shit out of his drunken face. At this point, I go running outside and start screaming at everyone, \"Calm the fuck down!\" I told the male cop to stop punching my brother, and I told my brother to go with the cop. (Cop stops punching, brother calms down.) \n\nBut then my brother screams, \"Get their names!\" So i run inside and grab and pen, paper, and flashlight, and the cops start wrestling my brother into the cruiser. I come back out and point the flashlight at the female cop's chest. Her partner (who had been wailing on my brother) screams at me to drop the flashlight, and I told them I was merely collecting their info and reminded them that I was the one who calmed everyone's shit down. That's when the male cop throws a full-nelson on me. \n\nI outweighed him by a good 70 pounds, and wrestled in high school. I shucked him like a fly. My brother starts fighting the female cop, and Round 2 of abrupt chaos breaks loose. \"Just help me get this one in the car!\" She screams at her partner. They put him in the backseat, and Mr. Cop puts his boot on the back of my brother's head while Ms. Cop drives to the police station.\n\nAnd then I, being a doofus college freshman, drive down to the police station to see about bailing my brother out. I walk in, recognize the female cop filling out paperwork, and say, \"I'm here to check on a guy who just got arrested.\" She looks at me and says, \"Are you the brother? Step behind the counter. You're under arrest.\"\n\nAnd that's how I missed the first day of college classes.",

I now have every clinical, exam, project and ATI due online, missing out on 80hrs of patient experience. The funniest part is my bf and I have custody of his 3 kids. They're on online homeschool, 2 are independent enough but I'll have to basically teach a 9yr old who just wants to play video games about a math technique that I never learned in school. Being so overwhelmed my anxiety skyrockets and I actually get less done than I'd like. The hilarity, i cant! The good news is the bf still works. So, we'll make it, I just don't know in what condition lol.",

What this means is that the revenue of a school should equal the cost of the school. With online lecturers, everything is being moved online and most of the cost associated to operating a university still exist. Believe it or not, people misunderstand that the cost of a university is not a per month thing, most of the operations like construction of buildings are paid long term via contracts ect. So the argument \u201cwe arent getting what we paid for\u201d is irrational in a business and logical breakdown. I discussed the own costs of my school with other people and had the opportunity to learn more about it, it may differ but there is practically little difference in the cost of operating a online vs in person university. The only thing would be waiving activity/extra fees for certain things that aren\u2019t by contract, but this is unlikely for most large universities. Its very illogical to ask your university to intentionally lose couple dozen to hundred millions of tuiton dollar just because its not as good as before. The long term effects of such a plan with lead to many unexpected consequences that us students, who don\u2019t deal with the administration of a whole university wouldnt understand. I don\u2019t take myself as a expert of this, but i would rather like to offer a alternative point fo view to this topic.",
