I answer the phone in hysterics as I\u2019m desperately pulling on a bra and shoes and sprinting down the hallway of my dorm.

I still had a solid 5 minutes to go, so there was no making it. My friend texts me, however, and says to BOOK it because the prof was keeping the door open.\n\nI break out in a full Usain Bolt fucking sprint and don\u2019t stop for a solid minute or so until I get to the building where the final was.

We designed a reaction where if the reaction went from clear to purple, that would indicate better antioxidant ability. We tested this on clove extract, cranberry juice, and green tea.\n\nMy TA asked me to make the clove extract for our entire section. The instructions were just to put the cloves in some water to let it soak for 30 minutes, which I did. Afterwards, I asked my TA if I should use a filter to remove the cloves, and she was like \"Oh, you can just pipet the water out\".\n\nWhich I did. I pipetted the water out, but INTO A WASTE BEAKER. I was supposed to throw away the CLOVES, not the water!!\n\nI didn't realize this until I went up to the front counter with a beaker of cloves, and I stared at everybody else's containers....and I realized: Wait, cranberry juice and green tea are liquids.....but I'm carrying a solid!\n\n(So at that point I realized I messed up, and I realized that clove EXTRACT meant the water that you soak cloves in, not the cloves themselves. My 1st language is English by the way, I just never realized what clove extract meant before that day)\n\nOkay so now I'm in panic mode because I wasted 30 minutes and everybody is waiting for my cloves. As I'm putting the cloves into water again, the worst thing happens: I GET A SPONTANEOUS NOSE BLEED!\n\nBlood is gushing out of my nose, my lab coat is soaked in red, and I have to leave the room. I told my lab partner that if anybody asks why the cloves aren't ready, it's because when I got a nosebleed I panicked and accidentally knocked over the extract (total lie, but I was in too deep)\n\nSo my nosebleed stops after like 15-20 minutes; when i return, the lab is back to normal, the clove extract is almost ready. I take out the WATER this time and throw out the cloves.\n\nBut....when we do the experiment, our clove extract reaction didn't turn purple. At all. Which is weird because we KNOW cloves are antioxidants.\n\nAfter we left the lab, I was talking over what happened with my lab partner. When I got to the part about putting the cloves in water a 2nd time, she stopped and said: \"Wait...you put the SAME cloves in water???\"\n\nSo yeah, that's why the experiment turned out bad. I re-used the same cloves for the 2nd experiment. It didn't occur to me that after soaking them once, the cloves would have lost some \"clove juice\" to the surrounding water. Which is why I didn't think it'd be necessary to use new cloves.\n\nLuckily, even though i ruined everyone's experiments, we were graded for how we wrote up the results, and not the accuracy of the results themselves :)", "author": "Giant_Anteaters", "created": 1586377760, "upvotes": 1}, "fmtpf6t": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fx1kvj/tell_me_your_funny_college_story/fmtpf6t/", "text": "I went to college that\u2019s it that\u2019s the story.", "author": "BigChilling25", "created": 1586376719, "upvotes": 1}, "fmtmgi9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fx1kvj/tell_me_your_funny_college_story/fmtmgi9/", "text": "There was this activity for a subject that I didn't like.

I get pretty angry and follow him and was like \"what's wrong?\" and he tells me that he saw something in the motherfucking woods and it's coming after him. i looked back at the woods, back at him, back at the woods, and back at him, and said \"what the fuck are you talking about\" and then tried to convince him to just walk with me and i could take him home so he felt safer.\n\ninstead, he ran away from me. and he didn't know where to go because he generally lacks directional skills. he was relying on me from the get-go and yet wouldn't even trust me to get him to safety. and he's FREAKING out now. i even tried to calm him down with a blunt and he threw it and ran.\n\ni was genuinely worried. and also pretty fucking mad that he wouldn't just follow me. so i kind of just left. am i a terrible person? maybe. but i was getting really fed up with babysitting my boyfriend when i just wanted a night alone.\n\nso i get out to the alumni field. shits getting melty and i'm finally enjoying myself for a minute until i realize that my ex is still out there losing his motherfucking shit. i was torn; do i follow the protocol set in place for RAs to call public safety when someone seems dangerous or just let him live it out there alone. both felt like i was throwing him under the bus (i feel way less bad about it now and tbh would have probably just left him if it was current me, but then i certainly was torn because i cared about him). but because he felt to me to be a danger to himself and possibly others (he was sincerely delusional when i left him; it was kind of scaring me), i called the pub. my personal mistake was reporting it and then sticking around. they would have never known i was on drugs if i had left... or kept my composure. after placing the report call, i was sitting in the field and enjoying myself until i got another call. i thought it was my boyfriend because his name came up. turns out, it was his FUCKING MOTHER calling to YELL AT ME about how i PUT HER SON IN DANGER. y'all. y ' a l l. HE LITERALLY MADE ME GO BUY HIM A DAMN TAB. I WAS GONNA DO THIS ALONE. HE COULD HAVE SAID NO AT ANY TIME AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE HURT ME ONE BIT. \n\nso anyway back to me crying like a little baby. makeup smearing all over my face. bawling. was really mad at the same time. so while my waterworks are working at full speed, the pub rolls up and hears me crying and they get super concerned super quick which is, like, not what i wanted. they seem to start thinking this is a domestic abuse case or something since the call i placed was basically \"my boyfriend and i got separated in the woods and i don't know where he is and i think he's lost and confused.\" they ask me if he's been hurting me, if i need help, etc. and finally, it just comes out. \"we're both tripping on acid. he lost his mind and i left him out there to handle it on his own.\" \n\nthen, they start freaking out. they call EVERYONE. ems, fire, police. the whole nine yards for this search team. the search takes, like, an hour. the police officer was surprisingly the only person that was nice to me. he brought me two bottles of water and a blanket and was like, \"you seem to be handling this okay\" and i responded \"dude, i don't even know what i am doing here right now.\" and he laughed and told public safety it was in their hands now (public safety has total jurisdiction for campus crimes. didn't know until this day) and left and told me to have a good night despite this mess.\n\nother stuff happened too after they found him (it took, like, an hour), such as a trip to the public safety interrogation room in which they interrogated us under the influence of drugs and got nothing really from us because WE WERE ON DRUGS. but, anyhow, that's the story of how i got fired from being an RA before my job even started and the downfall of my first go-around at college. hope it entertained someone out there.", "author": "kateblazed", "created": 1586363038, "upvotes": 33}, "fmsvmsp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fx1kvj/tell_me_your_funny_college_story/fmsvmsp/", "text": "This one time, i started to get my life together at the age of 24, and started going to classes at my local community college, and then this huge virus took over the nation and now I'm basically doing what i was doing before.", "author": "Darth-Shittious69", "created": 1586362705, "upvotes": 27}, "fmstfpd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fx1kvj/tell_me_your_funny_college_story/fmstfpd/", "text": "I slide down a hill and my pants were covered with mud.\n\nWe were doing a solid lab and we had to get down to the bottom of a hill.

Also have one of them dress up as Santa and give me $500 for the time I spent cleaning after them and feeling paranoid when my stuff was moved out of place. \n- Spring Tuition & Fees paid for\n- a microwave with $1,000 stuffed in it\n- Non-perishable food to give to the pantry...  and also $1,000\n- $500 Target giftcard and a bottle of eggnog\n- Paid storage unit for 5 years so I can put all of my extra shoes and clothes in there.
