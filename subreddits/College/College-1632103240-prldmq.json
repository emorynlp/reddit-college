Everyone\u2019s from instate and knows everyone from neighboring towns or even HIGHSCHOOL. I\u2019m from out of state (12 hour drive) and just find it hard to connect with people. I just broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years and maybe that\u2019s been it but man I\u2019m just not having a good time. I visited my buddy down in Florida and that was fantastic and felt more welcomed there than here! Idk but what stage did you realize your uni wasn\u2019t for you?
