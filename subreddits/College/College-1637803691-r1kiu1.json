  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve applied to some schools and will be transferring somewhere in January of 2022. I like where I\u2019ve already gotten in, but I don\u2019t know a ton about the *actual* student life at these places. Does anyone know where to talk with current students or get more information about what life *actually* is like there? Some have subreddits, but they\u2019re basically dead.",
