  "text": "It's been a while since i've written a research paper, and I just turned one in right now. It's on mental illness, but is only supposed to be 5-6 pages. Nothing I'm trying to prove in the paper, just a paper describing it. I wasn't able to go in depth as much I could've. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just used so many references, but cited everything (I know for a fact, I read through it 20 times). Most of the paper is citations pieced together. \n\nI just get so irrationally scared, I would never intentionally plaigarize but my brain thinks of a whole doomsday scenario where I accidentally do it and there goes all my hopes and dreams lol",
