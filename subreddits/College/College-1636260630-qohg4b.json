      "text": "Depends. For fields that require a license, such as medicine, law, accounting etc., the degree itself isn\u2019t worthless but it is far from enough. There are often long licensing procedures, possibly requiring you to redo some schooling in the US.\n\nFor CS, the university\u2019s reputation matters (sometimes), but as long as you are up to the task, it won\u2019t matter which country it is from.",

      "text": "I think it depends on the degree. This girl I worked with got her accounting degree in a different country but couldn't get promoted in the US because it wasn't a US degree. Accounting has different requirements in the US than other countries, so that may be why? \n\nIf you are looking to get a degree outside of the US, you can research what degrees are transferrable and maybe that will help.",
