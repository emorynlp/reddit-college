Note: there\u2019s only like 1 Uni where I\u2019m from and I\u2019m too far into my program to even transfer out to a different program. I\u2019m just sucking it up to finish but so far, my University experience has always been really bad before the pandemic. I\u2019m fact, the experience for me got a bit better when everything became remote, god, I\u2019m going to miss online learning so I don\u2019t have to travel 2 hrs to Uni everyday\u2026",
