You find yourself in a period of time thinking \"Wow, I have no homework this weekend\" or \"Once I turn this in on Wednesday I'm free.\" \n\nIt's an illusion. In reality, you have more work to do; it's just not due until later.\n\nSpend your free days getting started on that work. Even if just for a few hours. Don't have any more days of non-productivity. And by working, I mean really working. Not just staring at a textbook to kill an hour or going to class like you should already be doing, but actually spending Friday making headway on an assignment that's not due until next Wednesday, or getting caught up in a class where you know you're behind.\n\nI give this advice for 3 reasons. \n\n\\#1, A lot of college students (including myself for many years) miss points on assignments because they underestimate how much time it will take to complete. That's the dumbest reason ever to lose points. You're just hurting yourself for no reason.\n\n\\#2, Most students' schedules have a natural ebb and flow: crazy amounts of stress before deadlines, and free time elsewhere. It's not balanced nor healthy. It's the reason some students can't take the pressure when it really builds up. Delegate your work more evenly and you'll still have the ability to take time off and relax, just with less stress hanging over your head.\n\n\\#3, It builds discipline. You have to teach yourself to work even when you don't want to. That's the difference between discipline and motivation. Motivation is nice, but it won't last you all year long. Discipline will. \n\nI hope this is read by at least one person who can apply this to their situation. It will change your grades, your time management skills, and your relationship with your work.", "author": null, "created": 1537413587, "retrieved": 1632802526, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 867, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"ea27riu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9hbtnj/early_semester_reminder_stop_having_zero_days/ea27riu/", "text": "MALE COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKE THIS SHORT SURVEY: \n\n[http://uwpsychology.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_dhRYVuVT66TQfyJ](http://uwpsychology.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dhRYVuVT66TQfyJ)", "author": "alyssaandresen", "created": 1542664796, "upvotes": 1}, "e6bv7li": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9hbtnj/early_semester_reminder_stop_having_zero_days/e6bv7li/", "text": "I just stay a full week ahead of everything.

That's where I'm at now, and I wish I had a day once a week with no class or homework to unwind.\n\nI agree with the overall message--but spending Friday working on an assignment that won't be due for days, spending /hours/ on it, I don't really agree with.
