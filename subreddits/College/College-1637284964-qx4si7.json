  "title:": "I screwed up my cs exam, how do I get over it",
  "text": "I did my best, preparing for the exam before a couple of weeks ago, made a pdf of lecture notes and sample questions, solved lots of example questions, but was only able to properly solve one out of 5 questions. I partially wrote codes for the rest of the questions. I used to receive straight As in assignments and previous exams, but I don't know why I screwed up. The questions were very confusing, and I even missed some codes that I know because I got extremely frustrated while taking the exam. I'm not exaggerating, I had to control my breaths due to severe anxiety. Due to this exam, I might get a B+ or A- IF I get good grades in the finals. I know that this is not the end of the world, but I feel so depressed and I really want to know how to properly manipulate myself. I am aware that I seem like I'm being too obsessed with grades but I just don't know how to get over this. If you have any advice or if there's someone who had similar situations as mine and overcame this, I would be honored to listen. Thanks",

      "text": "Like you already know, this isn't the end of the world. Last semester I was taking a CS class where I had exceptional grades throughout, until the final exam. I failed it SO badly, and I was sure I wasn't going to get the grade I wanted because that exam held so much weight. \n\nBut I spoke to someone about how I felt and they advised me to tell my professor about my concerns. I wrote an email to the professor outlining that I found some of the problems confusing, highlighting exact points that confused me in the prompt. The questions also didn't have any sample input/output for the code, so I mentioned that those would've been helpful too. I wrote it in a very polite way, not sounding like \"the exam was so hard, it's your fault\", but rather \"here's some polite feedback about my experience taking the exam\". I only stated those things, and didn't ask for any leniency/extra points.\n\nThe professor thanked me for my feedback and explained the concepts that confused me. When the grades were posted, I saw that I got almost full marks on the exam. I believe my email may or may not have taken mine/other feedback and curved the grades of everyone. Of course, not every professor does this, but I think it's worth a shot because it goes me an A. \n\nGood luck, and even if you don't get the outcome you wanted, know that you still have another chance with the final and you can still pull your grades up. Stuff like this happens all the time and we just have to learn from it and move on :)",
