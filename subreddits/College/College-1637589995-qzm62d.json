      "text": "Depends on the individual. \n\nI personally cannot use podcasts to learn because I\u2019ll zone out. They\u2019re not as engaging as something like videos per se. \n\nYou\u2019ll also have people who would enjoy creating a podcast, and those who don\u2019t. I hate group assignments because other members slack. So maybe allowing students to work on their own would help.\n\nAlso, you come across the issue of equipment. I don\u2019t know what it takes to create a podcast, but you have to keep in mind what materials the students in a class have easy access to for free.",

      "text": "That seems like a really enjoyable assignment that can really amplify your learning. How much one learns is always proportional to the effort one puts in, and podcasts are one of those things that allow all students to explore the topic in various ways to various depths. \n\nIf a professor assigned me a podcast, I\u2019d be a little annoyed at first but hopefully enjoy it in the long run. If a professor is using a podcast to teach, I\u2019d love them forever given it isn\u2019t a visually based class. It allows me to do things like fold my clothes while also listening to a lecture and knowing I won\u2019t miss any visual components.",
