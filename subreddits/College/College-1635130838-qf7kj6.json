  "text": "So, I am applying for some scholarships through my university and one of them requires two letters of recommendation from academic sources. I am in my first year, first term of college and was wondering how long I have to know a professor for it to be appropriate to get a letter of recommendation? The terms are only 10 weeks long, and we are in week 5 starting tomorrow. I don't plan to ask right now as I feel like that is kind of soon, but there is a professor whose class I take who I really enjoy and I do really well in their class. I always participate in the lecture, I genuinely carry the discussion group afterwards (for some reason like half of my discussion group never reads the materials and the other half are super introverted, but I don't mind speaking up and answering questions when nobody else knows.) I also do very well on the tests: 100/100s on the two we've taken and I am really liking this course so I doubt if I do worse than that in the future it will be very bad (we don't have any other assignments by the way just tests.) I want to ask her for a letter of rec. but I don't know if maybe I need to develop a better relationship with her? It's not an overly serious or personal letter of rec either. She also apparently recommended me to one of the literature major advisors because I got an email saying so, but I can't tell if that's because she liked my work or if she just did that for anyone.\n\nHow do I know when it's appropriate to ask for a letter of recommendation? If anyone has advice that would be greatly appreciated!! (This could just be general advice too, not just for this situation.)",
