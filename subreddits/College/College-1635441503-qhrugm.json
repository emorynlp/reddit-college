Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab.\n\nIf you are at a point where you have to ask what stocks to buy, you aren't in a position to be buying anything individually. Buy an index fund ETF or sector ETF.\n\nEquities are a growth investment and you want at least a 5 year term. The value will go up and down each day, ignore that and look at the year to year of your fund compared to similar funds.",
