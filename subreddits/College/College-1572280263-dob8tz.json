  "text": "*Edit - I DID IT. I graduated in 3 years with a BS in CS. I'm glad I stuck with it and having a valuable degree is worth the extra work.\n\nI'm going for computer science and every programming class I can't stand and am terrible at. I find no enjoyment in programming and don't plan on doing it ever again for my career. The only reason I am going for CS is all the other tech or computer related fields are for IT, which screw fixing school projectors for eternity, or engineering. I wouldn't be able to pass the math needed for engineering. Computer Science is so diverse that I can get a job that doesn't require any programming with the degree. But I feel like I am wasting my time on something I will never use again and sorta is the focus of the degree. I much prefer hardware, networking, cyber security, and sys admin work.",

      "text": "[Steve Job's Commencement Address at Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc)\n\nAbsolutely you are supposed to enjoy college. You are supposed to enjoy almost everything that you choose to do in your life. Sure, for every major that you pursue there will undoubtedly be classes that you don't completely enjoy. However, at the absolute bare minimum, you should see that there is some value to the work you're doing in each class. If you find that you hate your classes you should really reconsider what it is you are doing. Your work in college will take up a massive amount of time in your life as it will when you get out of college so if you don't enjoy it then what is the point? Don't settle for anything that makes you unhappy.",

There is also some AI and computational theory and a bunch of other things thrown into the mix. Then later on we have to choose a specialization from one of these things.\n\nAnother university in the city has what I'd translate as CS, what they do is almost all theoretic with a **lot** of maths, programming and algorithm and computational theory.",

      "text": "Bro I'll tell you right now as someone with a bit of industry knowledge, employers in IT-related fields don't really care about what degree you have. They care that you have the soft skills that enable you to communicate effectively and the technical skills to do the job efficiently. \n\nHowever, it's not a bad idea by going for a degree in CS, Computer Engineering, or any other IT-related degree. BUT, you must accompany those degrees with certifications and experience (which you can gain from internships). Internships especially!!\n\nIn IT, the degree serves the purpose of showing you are teachable and can commit to something, however without the necessary certifications and/or experience in the field, the degree is practically meaningless. \n\nIf you truly want to get into fields such as cybersecurity, networking, cloud computing, or any other specialization in IT, look for the certs that'll help you get into those fields. I don't mean to come off as a broken record, but certs + experience go a long in the way. Way more than the degree.\n\nBut if you can go for all three at the same time, all the power to you, it's definitely possible. If you need any more info, go into the ITCareers subreddit. There's plenty of professionals in there that will most likely tell you the same and even more!\n\nOne last note: in IT, you are eventually going to have to obtain some knowledge about programming to a solid extent. That's just how fast the field is converging. These days, the field is converging faster than ever into software which revolves around a lot of AUTOMATION (via programming). So we're talking about learning python (one of the hottest programming languages out now) and maybe something else if you ever want an administrator or managerial position (Tier 2 or Tier 3 position). \n\nGood luck!",

It also has a lot of practical skills regarding business that can be easily transferable if you end up not enjoying it.

If your graduation date is going to be affected by you switching majors, your advisor might be able to apply credits from CS to your IS degree. Hope this helps!",

It's certainly more fun once you're through the prereqs and into the meat of whatever you're studying, and the social aspects are fun if you're that kind of person.  My advice is don't look at college solely as a place and time to study and prepare for your career.  Attend performances, go to art exhibitions, join clubs and orgs, go to parties, meet interesting people and learn from them.  Grind through the boring stuff and get into the real study of your subject.  You might consider asking an advisor or a professor if there's a program that engages more with what you actually want to do.  They'll probably try their best to help you, and they likely have a lot of experience in their fields, so their help comes from a place of knowledge.",

I can't remember if you said one way or the other, but I hope your new path is treating you well :) it seems math is a barrier for most people, and understandably so. I know many people who want so badly to enjoy math and do well in it, but missing or forgetting concepts in previous classes snowballs very quickly into pain and suffering in subsequent classes. \n\nI feel for you, I really do. My theory is that all it takes is one bad math teacher in middle or high school, or one class where you didn't try as hard (totally understandable, since before calc 1 it's really, really hard to see any applications of what you're learning in math) to really get screwed over in the future. At that point, you either revisit everything you've done from algebra 1 through  precalculus, and geometry and trig and identify anything you're not confident with anymore, or you struggle and/or have to switch majors. Math is incredible and beautiful, but it's so common to appear the complete opposite of beautiful.\n\n\nGood luck with your future endeavors! I may not know you, but I'll be rooting for you!",

The difference is the majority of IST majors choose the IT or librarian path. Therefore, there is a misconception on salary outcomes. IS is a more well-rounded option. I know plenty of individuals who have gotten an IST degree and received programming jobs with an excellent salary. It comes down to your skill level. Why would you continue in CS if your dragging your feet to get through it?",
