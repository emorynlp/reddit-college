  "text": "I\u2019m a psych major. I\u2019m taking five psych classes. Three were required and the other two looked fun on paper and I was really interested in the topics so I thought they\u2019d be easy As to raise my gpa. Well one of them is kicking my ass because the Professor is a mess. My major gpa is 1.6 because I failed a couple and am retaking them. I need it to be 2.0 after this semester or I\u2019ll be kicked out of my major in my final semester. Not sure how to calculate raising my major gpa. Looking like Bs and Cs if I\u2019m lucky.",

      "text": "I mean the best option would be to get all As that would raise you more points but that doesn\u2019t sound attainable right now. Aim for a 2.6/3.0 (for the semester) since that\u2019s going up one full point it should raise your overall. There\u2019s GPA calculators online that can help you figure out what grades this would be. \n\nOn a different note: I\u2019m a junior psych major (I only have 10 credits left so senior standing I guess?) are there any topics you are struggling with specifically? I might be able to help if you want to message me!",

If you do reach out to her more often for help she would probably be more willing to bump your grade up a couple points at the end of the semester for at least trying. \n\nI think if you were able to get all Bs with a C you would be up to a 2.0 for your major gpa",
