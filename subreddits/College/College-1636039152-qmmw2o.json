  "title:": "Considering transferring mid-Junior year (tw: suicidal ideation)",
  "text": "Hi. I am not sure if this is the place to post this, but I desperately need impartial advice on whether to transfer. I currently attend an Ivy League college in New Hampshire. I attend on a full need-based scholarship. In my freshman year, I realized that this wasn't the place for me. The frat culture is overwhelming, and the only people who thrive here are massively wealthy athletes who love Greek life (most students here are in a Greek house). I don't mind that other people love that type of culture, but it is just not right for me. However, I was so terrified that I would never get an opportunity like this again (I am poor and have very few resources to make my life better outside of college) so I decided to try to grin and bear it. I have come to realize that that was the worst decision I have ever made. I am currently halfway through my junior year (we are on the quarter system and I took two gap terms during COVID so my path to graduation is timed weirdly) and I have contemplated suicide every day that I have been back for in person learning. I have experienced suicidal ideation ever since arriving at college, but never as bad as the things I am feeling currently. I thought that maybe I would feel more positive about this school after being virtual due to COVID, but I have cried myself to sleep most nights I've been here. Often in class I will realize how much I regret my decision and have to leave class in order to cry in the stairwell. On better days, I am simply numb to my situation. I rarely feel happiness or even contentment. I have not been able to connect with anyone here; most people have experienced lives so different from my own that there is very little I can do to bridge the gap between our experiences and make genuine connections (and I have tried). I do not have a single true friend here. I have talked to my undergraduate dean (basically the school counselor) about transferring and she has told me it's too late for me to transfer and I need to just focus on graduating from this college. I am desperately trying to keep my head above water in my classes and still I am unable to focus, turn work in on time, or keep up with readings, which is something I have struggled with for a long time but only became truly consequential in college. I am trying to find a therapist currently, and I believe that it will help me to cope with my situation but the core of the problem -- the fact that this school is a terrible fit for me -- is obviously not going to be resolved through therapy. I am currently looking into transferring, but if I am being realistic, my only options will be to transfer to a state or community college in my home state due to my academic and financial situation. However, I have lost most of the value of going to an Ivy League anyway, as I have made no friends or connections, so maybe it would be best to go someplace where I will not feel so deeply miserable. I am at a loss on how to go about making this decision. If anyone has transferred or has any advice about things I should consider/do, please let me know. I would greatly appreciate it.",

      "text": "1. It\u2019s not too late to transfer. Many colleges, even top ones, are willing to accept junior transfers. Just be prepared to do an extra year is all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going to a state school though, and I\u2019m sure that UNH (if that\u2019s your home state) has many good opportunities for you. Otherwise, MANY other state universities can provide you with the opportunities to succeed without the need to say you went to an ivy league institution.\n\n2. Have you considered taking a semester or even year off? It may affect your finaid, so talk to your financial aid officer first, but you could be extremely burnt out and it\u2019s affecting your mental health. I go to a non-ivy school and am also in my junior year and considering transferring. But your depression could be getting in the way of finding some friends; I\u2019m sure that even where you go there are clubs and other organizations to represent your interests. And obviously it\u2019s hard to get that going when you\u2019re depressed. I understand your financial situation is hard, so perhaps you could work a job during that time, at least just take off from college during then, and pursue a passion?\n\n3. Your issues may not be resolved by therapy, but they\u2019ll massively help. In addition, your therapist can write a statement on your behalf to your university stating that your depression is horrible and preventing you from getting work done, and your university can withdraw the semester (and classes) from your academic record. This would effectively make you a 1st semester junior once again, but it would mean that the \u201cadvice\u201d your undergrad Dean told you doesn\u2019t apply since you\u2019d *technically* not be in your junior year. Especially then, if you take a year off, you\u2019d be applying as if you were a sophomore going into junior year. \n\nGood luck friend. I get it\u2019s hard. Above all else, **please talk to your professors about what is going on.** They can help you out with the immense stress you\u2019re feeling and are willing to give you more time and resources so that you can stay afloat if taking a semester / year off isn\u2019t an option for you.",

      "text": "Take a step back and breath. As you said, this is a great opportunity, and I understand that financial differences lead to different experiences, therefore it\u2019s harder to connect with people, but trust me, you\u2019re not alone. I KNOW that there is people with similar interests and people who you can make a connection with at your school, have you tried joining clubs about things you like? It\u2019s the best way to meet people with similar tastes, give it a try. \n\nI was going to tell you to look for professional help, but it looks like you\u2019re already taking care of that. Great job! \n\nHowever, if you feel like there isn\u2019t the place for you, definitely try transferring, I don\u2019t know how your uni works but it\u2019s never too late to transfer. Don\u2019t feel pressured to go to an Ivy League just because it\u2019s an Ivy League and because of what other people might think, they\u2019re not living your life. You can still succeed if you decide to transfer to a less reputable school, many people do. \n\nBut also, what else do you dislike about your school? The classes content, professors, extracurricular opportunities? If it\u2019s just the fact that you weren\u2019t able to make any friends yet, I would say that this can definitely be fixed. Join clubs, talk to people, take the first step, easier said than done, I know, but that\u2019s likely the only solution to solve your problem.\n\nThe pandemic messed up with everyone, people are now tending to be more approachable and there\u2019s a bunch of other people also craving to make friends, take advantage of that.\n\nGood luck and remember that there\u2019s a solution for any problem!",

If you're able to take a semester or so to take a break I would recommend it just to let yourself get used to things changing plus it might allow you time to find people that you'd be going to school with",
