  "text": "\nWhen I was in middle school, I was offered a merit scholarship to a prestigious high school called Boston University Academy due to my excellent grades and top standardized test scores. The high school is operated by Boston University (ranked #42 in the U.S). The rule was that anybody in BUA who graduated with a 3.0 or above is guaranteed admission to BU. I barely made the cut after busting my ass off, lol. Funny thing is, I was valedictorian of my middle school. It was hard transitioning from being the #1 student in middle school to being an average student in high school. I already graduated from BU but just wanted to share my story.",

      "text": "Congratulations on finishing college and most especially getting into a top 50 school. I graduated high school magna cum laude (3.92 GPA) but had a couple of C\u2019s in high school and finished with A and B grades my senior year. Middle school was a mess (straight B/C student and almost repeated 7th grade). I made a financial decision of going to community college (got shitted on by my friends Bc apparently I was smart and could have gone to a great school) and let me tell you, I got so many grants and scholarships just from my grades from high school that I could pay off 2 semesters of community college and this was after applying and during the midterms of my first year. I got invitations left and right for honor societies and campus visits from top colleges as well like Baylor, Cornell, and Boston University. I\u2019m still in community college but I\u2019m planning to transfer to state school in about a year. Current GPA is 3.9. Just wanted to share my story. Good luck to everyone here!",
