These materials used to be included in the coursework for the 3 credit Senior Seminar course, but the school has decided to split the two while keeping Senior Seminar at 3 credits and creating this new course for 1 credit. It\u2019s great that they separated the two since they don\u2019t really go together, but why not make Senior Seminar 2 credits then? I am affected negatively because I had the option to take a summer course for either 3, 4, 5, or 6 credits (for the same exact course, just different credit options) and I took 4 because that is the amount that I needed to reach 120 credits and graduate. Now I will be finishing with 121 which means that I spent an extra $400 on 1 extra credit I don\u2019t need. I\u2019ve spoken with the Assistant Dean and they basically told me good luck disputing this. Is this ethical/ legal? What are my options?\n\nThanks in advance.", "author": "JSC843", "created": 1564926798, "retrieved": 1632802895, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 569, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ew0ejvd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/clwjd9/is_it_ethicallegal_for_a_college_to_create_a_new/ew0ejvd/", "text": "You should have catalog rights,  which means you graduate based on the catalog (degree requirements) that were in effect when you started.\n\nRead the fine print and see what your school's policy is on this.

Colleges can absolutely change graduation requirements but as other people have said, they'll only implement them for incoming 1st year students, or maybe 2nd, or in so many years. It sounds like the college is trying to get more money from you before you leave. I've only heard of this happening with primarily online colleges such as National University. In fact, many National graduates report graduation requirements changing on them right before they graduate causing them to delay graduation and/or spend more money in order to graduate. It's extremely unethical and I honestly hope that school loses its accreditation status. Anyway, play along and graduate then look into their relevant stated policies. If I were you, I'd report them to the relevant governing agency just to check if this is something they allow. If it is, then obviously there's nothing you can do. Or report to the accreditation agency and ask whether or not this considered ethical. Again, if no one is concerned, then I would move on.
