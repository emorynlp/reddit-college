  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm doing a study on how college students understand data privacy, and would really appreciate it if you could take my survey! [This is the link to the survey](https://virginiatech.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3NPUWAzUF2qbGpo), it works on both PC and mobile. It's entirely anonymous, just to determine how college students understand data privacy.\n\n[https://virginiatech.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3NPUWAzUF2qbGpo](https://virginiatech.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3NPUWAzUF2qbGpo)\n\nIf you could spare a few minutes to take this survey, or upvote this post so more people can see this, I'd really appreciate it, thanks!",
