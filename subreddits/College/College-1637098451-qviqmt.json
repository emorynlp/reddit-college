  "text": "So, I am an engineering student\u2014 struggling at that. Anyway, part of my pre-engineering curriculum is obviously calculus. I took calculus 1 and 2 during shutdown. My professor (I had the same for both) literally just passed everyone. On top of that, my calc 2 class was a summer 7-week. So I am literally failing calculus 3 and calc-based physics. I felt like I didn\u2019t get any proper studying. I feel like I have the knowledge of a very early calc 1 student. Triple integrals? I can barely even integrate. I literally didn\u2019t know what a derivative was. I have no idea what to do. This semester is dead in the water for me.. thankfully I have already enrolled in my final university for next semester and I assume I am going to be taking calc 3 and physics again. \n\nBut what the hell do I do? Do I try to backtrack and teach myself everything again? Should I find a tutor? Do I let my professor know? \n\nI liked some aspects of the pandemic when it came to school. Such as not having to go to campus for easy classes like Spanish or economics. But I hate that I was literally passed with no effort in these difficult core math classes. \n\nPlease help.. this is an odd one.. thank you",

All of these things. I'll say that it's better to take the first two paths (teaching yourself and finding a tutor) before you try reaching out to your professor. They're too busy to personalize their course just for you. Definitely take care of things on your end first.",

      "text": "You have 2 options \n\n1) retake calc 1 and 2. This will obviously be time intensive and $, but you will almost certainly enter calc 3 way better prepared. \n\n2) buckle tf down, get a tutor, attend every office hour, and use khan academy or something to review calc 1 and 2 principles. Honestly, go with this first since youre already in the class. If you fail or get a grade you arent happy with then you go with #1. I know that sounds overwhelming, but im literally retaking 2 full semesters. Im doing great and happy with my choice to do that",
