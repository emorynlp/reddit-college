  "text": "Hello guys, I am just finishing my economics degree in Europe and have already had 2 years of work in my own field primarily in accounting and some banking in accordance to some internships that we have here in Europe.  \nNeedless to say, I despise every moment of my job. I dread the fact that I'll have to do this for the rest of my life since I feel it a soul-crushing and if anything boring job.  \nIf anything the lack of creativity and the formality that I have to go through is killing me. And I can't really handle it anymore.  \nDo you guys think it's weird to have 23+ students in engineering schools? Will my professors look at me differently and will I be discriminated against for my age when applying for some scholarships or internships?  \nany advice would be really appreciated and if anybody has a similar story I'd really like to hear you out since no one in my family has done the same thing and career change is kinda a taboo where I come from...",

      "text": "No, it won\u2019t be weird for you to be going to college at 23+ and professors won\u2019t look at you any differently. \n\nTo be honest, no one will care about your age. And it\u2019s common for varying age groups to attend college, 23+ is no exception. \n\nIf you want to go back and get a second degree to have a happier future, then make it happen. In fact, good for you for not settling with a soul-sucking job for the rest of your life.",
