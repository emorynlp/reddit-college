  "text": "Ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of studying medicine. I didn't get accepted the first time I applied and decided to take a gap year during which I enrolled into Japanese Studies major (in my country we don't have to pay for uni) to learn an Asian language while I've always wanted to do that. I liked the atmosphere and the stuff I was learning so much that 4 years after (including an amazing year in Japan), I got accepted to med school. \n\nI see the time of studying Japanese as a pretty cool experience that help me develop many important interpersonal skills and let me make incredible memories before diving into medicine. But now that I got accepted to med school (I LOVE IT!), I'm wondering if there's any way to combine these two? I'm not talking about practicing medicine in Japan, but are there any conferences/training programs in Japan/international clinics that I could take part in/gaing some experience working at in Japan? Or would this language be useful in any other way?\n\nThanks!",
