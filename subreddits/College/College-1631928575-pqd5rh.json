  "text": "Bruh. Friday night and nothing to do. My friends are all doing their own thing. I\u2019m bored as fuck, it\u2019s still early but I\u2019m bored as fuck. Might just drink alone tonight. \n\nAnyone else bored out of their fuckin minds?\n\nIt\u2019s worse in college because I know people are out having fun it\u2019s not like I\u2019m back home and can at least not have fomo\n\nEdit: ended up hanging out with some friends after all. Good night. For anyone who felt similar, you have to initiate the hangout. That\u2019s what I did.",
