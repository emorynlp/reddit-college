I was so bad in high school/early college that I couldn't even enter a room without feeling like I was going to vomit/pass out. Nothing doctors could prescribe helped at all and I ended up having to drop out of high school and complete it online before going back to college. It took me 8 years to graduate college and every semester was some sort of new fresh hell for me. There are a few tips and tricks I used to get me through it though that I'll share.   \n\n\n1. This is probably something you're already doing but scout out the seat closest to the door on the first day of every class. Knowing that you can just quietly get up and leave without bothering the class if you start feeling sick or overwhelmed takes a lot of the claustrophobia pressure off your shoulders. \n2. Plan AHEAD for presentations. Not just the content but everything down to where you'll stand and what you're going to eat on the day of. Always go first if you have the option, if you get it over with the second you walk in, you won't have time to be psyching yourself out once you've already shown up. I choose to do it on an empty stomach (I feel like I'm going to puke. If I don't eat, I know I can't puke so it's easier to ignore those feelings.)\n3. If your anxiety is really bad, let your professors know you have a chronic health problem. You don't have to go into detail at all, but it'll help you out. I found that in classes where I told the professor beforehand that I may need to step out of class occasionally, and they said that was totally fine, I almost NEVER actually did it. I used to obsessively watch the clock thinking 'okay I just need to hold on for 38 more minutes then I can leave the room'. Getting the okay to leave when I need to has totally changed that; I stopped being stressed about it knowing that if I felt sick or claustrophobic I could just get some air and then come back and it's not a big deal, and I became a lot more comfortable in those classrooms. \n4. Your life will not end if you miss a presentation. I do not in any way recommend intentionally skipping them because you will need presentation skills in most jobs, unfortunately, and you should learn them as early as you can. It's much more humiliating to bomb a talk in front of a new boss and coworkers than a room of college students. However, if you're an overall good student, in most cases missing one presentation in a class won't bomb your grade. I missed a final presentation once and still made it out of the class with a B-. Life goes on. \n5. Use the health services that your college makes available to you. Counseling is definitely offered which may help a lot if your barriers are mostly mental. If you have an underlying condition that makes your anxiety worse than you should see a doctor about it and use disability accommodations. I mostly toughed it out because I don't like medicine and it historically hasn't worked for me, but my doctor at the clinic that served a lot of students gave me a trial prescription of xanax to get me through the last round of presentations before graduation. Some people can conquer anxiety with therapy and practice, but for others there's a physical component that can't be fixed without medicine.", "author": "Contntlbreakfst", "created": 1579636874, "upvotes": 3}, "ff6ww84": {"link": "/r/college/comments/eryxub/i_really_dont_like_college/ff6ww84/", "text": "I don't necessarily agree with those saying to switch to online courses or an online degree.

It is common but it isn't healthy, especially if it is causing you to drop classes, and you need to be able to function in your career someday. You seem to realize this which is a solid first step.\n\nThe best advice I ever received was to never make decisions based on fear. I knew I didn't want to look back on my life and be regretful of everything I didn't do all because I was anxious. When I started diving right into the things that scared me, I also started to get better and I started to get happier. It didn't feel good at first, but with time, it improved.
