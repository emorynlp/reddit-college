  "text": "Hi, y\u2019all. Sorry if this is the wrong formatting and such. \n\nI\u2019m a marketing major in my senior year. I was just accepted into grad school, but I\u2019m worried about my reading speed. I\u2019ve heard you have to read A LOTTTT in grad school, but I usually take three-five minutes reading a page, and then another couple minutes taking notes. \n\nAny tips/tricks on how to read quicker or how to take better notes?",
