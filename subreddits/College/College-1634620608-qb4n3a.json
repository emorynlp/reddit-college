  "text": "So I am currently a freshman in college and I have a crush on my roommate. I was hoping it would go away by now, even after he rejected me by saying \u201che wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship so soon.\u201d The crush is still there even though he is going out with other guys, and of course, I get super jealous. I don\u2019t want to leave him (we\u2019re really go friends and he has no other friends here), but I\u2019m not sure what to do. Any advice?",
