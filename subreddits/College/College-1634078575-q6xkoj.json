      "text": "i can empathize with this. i used to not go to office hours because i never had clarifying questions about the class material. what i do now is i actively think about the lecture content & try to make connections about the current material to concepts i\u2019ve learned in previous classes. that always generates some questions that i take to office hours as conversation starters. not only does this method help you better encode the stuff you\u2019re learning, but it\u2019ll make for a far more engaging conversation with your professors.",

(I send out an intro email with my name course code, my major and a nice endnote I.e I\u2019m excited to learn about [subject] with you this semester) \n\nThe 1 professor I go to office hours I know on a better level.  \n\nAfter I review my notes I write down questions I have and visit office hours. \n\nDon\u2019t force it. If it feels forced its counters what you are trying to do.",
