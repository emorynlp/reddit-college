So I guess my question is should I try to teach myself high school math again in order to major in what I wanted to or should I figure out a different plan as to what I should do in college (or even go at all tbh)", "author": "Fiddle-my-Diddles", "created": 1632461656, "retrieved": 1632800396, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"he3utq7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pudatl/zero_clue_as_to_what_to_major_in/he3utq7/", "text": "Take prerequisites (core classes) the first year or two and then decide. \n\nPut your major address undecided", "author": "abbaabbaaa", "created": 1632500010, "upvotes": 1}, "he39zg2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pudatl/zero_clue_as_to_what_to_major_in/he39zg2/", "text": "What makes you want to do computer science/petroleum engineering?", "author": "DiscretePoop", "created": 1632491144, "upvotes": 2}, "he2vb7u": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pudatl/zero_clue_as_to_what_to_major_in/he2vb7u/", "text": "Honestly, go teach yourself the math if that\u2019s what you want to do!
