  "title:": "Should I major or minor in something I'm passionate about?",
  "text": "I'm a sophomore changing majors from pre-medicine because I hate it, but now I'm confused and lost, which is usual. I'm very passionate about English and writing, but I'm unsure if I should major in it or minor in English while majoring in something more practical, like computer science. Also, I could double-major in English and Comp Sci, but that sounds really tough (could be worth it). Everywhere I ask I receive conflicting responses: \"follow your passions\", \"be financially free\", or \"just do your passions as a hobby\".\n\nI'm heavily leaning towards Comp Sci major with English minor. Any advice on this?",

          "text": "I think it's wise to take career satisfaction into account when making this decision, but the average English major doesn't end up working as a professional writer or professor. Those jobs are relatively rare and difficult to get.  \n\nTeaching is definitely a viable, common career path for someone who majors in English, but so is [sales or office administration work. ](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/english/english-field-of-degree.htm) It's very common for humanities grads to end up working in fields unrelated to what they studied in college.",

      "text": "I would definitely lean the same way that you are. Computer science is a much more lucrative career but not that that's everything. Both English and computer science actually make great hobbies because you can read write or talk with people about books novels and literature whatever you want. But you can also write programs make video games or do data science projects whenever you want as well. So the on paper by the numbers choice would be to go with computer science but in the end I think it really depends on your personality. Are you the kind of person who can enjoy work for work and then enjoy your hobbies the rest of the day or are you a person who needs to really enjoy every bit of your work. If you think that you would get tired or burned out or bored of being a coder all day then it might be worth pursuing English keeping in mind that most English majors become technical writers teachers editors publishers and really think about what work is entailed in those careers. It's a tough choice for anybody so best of luck.",
