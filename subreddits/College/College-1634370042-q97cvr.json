  "text": "I'm in my first year, first semester of college and I just feel so frustrated, lost, and confused. I know exactly what career I want, I've been writing stories since I was 12. I want a degree in cinematics and script writing, but now I feel like it's impossible. All the English writing classes in my college are required for my degree, but they're all nonfiction essay and research paper based, and I just have never been good with essays. I don't get why fiction writers have to go through this bullshit, and I'm terrified I'm going to fail my writing class. I don't know what to do, or if there's even anything I can do, but please, I need all the advice I can get.\n\n\nI don't know if this is what this sub is for, but I just really need a group I can talk to right now.",

      "text": "You just learn essay writing, what about that? As a creative person you should be able to appreciate the art in essay writing. See it as a challenge, as an opportunity to broaden your range. Go about it playfully, have fun. Have a beginner's mindset. But the most important thing is not to lose interest or fun in writing. You might discover that essays are not so different from good fiction stories. Good luck!",

      "text": "It sounds like you put too much pressure on yourself to do what you want to do, and ONLY that, so you're freaking out about having to do something else temporarily. \n\nYou go to college to become a better all-around person. Essay writing is part of that. Essays are an art form that go back to 1580, when Michel de Montaigne published a book called *Essaie* (French for \"to try\"). Essays are *still* a key genre for creating and disseminating ideas. They are important to writing. Learning all of these things will make you a better writer of scripts, because it will make you a smarter, more thoughtful, more skilled person. \n\nYou should choose to engage with the wide variety of topics you will be exposed to in college. If you really can't do that, you can drop out, buy a copy of *Save the Cat!* and strike out on your own. Good luck.",
