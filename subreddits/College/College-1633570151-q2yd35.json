      "text": "Not necessarily a huge ego but a fragile one. My class is on zoom. About 400 kids are signed up for the course.\n\nMy professor\u2019s mood / tone of voice is entirely dependent on how many kids log onto the lecture on a given day. If only 200 show up, he mumbles the entire time and ends class early. If 400 show up, he projects his voice and gives great lectures. Very strange to say the least. You can have a PHD, 6 figure salary and still care about 18 year olds \u201clike\u201d you.",
