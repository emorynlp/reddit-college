  "text": "I\u2019m moving on September 1st. This is crazy. I have felt stuck (physically and mentally) at my parents\u2019 house for years now. The apartment is a teeny tiny studio in a very rundown building. It literally looks like the before montage in an episode of \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d but it\u2019s very cheap so I don\u2019t care. It has a full kitchen/dining area, bathroom, living space, and a big closet that can fit all my clothes. AND it\u2019s in walking distance from my school. It\u2019s perfect for the next year or two until I graduate. I plan to be pretty minimal since it\u2019s a tiny space. A couch, bed, tv, maybe a dresser that can be used as a TV stand and storage, and a table that can be used as a desk and eating area. I\u2019m probably going to be visiting home a lot so I don\u2019t get lonely (which I\u2019m a bit scared of). It\u2019s only an hour drive. Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Advice about living alone for the first time, being social in college so I don\u2019t get lonely, living in small areas, etc. etc. etc. Thanks!",

      "text": "Congrats! Speaking as someone who's been living away from Mom and Dad for a decade and has moved approximately once a year for the past ten years, I have some tips.\n\n* When you pack your shit, designate one box/backpack/etc as \"Night 1 Essentials.\" Fill it with basic things that you know you will need immediately upon carrying in the last load of stuff: a change of clothes (and/or pajamas), your phone charger, basic toiletries (toothbrush and toothpaste, hairbrush/comb, hand soap, and whatever you need for your most basic shower), **a plunger** and a roll of toilet paper, maybe a shelf-stable, quick-to-prepare food. The idea is to have the essentials set up so that you don't have to start unpacking right away to do things like use the toilet, take a shower, get ready for bed. Moving is exhausting even when you have help.  \n* Related, buy a plunger before you need one. You can get them for like five dollars at Walgreens, throw it away when you move out and give yourself the gift of a new plunger with every new apartment. You can afford $3-5 every couple of years. [Make sure it's a toilet plunger, not a sink plunger.](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5bb042_8d961aa638694477a264281b5a671499.jpg)  \n* Also related, make your bed as soon as you get it set up in the new place. It'll take two minutes, and that way and you won't have to do it later when you're tired and sweaty as fuck.  \n* Use backpacks, duffel bags, and suitcases to pack things in as much as you can - they're all much easier to transport than cardboard boxes. For the boxes that you do use, write a list of the box's contents on the outside, so you'll have an easier time unpacking. My packing strategy starts out very organized, but by the end I always end up with boxes of miscellaneous shit that didn't get packed before, and having a list of what random junk is in this or that box helps a lot.\n* If you have friends helping you move, it is customary to buy them food afterward as a thank-you. Pizza or Chinese takeout is standard. (Beer is also appropriate payment if you're of-age, but it sounds like you may not be.)\n* For your clothes on hangers, use trash bags to protect them in transit and make them easier to carry - [it's just about the only useful tip Buzzfeed has ever published](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/a8/da/4ba8da73e51ed19916328b9781d770a3.png) (and even that image came from Pinterest).  \n* You can get a *lot* of basic home goods at the dollar store (cleaning supplies, dishes/cooking implements, paper goods, etc). If you take even halfway decent care of the reusable stuff, it'll last at least the rest of college, but even if it doesn't, you spent like five bucks on it, so whatever.  \n* Have more than one \"mess kit\" (plate, bowl, mug/cup, fork, spoon, knife - you don't need to buy them as a matched set or anything, but just, have more than one of each of those things), so that if you ever do have a guest (or guests), you can share a meal with them and they can eat like civilized folks. 90% of my eating utensils came from Goodwill or the Dollar Store.  \n* You can drink cold things out of hot cups, but you can't drink hot things out of cold cups. It is 100% permissible to drink everything out of coffee mugs.  \n* When scouting out furniture (whether from the thrift store or the side of the road), plan for the eventuality of guests. One chair may be enough for you - you only got one ass - but at some point you will bring over a friend, maybe a ~special~ friend if that's your thing, and they will also want to sit (and maybe even sleep!) somewhere.  \n* It sounds like you have a place to yourself - awesome! What's not awesome is suddenly having to be your own Dish Fairy, Laundry Fairy, and Toilet Paper Fairy, if someone other than you has been largely responsible for those things for most of your life. Schedule time for chores - set alarm reminders on your phone, if you have to. 6 PM is Dish Washin' Time. Saturday morning is Laundry Day. Whatever works for your schedule, block out the time and make yourself do the things.",

Its easier just to not - but I get some people NEED to go home and be social thats just not my cup of tea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't have a job lined up and want one I recommend getting one at a restaurant. Yes it sucks. Horribly. BUT you get a free meal every shift (well as long as you don't work at some corporate trashfire) and if its a real restaurant you can probably even take ingredients home to make your own stuff. It saves money long term for sure. Work and school were my life I didn't have a whole lot of friends outside of the people I met in my core classes (which ended up being my roomates year 3 and 4) but I made really good friends with my co-workers, bosses, managers, etc which is always nice because if you're not a shit worker you get even more perks to everything.",

Make sure to get kitchen essentials early on if you are gonna cook. Plates, utensils, dish rack, dish soap, sponges, etc. I remember eating off of paper plates for a while when I first moved in to my studio lol. Make sure you have a WiFi router or know that you are gonna get one with your WiFi plan.",

Usually better prices for high quality, solid wood items.\nDefinitely cook rather than eat out (you'll save so, so much money).\nIf you live close to campus, you can still either hang out there a lot or even invite a couple friends to your place if it can accomodate guests. Living alone for the first time is intimidating but it is also very freeing!\nAnd also: keep your place tidy and clean relatively often. Having a dirty or cluttered place can really put you in a funk.\nGood luck!",

Maybe I\u2019ll join a club or something. Hopefully being super busy working and doing schoolwork and working out will keep me sane.",

Honestly, you are going to realize that you use a lot less things that you think and that you can manage to fit all your stuff without too many issues.

You really don't need a TV nor a couch. \n\nI used my desk as my dining table at first, but I realized a seperate table helps a lot. Eating on your work desk will make it messy. I barely have counter space in my kitchen, so I use my dining table as a prep table when I cook.\n\nAnyways, a tiny studio really isn't that bad. Freedom to do whatever you want without having the fear to disturb other people is great. I'm sure you will enjoy it and be more productive.",
