  "text": "Hey so I have a bio assignment where all of the question are of the \"what is [this thing] and give a description of its function\" variety or similar.\n\nI put my assignment through a couple plagiarism Checkers and they returned that my assignment is plagiarized. So I looked around the web and found that all of the assignment copies online read similarly to mine and there are a lot of online sources (courses, wikis, etc) that also read similarly. \n\nIs this expected and are the plagiarism Checkers effective for these kinds of assignments and non essays in general?",
