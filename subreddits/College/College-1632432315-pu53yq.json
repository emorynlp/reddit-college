  "title:": "Going to online school in California while living in Iowa?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI haven't been to college in about a decade, and I've decided to go back and continue. My background is primarily software/hardware engineering for all computer systems. I'm not opposed to a trade school, either. The thing is, being native in California, I took the High School Proficiency exam in order to enroll in college before finishing highschool. Life happened and I was unable to finish school at the time. I believe this means that I do not have a highschool diploma equivalent that is recognized outside of the state of California. This pretty much forces me to take classes in California, but I recently moved to Iowa in order to NOT be apart of California. My roommate is currently doing online at Grand Canyon University located in Arizona while he is stationed in Iowa.\n\nI have no idea where to start, so if there's anyone with a modicum of understanding, please throw it my way.\n\nThanks!",
