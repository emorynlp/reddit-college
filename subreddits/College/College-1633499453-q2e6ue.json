  "text": "I am in a government class and it is a boring and hard class. We just took a test and I failed and got a 57. I did study and attempted to do my best to pass, but I simply couldn't. The textbook for this class is SUPER LONG chapters and takes forever to read. I get 100% on all class work (It's a weird activity which you eventually get 100% if you keep trying), which is 23.5% percent of our grade, I got 100% on my syllables which is worth 5%, and the other 2 exams are worth 23.5% as well.\n\nI need a 3.25 GPA to enter the program I need. I can't afford to take a low grade in this class because I am already struggling with Math since it's a asynchronous class.\n\nIs there any good tactics, strategies, or anything I could use to pass?",
