  "text": "I'm looking for an online undergraduate Ex Phys class to enroll in for this coming winter session (2021 going into 2022). The school I normally use for online classes requires this one to be in person because there is a lab portion at that school. \n\nI am a graduate student, but I need this undergrad class to complete my program requirements. It is not offered at my local community college outside of the regular semester sessions. \n\nThank you in advance for your help.",
