The best thing to do is to take a *hard* and *honest* look at yourself.  If you're the type of person who can do the work and stay on top of things *on a day-to-day basis*, you might be fine.  On the other hand, if you know yourself to be the type of person who tends to put things off and only really concentrates a day or two before the exams or the project due date, you could quickly find yourself overwhelmed with that many courses, several of which are known to be challenging.  If the latter is the case, then consider taking fewer credits than 21.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632500764, "upvotes": 1}, "he33fn4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puitvt/how_bad_are_these_classes_for_21_credits/he33fn4/", "text": "If your goal is a PhD I'd advise taking fewer credits because it's extremely important to keep your GPA high and the more classes you take, the more likely it is that you won't have enough time to put in the effort necessary to do well in your classes. \n\nIf you don't really care about grad school then your GPA won't matter so much so it won't be as risky taking so many classes. Keep in mind that how much time each class takes up often depends on the professor (even though the content taught in STEM courses is fairly standardized, the amount of homework assigned is not). All you need is one class to be a time sink before your GPA starts taking a hit when your schedule is this tight, so proceed with caution.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632487998, "upvotes": 3}}}
