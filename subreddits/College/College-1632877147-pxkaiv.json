  "text": "Looking for some help from my fellow students. I have to use Word for my papers. For some reason when I save it as a PDF to send through Canvas it reformats it and gets rid of my paragraph indentations. This is driving me crazy and I'm currently trying to submit a paper that it's happening to \ud83d\ude29\n\nAny ideas?",
