  "text": "\\*/sorry if some of it doesn't make sense im here just shaking and partially crying while writing this as im just scared... If I dont Write back right away its because i am trying to sleep as I have just been getting 1-2 hours of sleep at most if that and I just took 2 sleeping pills given to me and am really just trying to fall asleep. so sorry if its not right away but I will try as soon as I see it./\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I have had mental problems it seems like I just cant think about anything or retain information, and I really dont know what to do as I have been having mental breakdowns and just being loss. I am the type of person that has never cried about anything or needed what seemed like mental help but I am in a bind with school and have no Idea who to ask questions to.\n\nThis paragraph will be more background/story\n\nSo college has been mainly focused on computer or electrical engineering, but even here I was already having problems with the school itself, I had to take a year off because of fafsa problems, then after that when i finally started I started at a community college and for the first two semesters I am put into Classes I should not be in as they aren't for my degree, so I take a total of 4 classes that dont pertain to my degree, then they finally put me in the right classes (I was in a fitness degree path cant remember what it is) but this had now put me back a year and to get the financial aid needed I had to be full time so this lead to me taking classes I did not need so now I am about 32 credit hours of classes I didnt need, following this the programming classes that they had put me in were also not part of the degree path BC while they did put me in the engineering path they also put me into this as something that was needed for the associates degree something I wasn't going to get nor have I. so then this added another 8 hours so at this point Im racking up hours I should not have(like non credit degree hours), I didnt think about it since no one had told me about this mattering. so I finally finish up my basics and left to college, A little about the programming classes since this will be relevant later Programming 1 was more about pseudo code and learning principles in programming and programing 2 was learning to code in java script and it was just more and introduction. \n\nNow moving onto my uni, upon getting into the school I was accepted into the engineering program, and everything was going great but each one of my professors in physics kept telling me that that comp engineering wasn't worth it and that I should just do the cyber security program, and with covid just then hitting and the engineering needing to be in person for the abet certification i wanted to see if it would be worth it and went over to my counselor and told them I wanted to and they did but they placed me in the programming path not the business path as I had more credit filling them, they then decide to throw me into the more advanced classes (not as in honors but for coding) so this then leads to them thinking I know a language that i dont. Like they expect me to know C coding but I know none of it, this is just the semester after covid hitting so now everything is online and here I am not knowing the language trying to learn data structures. and because of my professor getting covid I only had three assignments and two of them were group so I got a good grade in the class, a grade I did not deserve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow be me in this semester I am about to hit 141 credits and completely lost in my classes as I dont know the language needed. at 150 hours the cost of tuition in texas hits double (becomes out of state tuition) and I wont have fafsa anymore. I have been having mental breakdowns and even having some pretty dark thought I just dont know what to do. I have a bit of loans taken out because of the uni but not much and they are government loans, but if I dont even know If I want to do programming, I wanetd to do the business but If I was to switch that would be like 80 hours at out of state tuition so I just dont know what to do Im looking for advice on what I can do, How I can pay, I have no credit, My mom has bad credit as we are poor and she has been a single mother so im guessing loans are out and im just really stressing and crying. any help on direction would be great. I have been thinking of taking a semester off so that I could learn the language but then what does that do to my fafsa and everything else. I really dont know what I can do or what I should be doing right now and I am just not stable it seems. On top of this for the past year and a half my brain seems to not want to absorb information and I just cant study, or even focus. I have been to the doctors and they give me antidepressant's but they do nothing. So what Can I do what would yall do any way I can rectify what I can do with college is there anyway to get rid of hours I am really not knowing what to do.",
