I liked having my freshman year online especially because I was taking mostly gen eds and was happy to be safe from COVID. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to going to campus because I liked the freedom provided by studying from home. However, after being at college for about 3 weeks, I\u2019ve realized how much I needed in-person. After 1.5 years of little socialization outside my family, even my introverted self has been pretty outgoing and chatty, with people in my dorm including my roommate, classmates, people from clubs, professors, etc. It\u2019s also been nice waking up early and having an actual routine instead of rolling out of bed and getting onto zoom. I feel more productive that way. And I love my family, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I really needed a break from them after spending all of quarantine with them. I also have more confidence now that I actually have to somewhat \u201cadult\u201d and make my own choices. I would say that is the case because I was relatively sheltered growing up. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m very curious to hear what others think on this topic! I\u2019m particularly interested in your experience if you, like me, were surprised at how much you enjoy in-person college.", "author": "Affectionate_Wish", "created": 1632247276, "retrieved": 1632946586, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdrzmbp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pso8i8/anyone_like_inperson_surprisingly_much_more_than/hdrzmbp/", "text": "Far worse, my dorm is so dead that I might as well just be at home.

I know people my year or more who prefer online, while I also know people who prefer in person. Personally, I think In person is the best way to actually learn things. For things like gen eds or electives, I think online is great so I don\u2019t have to over burden myself with taking a course that has absolutely nothing to do with what I want to actually study and work towards. I also love in person for that socialization aspect of things you mentioned. Actually seeing people and talking to them is a huge morale booster, even tho going in person is added work load. Making friends is hard to do on a webcam, if I use one at all lol", "author": "YungFreudian", "created": 1632247559, "upvotes": 3}}}
