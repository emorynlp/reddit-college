  "text": "I am a biochem major and I absolutely hate math. Doing calculations without applications just doesn\u2019t do it for me. Would it be worth enrolling at a community college go get them done easier? Also, is doing classes over the summer worth it? I find that I forget information when I don\u2019t use it all summer, so would it be worth enrolling in classes over the summer just so I don\u2019t fall out of the loop?",
