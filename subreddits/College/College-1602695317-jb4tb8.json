If you\u2019re not learning, then seriously try to learn instead of just memorizing. Spend time with the material. Do more research, approach it from different angles. Learning takes actual effort. If you want to LEARN as opposed to MEMORIZE, really dive into things and attempt to master it. Watch youtube videos, spend your free time reading a book on the subject. College was supposed to be about developing your intellect, not getting a job. In the job market there are NO guarantees- treat college as its own experience that requires its own mindset.

You're not actually going to remember everything. But you are learning and you are understanding, and because you've remembered it before and understood it before, then you'll be able to pick it up more easily in the future. For example, I have to use calc 1/2 knowledge in a lot of classes. I haven't taken calculus since high school, 2 years ago, but it didn't take my long to remember most of the rules and methods. It didn't have to be \"retaught\" to me because I picked it up again easily. And a ton of this stuff you won't need to apply in real life, but if you ever need to, you can easily relearn it. That's the point. \n\n\nIt's important that you understand and not memorize, and this is especially important for majors that require little memorization and more problem solving and understanding (engineering, math/physics, some sciences, computer science). If you try to memorize your way through the class and the major you'll end up performing extremely poorly in the future.\n\n\nI personally feel very uncomfortable with just memorizing content; if I panic on an exam I only have my memory and my hours of studying to fall back on, and if I forget somehow then it's over. I need to have an understanding of things to feel prepared. That's probably a good habit to get into: forcing yourself to understand concepts.\n\n\nFor example, take a mathematical formula. Try to understand why exactly it makes sense, or why you're performing a specific computation, rather than spitting out the formula. For Chemistry, try to understanding why molecules interact, how the electrons and polarity will favor certain reactions over others.
