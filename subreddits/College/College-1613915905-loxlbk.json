Last fall I took a course and had an A in it the entire way through. A week after I had turned in my final exam and a recording of my presentation (which I had also given live) to blackboard my professor gave me a 0% for both. This was strange since the exam was through blackboard and I got a 94% on it already. He then gave me an incomplete for the semester. I contacted him immediately and it worked out that he didn\u2019t see my final exam and presentation submissions and thought I never turned them in. I sent him the screenshot of the submission date and exam grade and he said he would contact the registrar and have my grade fixed again. This was December. In January I contacted the registrar and no one had received any form from him, so I contacted him. I emailed him twice over the course of 2 weeks and he never responded. I contacted the chair of the department and asked her to step in. He responded to her and sent an email saying \u201chere is the form\u201d but did not attach anything to the email. The chair tried again, and this time he sent another students confidential disability information whose name is close to mine (btw I\u2019m attached to all these emails). After that I didn\u2019t hear from either of them for 2 weeks. I emailed the chair again to try again. It\u2019s been a week and now the professor won\u2019t even respond to her. By now, the registrar had changed my grade to an F since supposedly I never completed the course. I don\u2019t know what to do. Can someone give me advice on how to fix this? I graduate soon and the graduation office is telling me I won\u2019t graduate if I don\u2019t fix it.\n\nUpdate 2/23: I waited just a few more days to see if the professor would reply since I knew he would have class today and maybe he would respond. But he didn\u2019t, so I compiled all my emails to him and to the chair and put them in a word document. I then explained the situation in an email to the Dean and attached the word document to that. She responded literally seconds later and said she\u2019ll get this resolved. Hopefully we\u2019ll get it done soon :D\n\nSecond update: it\u2019s the same day as the first update and the Dean already took care of my grade.
