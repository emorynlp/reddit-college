      "text": "Start with your school. They should have scholarships for different things, such as your major, gender, race, ethnicity or special circumstances. Then use your network. Do you have a job? Does your job have any scholarships for employees? What about your parents place of employment? Also keep your GPA at a 3.0, since a lot of scholarships have GPA requirements to get scholarships and to keep the scholarships.",
