I had pop ups in my LMS and red flashing buttons and multiple emails a day with hypothetical invoices for tens of thousands of dollars and the words \"you must take action now.\" I applied brcause it was so disruptive.. When I logged into the FA portal for my school there was no apparent decline button. When I did figure it out and decline, I had to go through multiple steps and warnings. I asked a classmate what accepting loans looked like and she showed me. One click and done. So, as I said be cautious if your institution goes this route.

You def need it to get federal loans which are way better (still a rip) than private loans when it comes to interest rates and payment plans. Another option is to find a community college close to you, they are waaaaaay affordable and sometimes offer payment plans on tuition.  My community college allows me to pay each terms tuition in two chunks and that helps a lot.",

The student is solely responsible for costs of education. FAFSA is a standardized system that checks for Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Part of that is saying \"since you come from a household with an income of X or greater, we expect your parents to contribute.\"\n\nParents are not obligated to contribute. You also do not need to be poor in order to qualify for scholarships, merit-based aid, etc.",

My parents never made a lot of money but because they owned 2 houses (asset value) I never qualified for grants until I turned 24. They look at your taxes to determine estimated financial contribution. the first two times I went to school I had to take out federal loans because my parents asset value put them over the threshold for grants. Unless i had a judge sign an affidavit that I was completely independent they counted my parents finances with mine until 24. And btw I\u2019ve lived in a different state from them for over a decade.  I\u2019m the oldest of 5 and we all have gone to college. Look at the fafsa website, it\u2019s on there, along with directions on how to declare yourself independent from your parents.",

While *your situation* does happen, and it's incredibly unfortunate, think of *all* situations: people would just have 0 income by not reporting their parental information.\n\nOf course, there should be a process by which people who can demonstrate independence should be able to (though that's a different conversation). Again, FAFSA doesn't mean your parents are paying. It's calculating how much *they could contribute if they were to.*",
