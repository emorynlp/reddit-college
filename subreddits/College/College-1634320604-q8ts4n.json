  "title:": "I live at home and attend a local university. How do I soundproof my room (for a reasonable price)",
  "text": "Moving out is quite expensive, and living at home is pretty easy. I can't make any sort of noise at night because my parents get woken up so easily. Even in my own room, I have absolutely zero privacy. I want to be able to play video games late at night and not worry about talking at normal level without worrying about them hearing every one of my conversations and especially just not waking them up. Anyone here know any effective methods to soundproof a room to improve my quality of life?",
