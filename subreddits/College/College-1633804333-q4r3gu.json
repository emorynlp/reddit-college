  "text": "What the title says\\^\n\nI have do D's, a C and a B. This is my first accounting semester- online. I hate it. So much.\n\nI am never fully motivated and it is so hard to concentrate on tedious assignments. I am going to a Uni that is four hours south of me and because I am only 17 I cannot even live on campus. I want to take a break next semester but I feel like I might have a better chance of doing better. All I know is that my GPA (if I pass, which I think I will because passing is C, around 70-73%) will definitely be a 2.0, maybe a 2.3 if I get a B or two.\n\nI need advice- I am afraid to talk to my parents about it as they are paying the tuition (3,600 per semester, not bad I think) and I don't want them to know that I am essentially failing.\n\nHow can I boost my motivation and my attention span? I have tried studying in different places around the house, eating nutritious food and drinking water. I do exercise a couple times a week by playing tennis for 1.5 hours. I feel as if I'm lazy- that or burnt out.\n\nThoughts?",

You will also find that sometimes excelling at one area of the subject pulls your grade up significantly.\n\nI remember when I looked like I was failing. I got a failing Grade for 65% of the course was at about 48% of overall marks available where a passing grade was 50% of the entire course.\n\n\nin  the remaining 35% I excelled and got like a large proportion of the marks on offer.\n\nOn those classes I got a C+  as my high successes made up for my slim failures.\n\nIn another class I scraped through after failing every assignment bar one.
