  "text": "So there\u2019s this student in my classroom. I don\u2019t mean this in a rude way, but it\u2019s very clear they have issues. \n\n\nFor instance, speech problems (pronounces stuff very incorrectly), trouble communicating (instead of \u201cwhat letter is that?\u201d he\u2019ll ask \u201cx?\u201d, then when asked what he means he\u2019ll go, \u201cletter\u2026 x?\u201d). And other stuff like when the teacher is checking attendance and we all say \u201chere\u201d he goes \u201c IM HERE! hey!\u201d \n\n\nHe also was like hyperventilating the first two classes for the entire period \u201c. He\u2019s SUPER sweet and I can tell he gets nervous / laughs when he gets emberassed by the teacher  \n\n\nAnyways, I noticed the teacher getting increasingly annoyed with him every class, which makes me seriously despise this teacher. In my opinion, he needs to either a. Have more patience or b. Tell the student to save most of his questions for office hours. \n\n\nToday, the student talked while the teacher was explaining a test. The teacher automatically goes \u201ccan you shut the hell up?!\u201d. Now **obviously he shouldn\u2019t have been talking so I didn\u2019t say anything**, but the teacher has no chill with him. \n\n\nKeep in mind **OTHER STUDENTS RANDOMLY TALKED** and he said nothing to them\n\n\nOther stuff too. Like today the student asked (once) what chapter we were on and the teacher, with an attitude, said \u201cI already said it.\u201d \n\n\nHe also has said stuff like \u201cyeah (smug chuckle) you\u2019re gonna need help if you don\u2019t get this\u201d. Or like \u201cyou should know this\u201d but he says it hella rude and **specifically only to the student**. \n\nAnd other random stuff like \u201care you serious\u201d, \u201ccome on\u2026\u201d \u201cwhat do you **think** the board says\u201d(the teachers penmanship is awful ) only when the student asks questions \n\nI\u2019m non confrontational, but i think it\u2019s complete BS that he obviously is being rude to this student because he knows he won\u2019t stick up for himself.\n\nOn one hand I feel like helping the student out when the teacher is being an asshole to him, but I can tell he gets emberassed so I don\u2019t want to make him feel worse. \n\n\nWhat do you think?",

Report it to someone as soon as you can and maybe reach out to the student if it's appropriate? It might help him to just know someone is looking out for him.",

The ball is in their court and you pass off the responsibility to them nothing else to it you're just making them aware of an issue. Whether they act is on them.\n\nThere definitely is a chance nothing will happen and it would help a lot more if the student themselves went to either disability office for official status or reported it themselves.

For example \"At about X PM, student asked \\_\\_\\_\\_, and teacher replied \"are you serious, what do you think the board says?\" In contrast, when other students ask questions \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". Time, day, what happened, and make it clear that the student is singled out and treated differently. Talk to the student himself and make sure everyone is on the same page too. And if you can, get other classmates to sign onto the list. More people who can testify the better.\n\n2) Talk to the teacher, get their side of it. What they're doing isn't okay of course, but barring absolutely grievous offenses it's best to talk it out directly with the person first.\n\n3)If no solution happens, escalate to department chair, if nothing happens, figure out who they answer to, and escalate...etcetera Maybe get to the point of filing a formal legal complaint, although I wouldn't know exactly what that'd entail in your country's legal system.\n\nSome people point out that it's very possible the teacher was never notified, and that happens. I remember growing up we once had a new classmate with asperger's and in like the first day they had a breakdown that put the teacher on the spot. Nope, they didn't handle it very well. But you know what the teacher did? They figured out that the kid had special needs, and the school went to work on making sure everyone was on the same page & knew how to support the student.  It is October, months into the semester, far past the point of reasonable doubt, and somebody, whether it's the teacher, or the school, is seriously dropping the ball.",

      "text": "It's interesting you mentioned this as something similar happened with me in one of my classes. There was this special needs kid  in my class one semester and he had no self control whatsoever. He would blurt out random things during class, pass gas during class (loudly too) and would constantly interrupt the professor. The professor honestly had NO patience with him and just flat out ignored him or would raise his voice to him pretty frequently.\n\nIn this case I did understand the professors anger as one day he was talking to us as a class (without the kid there) and told us that NO ONE (department or parents) had told him this student was going to be in his class. So he essentially had no idea the kid was going to be in his class and had no support on how to help this kid get through class. He's just a regular guy and isn't trained to handle a special needs student who obviously needs more help and patience than this professor could give him. They essentially just dumped him on the him and assumed he would take care of it. In my eyes this is the wrong way to go about things. He was already juggling a million other classes/work and let his temper get the best of him with this student. He apologized to the kid a lot and to us as a class as he just didn't have the mental capacity to teach us and give his kid the special attention he needed.\n\nThis might apply to your case too since if this student has known issues that the school and parents know, then I think it's common courtesy to pass this along to the professor instead of just waiting for the inevitable to happen. I know this doesn't justify him yelling at the kid as he's human too and everyone should be treated with respect. But some kids need extra help and special attention and some professor just flat out aren't trained or are ready to do that. In this specific case I think it's too late for a lot to happen so the best course of action would be to talk to someone higher up, or maybe even to the professor. Talking about it is definitely better than letting this kid get yelled at anymore.",

      "text": "If you are being put in a classroom environment that makes you uncomfortable, you're not being \"sensitive\" or overreacting. In your position, I would absolutely tell someone what is happening. However, since I am not the student that is targeted by the prof, I would frame it as \"the classroom environment makes me uncomfortable\" because you can't speak for that student, but you can speak for yourself and how much it bothers you and makes you feel uncomfortable. And in that case it might be useful to talk to others in the class to see if they feel the same way because the if that's the consensus, it will help push this issue forward quicker with someone like the chair. To address the specific issue with the student, I would frame it as \"a student in the classroom exhibits what appears to be neurodivergent behaviors and how the professor interacts with that student, from a bystander point of view, is unprofessional and uncomfortable.\" And due to the hostile behavior by the professor in this situation, convey that you feel uncomfortable discussing this behavior with the professor directly.",

My second option would be Office of Educational Accessibility. \"I have a classmate that appears to be autistic or maybe has a social skills issue. Anyhow, I've noticed that our professor is being particularly rude and borderline abusive towards him, refusing to clarify answers and mocking him. I'm worried my classmate is not getting the level of instruction he is entitled to, and the situation in the classroom has begin to impact the learning environment.\" This should have enough EA/EO words for them to address the professor and follow up to ensure your classmate is looked after.",
