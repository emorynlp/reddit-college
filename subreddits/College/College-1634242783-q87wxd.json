  "title:": "Teacher is a little rude to student with issues\u2026 it deeply upsets me",
  "text": "So there\u2019s this student in my classroom. I don\u2019t mean this in a rude way, but it\u2019s very clear they have issues. \n\n\nFor instance, speech problems (pronounces stuff very incorrectly), trouble communicating (instead of \u201cwhat letter is that?\u201d he\u2019ll ask \u201cx?\u201d, then when asked what he means he\u2019ll go, \u201cletter\u2026 x?\u201d). And other stuff like when the teacher is checking attendance and we all say \u201chere\u201d he goes \u201c IM HERE! hey!\u201d \n\n\nHe also was like hyperventilating the first two classes for the entire period \u201c. He\u2019s SUPER sweet and I can tell he gets nervous / laughs when he gets emberassed by the teacher  \n\n\nAnyways, I noticed the teacher getting increasingly annoyed with him every class, which makes me seriously despise this teacher. In my opinion, he needs to either a. Have more patience or b. Tell the student to save most of his questions for office hours. \n\n\nToday, the student talked while the teacher was explaining a test. The teacher automatically goes \u201ccan you shut the hell up?!\u201d. Now **obviously he shouldn\u2019t have been talking so I didn\u2019t say anything**, but the teacher has no chill with him. \n\n\nKeep in mind **OTHER STUDENTS RANDOMLY TALKED** and he said nothing to them\n\n\nOther stuff too. Like today the student asked (once) what chapter we were on and the teacher, with an attitude, said \u201cI already said it.\u201d \n\n\nHe also has said stuff like \u201cyeah (smug chuckle) you\u2019re gonna need help if you don\u2019t get this\u201d. Or like \u201cyou should know this\u201d but he says it hella rude and **specifically only to the student**. \n\nAnd other random stuff like \u201care you serious\u201d, \u201ccome on\u2026\u201d \u201cwhat do you **think** the board says\u201d(the teachers penmanship is awful ) only when the student asks questions \n\nI\u2019m non confrontational, but i think it\u2019s complete BS that he obviously is being rude to this student because he knows he won\u2019t stick up for himself.\n\nOn one hand I feel like helping the student out when the teacher is being an asshole to him, but I can tell he gets emberassed so I don\u2019t want to make him feel worse. \n\n\nWhat do you think?",

No teacher should ever say something like that no matter how disruptive a student is. Especially not to a student who may have limited control over his actions or speech. Report it to someone as soon as you can and maybe reach out to the student if it's appropriate? It might help him to just know someone is looking out for him.",
