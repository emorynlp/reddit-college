  "text": "Hello all, \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of being looked down upon by family/friends/friends of family and friends for deciding to study Psychology bachelors online. I\u2019d prefer face to face but I couldn\u2019t beat free tuition at this one particular school because my father is employed there. However, as I finish it up, I\u2019m a bit concerned if I\u2019ll find a job. I\u2019m also minoring in criminal justice to expand my academic resume a bit and open a few more opportunities for jobs.",

No one asks whether your degree is online or not, and honestly, no one cares. Screw everyone who isn't supporting your decision to seek higher education.",
