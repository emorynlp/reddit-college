  "title:": "Making friends in college as a nontraditional student",
  "text": "I'm 31 and will be returning to community college as soon as campus is able to open back up, I went for one quarter before the pandemic hit and was able to make some nice connections with fellow students but since I'm in intro classes most other students are at least ten years younger than me with a few much older. I am hoping to ultimately become a dance teacher, so I certainly don't mind honing my mentorship skills in the meantime, but I was hoping some other nonconventional students might share their experiences making friends in college! I expect there's a fair bit of luck/fate involved, especially since I'm planning to pursue a traditionally younger major. I also wonder about the etiquette surrounding friendship with professors as an \"older\" student? Obviously each college experience is unique and I'll ultimately just have to wait and see, but it always helps me feel more comfortable to hear about other people's experiences and perspectives!",
