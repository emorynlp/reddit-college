  "title:": "Making friends in college as a nontraditional student",
  "text": "I'm 31 and will be returning to community college as soon as campus is able to open back up, I went for one quarter before the pandemic hit and was able to make some nice connections with fellow students but since I'm in intro classes most other students are at least ten years younger than me with a few much older. I am hoping to ultimately become a dance teacher, so I certainly don't mind honing my mentorship skills in the meantime, but I was hoping some other nonconventional students might share their experiences making friends in college! I expect there's a fair bit of luck/fate involved, especially since I'm planning to pursue a traditionally younger major. I also wonder about the etiquette surrounding friendship with professors as an \"older\" student? Obviously each college experience is unique and I'll ultimately just have to wait and see, but it always helps me feel more comfortable to hear about other people's experiences and perspectives!",

      "text": "I started college at 26 (30 now and in grad school) and honestly I was glad that I started later in life. I was able to make some friendships with younger classmates that could very well be lasting long into the future. Definitely can bring some wisdom to younger classmates (I definitely have given some to my younger classmates and friends). \n\nIn terms of professors, I generally found that if professors noticed (I don\u2019t think all of them knew or cared) they seemed to find it positive. I won\u2019t say it is always the case, but older students do tend to have a different attitude about school, I would say because of real world experience and sometimes a stronger work ethic. I\u2019m not sure about making friends with professors exactly, but definitely interacting with them can be very good. There may be professionalism concerns about being friends while you are a student of theirs, but having a good professional relationship can be a good option (networking and references).",
