  "text": "I\u2019m a music education major but I don\u2019t like the education part of it. I don\u2019t really care about the children either so I think that maybe this isn\u2019t the right field for me, but I do love music and I was thinking about switching to Computer Science Major and a music minor because I feel like that would make me a little more unique than some other Computer science majors. But I\u2019m in my 3rd year already but I\u2019m not taking 15 credits a semester so I still have like 3 years left. Thoughts?",
