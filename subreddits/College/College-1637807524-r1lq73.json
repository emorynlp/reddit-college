  "text": "Hi y'all! My professor for a course I'm taking forgot to tell us about our research paper due in less than a week. She hadn't published instructions (still hasn't) but did inform us that it's due next week and needs to be in MLA format. I have no clue how to go about this. The vagueness and the suddenness is frustrating honestly and I'm trying to manage a lot of homework on what I thought would be a couple days off of school for fall. Does anyone have any advice on writing a 10 page research paper in about 5 days? I'm exhausted and she's already overloading us with other work but I need to do this paper otherwise I won't get credit for the class. How do I keep enough energy to do this? I'm already burnt out as it is.",

Those were not very fun, but at least you felt amazing once you finished it.\n\nIf you haven't already, send her an email and mention you are trying to balance multiple things being due at the same time. Do you know what you will have to be researching, or at least an idea? If so, start researching now. At least get some basic sources ready. Even if you aren't quite sure, find some good basic multi-purpose sources that you will need.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "Honestly, I would contact the department head for that course/professor. Your professor should be held accountable and you shouldn\u2019t lose money over someone who can\u2019t do their job. In the email I would include screenshots of the syllabus, the recent notification about the paper, and the lack of instructions. Then maybe give the department a call (if you can) letting them know you contacted them about something pretty urgent (since its due in a week). You can try to do the paper if you want just incase it doesn\u2019t work out, but this isn\u2019t your fault nor is it due to laziness/lack of motivation. Research papers should never be written in a week for you to actually learn what you need to. Sorry you have a shit professor. Good luck!",
