  "text": "Okay so what happened during quarantine was that I was really struggling mentally and didn't talk to a lot of my friends, so naturally we stopped talking. Now that I'm back on my college campus, I've tried asking them if they have any issue with me, and I sometimes try to have conversation with them but they barely reply. I found a new friend group which barely calls me to events, I have to keep texting and asking them what they are upto? But when I'm with them, they seem to enjoy my company and I seem to enjoy theirs. And these friends that I stopped talking with, during quarantine, seem to have made other friends(also friends of mine), but when they became friends, all of them stopped talking to me, I don't know what's up, I feel alone sometimes and just want a new set of friends. Ahhhh",
