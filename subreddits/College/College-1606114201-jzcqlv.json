I flunked classes and didn\u2019t really mind if I got a D or C. In college I have been trying more and learning how to study. My grades aren\u2019t perfect but they\u2019ve been mostly higher than the classes average which made me feel good about myself.\n\nBut this one class, my professor is super confusing and with online learning its harder for me to grasp information not to mention that he\u2019s an older guy that doesn\u2019t understand technology. I\u2019ve been doing okay in his class but we had this one essay that was super confusing. It wasn\u2019t very typical and the instructions were strange. \n\nHe\u2019s \u201cclarified\u201d before but it didn\u2019t make it any easier. I wrote the essay and it definitely wasn\u2019t worth a A+ but I fulfilled all the requirements and did everything needed. So today I opened my grade book and saw I got a 0% on the essay worth 20% of my grade.\n\nI now have a 57% in my class. I am devastated and don\u2019t understand how I could get a grade that would be the same as someone handing in a blank piece of paper. I wrote him an email but I\u2019m scared for his response and can\u2019t help if it really was worth a 0. Im doubting myself and failing this class is really bad for me for other reasons other than just school.\n\nEdit: apparently i got a 100. He was sleepy when putting in grades. Wtf this was hell for me especially since i have severe anxiety but thank you everyone\n\nAnother edit cuz everyone is so supportive \ud83e\udd7a: Thank you everyone!! I definitely learned my lesson and wont automatically think I fucked up and got a 0. I guess due to the fact that I was such a bad student in highschool, I have low self esteem when it comes to grades that even when I try super hard on an assignment and it doesn\u2019t make sense that I got a bad grade, I immediately doubt myself and wonder if I deserved it.", "author": "acitruscandle", "created": 1606114201, "retrieved": 1632802772, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 597, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gfbwisk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jzcqlv/i_got_an_0_on_an_essay_i_thought_i_did_pretty/gfbwisk/", "text": "LMAOO U ENEDED UP GETTING 100", "author": "likeyecutg", "created": 1607641680, "upvotes": 3}, "gf36xf4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jzcqlv/i_got_an_0_on_an_essay_i_thought_i_did_pretty/gf36xf4/", "text": "Super late to the party, but something like this happened to me.\n\nI turned in a project that I worked really hard on and consulted the rubric really well as I was getting it done.

It was one of my first classes and I worked hard on the paper. Like you, I didn\u2019t think it was a 100% paper, but definitely not a failing grade either. When I got my grade back it was listed as 10%, which of course was upsetting when you work hard on it. I emailed the professor to ask why my grade was only 10% when I had fulfilled all the listed criteria. She came back to me and said the paper was 100%, but that she had entered the points rather than the percentage (the paper was worth 10pts). She promptly went in to fix it. \nErrors do occur and after that I\u2019ve always made a point to email and ask why there\u2019s a discrepancy of that magnitude when all the criteria has been met.
