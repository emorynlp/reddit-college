Find out where you went wrong, and adjust. Try a new approach; it may not mean studying more or harder. You might just need to learn a new way to take notes or study, etc.  \n  \nGood luck!",

      "text": "YES. This past semester too. I necessarily didn\u2019t get a poor grade, but for the amount of effort I put in the class, I was disappointed. \n\nI had an English teacher who had a very straightforward assignment structure throughout the year and they seemed not too difficult at the start of the semester, but for each individual essay, it was damn near hard just to get an A. We had three essays to complete through the class. For each essay, the professor had the format laid out and had the general points or statements each essay was required to make. I thought, okay, this seems very straightforward. \n\nI got my first essay back and I got almost a C. Upon reading the professor\u2019s comments, I was so confused. She made remarks on how my essay did not go into detail about things that weren\u2019t even on the requirements list. She criticized me on not following certain guidelines that she had never even mentioned in class. She told me to go more in depth about my topic, but her GUIDELINES said to hit every single one, so it was clearly difficult and outright contradictory to even go in depth. So I was basically marked off because I followed invisible formats/guidelines and for not going too in depth for an essay that didn\u2019t necessarily say to. \n\nThe next few essays I tried my ass off and learned from my mistake. I reread my essays start to finish, had someone look over them and critique my mistakes. Referred closely to the rubric and even thought to myself, what would my professor want? Like it seemed as if I weren\u2019t making my own essay, I was just appealing to my professor. \n\nThe highest grade I got was an 87, which is not bad, but I think this was a class that I put a lot of effort into, trying to follow guidelines that weren\u2019t stated, and almost wasted my time trying to go beyond what I should have been doing, just to get an okay score. \n\nMy final grade was a straight B. This may seem not bad, but I definitely want to get into grad school and this was the grade that put my GPA back. ",

She was incredible in person and seemed very compassionate of my situation, and offered to open up my closed assignments. Long story short I busted out a semesters worth of work in about 5 days. I can honestly say I put in my best effort because I felt I owed her after being so accommodating to what was going on. I slept MAYBE 4 hours a night. I've never been so tired in my life. \n\nThat following Monday she graded them. Took 50 points off for minimal mistakes. Just tearing my work apart, to the point where it was obvious her intentions were to fail me.\n\nI just gave up.
