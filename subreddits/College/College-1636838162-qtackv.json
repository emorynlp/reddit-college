  "text": "We were ordering pizza at my college dorm yesterday, and my roommate as well as the few other people that were there wanted pineapple on their pizza. I was the only normal person there, and was very much dumbfounded that I was outnumbered. I'm not sure I can live in the same room as someone who enjoys pineapple on pizza. What do I do? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~This is a joke~~",
