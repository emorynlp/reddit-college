Ever since last semester when I got a D in government everything involving school went downhill\n\nPrior I only get A\u2019s and B\u2019s, but now I just can\u2019t\n\nI can\u2019t tell my family. The disappointment and the ptsd of having bad grades in high school and hiding my report card from my mom is coming back again\n\nI want to drop out so so bad.

      "text": "Dude if you're failing there's seriously something up. You might be burning out or something, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to give up hope if this is what you actually want to do (assuming you still want to pursue your degree). If you don't, I know this sounds tough, but if it comes to it, it's either your family or your future. Ultimately you're going to be the one that will have to live with the decision you make in this respect for some time, if not forever. You don't necessarily need to drop out, maybe the major isn't for you, or maybe you're just in a rough spot and need to find a plan that works better for you. In my opinion though, never let your family choose your career, degree, or any huge aspect of your professional life, especially if you don't like it. That will only leave you with a degree you dislike, while you've wasted years of your life and thousands of dollars.",

I would offer you advice, but I\u2019m obviously not in the right place to do that. I can only wish you luck and suggest you to try to not be so hard on yourself. Maybe you should take some time to regroup for yourself?",
