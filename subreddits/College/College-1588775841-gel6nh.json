It's a little annoying having to mess with the due time constantly.\n\n2. If an assignment is due every Sunday at 111:59pm because it's like a journal or something you can go to custom in the date area and make the event repeat as much as you want. So if there is 15 weeks make it repeat 15 times. This way you don't have to remake the thing 15 times. \n\nIt's easier because if due dates change you can just go in and change the date.

My parents and grandparents went to college so it was well hammered into my head. First-gen students often don't get the same quality of advice from their parents who didn't attend college, though. This \"information disparity\" contributes to the success rate gap of first-gen vs non first-gen students. Colleges need to do more work to provide first-gen students with the networking and self-development knowledge that they weren't able to get from their parents.\n\nEDIT: Also most people don't learn personal finance or money management before college *or* during it. That's how we are able to have college graduates making $100k now going broke during COVID because they have no savings.
