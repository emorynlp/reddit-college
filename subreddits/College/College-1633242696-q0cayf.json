  "text": "I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to drop out of a community college for one semester to help with stress. I\u2019m working 30-40 hours a week to help support me financially but my classes are literally making me physically sick because of the stress. I was wondering if I could drop out of college until the start of next semester to put my all into work and save money so I can take it a little more easier then?",

Also once your out of school and not 100 percent committed, that feeling of not doing the schoolwork may keep you from going right back.",
