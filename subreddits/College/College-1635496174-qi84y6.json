  "text": "I\u2019ll save you from a really long paragraph but I\u2019m kind of confused about how to deal with a professor and wanted to give some examples of treatment that I think is unprofessional.\n- touching students on the back, multiple reports and we all hate it\n- gossiping about certain students with other students. \n- insinuating some students are bad students and some are good\n- giving more work to other students\n- overall negative and scary attitude (yells a lot) \n- very demeaning and condescending when someone doesn\u2019t know an answer \n- told another professor that the whole class was immature \nThe list goes on but does count as a professor that is unprofessional? It\u2019s their first year at my university as well and we all want him fired",
