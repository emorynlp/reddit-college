      "text": "I'm not in CS.\n\nBut I can tell you something as a Bio graduate: We *all* have imposter syndrome. And I imagine it's the same in any other field. You start meeting people smart at the same things you're smart at in college, and it's a shocking experience. And you only meet smarter and smarter people as you progress in a field. If you really enjoy CS, then you can't make an assumption just based on the start of 1 semester.\n\nI can't offer any specific advice on how to catch up; I would recommend studying with other students and visiting the professor during office hours. Try to identify what current parts of the curriculum are giving you trouble so you can ask your tutor/professor about those parts.\n\nAlso, ask your professor if they think you can catch up with enough effort based on your current position. They're usually honest about this kind of thing.",
