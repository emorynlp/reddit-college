At the time, I was interested in it and got quite a bit done. I still have at least a year to go and internship before I can successfully complete it. It\u2019s been 3 years since I\u2019ve stopped to take a break because I had 2 children back to back, and my mental health hasn\u2019t been in a good spot. \n\nRight now I kinda feel stuck. Part of me wants to finish, but the other side is like \u201cwhy\u201d? I don\u2019t even have much of an idea of what area I really want to go into, and it makes me feel like it\u2019s completely pointless. I do feel like I would regret not finishing, but it\u2019s just hard to mind the motivation when I have no idea what to do. \n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a SAHM/military spouse. I just feel like nothing even matters right now. I\u2019m at home with kids, not working, stressed with deployments etc.", "author": "SassyPrincess297", "created": 1632167821, "retrieved": 1632801369, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
