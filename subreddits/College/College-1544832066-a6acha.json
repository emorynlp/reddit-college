It's a lot, but if you start going over it little by little and not procrastinate it will make all the difference. Know what the stuff is and more importantly know what these things do and how to **apply** them to real life experiences. If you have questions find some way to get an answer. **Make friends** to study with if you really need it. Look at what professor you're getting and find out what kind of tests they do. If its MC then you're good, if it's free-response you're gonna have to get that memorization down. This is my second time taking this class because I went in half-assed the first time and I barely got a C. My class had about 50 students and only 17 made it to the end. Don't make the same mistake as me and many others had. This class has to be taken seriously unless your professor is a ball of sunshine and rainbows.",

Like clindamycin blocks the polypeptide exit tunnel on 50s or tetracyclines bind to 30s and interfere with binding of trna, etc. Every teacher is different and why I hate our school system here in the US. Some people I know who are dumb as rocks got A's because their teacher taught basic biology while my teacher went above and beyond anything we needed to know for general micro.
