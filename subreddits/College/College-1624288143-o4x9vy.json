I learned a lot about myself and a lot of underclassmen have told my tips helped them so here are my tips/advice (for background, I was an Econ major): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Take Your Time** \\- You don't have to do every single major requirement in your first 2 years. I paced out my major pretty slowly and it worked wonders for me. My senior year I had to take 5 classes to finish my major (3 in the fall, 2 in the spring) but they were all easy electives. Spacing out requirements gave me the bandwidth to take easier classes so I could focus on my core courses. I knew lots of people that did too much too early and burned out by sophomore. They ended up switching majors or just unhappy.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Free Time is King** \\- Every school/major is different but try to make a schedule that has more classes that only meet 1-2 times a week. Sometimes I would take classes that I knew would suck but they only met once a week so it was worth it for me. Having more free time in your schedule gives you **time to study, go to the gym, meet with friends, get a job, office hours, etc.** I didn't have classes on Fridays on my last 5 semesters of college and it was one of the best things for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Everyone's Path is Different** \\- Try not to compare yourself to others. It's hard not to, but try your hardest. Some of your peers/friends may get great internships or research opportunities while you're still trying to figure out what you want to do. That's okay. **Just focus on doing what's best for you.** When I was a sophomore I applied to countless internships and didn't get any but my peers were all going to big companies like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. I used to feel like a failure for so long but I ended up stressing myself for no reason because 2 years later I ended up in the same companies as them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\"There's More to Life than School\"** \\- This is what I would tell myself when I would get burned out. I like to think I'm a high achiever but everyone has their limits. If you ever get to the point where your mental health is suffering, just remind yourself there's more to life than school. **Take a break, go out.** It's okay to get a B or a C from time to time. **As long as you know you tried your hardest, that's all that matters.**", "author": "Muvinco", "created": 1624288143, "retrieved": 1632802624, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 763, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h2mmno7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o4x9vy/advice_from_a_recent_college_grad/h2mmno7/", "text": "Which of those two companies did you end up in?
