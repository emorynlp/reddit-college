  "text": "My advisor at my school is also a professor for a few classes, and I'm currently taking two of them. I have never received any information about how they like to do things, mainly appointments or a range of days and times to meet. I have several questions about what classes I need to take and to see how close I am to graduation where I've changed my major a few times. They have never answered any of my emails and is rarely at the office hours they scheduled. Is there anyone higher up I can contact or what should I do? I register for classes within the next week or so.",
