  "text": "So I\u2019m struggling very hard with school right now. This is my first semester and I jumped straight into college. I have two jobs also. \n\nMy family and I just moved closer to my school and my better work place, but we didn\u2019t have internet so I haven\u2019t been able to catch up on my work in about two weeks. \n\nDoes anyone have tips on how to juggle school, 2 jobs, and a social life? \n\nSide note: I\u2019m under A LOT of stress right now because of how much I have on my plate. I barely sleep, I don\u2019t have time to do the things that are necessary, I barely eat, and I think I\u2019m becoming majorly depressed bc I\u2019m failing college. Please help.",

      "text": "There\u2019s one thing you shouldn\u2019t compromise for the sake of college and of work, and that\u2019s your physical and mental health. Take it from someone who did it for over 10 years. \nIt\u2019s all about organizing your life. But most importantly being able to discern what\u2019s the most important task at hand, so you need to prioritize first. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have internet, go to your local library, they have free wifi! Or to a Starbucks, they also have free wifi. \n\nMake a schedule, prioritize and don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It\u2019s a process and it takes a while to form a routine!",

          "text": "I'm not op but feel I'm in the same spot, its easy to say prioritize your health and other things but unfortunately my professors just don't care. They're not going to say \"ok, you're going through a lot go ahead and get a couple more weeks behind and we'll figure something  out.\" That would be crazy college is just one race but everybody that finishes, finishes at the same time if you fall behind you're fucked. No one is there to pick you up or help you along you're just screwed, don't understand a unit in class its over, slip up and turn a paper in late. Oops , that sucks, best I can give you is 50%. I know these examples are extreme but these are the reasons people don't finish college. Don't get me wrong it is easy to say just take an extra semester, but the damn human brain won't let that happen. If you take a semester I feel like I might aswell already failed and dropout. It all just feels so futile.",
