  "text": "I surprised all my friends and family by taking a bunch of summer courses, and now I am graduating a semester early. I already informed my close friends and family, but plan to text the rest. I don\u2019t want people to feel like they have to come (and can\u2019t anyway due to ticket limits).\n\nWhat is the best way to text and inform people of this early graduation, and invite them to watch the live stream?",

      "text": "If you\u2019ve taken any senior pictures, maybe use an app like canva to make a digital graduation announcement and ask recipients to tune in to the live streamed graduation and send it as a mass email so you can reply all with the link when it\u2019s available. You could also text it as a photo, but I think email would be easier for sending the live stream link to everyone.",
