  "text": "I am in my 6th week of class and two of my classes have no grades in. This has happened to me in other classes and I think it should be unacceptable. Students need to turn in homework every week on time or they get a zero, why aren\u2019t professors held to the same standard for grading? They should have a deadline too. I get it if grades aren\u2019t in for 2 maybe 3 weeks but 6?",

The only reason I could do that is because I somehow have very little work of my own this week and was able to spend all day Friday and Saturday grading. Literally all day, I did nothing else. Normally I'd be maybe halfway through them because reading and commenting on each paper takes time. \n\nBut, out of a 70 person class, 22 asked for extensions (mostly covid quarantine related because we requested hard copies - not sure how many are real excuses but we aren't allowed to ask for proof of covid) and the professor I'm TAing for granted all of these extensions. So that is nearly 1/3 of the class who I won't get papers for until Tuesday. Because we curve all of the essays we can't finalize grades until all of the papers have been turned in and we can't return the papers themselves with comments until they've all be turned in because we don't want the rubric getting out while someone is still working on it. So the more extensions, the longer it will take to get back papers. In this case because I have an incredibly busy week next week, it will probably be 2 weeks total. But, if there were no extensions, the papers would be returned in class this Tuesday, less than a week after being turned in. Just an example of why 1 - 1.5 weeks isn't always possible. I can't think of a single paper or test from my 6 years of TAing that didn't have at least one student with an extension or make-up holding back returning grades for most of the class.",

We have a list of topics we expect each paper to cover based on what was covered in class. But not a single student has hit each one. Most are in the 50-60% range but yet still decent papers that deserve more like a B than an F. So we remove topics from the rubric that the majority of students don\u2019t get (keeping points for the students who did get them as a bonus) and then end up with a more normal grad distribution. \n\nIt\u2019s basically a loose loose. Wait to curve and students aren\u2019t happy about how long grading takes or don\u2019t curve and a lot of people fail, which students are also understandably upset.

You could be a conscientious and industrious person who thinks they're doing it right and has completely misunderstood something fundamental and don't even realize it. \n\nFrankly, this is something where I'd 1) ask the professor to at least let you know a \"great/good/ok/bad\" even if they're behind, 2) if you don't know anything by the withdraw deadline, I would complain to the department, 3) Go into it, with explicit details, in the course evaluation. The more factual and unemotional you can sound, the more likely you are to be listened to. Just something like \"Professor Smith collected weekly homework but the first grade we saw was in week 11\" is very likely to raise eyebrows (if the department cares).",

Ideally you should be receiving grades within 24-48 hours of the assignment deadline.

You need feedback on your work so you can improve your performance on future assignments. If you get ignored or you're given a date for grades that comes and goes then CC their program coordinator or department chair. Don't go straight to the dean or college/university president, you'll want to save them for later in-case the program coordinator or department chair don't get involved.\n\nJust be polite in your emails and avoid confrontation. Your goal should be to improve your academic performance, not get the professor in trouble (even if they deserve it).

Worst-case scenario you should receive your grades within 1 week of the assignment deadline.\n\nAre you actually a professor, or are you just pandering to the crowd? I'm not even going to mince words or worry about the downvotes: 24 hours is simply insane, and 1 week is perfectly reasonable as the average turnaround for getting grades back to people. The only scenario where I can see 24-48 hours being practicable is if it's a fully multiple choice assessment (and even then, inputting those scores is a time-consuming task, depending on the size of the class, so it's really only online multiple choice exams like the ones on Canvas that lend to a 24-hour turnaround).\n\nAre all of your assessments multiple choice? I'm a history instructor myself, and there is no possible way I can get essay exams or research papers back to students in less than 7-10 days (anything longer than that is unreasonable, I will admit).",

I politely emailed the professor explaining I have anxiety and I was trying to patiently wait for the grade/feedback and asked if I could get a timeline of when to expect it by. He replied immediately and said he understood then emailed me again ten minutes later saying my grade was posted.

Why is there no pressure from anyone to do better?\n\nThat's definitely not normal, especially that 10% pass rate!\n\nA lot of professors -- more so in fields that expect profs to bring in money for research -- change substantially (not necessarily right away) once they have tenure. Everybody's different obviously, so the ones that change, change in different ways. Just thinking about my department, we have one prof who's always stayed passionate about his field after getting tenure in the '90's and cares about his legacy, so he's still active, writing articles, teaching every semester, raising money, and serving as a grad student thesis advisor to a couple students every year. He's just now talking about retirement but says it's because after an illness he's found he can't think as clearly as he used to -- he can't live up to his own standards anymore, he says. Contrast that with another prof who got tenure in the late 1970's, teaches one small class a year, as far as I know only ever wrote one book, and best I can tell seems to take pleasure in being the person who waits until faculty are ready to take a final vote on a major improvement just to say \"Well, now, I haven't had a chance to speak, so let's go back to what we were discussing a few meetings ago.\"\n\nBut the more common thing is faculty getting much more protective of their time after tenure. If you went straight from undergrad to Ph.D., to postdoc, to assistant professor, to associate professor, to tenure, you've basically been living without long-term stability for twenty straight years. If you're the type who wants a family, you've either delayed having kids or accepted that you can't be there as much as you want in their early years. You're at an age your own parents may need help. So with tenure, you finally get to say \"I'm not teaching that 8am class, because I want to walk my kid to school. I'd love to serve on that committee, but not if Dr. Smith is heading it because they don't know how to keep a half-hour meeting from becoming an hour.\" Or, less ideally, \"I don't have time to revamp that course and my teaching style based on some negative student feedback. That's a year of course prep in my spare time, which I don't have when I've got to drive three hours each way to get my dad to his doctor's appointments. Besides, I still care about my lab, and I've got 7 RA's to hustle money for every year.\"\n\nFwiw, I'd venture most of any abrasiveness students get from professors outside of class (say, over email or LMS messages) comes from the professor's sense that their time is being eaten into. That's why a top request from profs is that students take advantage of office hours, since they've specifically blocked off time for those kinds of interactions.",
