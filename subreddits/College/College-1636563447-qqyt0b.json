  "title:": "Is it okay to not take too many Honors/AP classes in your freshman and sophomore year?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in high school and as I\u2019ve begun looking and thinking about colleges I\u2019ve come across a small little worry regarding my GPA. My freshman year and this year I hadn\u2019t taken too many Honors classes, with one each year and one AP class this year. I plan to try and get into a more so prestige college like Vanderbilt, and hope to take more AP and Honors classes in my coming years, but will those first two years subtle down my chances greatly?\n\nI\u2019ve had a high A average for both of my semesters last year as a Freshman, and the same A average for this year as well",

      "text": "Please take the following advice. I wish I had.\n\nFuck honors classes. Take AP, or take the easiest required classes that you can get an A in. Helps your GPA and, when you do put in more effort in an AP class, it actually means something (college credit). \n\nI\u2019d also recommend knocking out as many CLEP exams you can while you\u2019re in HS. Basically free college credit, and you can shave off an entire year of gen-eds depending on how your uni takes CLEP credits. The majority of colleges accept them.",
