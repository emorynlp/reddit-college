  "text": "I am a sophomore in college.  I have always struggled with time management and asking for and getting help.  I also struggle with getting organized.  I also have an addiction to my phone.  I thought this year was going to be different.  I thought I was going to turn everything in on time and get good grades and make my parents proud.  But no, I am failing all of my classes.  I have so many missing assignments.  I should have told my parents the truth about my grades at the beginning of the semester, but I did not.  I feel so overwhelmed and sad.  I just told my dad about it and I am trying to figure out what to do, but as I am looking at everything, I am just getting really overwhelmed.  if anyone has any words of advice or tips or anything like that, my DM's are open.",
