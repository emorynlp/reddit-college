  "text": "I currently am looking at my classes needed to graduate and I am realizing they all are offered in the Spring but only two are offered in the Fall. I have advising meetings before enrollment every semester but from what I understood all was well with graduating. I already has one extra semester I knew about but I can't afford the full fifth year. I'm guessing this has to do with my past advisor being the head of the music department and my other major being business. I guess she didn't realize when these classes were offered and had me focus on my music degree instead. I'm finishing my music major early surprisingly even though I started late but now I'm far behind in my other major since the classes aren't offered when I need them. What do you do when you will end up with a part-time semester?",
