  "text": "So its my first year and ive been accepted in 2 universitys, one is electronic engineering 400 miles away from home where i know nobody, and the other is bussiness administration in a city 40 minutes from home bigger than my home town. I dont know where to go. The degree on the one far away is better and i would rather do the lessons they have there but the one close here will give me a degree faster and i already have people i know in that city... Wtf do i do",
