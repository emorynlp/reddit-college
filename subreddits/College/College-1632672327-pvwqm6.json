They were saving for an apartment and were supper serious.\n\nFast forward to end of Senior year. She broke it off for unrelated reasons.\n\nHe is now attending a community college and she has a job at a local shop that she loves. While she still lives at home she is living her best life. She made new friends, and reconnected with some friends from high school.\n\nShe does not speak to the ex. \n\nMy point, things happen. Life changes, feelings change, minds change. Do not make life decisions based on your partner. My daughter learned that the hard way. \n\nRemember, you are only 17/18, and that\u2019s such a mom thing to say but we speak from experience.

First year university student here. I was in a similar boat not a year ago. I'd been with her for over 3 years by that point and things were pretty serious. Then came the time we had to apply to colleges. I found a school with a program I was really passionate about. I also found a program I guess I could be ok at that was on the same university as hers, even if on a different faculty.\n\nI got accepted to both and I was *this* close to going to study something I didn't really want, just to be with her. But then I ended up sending my paperwork to my preferred school, pretty much on a whim after I meet someone from the field. I couldn't have made a better decision. I'm now doing something I want, I'm around like-minded people, I love it.\n\nOh, and me and my girlfriend? Yeah, we broke up. For *completely unrelated reasons*. Way before I had to move away, but way after applications closed. So imagine if I had chosen to go do something I don't want for her, only to then break up with her months later. I would be somewhere I don't want and have zero reason for it.\n\nNow I'm not saying you'll end up the same way. I truly wish for you guys to be able to handle long distance. It's just that sometimes, it doesn't work out. People change, for better or worse, and there's not much you can do about it.\n\nSo to summarize, because I get way too rambly: I would strongly suggest to pick a university for yourself, because while it may look all rosy with your girlfriend right now, it doesn't have to (and probably won't) always be that way and it would be silly to make important life decisions based on persevering something that has a likelihood of being temporary.", "author": "Hairikku20", "created": 1632717463, "upvotes": 2}, "hefnvo4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvwqm6/what_should_me_and_my_gf_do/hefnvo4/", "text": "My Bf and I are sophomores so we haven\u2019t made it out of college yet.

I had trouble adjusting last year so I saw him every weekend when I went home which helped a lot. This year I stay at school more often and so far we see each other about twice a month. But we make sure to call a couple times a week and send Goodnight/ good morning texts. It\u2019s hard not seeing each other every day and helping each other with homework like in high school and we miss each other a lot. But it is quite manageable.\n\nThe important thing is that you both choose your schools and career paths for yourselves.

As someone in a long distance relationship in college and with several friends in one (and several friends who broke up with their high school s.o.), you can tell when you\u2019re making the right decision that works for you. \n\nAs for applying, do not apply to schools for the person you\u2019re dating. My boyfriend is studying naval engineering and I\u2019m studying ballet so not a ton of overlap in programs. If you end up finding a school with great programs for your own majors and an atmosphere that you both like, great. However, college exists to give you professional opportunities and experiences. Neither one of you should turn down a great school for a relationship. \n\nI know the prospect of breaking up is scary and not seeing the person that you date everyday (or even for months at a time) sucks. But college is too expensive and often career-wise too important to expect or be expected to change your plans for a relationship. \n\nAs for people bringing it up.

You both might move apart geographically and meet new people, develop new interests. Life's going to yank you in many different directions before you build yourself a solid foundation, so don't sweat it too hard. You're both kids right now, what you should focus on primarily is accomplishing your career goals.   \n\n\nJust be faithful, stay in your lane, and if it's meant to be then she'll do the same for you.
