  "text": "I work at a hospital and my shift usually starts 6 or 7 in the morning so typically im up 4-5 in the morning at the minimum to get ready since its a 30min commute. But I found myself getting up at 3-4 am to get some hw done because its hard finding enough time to do so as a stem major working 24 hours a week. \n\nThis isn't a sob story post but for some fucking reason I find myself more efficient and faster at getting shit done. Is it because I just woke up from sleeping even though it was only five hours, no distractions (everyone sleeping and quiet). I kinda like this and I may continue doing this for the rest of the semester. \n\nDoes anyone else experience more efficient studying extremely early in the morning",

I started doing that recently and has been a life-changing thing.\n\nThey say that our brain works better in the morning because it hasn't been exposed to the noises and stress from the day so you're able to focus more on what's in front of you. Especially if you have some sort of focus issue like me lol\n\nI used to get super overwhelmed and burn out. Crying all the time haha Now I am done with homework and school early afternoon and have the rest of the day free for my business. No more overwhelming material.",
