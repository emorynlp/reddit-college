However, this professor is making my life a living hell this semester, I do everything she says to do on the posts and go above and beyond, I spent 4 hours on a discussion post and she still gave me an 8/10, I\u2019m so frustrated and even tried talking to her with no help, I believe she\u2019s on a power trip. She also stated that our grades are relative to how the class did? I\u2019m sorry but I didn\u2019t know my classmates were getting my degree for me? Is it time to drop this class?", "author": "dovahem13", "created": 1632262957, "retrieved": 1632800969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"heg2suy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pstodd/professor_problems/heg2suy/", "text": "Sounds like your course is graded on the curve.
