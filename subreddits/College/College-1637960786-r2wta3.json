  "text": "I am a second year bachelor's degree college student. Last year, I didn't really have this problem since we were online. However, now that we are back to on-campus learning, I noticed they my classmates (which I thought I was friends with) really, trully ignore my existance. I was so distressed that I bought self help books to help me become better at socializing. I thought that if I was just a good friend, I could make good friends. It seems not.\n\n I also spent so much time thinking if I have done something wrong to them and really I can't think of anything apart from the time that I got too drunk and kind of vomited everywhere (I apologized for that incident that happened a year ago). I always try to speak to them and ask them about their day/life. They basically only contact me when they need something. I have not went out with that specific group the entire semester and usually I spend weekends alone reading in my room. \n\nThe thing is, I am studying abroad (and so are those so called \"friends\"), and living alone, so lonliness is amplified. You can imagine the depression spiral this has caused. I tried to make the best of this situation by working on my self, and joining clubs. I have met nice people there but I wish I didnt feel so ostracized almost daily. It is affecting my learning/studying. I confronted them by sending a text to one person asking if I had done something wrong in the past to anyone in the group. She assured me that I didn't and she had just been moody (and therefore distant) recently. She didn't really answer my question but I guess my question to her was not clear of what I wanted to ask anyway. \n\nI really can't understand why they make plans in front of me and don't invite me. I don't understand why they don't greet me or speak to me at all. Especially, since we are all the same nationality (more or less) studying at a foreign country together. It feels like they are trying to avoid me on purpose. It's not like I am entitled to their friendship but some politeness would be appriciated. Am I missing something? Am I crazy for thinking like they are ignoring me? Am I bad at making friends? I don't know. Please enlighten me.",

      "text": "Since we don\u2019t know you personally we can\u2019t really tell you why they don\u2019t want to be friends with you. What I do know is how hard it is to be in a foreign country by yourself. I have often found that the people who are from your own country and supposed to be your friends are the most judgemental and they will stay in a group and not let others in. Try make friends out of this circle, try to make friends with people from other countries. They are often much more open and nice than the ones from your own country.",

      "text": "I guess a better way to look at this would be... Why do you think they are your friends in the first place? The way you describe your relationship with them, you sound like an acquaintance. \n\nIt's entirely possible that these guys are gigantic rude jerks and make plans in front of you without inviting you, only talk to you when they need help, etc etc... It's also entirely possible that they just view you as a nice acquaintance and not as a friend. It can be difficult to see how somebody views you from their perspective. They might totally be okay with being your friend at some point in the future it's just that relationship has never developed. If in your mind you guys are friends, their behavior can seem so dismissive, however you might have read their behavior as friendship when they're reading your behavior as just normal human interaction.\n\nThem ignoring you could be the exact same as you just ignoring some guy walking down the street. You wouldn't invite some random guy walking down the street to hang out just like you wouldn't invite some random guy in your class to hang out. \n\nDon't take this negatively, try to view it positively. They're not ignoring you because they don't like you, they are probably just ignoring you because you're not on their radar. I'm sure if you put in a bit of effort, they would probably more than happily be your friend. Really, try not to puke everywhere though That's not a good look.",
