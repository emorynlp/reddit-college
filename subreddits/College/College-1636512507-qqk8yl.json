  "text": "I\u2019m a non-traditional student in my first semester post military. I\u2019ve always enjoyed learning and had high expectations for this semester. However, I\u2019m pretty disappointed with the experience so far. Despite having a 3.9 GPA, I feel like I\u2019m just checking boxes. The 100-level courses are neither interesting nor rigorous (with the sole exception of my math course). I have a strong desire to get what I can out of all of my courses, but I\u2019m annoyed that they seem to cater to the lowest common denominator. What I lack in natural intelligence I think I make up for in hard work. So it\u2019s disappointing that my hard work doesn\u2019t seem to yield a fulfilling experience. \n\nWas this other students\u2019 experience as well for their first semester? Does university become more enjoyable once you start taking classes for your major? For those with a similar experience, how did you derive value from these introductory courses?",

      "text": "Was it an option to test out of those courses? At my school for some gen eds you could test into a higher level; there are also some gen ed classes that cater towards non-majors and tend to be easier while others are more difficult. So it may also depend on the classes you took.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're getting straight As, maybe you should stick with the schedule and use the time to explore other aspects of college like clubs. If your major ends up being challenging then you'll be glad for the GPA boost from your freshman year.",

Same with certain required lower division courses that I put off because I knew they would be tough.\n\nYour first year is not representative of the entire college experience. Not even close.",

      "text": "1. yes (especially at community college. professors have to pander to the least educated student, otherwise pass rates would be extremely low, people would whine about inequity/inequality, administrators would get a ton of heat. you won't see this behavior at top universities because the lowest common denominator is extremely high).\n2. yes, because those classes won't have any (fewer?) \"i'm never going to use this, i just need to pass, screw you nerds\" slackers.\n3. i derive value by applying those basic concepts to my understanding of commonplace stuff and arguments. for example, if i weren't educated in basic economics, I might've been swayed by \"have 100% marginal tax rate on all earnings over $xxx,xxx\". In physics, those free body diagrams are probably the most important thing I got out of the class, and I suspect I'll always think like that for the rest of my life. unfortunately, I don't derive value from every intro class (I don't think I've managed to apply psychology knowledge outside the classroom). political science course gave a lot of context on what I see in the news and how third-party votes in US 2-party system actually detract from the cause they support.\n\nremember, those courses only have value as long as you apply the knowledge gained. it is highly unlikely you will ever apply introductory knowledge to your major, and that is fine.",

If you read the directions and do what they say you'll get a 100. \n\nIt's stupid. It is in fact a waste of my time. I drive 45 minutes one way to campus and on Monday, it's my only class. It's a drag. I need to do it. \n\nIt's a nice GPA boost. There's really nothing stimulating about it. \n\nBut what can I do? It's a requirement for the degree and I have to pass it. I show up and do my best. If that's a hoop I have to jump through for my degree, I'm totally cool with that. For some people it's difficult and rewarding.",
