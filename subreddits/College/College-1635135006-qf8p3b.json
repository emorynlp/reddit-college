  "text": "Has anyone here ever taken a Final exam for a course worth 100% of their final grade? It\u2019s for a Biochemistry course. Our prof said that if we miss our 40% Midterm exam then it will go over to our 60% Final exam making the whole Final exam worth 100% of our final grade. No exceptions. And no questions ask. \nI\u2019m really scared of my upcoming Midterm exam tomorrow so I was wondering if I should just risk it all and let it become 100%. Has anyone here done that before? Any story?",
