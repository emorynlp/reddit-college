I probably would have been able to do it but I am going through a death in my family. The most challenging course is obviously calculus II which is a part of my minor. I am a DS major, CS and math double minor . \nWill it look bad if I withdrew from calculus II (I will attach a letter explaining my situation) and then took it in the summer at a community college which have much better professors and 4x cheaper. Will it look like I took the easy way out ? I am looking to apply to grad school .\n\nThank you.", "author": "TheGreakFreakK", "created": 1632669922, "retrieved": 1632800269, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hecxmnq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvvzoj/community_college_while_attending_university/hecxmnq/", "text": "You will need to consult an academic advisor about your school's policies for \"external domestic study\" or whatever your school might call it. For example: at my school, you can only take outside credits at a BA/BS granting school, which many CCs are not. You must also check that your major/minor will accept these outside credits. There's no real issue here re: grad school admissions.", "author": "renebeca", "created": 1632671635, "upvotes": 3}}}
