  "title:": "Cheap Online College vs Large State University for \"partying and the college experience\"",
  "text": "I've thought of this too. I'm now 29, but graduated at 24 from a commuter college that was super lame and had none of the party campus environment that you see in the movies. It seemed like most of the students just went to class and went back home, and the campus was empty. Plus I was mainly focused on grades etc. Also, it seemed like you would talk to someone max one semester and never see them again. It seems like the big colleges seem more fun, but idk if it's just hype and if it's worth 20-30k more and moving/quitting my job etc?\n\nNow that I'm changing fields to IT, since I couldn't find a job with my first degree of Kinesiology, I'm debating whether to go for cheap at an online school that would only cost around 8000-11000. Or to go back in person to a big public university for 2 years which could be anywhere from 20-40k, plus driving in, parking, more book expenses, and I would have to switch from working full time to part time.\n\nNot much dating in my town so I was thinking of applying to a big uni for more dating opportunities that my first college did not provide. Or would it be better to go with the cheaper and quicker online option, while keeping my full time job and save more money?",

      "text": "Make sure any online options are accredited and non-profit. There are good ones out there but also some notable scams.\n\nYou are old enough that dating in college would be less of an option. You can of course look for dating prospects in the area surrounding the college but not as much on campus.",
