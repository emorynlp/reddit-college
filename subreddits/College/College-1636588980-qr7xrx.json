  "text": "So I\u2019m a sophomore in HS so I still have awhile before I have to really start focusing on college but at the moment I want to go to college for music education but I constantly hear about how going to college for anything music related is overly expensive, stressful, hard, etc so is it really that much harder than any other degree or am I just seeing people overreact. Any answers are appreciated.",
