  "text": "i was admitted to the nursing program of a local community college RIGHT before the pandemic went into full swing. Online courses mixed with mental health issues caused me to take a step back. In the midst of my mental health issues, I did not complete my FAFSA and was removed from my classes before I could officially drop due to \"non payment\". These issues have yet to be resolved despite going down in spring 2020. I haven't been back to campus. Well, my life is slightly more together and I would like to transfer to a larger university near me, but am unsure if I will face obstacles due to the nature of my last semester. Any advice? Will I be able to go back with only *minor* inconveniences or will i have to fight to return to school? I don't wanna to take more time off and risk not going back. Help!",
