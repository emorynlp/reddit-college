  "title:": "failed my first a&p exam even though i thought i knew all the answers and studied for weeks",
  "text": "like the title says i failed with a 57. apparently i scored a bit higher than all the other people i talked to. the average score was 64%. my issue is, i studied for WEEKS for this exam. consistently. every day. i understood the concepts and was retaining all the info where i could probably teach a class on it. yet i failed. i\u2019m thoroughly shocked and discouraged that all my hard work went to waste. i\u2019m gonna keep trying but has anyone had this situation before? \n\ni know people say to study smarter not harder but i thought that\u2019s what i was doing. i was using flash cards every moment of the day i could, i am a visual learner so i watched a lot of youtube videos and looked at diagrams. i went over the exam review and made sure i knew the answer to ALL of the questions. the exam was easy too and i felt confident in about 95% of my answers. yet i still failed. i don\u2019t get it and i\u2019m upset. i need to get into nursing school",

      "text": "Flash cards only help you learn basic definitions.  This is not useful except for the practical part of the class.\n\nOnly LOOKING AT stuff is also not going to help you.\n\nYou need to make you OWN concept maps, draw the diagrams from scratch, and be able to explain all the stuff in your own words.\n\nGet a study buddy and sit down and explain to them all the steps of fracture repair as if you were teaching it to them.\n\nIt really is about active learning and not passive looking",
