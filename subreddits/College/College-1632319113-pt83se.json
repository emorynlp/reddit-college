I was the only one in my group that sucked at it, and I was getting extremely embarrassed because everyone in my group knew what they were doing. I have so much anxiety right now, and I feel so stupid. I could tell my group was getting annoyed with how bad I was struggling with taking someone\u2019s BP and it was just the most aggravating thing. I made myself go first with trying it out because I obviously need more practice, I plan on coming to open lab sessions to practice as much as possible. I\u2019m just super stressed out that everyone must think I\u2019m super stupid for not knowing what to do.

Place the cuff on the person with the arrows for the artery pointing where the artery should be in the middle. I\u2019m assuming since this is for a science/exercise course, you don\u2019t have a stethoscope. That\u2019s ok.\n\nOnce the cuff is on, you\u2019ll want to tighten the release valve and inflate the cuff until you can see the needle \u201clinger\u201d at a certain number. This is the diastolic. Then, to avoid any possible auscultatory gap and getting the reading wrong, deflate the cuff, inflate again and go 30 above the diastolic. Deflate the cuff by 2-3mmHg slowly but not too slow or too quickly. Ignore the first \u201clinger\u201d or use it as confirmation for the diastolic. Watch carefully for the second \u201clinger\u201d. That is the systolic.\n\nThen you have your reading.", "author": "StrawberriesEatKiwi", "created": 1632339650, "upvotes": 1}, "hdv01jz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt83se/had_a_lab_today_tying_to_do_blood_pressure/hdv01jz/", "text": "ah, i wouldn't worry too much about it. labs are there to learn and stuff like that happens. While I never had a lab where I took blood pressure, i've done plenty of stupid things in chem labs. No one really remembers it anyways.\n\nI think it will be fine if you go to the open labs and practice a bit.", "author": "Lksaar", "created": 1632327810, "upvotes": 2}}}
