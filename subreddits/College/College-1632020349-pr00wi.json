  "text": "Is it weird that I feel homesick -- except that I am homesick when at home. It has only been 3 weeks since I've started my freshman college year. I'm staying over at home and honestly want to go back to my dorm with my roommates. I don't know.... my family lives very close so either I or them have visited me every 4-6 days on average... just some thoughts",
