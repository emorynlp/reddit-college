I partially did the police academy and that kind of learning clicks way better than the traditional sitting in a classroom learning. Especially that EVERYTHING you learn is actually stuff you will use not, the \"oh let's learn about stuff you will forget after you get a job and never gonna use this information\". Yes yes I know the whole \"but you're risking your life.. blah, blah, blah..\". Honestly I don't care about that, you're technically risking your life by just doing normal stuff like driving and walking. Just saying if for some reason I couldn't pass the classes or get a job related to CS, then I'd happily go to the police academy again or try something else in technical school.",
