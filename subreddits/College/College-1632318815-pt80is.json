  "text": "is it normal to feel like shit in college as a freshman? it sucks being a constant achiever in a competitive highschool environment then all of a sudden college tells you \"oh did you know that you suck big time? here's a failing grade in an area where you excel at before.\" \n\n\ni love to study but this feeling sucks. i feel so fucking demotivated. we have 4 semesters per year (Mapua) and the grading system fucks up our QWA big time. one failing mark and your good to go as an irregular student. i can't afford being one because of my scholarship... \n\n:(",
