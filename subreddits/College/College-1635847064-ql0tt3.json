  "title:": "Am in the wrong for not wanting to show up to college for 1, really shitty lecture",
  "text": "I have to take the bus to and from college everyday, and the way the scehdule works, i could have only 1 ond hour class but end up stuck at college for about 4 or 5 hours.\n\nI know my timetable pretty well and can figure out what days i can skip. In all honesty, i *could* skip everyday bar one, but i try to go to at least two.\n\nSo when i have a day that is just one or two lectures in which the lecturer will just read a couple slides and recap a video we watched, i dont want to go in. \n\nBut my mother will constantly say im lazy for not going in. Shes never really been strict with anything like that so thats what makes me kinda believe her and i end up feeling bad.\n\nBut then when i do go in, i sit there in class for an hour and by the time class is over i cant help but think \"that was the biggest waste of time ever\". And then boom im stuck at college for another 3 hours. The odd time i might go for lunch with friends but theyll often sither have another class or have an easier way of getting home as they live somewhere else.\n\nSo basically, should i feel bad when i skip these days?",

Now I skip almost every day because there\u2019s just no reason for me to go. But tbh I just really hate my study as well. I 100% prefer last year when we had online classes",
