  "text": "I\u2019m a second year at college (UK) and I am studying A levels. This alone is already a pretty heavy workload. However I live in a very low income household so I also work on weekends to support myself. Having a job and going to college every day means I do not get a days rest a week, which I\u2019m sure is standard as an adult but with the mountain of work I have due in I can\u2019t cope and this is leading to poor grades and a overwhelming amount of stress. After college when I arrive home in the evening (the travel to and fro takes atleast an hour) I\u2019m so physically and mentally exhausted I usually fall asleep or can\u2019t get out of bed. This is the time I should be studying but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I\u2019ve also been oversleeping every morning, showing up to every class late and in general I am disorganised. There doesn\u2019t really seem to be a solution other than forcing myself to work when I arrive home, but I\u2019m struggling to find the motivation to do so. It\u2019s got to the point where the work load is so high I don\u2019t know where to start, and it\u2019s frustrating as a perfectionist and someone who usually gets high grades to be so behind. \n\nIt would be interesting to see if anyone else has experience anything similiar and how they dug theirself out this hole. \n\n(For context I work 9 hour shifts, but the travel there and back totals to 2 hours)",

You\u2019re going through a lot and they\u2019re going to be able to give you a lot better advice than a stranger on the internet. \n\nYou have it in you to get through this - I have confidence in you.
