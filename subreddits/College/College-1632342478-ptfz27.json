  "text": "Hi, I should be graduating in a year with a major in Human Biology (BS). I was planning to take a year or two to complete my EMT license and work as an EMT before applying to PA school. I was wondering if anyone knows any other high paying jobs right after undergrad I can do right with that specific major. I know a lot of people go straight to med school or whatever program they decide to go to right after undergrad, but I just wanted to know if there were good jobs I can attain right after graduating undergrad. Thank you ahead of time",
