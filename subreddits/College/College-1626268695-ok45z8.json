If all economic activity stops again, it will be disastrous and might cause another 2008 type of financial collapse; only that this time, it will be worse and its negative effect will likely last decades.

It's very likely that we might see a surge of cases coming the holiday seasons later this year as the virus continues to mutate.

Bigger schools will have a harder time managing an outbreak of a new variant and would be more likely to lock down. The smaller your school, the easier it is for them to enforce other safeguarding measures (like requiring/ recommending that students do not travel or doing thorough contact tracing). Smaller schools also typically have smaller classes. Schools that usually (pre-COVID) have lots of large lectures with hundreds of students will take longer to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d than schools where the average class size is 15 or 20. \n\n- Is your school public or private? Public universities will legally have to follow what their state and local governments are doing - i.e. if the state of NY mandates a lockdown and closes all public schools, NY public colleges are likely to be included in that mandate whereas a private school like Skidmore or Columbia can make their own decision about whether to lock down/ shut down or not. \n\n- Is your school requiring that all students returning in the fall provide proof of being COVID vaccinated? If so, they will be less vulnerable to another outbreak. If not, they will be more vulnerable and will be more likely to lock down. \n\n- Does the student body culture revolve around activities that increase the risk of an outbreak (aka large sports games, Greek life, partying, etc.)? If so, they will be less likely to trust that students will follow the guidance and will be more concerned about the chance of an outbreak. If not, they will be more likely to implement other safety measures and trust that students will follow them without having to lock down (like limiting gatherings, limiting visitation, etc). \n\n- What state is your school located in? Some states have been *much* more lenient and schools tend to follow state guidance. Florida, for example, never really locked down or enforced masks while New York and California were fully locked down and fully enforced mask wearing. Also, if you\u2019re located in a warmer climate, there\u2019s more opportunity to have outdoor events for more months of the year which will give the school more flexibility to open up closer to \u201cnormal,\u201d whereas schools located in places that start getting snow in September/ October won\u2019t be able to do activities outside for as long so they will be more susceptible to an outbreak once it gets cold. \n\nAs an administrator at a University, I can tell you that no one wants your senior year to be on Zoom. I work in Residence Life and last year broke my heart. We have to protect our vulnerable community members, but last year was not what college should look like and it was painful for me to have to discipline students who were just trying to hang out with friends and build community. Most schools desperately want to be back to as close to normal as possible and will do everything in their power to avoid another lock down, but if things get bad, it may be unavoidable and right now we\u2019re all just holding our breath and hoping we can move forward with opening our schools this fall the way we want to and planned to.
