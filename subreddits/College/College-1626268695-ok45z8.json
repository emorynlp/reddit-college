It made me feel so miserable and isolated, and if anything it made me feel the pressure of school even more than I do when I'm physically in the building. I had a hard time retaining information for long periods of time, and I had an incredibly hard time staying motivated. \n\nAnother reason why I've been dreading the potential threat of another lockdown is because it would force the place where I work to close for the duration of said lockdown. I'm actively trying to save money for myself and for plans that my boyfriend and I have made for the future, and being forced into a position where I can't do that along with having to return to virtual learning would almost be too much for me. \n\nLong answer short: yes, I am VERY worried about a second lockdown.",

If some people are unwilling to wear a mask, that's their personal choice, but don't remove the mandate and tell people that it is safe to be maskless as long as you're vaccinated. The vaccine is not the silver bullet. Common sense precaution and awareness are still necessary. And on the economic side, our state and the federal government cannot afford to impose another lockdown again, we already on a path of financial catastrophe. If all economic activity stops again, it will be disastrous and might cause another 2008 type of financial collapse; only that this time, it will be worse and its negative effect will likely last decades. Anyways, since we already removed most of the restrictions on the national and state level. It's very likely that we might see a surge of cases coming the holiday seasons later this year as the virus continues to mutate. And when you remove mask mandate and lockdown restrictions, it is most definitely impossible to reinstate it ever again. We're just gonna have to live with the virus for the foreseeable future. Just take proper and common sense protection.",

If anything it would be nice to see all the conservatives get pissed off again. You know if everybody would have stayed in their damn houses for two weeks last March we wouldn't have gotten this far into the pandemic. The vaccine is just a band-aid for people who are too stupid and selfish to stay in their houses. Also if there was another shutdown I could just collect unemployment benefits again and not worry about having to look for a stupid job.",

I can't learn online. If they go through with it and pull it midway... man, I wish I could do something; but it's a government facility so they're basically invincible. At least give me a full refund and don't even count me as a withdraw.\n\nSuffice to say I'm not paying for my classes until 5 days before they start; just incase in the coming weeks I can get any sort of affirmation if it's closing.\n\nBut yeah, given the political culture of my state I just don't see it happening.

It will be *almost* exclusively the unvaccinated, regardless of the reasoning for their refusal or inability. With every month that passes, this fucking virus has more time to mutate and potentially turn into something **more** deadly. \n\n**None** of my family members (all Christian conservatives) are vaccinated. I (godless communist, according to them) am the only vaccinated one in my family. At this point, I don\u2019t think my family would even *consider* vaccination unless someone in the family or someone close to them dies. It\u2019s depressing, but it\u2019s a reality many of us may have to accept.",

Despite high cases, deaths are very low so therefore we should stop testing those who are vaccinated and pretty much anyone below 25 as there's almost close to zero chance of them dying. Allocate those tests to the elderly and provide the elderly with boosters. As I always say to others COVID will never stop, but we have to stop making it a burden on us while protecting people from death.",

      "text": "I think it completely depends on your school\u2019s location and the school itself.\n\nSome of the factors to consider if you\u2019re trying to figure out how likely another lockdown would be:\n\n- How large is your school? Bigger schools will have a harder time managing an outbreak of a new variant and would be more likely to lock down. The smaller your school, the easier it is for them to enforce other safeguarding measures (like requiring/ recommending that students do not travel or doing thorough contact tracing). Smaller schools also typically have smaller classes. Schools that usually (pre-COVID) have lots of large lectures with hundreds of students will take longer to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d than schools where the average class size is 15 or 20. \n\n- Is your school public or private? Public universities will legally have to follow what their state and local governments are doing - i.e. if the state of NY mandates a lockdown and closes all public schools, NY public colleges are likely to be included in that mandate whereas a private school like Skidmore or Columbia can make their own decision about whether to lock down/ shut down or not. \n\n- Is your school requiring that all students returning in the fall provide proof of being COVID vaccinated? If so, they will be less vulnerable to another outbreak. If not, they will be more vulnerable and will be more likely to lock down. \n\n- Does the student body culture revolve around activities that increase the risk of an outbreak (aka large sports games, Greek life, partying, etc.)? If so, they will be less likely to trust that students will follow the guidance and will be more concerned about the chance of an outbreak. If not, they will be more likely to implement other safety measures and trust that students will follow them without having to lock down (like limiting gatherings, limiting visitation, etc). \n\n- What state is your school located in? Some states have been *much* more lenient and schools tend to follow state guidance. Florida, for example, never really locked down or enforced masks while New York and California were fully locked down and fully enforced mask wearing. Also, if you\u2019re located in a warmer climate, there\u2019s more opportunity to have outdoor events for more months of the year which will give the school more flexibility to open up closer to \u201cnormal,\u201d whereas schools located in places that start getting snow in September/ October won\u2019t be able to do activities outside for as long so they will be more susceptible to an outbreak once it gets cold. \n\nAs an administrator at a University, I can tell you that no one wants your senior year to be on Zoom. I work in Residence Life and last year broke my heart. We have to protect our vulnerable community members, but last year was not what college should look like and it was painful for me to have to discipline students who were just trying to hang out with friends and build community. Most schools desperately want to be back to as close to normal as possible and will do everything in their power to avoid another lock down, but if things get bad, it may be unavoidable and right now we\u2019re all just holding our breath and hoping we can move forward with opening our schools this fall the way we want to and planned to. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had COVID disrupt your college experience and for all of our sakes, I hope we don\u2019t spend another year on Zoom.",

It would take the virus to become *much* more deadly in a short amount of time which (granted my knowledge in that area is limited) is highly unlikely for those in power to even consider having restriction reimpose at this point.\n\nWith vaccinations widely available, hospitals no longer overwhelmed or unprepared like they were in March of 2020 or Winter of 2020-2021- there is in my view no longer any reason to treat this at this point as anything more than a somewhat more deadly flu with the current situation we're dealing with within America.

Get vaccinated, and encourage everyone you know to get vaccinated.\n\nAt the college where I work, 95+% of the staff and faculty are vaccinated. \n\nAmong student athletes and the overall student population, vaccination rates in recent poll were only about 60%. Students just don't think they are vulnerable or don't feel it is a priority. However in Florida right now, they are re-opening COVID wards that were previously closed due to lack of patients. And the majority of patients are young adults in their 20's and 30's. Additionally, they are coming in more sick, and the outcomes are worse than they were for the previous waves. In a podcast call from the head of the Department of Health in my state this week, they stated that hospitalization rates for Delta are about 3x higher than previous strains, and death rates are about 2x higher. But the ages of the average patient are dramatically younger (people ages 20-40 in our state). \n\nAs a parent of small children who can't yet get vaccinated, this terrifies me. \\*PLEASE\\* get vaccinated. Don't risk permanent lung, kidney, liver or heart damage. Don't risk 6 months of brain fog (which up to 50% of COVID patients experience). Just get the shot and you don't have to worry. And just as importantly, the people around you who are unable to get vaccinated (like small children) will be safer because you are vaccinated.",

And 99.5% of those dying in our state are unvaccinated at this point. \n\nYou can make whatever choices you want right now, but my guess is that within 90 days the Delta variant will be changing your mind. I know some pretty die-hard Covid conspiracy theorists who are now vaccinated due to family members dying and contracting incurable organ damage from \"regular\" Covid. One of my friends in her early 30's is now on borrowed time with her husband because he is in heart failure due to a \"mild\" case of Covid. Technically he'd be considered in your \"survival rate\" because he isn't actually dead yet, but he can't walk up a flight of stairs and they won't be having sex any time soon due to risk of killing him. Another friend had her uncle and cousin die, and two other cousins in the same family get hospitalized. Her uncle lived for about 6 months after being \"cured\" of Covid before he died of heart and lung failure. I have multiple friends with parents and spouses who were hospitalized. I had students last semester who missed weeks of school due to lingering COVID symptoms. Your \"survival rate\" ignores quality of life, lung and organ damage. It also ignores the medical costs associated with long term aftercare when you have lung, heart, kidney and liver damage.\n\nBut you do you, buddy. Keep spreading a disease for no reason so you can beat your chest and expose people's children to lifelong lung damage.",

No. The European Union had a shit fit and major news cycle over 14 people who had reactions to the Oxford/Astra shot. 14 is not 100k. \n\nEven if 100k worldwide was a real death number, the US alone has had over 600k Covid deaths. So by that measure, even if 100k people died in the US from the shots (which they haven't) you'd still have 1/6 as many people dying from the shot as from Covid. Expand that to worldwide, with 4 million COVID deaths, you'd be looking at 1/40 as many deaths from the vaccine as from Covid. \n\nPenicillin actually has higher rates of incidents than this vaccine, but people take antibiotics every day.

You also couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t force people to take a vaccine that they don\u2019t feel safe taking. I support limiting those people on where they can go (vaccine passports and such) but completely forcing them isn\u2019t okay. \n\nBut we also can\u2019t do the opposite and pretend the virus never existed. We should be spreading better information to encourage people to get it. There\u2019s too much misinformation going around and that\u2019s the problem",

On the other hand, my older brother went to school in a town in VA that was far too insane, so much so that people were getting kicked out of school for partying with 10 fucking people (and the local mandate was 15 at the time, not sure how that made any sense). Luckily their father was a big time lawyer that he threatened to sue the school, and they reversed course.\n\nAll in all, does not surprise me that you were arrested in California.",

Later on it seems he was a bit more open about criticizing the former president. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/dr-fauci-trump-terrible-things-b1804862.html\n\nAll the same, Trump kept insisting that it would magically disappear. He kept saying it would be gone in a few months over and over. I don't believe that's actually what he was told by the experts. Either that or his personal advisors were easily intimidated into agreeing that it would go away on its own. \n\nIn some of the moments where Trump said it would disappear, even I could look at the data, the mechanisms of transmission, and case studies from other countries, and tell you that we need to take proactive action. If his team really didn't do that then that would be an enormous failure on their part. I find it much more likely that Trump himself was the point of failure - you know, the guy who hid the fact that he got the vaccine, and took every measure to avoid being seen while wearing a mask. Even if his statements were in line with recommendations (which I still don't fully believe), his personal choices and the way he went about delivering the message were fully fucked.",
