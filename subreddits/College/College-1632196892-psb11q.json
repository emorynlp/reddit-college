  "text": "So I'm a freshman and I'm taking a few math classes and a few engineering classes. Outside of doing homework for these classes, I don't study for them. I think I'm grasping the concepts well enough for quizzes and exams. Am I doing things correctly, or should I just spend more time studying for my classes, even though I'm able to finish all homework questions?",

Don\u2019t be afraid to make adjustments if it starts to not be enough, but otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about it. Everyone learns differently so there isn\u2019t a universally \u201ccorrect\u201d way to study.",
