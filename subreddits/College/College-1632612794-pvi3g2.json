You can do this if you're 18 or 90, anyone at any age can go to college for free. We do have private institutions but they're notoriously inferior quality-wise.\n\nAnd then I started seeing some americans talking about the admission process and i was like, damn that sounds hard, and then I found out you have TO PAY FOR IT? and it's no cheap at all!!!! That was the first time I was grateful for being born in my godforsaken country, but what shocked me the most was people saying it's ''impossible'' to make college free for everyone in the U.S, because no one would want to go if it was free(????) idk man, I feel bad for yall", "author": "Busy-Pudding-620", "created": 1632612794, "retrieved": 1632800312, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"heasnwe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvi3g2/just_joined_this_thread_as_a_brazilian_starting/heasnwe/", "text": "If you think that\u2019s bad, you should see our healthcare system\u2026", "author": "Harddicksavage", "created": 1632624590, "upvotes": 6}, "hea642u": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvi3g2/just_joined_this_thread_as_a_brazilian_starting/hea642u/", "text": "As you said, god forsaken country.
