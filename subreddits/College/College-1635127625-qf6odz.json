  "text": "You can get a $200,000 loan for college, unless you\u2019re smart and have a really good financial history. \n\nYou cannot get the same in business loans or for any kind of investment that free\u2019s you from debt, making yourself a 40-50 year asset for banks to milk.\n\nUpdate: I think I forgot to be more apparent with my point; it\u2019s this, STEM careers pay well and open opportunities to earn significant incomes with no ceiling, ideally. So more people that like rivers are channeled by difficulty to other focus\u2019s/majors that have very little guarantee for payout or less than $100,000 a year\u2026the more assets are created for people to be bound to banks and further fleecing in the future of their earnings.",

      "text": "I don't think you really understand who funds the majority of student loans and what the average student loan amount is. It's mostly government loans, not banks, and $200k is a dramatic outlier. With government loans the default rate is low and there are 20-year repayment plans where you can pay 10% of your discretionary income and any outstanding balance will be forgiven after that time. Few people in that program actually have remaining balances forgiven after that time: most of them pay it off before that.\n\nA business loan does not free you from debt. You take out the loan and then you have $200k in cash and $200k in debt. If you lose your cash you still have the $200k in debt. It's more risky due to the nature of how a business works and is going to be a worse type of debt for most young people.\n\n>You can get a $200,000 loan for college, unless you\u2019re smart and have a really good financial history.\n\nYou \"can\" probably get this credit regardless of if you are any of those things or not. But it passes the limit of federal loans so you'd turn to private lenders. People who are smart will not turn to private lenders for student loans or take out $200k when college is doable with far less.\n\n>You cannot get the same in business loans or for any kind of investment that free\u2019s you from debt, making yourself a 40-50 year asset for banks to milk.\n\nI don't understand what your thought is. Graduating from college with almost any in-demand major has as good of a return as a successful business. You are also assuming all lenders are banks, when a big portion comes from government.\n\nThe time it takes to pay off the loan is also irrelevant by itself. The question is if the benefits you will get from the loan are going to be greater than the loan amount plus interest. Take a $100k loan at 3% interest that got you a $20k higher salary compared to a no-degree worker. The $100k loan has $3k in interest the first year and you put half of the salary increase toward payments while enjoying the other half yourself. In that case you are making progress paying off the loan while enjoying more income for yourself even with making the payments.",
