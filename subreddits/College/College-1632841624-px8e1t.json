  "text": "I started class on the 30th of august and I contacted my counselor on the 15th of sept and I should've changed my major then but Is there anyway I can do it now? I am in biology and I fucking hate it with a burning passion and idk if Ill be able to make it through a semester, let alone four years. I want to change to cognitive science but who knows. Anyone have or had a similar situation?",

          "text": "I hate it because Chem and Math are my worst subjects. Bio isnt so bad but its so time consuming and im not passionate about it at all. My math class is basically teaching myself with a giant binder and online textbook, huge hw assignments and a quiz every wednesday. My chem class confuses me and my lab gives me a lab report and notebook I have to finish every week. My bio class is lecture, lab and discussion (where we still get hw) any free time I get from hw and classes and work I want to spend doing clubs and making friends. (Which I barely have time for now unless I procrastinate on hw. I've already had 4 all nighters and its only been a month)\n\nLong story short Its killing my motivation, mental health and social life. I can suffer through my next few months and finish these classes but none after that.",

              "text": "I'm not trying to change your mind but I think it's hard to be passionate about *any* general classes, because they're so broad. I get annoyed in bio because I want to know more about the thing we're studying and before I know it, we're on to the next thing. It feels kind of like a whirlwind. It's time consuming but ultimately it's easy, just a lot of memorization, and I'm pretty sure you'll need it for all science majors.",

I get so pissed when I think about my chem and math class cause I hate them so much. I just dont care enough about it to keep going in it for years. Im fine with them as generals, but not my major. I cannot do that. I get what your saying but it simply is not for me. \n\nAnd Bio is the only thing I enjoy about anything to do with science besides forensics but its not worth it to me.",
