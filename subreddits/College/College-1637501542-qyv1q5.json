  "text": "To preface this, I came out to my parents, got disown, and now I have to figure out how to pay for college amongst other things all on my own now that I have zero help from them at all.\n\nI\u2019m currently a sophomore at community college and I will be transferring to a four year institution for this upcoming spring semester. During my time at CC I saved up money and had my CC paid for via a student ambassador program at my college. So any fafsa, scholarships, and grants I got were all refunded to me which I saved up to pay for uni when I transferred because I knew I wouldn\u2019t get any help from my parents when I came out. \n\nAnyways, this spring semester at uni will cost me out of pocket around $8k. Junior and senior year will cost me around $25k out of pocket. I have applied for scholarships so I\u2019m hoping that costs will go down if I get any at all but I am also looking at taking out a student loan with Discover should I not get any other financial help. ~$34k is around the average amount of debt that college students get and with a job in software development I feel like I would be able to pay this debt off fairly quickly. \n\nThere\u2019s one full ride scholarship I applied for that I have a really good chance of getting but I do not find out if I get it until April and this full ride wouldn\u2019t start paying until this upcoming August. Assuming that I get it I would still have $8k I would need to pay for, for this upcoming semester. I do plan on getting a job for next semester to off set costs. I had a job at this beginning of this semester but I quit because the course load was heavier than I thought it would be. \n\nDoes ~$34k for two years and one semester worth of uni for a computer science degree sound fairly reasonable? This is around the maximum amount of debt in private loans I\u2019m looking at as of right now assuming that I\u2019m not awarded any scholarships or grants.",

      "text": "I'm sorry this is happening to you! Unfortunately, I wouldn't get your hopes up about the loan unless you have a cosigner. That's what I thought I was going to do and I even spent years building my credit up to be able to do it. My credit was good but I still couldn't get a loan without a cosigner. :/\n\nI would contact the schools financial aid office, and if they have a diversity group, maybe reach out to them. If you have any disabilities at all (anxiety is a common one) contact the disability office too. They sometimes give grants/scholarships. \n\nDepending on where you are, some places have grants for covid relief. \n\nYou might need to work part time while in school. Maybe you can sign up for work study? \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's very unfair and awful.",
