  "text": "I had a professor distribute anti-vaccine propaganda during a course I was attending. Among their references were members of the \u201cdisinformation dozen\u201d the twelve people responsible for approximately 65% of anti-vaccine disinformation on popular social media. Are there any student support groups that can assist me navigating university systems for complaints? \n\nI have gone through enough of the process that it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, that the system is protecting \u201cone of their own\u201d. I feel so isolated and gas-lit as no faculty member can be permitted to empathize with my situation, since that would lend credence to my case. I do have a piece of inflammatory evidence in the form of a recording that another student took, and passed on to me, but we aren\u2019t supposed to record classes. I don\u2019t want to put myself or the other student into any legal jeopardy.",
