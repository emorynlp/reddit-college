The lectures are great but we spend a full class period every other week watching a movie. In high school I loved movies, it was like a free class to not pay attention and sleep if you wanted. But now that I\u2019m paying for school, I get a little annoyed when he turns on a movie. First of all, this class is at 8AM so it\u2019s always like, \u201cI really dragged myself out of bed, into my car, and onto campus just to watch a movie?\u201d But also, I can watch movies in my free time on YouTube. I\u2019m not getting anything exclusive to a college course that I\u2019m paying for by watching a film or documentary", "author": "LawfulnessFancy5450", "created": 1632771745, "retrieved": 1632799910, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hej5sij": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotp6/anyone_else_get_a_little_peeved_at_having_to/hej5sij/", "text": "I find that I don't learn as well from movies.

There is little way to get people to watch them otherwise. If you assign them as homework people won't watch them or will complain about being able to access/rent/buy them. Showing them in class is probably the only reasonable way to include them in the course.

It feels bad to complain about because it can certainly be worse, but I still would prefer to watch it on my own time because at the very least I can be comfy then. I want to be in my bed, eating a snack, able to set it to my preferred volume and brightness if I have to watch it\n\nIt could easily be the homework assignment or something so you can discuss the next day or something. I suppose profs don't do that because either that puts it on the student to find/rent/buy the movie or they don't want to/can't put the movie on blackboard or something, and it's easier to just show the movie in class", "author": "wishfulhermit", "created": 1632774793, "upvotes": 7}, "heignyt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotp6/anyone_else_get_a_little_peeved_at_having_to/heignyt/", "text": "I understand your frustration, and I'd be peeved too if we watched movies a lot of the time.  \n\nBut as faculty I can tell you that your professor is in a no-win situation.  At the end of the semester, half of the course evaluations will say \"I love the fact that we watched so many movies, because it really helped to drive the material home and kept us from the monotony of pure lectures\" while the other half will say \"Why couldn't you lecture more instead of showing us so many movies, the movies were boring and they took time away from you covering stuff that was more important.\"\n\nSo no matter what choice the professor makes, some students will love it, and some students will complain.  \n\nBest advice: just buckle down and go with the flow.  Express your belief that there were too many movies on the course evaluation at the end of the semester.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632774549, "upvotes": 4}}}
