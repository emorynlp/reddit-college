  "title:": "I just failed my 3rd Biology exam",
  "text": "First exam - didn't study at all - my fault. \n\nSecond exam - studied for two weeks straight every day. \n\nThird exam - studied every day since second exam and hired a tutor to meet twice a week. \n\nI don't know what else to do. I think there is nothing else to do but to retake this class. I'm extremely sad and unmotivated. I'm a bio major, <- will be changing that to chem bc I'm very good a chem compared to bio, however i still need to take bio as a science major. This is the easiest class too how am I not doing well? I have one more exam left in Bio and I have a 53% in the class. I basically need to score an A in the next exam to have a passing grade which is highly unlikely. I think this is extremely sad because I did put in the effort for the last two exams and I would cancel plans for it as well. I'm also avoiding my tutor bc he probably thinks i did well. I'm completely out of ideas right now. What do I do?",

          "text": "well my tutor looked at my second exam and said that it looked like I memorized everything but didn\u2019t really understand it. So for the third exam we began working on actually applying the steps on a picture and we drew out a lot of things. Which for this exam I definitely knew what was happening so idk why I still failed, I still need to see what I missed.",
