  "text": "So, I'm settling into freshman year just fine. Then October came, and everything started hitting the fan. First week: I get exposed to COVID just days before my mom and 82 year old Grandmother come to visit me, and have to miss a test for a class because of it (remember this). Next day I find out that I'm negative (even after a triple exposure) and can continue with my weekend and fall break. Weekend arrives an I attend the sporting events I so love to go to. What happens, only 4 straight blowout losses to the same team in 3 different sports, but at least I got to see family. Next Week: So the last week was a bit crazy, but this one will be better. Tuesday-Broken Phone. Wednesday-Oversleep all of my classes. Thursday-Find out the concert I want to go to is now a summer tour that I'll have to re-buy tickets for and won't get approval for from my mom (who I'll be living with in the summer) (No, being 18 doesn't change anything). So, at least I have more sports to look foreward to. Well, I forgot to meantion that I broke my phone right before watching a soccer game. So, we beat a terrible team by 1 point in football that we should've crushed- no satisfaction. But wait, it get's better. On Sunday, I learn that my boyfriend doesn't appreciate that I haven't talked to him as much as I should have (mostly because of the afformentioned events). Furthermore, I find out via my side (I'm in an open relationship) that someone is claiming I made racist comments. Except they never told me about it, or even told my side what I said, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what it could've been if that is true (for context, I have ASD, so my situational awareness is garbage, so that may be why). Anyway, the drama in the dorm is at a point where police almost get called, and fomal complaints made--almost. So I'm left in the dark on this, then Thursday comes... oh holy jesus. Event 1-My Red Sox are getting blown out, so I go to a volleyball game, where things are great after a 2-0 set lead needing 1 more to win. Then I get a call from my mom that a very close family friend died of COVID. After that call, I trip on my up the bleachers (this happened about 4 times). We then blow said lead, in which the away team cheers during our alma mater (extremely disresepctful and classless) So I leave pissed and upset, and trip on another set of stairs on my way back. At this point, I just yelled. Then I did it-I asked what else is going to happen? Less than 2 seconds later-airpods case falls out of my bag, and somehow doesn't break. But then I realised that my wallet wasn't in my bag. So I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and retrace all my steps, thankfully someone finds it. I get back to the dorm, not even 30 minutes later, someone accidentally sits on and breaks my glasses. I just went into my room after and yelled for a solid 30 minutes. I did not sleep for the 3rd night that week. Things get slightly better, even got to see Vanilla ice perform at a pride festival (I was as surpised as you probably are). But lo and behold, back to reality. I find out someone said (to my side) they had video evidence against the person who made the claims against me. Also, turns out the video was of her threatening physical violence against my side. Except one problem, they never sent him the video, and unfollowed him on all social media for no apparent reason. Next day, I find out the same person filed a formal complaint, so I'll now have to talk to the head RLC about the situation. In all of this chaos, I have yet to make up the afformentioned test, and have also not found time to complete a nine page research log, which I had already gotten extended due to the death of the family friend. Anyway, does anyone have any advice regarding the issues I'm having, or at least how to handle the stress of it?",
