  "title:": "Uni/College experience is a myth?",
  "text": "We have all been watching these american university/college experience movies, which project these years as the best of one's lives...You know - parties, boys, girls, adventurous relationships, friends, lots of drinking...basically years full of adrenaline, love, and a lots of fun. \n\nBut is it really this way? How many of you can tell that you live the uni/college experience presented in the movies? Is it just a myth? \n\nIt really bothers me. I haven't thought of it for a  while, but when I think of my current experience at uni (21 yrs old, pharmacy student) I tend to get terrible anxiety and grear FOMO. I litteraly get into an existential crisis. \n\nI like to think that all these drinking parties and amazing uni/college adventures are greatly romanticized and hyperbolized by Hollywood, leaving us with crushed expectations and a sense of failure to live the best years of our lives. \n\nFOMO = fear of missing out\n\nP.S. Not that me and my friends don't part hard etc, but it's just not what I've expected.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not really a myth, some of it is fantasy and exaggeration for sure but a lot of it is just finding your group and making shit happen on your own time, friends and social life in college are the same as a job, you have to work hard to make good friends and to do fun shit. A lot of it is the activities or groups you choose to join, you\u2019ll almost certainly never get into the college experience if you don\u2019t join Greek life as a guy, as a girl you can get away with it, but if you\u2019re a guy you better have some good connections. \n\nI\u2019m even a transfer student and I\u2019ve managed to get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d, I say this because I know a lot of transfer students have issues with social life, but they left their first school because they had social problems, it\u2019s not school specific it\u2019s person specific. I really believe being an extrovert is just a learned skill.",

Almost every day it feels like. \n\nI think being in a fraternity helps a lot and also going outside and just talking to random people in the first few weeks of school. That's what he did. Also he's a bio major so definitely possible to live that kind of lifestyle for STEM students.",
