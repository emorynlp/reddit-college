  "title:": "thinking of changing my major from secondary education to gynecology? thoughts/advice?",
  "text": "so my original plan was to major in secondary education (high school teacher), but i have been slowly swayed towards majoring in gynecology (idk what the official name of it is).\n\ni am a freshman in uni! so far my classes i\u2019m taking are pre-calculus, fine arts appreciation, texas government (this is a requirement no matter what major), and introduction to university. \n\nis it possible to switch over? this is a dumb question, but should i change it? i am in the very beginning of my college, i have not taken any courses before this. so now would be the best time to change it right?\n\nhave you done a complete change in directions when you first started college? like you had one idea but then scrapped everything and chose another?",
