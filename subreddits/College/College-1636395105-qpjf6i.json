  "text": "With the registration for next semester coming I can\u2019t help but feel stressed. I only need two more classes in my major pathway to graduate and I can\u2019t help but feel myself freaking out about not getting into them and having to stay an extra semester. I know that since I have 11 units left I have priority over others but I still feel my anxiety creeping up. If I didn\u2019t get into one of the classes I need is the school obligated to get me in so I can graduate? How would this work? Am I just freaking myself out? (That\u2019s probably the most likely answer). I think it feels pretty surreal that I am entering my last semester of college so my anxiety is giving me things to worry about.",
