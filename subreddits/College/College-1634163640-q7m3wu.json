  "text": "I'm kind of an introvert but I was still looking forward to meeting new people at college. After five weeks, I haven't talked to someone for more than 15 seconds at a time and I haven't went out even once. My roommate is a super weird guy, we don't get along very well. Do you, wise people od reddit, have any tips?",
