If locally it sucks, someones you can get free or low cost cards for online access of larger city ones.\n\nThe reason is MANY of these are paid, so, use the ones you have access to and follow citations to find that one obscure thing you might need and use [World Cat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and an inter-library loan to get it. 90% of the time they just fax your school the article or chapter.\n\n[Wikipedia has a list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines)\n\nOff the top of my head, Google Books and Scholar, Microsoft Scholar or whatever it was called, JSTOR, DOAJ, EBSCOhost, PubMed, ArXiv.org...\n\nCan also be worth looking at other schools lists. Local examples for me [one](https://libguides.uwinnipeg.ca/az.php) [two](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/az.php) [three](https://library.rrc.ca/az.php)",
