  "text": "I work 50+ hours a week and go to school full-time. I know I did it to myself, but my mental health has been out of control and plummeting lately. I did so well in high school, but now\u2026 And I think dropping classes or dropping out completely is gonna mess me up more than just sticking to it. I\u2019ll feel like a total failure. I don\u2019t have any friends who are also in school, so I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here. I can talk to my friends about it, but I feel like someone in the same boat is gonna understand better than in the boat next to me.",

ASU only lets you take 7 hours at a time, but it's in 7 week chunks. Maybe you drop half your load of you have 15 week terms and see if that's better. You have to take baby steps!",

I worked 50hrs at a daycare while attending asu it was tough but so mych more doable and flexible than traditional school and the whole program is asynchronous so no zoom classes just do the assignments and hand them in by the due date I am able to do them while having a newborn!",
