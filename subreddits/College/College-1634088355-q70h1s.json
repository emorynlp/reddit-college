  "text": "I work 50+ hours a week and go to school full-time. I know I did it to myself, but my mental health has been out of control and plummeting lately. I did so well in high school, but now\u2026 And I think dropping classes or dropping out completely is gonna mess me up more than just sticking to it. I\u2019ll feel like a total failure. I don\u2019t have any friends who are also in school, so I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here. I can talk to my friends about it, but I feel like someone in the same boat is gonna understand better than in the boat next to me.",
