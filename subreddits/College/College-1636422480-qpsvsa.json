  "text": "While in campus, I have gone to the bathroom at different buildings on purpose, even at different floors within the same building. I designed a rating system for each bathroom, I factored in the condition of the stalls, the traffic (approximately) of each building, or each floor, the amount of people in the bathroom at a given time, the cleanness of each bathroom at a given time, among other things. I have found the the best overall bathroom and the best bathrooms across campus.",

I will literally walk across campus to poop if I hate the nearest bathroom. \n\nMy favorite bathroom spot is our library's annex bathroom before exams. Fairly new,  not stinking with old lady perfume, cleaned on a regular basis, it's a one room bathroom so I don't have to worry about others hearing me, the floor it's on barely gets any traffic until people start cramming for exams, it's huge (handicap accessible), and it has a little shelf to put your stuff on 10/10.\n\nI also like the bathrooms in our science building, because it's clean and barely anyone uses it. However I think it's *too* quiet, and I've gained an irrational fear of being murdered on the shitter and nobody noticing for hours.",
