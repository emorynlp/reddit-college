  "text": "hello,\n\nI am trying to find a school to get my bachelors. I have already completed my associates at another school. I am looking for the cheapest online accredited school. I would prefer something that I can take 2 classes at a time and be considered full time. I would also like a school that is accelerated. So if i can get my bachelors in less than a year, that would be great. Is there anything out there like this? I have tried Devry and they take almost all of my credits. They want 40K!!!! I think that is too much... I would get done with my bachelors in a little over a year which is so appealing to me. I have 3.0 and looking to go into business hr or management.. something like that. If anyone could help me i would really appreciate it!!!",

      "text": "I transferred form an in-person school to SNHU online and they are accredited and consider 2 classes per term (8 week terms) full time. There is a new term every 2 weeks so you can get your degree pretty fast. It\u2019s accredited and personally I pay about 1,000 something a class which i was better than 40k a year haha. I\u2019d say check out r/SNHU if you want to know more but overall i\u2019m satisfied and am only a few terms away from getting my degree and graduating on time!",
