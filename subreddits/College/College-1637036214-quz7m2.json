  "text": "Hello! I am 19 and in my 3rd month of college. As of right now, I\u2019m not feeling the best about it. I am quite lonely and have only made a few friends, and my classes are hard for me work-wise, not to mention the stress and anxiety that comes with mental health conditions. I just felt like posting this as a form of venting but also to see if anyone is in my position. Do you guys think it\u2019ll get better? I\u2019m a friendly guy and love to talk to people, but am very scared when it comes to meeting new people and starting conversations. Thanks!",

Read this sub reddit for at least a week and you'll find that the MAJORITY of freshman are all putting the same exact thing into posts. \n\nAll freshman have anxiety and depression. All freshman can't make friends and don't see any way they could. All freshman get homesick. \n\nTalk to people. They don't bite. If they do, at least you know where you can satisfy that kink when the time comes.",

      "text": "I am going to be honest; friends aren't going to come magically. If you go through college without every being proactive and seeking out friendships, then you will most likely end up friendless. The best way to make friends is to join clubs. Make sure to pick clubs that you actually want to be in. Avoid stuff like frats or sororities because they come with a lot of harm. \n\nAs for academics, college is hard for everyone. College is much harder than high school. The best thing you can do is ensure you are spending two hours studying for every hour of class you have. You should be spending at least 40 hours per week on academics. When studying, make sure you actually understand the material rather than memorizing.",
