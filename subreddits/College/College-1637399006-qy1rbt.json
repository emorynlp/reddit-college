  "title:": "Advice needed: Renting a 'private' dorm room with shared bathroom and kitchen or renting a dorm studio?",
  "text": "Little disclaimer: I'm a european student. The dorm situation here is different than in other parts of the world (e.g. USA). Sharing a bedroom with multiple people isn't really a thing here. Sharing a bathroom and/or kitchen is. On average you share a bathroom/kitchen with 10-ish people.\n\nI'm already in my masters and I'm starting a second masters next year. I've lived in a dorm with shared kitchen and bathroom for years now and I'm starting to think that I want more of my own space. I can rent a studio dorm, with all facilities for my own, for 200 euros more than what I pay now. In theory the money is no problem, but I know that there are better ways to spend 200 euros, like going out for dinner with friends, going on a vacation and not having to worry about money too much, or buying a nicer present for someone etc, just little things that make life just that bit more worth living, if you see what I mean. \n\nThe shared kitchen is the decision-maker for me. Pro's of a shared kitchen are that there are always people around, up for something fun. But the fact that there are always people around is also a contra for me. Sometimes I just want to come home and cook on my own, have dinner on my own and dont be bothered by someone else, or having to wait to use the oven/microwave... I have my friends, the people that I love and members of a shared kitchen change every year. After all those years of studying, I want some stability as well. I'm feeling a bit too old to hang around with college freshmen and watch them party till they black out etc. This is a me-problem, but sometimes I feel a bit too responsible for them and that's something I don't want anymore.\n\nWhy I would not go to a studio dorm: I'm afraid I will be lonely. There will be no spontaneous kitchen gatherings anymore, I don't see my friends that often and sometimes is nice to come home and have someone to talk to. \n\nWhat do you guys think of it? What should I do? Do you have experiences with both of them? Help me out.",
