  "text": "Jesus christ the amount of ignorant and selfish people coming into college classrooms is ridiculous. Look in terms of people coming in late it is what it is. I have to drive two hours to college every day I understand if you're late.\n\nBut for the other people wtf are you doing? As I'm writing this someone just walked in with their hibachi dinner from last night. Look i get it you're starving but its fucking 10am and we are in a packed classroom, no one is trying to smell that shit.\n\nLiterally five minutes before this person walked in a \"couple\" were whispering to each other and laughing since the start of class. Thank you for whispering but we can still hear you dumbass. Anyone else experience stuff like this? If so what are your stories?",
