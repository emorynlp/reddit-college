  "text": "Hi guys, i'm a freshman and recently i just stepped foot on campus for the first time. I was wondering why i haven't made a single friend the first milisecond of attending my classes. I was really hoping my classmates would like me even though i am an introvert and haven't tried the effort of speaking to anyone. I'm so lonely. Also my room mate pissed himself on his bed and im not sure who tell. Please help.",
