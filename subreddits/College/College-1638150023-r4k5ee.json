  "title:": "Losing interest in my classes (time management/motivation/ADHD advice?)",
  "text": "I'm a psych major in my sophomore year of college, and I'm really starting to lose interest in all my classes. I'm always pretty motivated at the beginning of the semester, and then it plummets at some point (i.e. right about now). My grades have been pretty good so far (mostly A's, some B's), but now they're starting to drop a little bit, which is usually a sign that things are about to get really bad. I've been skipping assignments, missing entire weeks of class, and just slacking in general. In some classes, I started slacking right away, and it's just starting to catch up to me now.\n\nThe class I'm most concerned about is intro to research (pretty important considering my career aspiration, which is research psychology). The class is online and asynchronous, and the only times I've ever even looked at the material is right before or during a test, and I've retained pretty much none of the information, which really scares me, because I'm worried it'll affect my performance in future classes and overall understanding of the subject. Sometimes I want to just go over all the material on my own to catch up, but whenever I try, I find I don't even have the mental energy to comprehend it, and it all sounds like gibberish, so I just give up.\n\nIt probably has a lot to do with starting college in the middle of COVID (last year, most of my classes were online, and I was able to cheat/get away with not studying, which really messed up my time management and study skills). Still, I've always struggled with time management and motivation because of ADHD and mental health issues. I also grew up \"gifted,\" so I never had to study or work that hard to get good grades, which also probably messed me up. I usually either immediately understand things, or I don't, and end up never understanding because my brain checks out whenever things don't come easy to me.\n\nSo yeah, I've been struggling. It's not because of lack of interest in the subject. I love learning about psychology, and I'm pretty certain I wanna have a career in research, because I want to continue learning about the subject for the rest of my life. I just don't wanna put the work in, which isn't doing me any favors. I'm really concerned it'll affect my future, and the anxious part of my brain keeps telling me I'm already off to a bad start, so my entire career is screwed. I've always had major time management issues, and it feels like that'll never get better with time (because so far, it's only gotten much, much worse). I guess I'm looking for advice on how to develop time management skills when you've never really had them, and also how to regain motivation mid-semester. Also, how to navigate college classes when you have ADHD. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "Honestly, you don\u2019t need to learn how to \u201cregain motivation.\u201d You need to learn how to study even when you don\u2019t feel particularly motivated. You\u2019re not going to be motivated 100% of the time. You need to learn to push through. I promise that most people who study hard have other things they\u2019d rather be doing at that time. Even so, nobody on Reddit can give you motivation. It has to come from an internal source. You say you have career aspirations. That should be your motivation. \n\nAlso there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to have a successful career in research/academia if you cheat. You\u2019re not going to have the necessary skills or knowledge and if you get caught for academic dishonesty, you\u2019re going to have a hard time getting a job in research. \n\nThere are tons of resources on the internet and YouTube in particular about how to manage your time in college. Find something that works for you and stick to it. There are no resources that will teach you to \u201cput the work in\u201d if you\u2019re unwilling. That\u2019s on you. If you need mental health help or help for your ADHD, you should look for counseling or a campus mental health center. However, you\u2019re still going to need to make a plan and stick to it even when it\u2019s not fun if you expect to reach your goals.",

      "text": "As another user mentioned, when ADHD is a factor, mental health treatment is a big factor. Even if meds aren't an option for you for whatever reason, you may be able to do therapy or ADHD coaching through your university, and they could help you learn skills that work for you personally!\n\n\nAs far as resources, [How To ADHD](https://youtube.com/c/HowtoADHD) is a great channel for ADHD tools.\n\n\nI agree with the comment that mentions that it's less an issue of always being motivated and more that you want to make things work when you aren't. For that, you want to make things as easy for yourself as possible. That can mean breaking down tasks into smaller steps, regimenting more of your time, using external things/people to keep you accountable, and finding ways to strategically cut corners when things just aren't sticking.\n\n\nAs far as motivation, though, I think breaking things down and keeping them novel can help. I usually have 2-3 tasks that I jump between; more than that is too many, but if you feel \"blah\" about one, you can jump around and get stuff done. I also like doing things like Pomodoro where I'm working against a clock, both because that tells me when it's okay to stop and because I can gamify it (ie, \"can I write this section before my next break?\"). Lastly, body doubling is cool because you've got someone there to keep you on track, and it always feels less frustrating to work on things when someone is there suffering with you imo. \n\n\nBut everyone with ADHD is different, so sometimes you've just got to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks. Maybe what works for someone else is garbage for you, and that's okay, as long as you keep messing around to see what your brain seems to do best with.",
