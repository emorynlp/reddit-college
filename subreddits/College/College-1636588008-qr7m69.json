  "text": "Hello! I wish to major in geography in general, maybe something in GIS, I\u2019m not too sure. Whenever I look for colleges with good geography majors on the internet, I am only shown very prestigious Ivy League schools that I don\u2019t think I could get into. I\u2019m an alright student, I got a 1440 SAT, few extracurriculars though. I\u2019m a NYS resident, and I want a cheap but good school, preferably large. A lot of schools are simply too expensive for my family\u2019s range! Does anyone know of such a school?",
