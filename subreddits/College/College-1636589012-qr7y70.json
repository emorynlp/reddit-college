  "text": "Every time I see a dog I start daydreaming about getting my own. I've never not had a dog or cat in my life and it's so strange. My roommates don't want one, and I know I couldn't really give the dog the attention is deserves loving in an apartment, but damn if I don't look at the dogs in the shelters every day. I thought going back home and visiting my dogs would help hold off those feelings, but it just makes me want one even more.",
