  "text": "I am majoring in BA with minors in MIS and HR. I think it's only 12-15 units to minor and I intend on using both summers that I have to knock them off. Hell even some of my major classes are part of the minors for both so I might be overreaching, but I was asking for people who have or are currently minoring in two things did it go well or is it going well?",

      "text": "Most schools will let you have multiple advisors. Find a nice prof in each department (ask the upperclassmen, they know who's good) and go to them. Even if they can't be an official advisor, many will agree to help you at least see if your minors and plan are reasonable. No idea what all the acronyms you're using stand for, but it should apply unless the minors are in the same department as your major. \n\nAlso, if you don't have a faculty advisor, go to a department head for each dpt your major/minors are in and just ask for advice.",

If it ends up being difficult for some reason, you can always drop them. No reason to overthink it. It\u2019s really just a matter if you think it\u2019s worth your time and money to do them.",
