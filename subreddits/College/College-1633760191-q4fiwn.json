  "text": "I know there\u2019s a lot of these types of questions and posts on here, but can anyone help? I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve really made any friends at college. I\u2019m halfway through my first semester and it feels like everyone I talk to either already has a solid friend group they came to college with or is just not interested in talking. \n\nI have a couple of people in different classes I talk to when I see them and I get along with them pretty well but I don\u2019t know how to approach them about hanging out. I\u2019m in a fraternity but all anyone wants to ever do is go out and drink 5 days a week and I just don\u2019t like that scene. I\u2019ve tried it a couple times and it just isn\u2019t fun to me. I fee like I\u2019m just watching the days go by and doing nothing with myself. I\u2019m supposed to be making friends for life but instead I just talk to my roommate and long distance girlfriend most days. I don\u2019t want to throw a pity party or anything I just need some serious advice here.",

      "text": "Does any of your courses have help/study sessions? I've found those are generally good environments to try strike up a conversation with someone and they'll most likely be people who are studious too. You can also have the course itself being the conversation starter too.\n\n\n>I have a couple of people in different classes I talk to when I see them and I get along with them pretty well but I don\u2019t know how to approach them about hanging out. \n\nYou've just got to bite the bullet and offer them to grab coffee or something. The worst thing they can say is no and it will allow you to get to know them better.",
