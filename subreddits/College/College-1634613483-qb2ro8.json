  "text": "So I'm a sophomore in college, I'm not the most social guy out there, and I have a rather special situation.\n\nFor one, I did not have a dormmate freshman year because I was off campus for the entirety of last year (due to COVID). Two, I live in an off campus apartment with a roommate I don't like that much. Apartments aren't like dorms too much because there are not very social. All my classes are online/remote again (because of COVID reasons), so I can't really meet people that way for now. I've joined a religious college group, and meeting people there was mostly a success, but I still want to meet even more people outside that group.\n\nI also do not like fraternities (I'm a guy here), mostly because I am not into partying and I feel like frats do some questionable stuff.\n\nAnd with on-campus (one-time) events, I meet some people there, next day, they're gone and I probably don't see them again.\n\nSo in short, how can I go about meeting others?\n\nBasically, any of you in college who were desperate to make friends (even if it was your freshman year), and you were in a bad situation too, how did you go about it? I realize for many people, especially freshman, roommates, classmates are probably the first two picks, but those are not options for me unfortunately. Thanks for any advice it really means a lot to me.",

      "text": "Best advice is, the people you meet and speak to, always ask for their socials. Then after a few days message them asking them to grab lunch or coffee or something. That way it wouldn\u2019t seem like they \u201cdisappeared\u201d and it can help getting to know them 1on1.",
