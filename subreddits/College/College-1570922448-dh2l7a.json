I am struggling with the clubs as I understand the amount of homework we get, but still try to go.\n\nI am not the type to party and drink AT ALL, and I won't even try to be. Don't get into those activities just to seem cool and as an excuse to be \"social\"; you can be social while studying with them too. Try to find people that are like you, you won't like being around people that keep drinking and partying all the time if you're not like that anyway.\n\nGood luck dude, hopefully you can be in a happier state of mind as you settle into college.", "author": "moreddit2169", "created": 1570925662, "upvotes": 2}, "f3hlwfs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dh2l7a/loneliness_at_college/f3hlwfs/", "text": "As others have mentioned, joining clubs is great. Try finding one friend who you have stuff in common with and start talking to them A LOT. They might have their own friends too, TALK TO THEM TOO! I was in a similar situation as you (except I came from another state) and this is what's helped me so far. I did marching band so a lot of my friends are from there. I also found friends in my own major. College can be scary when a ton of people are there just to drink and party. Not everyone is like that. I went to a party school and I easily found people who are better students than me. Also, something I've noticed about international students at least in my school is that they tend to always be friends with people from their original country. Maybe find someone from where you're from (if possible) and talk to them. That's what usually helps a ton of other people.
