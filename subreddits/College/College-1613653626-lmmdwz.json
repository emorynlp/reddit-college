More often than not, your exhaustion will only make you perform worse, but when you have hard deadlines for presentations/projects, late nights are necessary to pass your classes. My advice: get your sleep when you can, bite the bullet when you can\u2019t. If you\u2019re noticing a pattern of late nights/no sleep, look at your schedule and your workload and honestly ask yourself if it is that unattainable. If it isn\u2019t, dial it back at work, take out loans so you work fewer hours, or figure out how to optimize your current routine to either meal prep or something similar, plan out your days, etc. Live within your means. Find other ways to plan on naps etc. This is especially important if you\u2019re for an independent student. Sometimes it will come down to not eating or eating that week\u2014in that case I would say find ways to survive first, sleep second. Next would be school and homework. I know this isn\u2019t asking about mental health, but find a way to keep yourself sane. For some, that\u2019s planning a day to knock out all your schools work, but for me that isn\u2019t an option, so I try to anticipate busy school days and work on homework in the meantime. Then I plan out my work schedule and other cooking/laundry/chores schedules\u2014 from there, sleep should be planned in, but pay attention to that balance. \n\nIf your workload is attainable, I would suggest finding what helps you to focus on finishing everything you need to. I use the forest app as well as bullet journaling to keep me accountable, but there are many options that are effective for different people. I find what\u2019s best for me is to work mornings, go to class around 1-7(which i didn\u2019t choose but was set by my college), cook dinner/go to meetings from 8-9:30, and then work on assignments after that. I\u2019m aware that isn\u2019t attainable all of the time, so I tend to take a day off of homework abd a day off of schoolwork every week to catch up on sleep/homework/payroll hours etc. I know that was long but wish y\u2019all all the best with school and finding what works best for you.", "author": "hopeless_sarcastic", "created": 1613715755, "upvotes": 1}, "gnz8rk4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/lmmdwz/the_culture_surrounding_sleep_in_college_is_a/gnz8rk4/", "text": "Sometimes my anxiety about college is too high to sleep anyway so I may as well do something productive.
