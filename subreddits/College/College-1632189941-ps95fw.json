I've finished my sociology major and am just taking an honors thesis class now. I added on the economics major junior year because I enjoyed the intro level courses and thought economics would complement sociology well and expand my job/grad school prospects. But the classes have taken a toll on me. My gpa went from a 3.9 to a 3.6 because of two C's in intermediate classes and I have 5 courses left to finish the major. I am taking 3 this semester (that makes my courseload 22 credits with all other college requirements) and I'll have to take two more next semester. The classes this semester are doable but I'm afraid of lowering my gpa even further because when I overload, I do poorly on classes and I've only accepted that fact now. I'm considering dropping the econ major to free up my courseload but I'm afraid that I won't have many options after college in terms of jobs/ grad school. The 3 econ courses really add a lot to my workload (even though they're relatively easy compared to the classes I got C's in). I just don't think I can manage it all and it's taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nIs it necessary for me to finish the econ major? I've completed 7 classes (with 2 C's and rest A's and B's) and have 5 more left for this year (senior year, currently taking 3). I'm just exhausted.
