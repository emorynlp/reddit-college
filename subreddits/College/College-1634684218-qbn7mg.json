  "text": "I'm struggling with a choice, do I live with my girlfriend of 6 years, or do I live with three other teammates of mine on the hockey team. I'm a productive guy and i know being with my girlfriend would be better, and I want that. However, with the hockey guys the location is within walking distance to my classes and could be fun. Not sure what to do thats why I'm on reddit.",

Fun, close to campus, save you time and possibly closer to study areas on days teammates are rowdy. \n\nLet\u2019s say your gf is the one. I think having a little bit of distance and allowing yourself the experiences of roommate\u2019s, etc would benefit long-term. 10 years from now, are you okay with \u201cI wished I had spent every year during college with my gf\u201d or \u201cI wished I had taken the time to branch out and enjoy college a little with roommate bonding, etc?\u201d",

You\u2019ll spend time with your team probably a lot when you practice & play games and are on the road, but you might not spend as much with your gf. I think living with your team might exacerbate that a little more. Idk tho, idk you at all or anything about your thoughts here in this matter, just spewing hypotheticals haha. That\u2019d be where my head would be at tho. Teammates do sound more fun tho. Sounds like a recipe for parties & good times.",
