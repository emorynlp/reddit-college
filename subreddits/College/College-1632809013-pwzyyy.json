However, while being a freshman it's so boring doing online classes. You don't get to socialize and show your craft. I might be able to live in a dorm since my school in New York is opening dorms soon. Will, it is weird for me to be a 20-year-old sophomore in college? My future college friends say it's not at all since the majority of freshmen are my age at best. I guess I feel bad because most peers rub it in my face and started at a university earlier than me and say they are living the best time of there lives and that im wasting my life. It's really putting a mark and hurting so badly. How can I get this mindset out of my head? It makes me regret wanting to go to college because of embarrassment of age....", "author": "luludica_is_ded", "created": 1632809013, "retrieved": 1632945511, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "comments": {"hel57b6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwzyyy/is_it_bad_that_i_started_college_at_19/hel57b6/", "text": "Wtf are you talking about, I literally finished high school couple months ago.

At first I didn\u2019t care but I started to dwell on it towards the end of what would\u2019ve been my freshman year seeing people post on their stories about finishing their freshmen year of college and how great it was. A part of me regrets it but at the same time everything was online (at my college) last year so that made me feel a bit better about missing out but I\u2019ve actually met some really cool people this year and we\u2019re in a group chat and planning on hanging out. I don\u2019t feel as bad about it anymore cuz I have a summer birthday and am only older then some of my peers by a few months so we\u2019re around the same age anyway.
