  "text": "Unpopular opinion: the magic in your essays exist predominantly in rough drafts\n\nAs we continue to revise constantly over and over, we lose the voice that gave our essays that unique spark. \n\nPeople criticized my UC essays much more than my common app essays even though my UC essays were revised much much more. This was because my UC essays barely had voice.\n\n(If truth be told, my common app essay was barely a second draft. All my stanford essays are rough drafts.)\n\nI feel that this is because people feel like they have a right to criticize something where no voice and/or personality is attached to it. \n\nThis leads me to an important point: stand out so much to the admissions officers that they feel like rejecting you is equivalent to shooting your friend. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to be informal and use parentheses and such. In fact, your essays should read like this post. \n\nThen again, this is an unpopular opinion of mine.",
