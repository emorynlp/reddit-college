Before I came to college, I think I had an idea in my head that I was instantly going to make friends and have a group to do stuff with. But, I haven\u2019t really made any friends. I feel like i\u2019m meeting a ton of people but no one wants to hang out with me or they\u2019d rather hang out with other people. I feel like i\u2019ve really tried my best to make friends by going to clubs, campus events and really putting myself out there but nothing seems to stick. \n\nRecently, I met a girl in one of my classes who I actually bonded with over not having many friends. I\u2019ve been eating and hanging out with her for the past two week and I thought that I finally made a friend. I even went shopping with her and another girl today! After shopping, they talked about meeting up later that night. Once we got back to the dorms though, they said they were gonna take a nap and just chill for a bit and I thought we\u2019d eventually meet back up. So, I invited them to dinner and one didn\u2019t respond and the other said she already ate. I figured \u201cno big deal\u201d we\u2019d hang out later. So I texted her if she wanted to do something this evening and she said that she had to study and couldn\u2019t do anything. Guess who I ran into? It was her and the other girl laughing in the hall and i\u2019m pretty sure they ate dinner together. It honestly hurt my feelings. \n\nI don\u2019t know if i\u2019m being sensitive but i really thought this girl was my friend. But, as soon as she meets someone better, i\u2019m ditched to the side. Why lie too? I  wouldn\u2019t have been as hurt if she just straight up told me she wanted to hang with just the two of them. \n\nI am more reserved and quiet than most people but i really have tried to put effort into meeting people. I\u2019m so lonely and just wish that I was someone\u2019s first choice:( I hope college gets better bc I don\u2019t know if I can take four years of this.  Sorry for the negativity. I\u2019m just sad", "author": "RarePea", "created": 1632032166, "retrieved": 1632801457, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hdhfgz8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr2mdp/college_kinda_sucks/hdhfgz8/", "text": "Don\u2019t give up. I know plenty of people who struggled freshman year but managed to find friends later. For me, it was the opposite- made friends freshman year, realized sophomore year we mainly hung out because we lived close to each other and weren\u2019t really that close. I\u2019m short- just because you do or don\u2019t have friends freshman year doesn\u2019t mean it will always be like that. Things change, for the worse and for the better.

The first semester is a complete crapshoot in terms of making friends. Heck, I remember my first semester being crummy that way, because everyone but me on my hall wanted to go Greek, so they made a ton of friends the first weekend. I spent all my time on my high school friend's hall, which for me (male) was both fun (the hall was all female) and lonely (I wasn't meeting men to be friends with). \n\nCollege is a weird experiment, where we take people out of their familiar environments, put them in new environment, shake them all up, and see which people connect to each other to make a new familiar environment. The extra challenge the experimenters included was they didn't give complete information about how the physics of connecting work. Some people have the dumb luck of floating past others with the right connectors, while others have to float around a bit longer. Even when people connect, they don't really know why; in fact the connections might be surprisingly weak. The environment gets shaken a few more times -- when people pledge, when people choose second-year roommates, when the first round of break-ups happen -- and new connections form.\n\nThat doesn't really help feeling lonely. Most humans aren't built to handle loneliness with anything other than a preoccupation to stop being lonely. But the nice thing about college is, there _are_ people to connect well with, but it can take some wandering and shake-ups to find them.", "author": "dcgrey", "created": 1632057773, "upvotes": 6}, "hdfmunh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr2mdp/college_kinda_sucks/hdfmunh/", "text": "Dude, I fucking feel you. This is also what I\u2019m currently experience, only difference is I have it a little better because I\u2019m rooming with an old friend but yea I thought I\u2019d be able to find a group to do stuff with but nope, haven\u2019t made a single long term friend at all.
