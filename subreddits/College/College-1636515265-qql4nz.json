As long as you do well in community college you can always transfer to Texas A&M once you get your associates.",

I\u2019ll have my first 2 years out of the way and be a junior with $0 in student loans. \n\nPlus it\u2019s very common for students to go to Blinn then transfer to A&M in Texas. They have a partnership and like 53% of grads go to A&M after they get their 2 year. Its 20k students so it\u2019s very much a big school experience. I grew up in Texas and it was known as the feeder school, a lot of my friends went there",

          "text": "I lost all my high school friends going to college too, and it was more that we didn't have anything deep in common, just surface shallow things. I don't think it matters. What does matter is having a good retirement you can enjoy. I look at my grandparents who retired at 60, young and healthy, a d then it makes me want to cry when I see old people working at Walmart. Not having loans for college really matters a bunch.",
