  "text": "Me: \n\n*Begins reading for an assignment*\n\n*Discovers something interesting and becomes obsessed with it.*\n\n*Begins a research rage on Google on one fact.*\n\n*Researches the fact for two hours*\n\n*Realizes I have only a few more hours to complete the rest of the assignment/reading.*\n\n*Discovers another interesting fact and repeats*\n\n\nHelp\n\nEdit: I appreciate everyone's concerned about me. Although I understand why some Redditors may consider this a symptom of ADHD, I don't believe this is the case for me. Although I am distracted, and naturally VERY curious,  I am able to get my assignments in on time (thank goodness for check lists). Again, I appreciate the concern, but I believe I'm just a overly curious person.",

I\u2019m just a slow student. I\u2019m getting to the point to feeling discriminated against from these kinds of professors. I mean, take others into consideration, ya know?\n\nI mean yeah you can go through your school\u2019s mental health department or whatever, but they\u2019ll just give you a professor\u2019s assistant.

Someone actually cares and isn't just trying to sprint through a grad requirement!\".\n\nMy STEM professors have been more in the \"learn what I tell you to learn. Any depth I don't lecture you on, I will not ask you about and you will waste your time learning\". They don't tend to want to engage with content beyond the scope of the course. This is why I want to do research though, so I finally feel like I can take my time with a subject I want to learn more about. Keep your intellectual curiosity alive! I love the \"why\", implications, \"what if\"/\"can we manipulate this\" and \"how\".",

I mapped out my entire 7 year PhD this way to make sure I was staying on track in a system without real hard deadlines. I use a whiteboard to map out my long term deadlines (for college students, it might be big projects due at the end of the semester with a solid, hard deadline.) \n\nBreak down the project into shorter deadlines (that you'll have to impose on yourself) in order to have the big project done on time. For a paper, \"I need to have part 1 of 4 done by XX date in order to start part 2 of 4 with enough time.\" Break part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4 into manageable tasks that you can physically \"check off\" on your whiteboard and reward yourself every time you check something off. \"Part 1a needs to be done by XX time in order to reach my deadline for part 1.\" For me, it might be, \"I will allow myself to watch 3 episodes of my favorite show as soon as XX is checked off.\" Or, \"I will buy myself a desk plant as soon as XX is checked off.\" You have to hold yourself accountable to those deadlines, though. Plan something \"bigger\" for when you get that big project done -- a new outfit you've been eyeing or a fancy dinner, or a video game binge night. \n\nI put mine really visible in my room or office so the deadlines are fresh in my brain. I also leave a space to physically check off the task and it feels soooo gooood. I still use this as a professor working toward tenure, with my whiteboards visible in my office. It just helped me finish a paper I have been working on for almost a year. And it still feels sooooo gooood and I have a cute new house plant. I also don't feel as stressed by a lot of long term projects just floating in my brain -- they become mapped out and manageable.\n\nIf you miss a deadline, don't beat yourself up. Use it to motivate yourself to get back on track. I hope it helps. It works for me!!",
