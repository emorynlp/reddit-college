{"sid": "psv7xa", "link": "/r/college/comments/psv7xa/roommates_eating_my_food/", "title:": "Roommates Eating My Food", "text": "So I live in a suite-style residence - I share an apartment on campus with 5 other people. For the most part, I haven't really socialized with my suitemates since I'd already found my friend group before moving in so I've really been hanging out with them for the most part, which could potentially make my living situation awkward, but it really doesn't bother me. \n\nAnyway, there's a refrigerator in the shared kitchen where everyone puts their stuff. I recently started buying groceries for myself to save $$$ on my meal plan. I put all my stuff together in the back of the fridge to avoid invading anyone else's space and also so no one would mistakenly take my food. I also put my frying pan in an empty cupboard at the very bottom since I assumed the cupboard was unused. This morning I come out into the kitchen to not only see my frying pan has been used, but someone has eaten 7/12 of the eggs in my carton. Maybe I'm missing something, but isn't it usually common sense to ask before eating someone else's food or using their stuff? The pan I don't really care about, I mean it would've been nice if I'd have been asked beforehand but whatever. But when someone else is eating my food is when I have an issue. On top of that, there was another egg carton stacked underneath mine (which someone moved from the back of the fridge) literally unopened. No one has ever mentioned anything in the group chat or anything about all the food being shared either so clearly, I'm missing something if that's the case. \n\nI know it's probably best to just talk it out with my roommates but I don't want to be put in an awkward situation because I really haven't interacted with them much yet. They probably already think I'm weird because I haven't gone out to socialize with them and now I'm scared they're gonna think I'm a bitch too for confronting them about eating my food when really I just don't want my food being touched. I'm thinking of just putting sticky notes on my stuff, but I'm not sure if that would come off as passive-aggressive or petty?\n\nAnyway, I feel like this is an awkward situation and I have no idea what to do so if anyone could give advice I'd appreciate it.
