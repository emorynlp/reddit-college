It exists for precisely this situation, and it is cheap as hell.  \n\nOh, and over the past 20-30 years, while parents were setting their kids up to apply to college in elementary school, the Blue Collar Tradesmen industry has seriously gotten their act together with training & apprenticeship programs.  \n\nThey will pay you to attend their schools and learn their trade, and help get you started.  \n\nYou don't have to work on a construction site lugging bags of cement.  \n\nYour regional arborist(s) need people to care for trees.  \nResidential HVAC people are earning six-figures (after a healthy amount of experience).", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1632859776, "upvotes": 3}}}
