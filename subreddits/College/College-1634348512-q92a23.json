I don\u2019t know why you think you need to take that much in one semester but your asking to fail. That\u2019s too much. 19 is very hard in its own right but 23 is too much by a mile. You may be able to do it if you do literally nothing in life but get 6 hours of sleep and do school all day. But I wouldn\u2019t. Just honesty from me.",

Last semester I took 20 credits (6 classes) and ended with a 4.0, unemployed. I had plenty of time to do other things during the week as well. This semester I am taking 14 credits (4 classes) with part time work and I\u2019m honestly struggling. :,) You\u2019ll definitively need to be on top of it if you\u2019re going to take 23 credits\u2026",

It\u2019s a risky situation that could go poorly",
