  "title:": "how to appropriately discuss how my medication is affecting my school work w my professor",
  "text": "so to preface this, i struggle w ADHD, depression, anxiety, and at the beginning of college i went through a rough patch and ended up on academic probation, nearly loosing my scholarship. i got into therapy, got on good medication and everything turned around. started getting all A\u2019s, even got on the deans list. I\u2019ve recently had some big life changes, had to change my medication, preventing me from taking my medicine specifically for ADHD. it\u2019s now the last 2 weeks of school and there\u2019s this 1 class i\u2019ve really struggled w. i\u2019m nervous and don\u2019t know how to approach the professor about this situation, as it is an online class and we\u2019ve never met face to face so i have to explain this all through email. i don\u2019t want him to think it\u2019s some excuse. I currently have a low B, but have A Lot of work left to do that i am honestly at a loss on how to do and am lacking so much motivation (which i\u2019m not gonna give up, i\u2019m just having a hard time) Any advice on how to approach this situation would be appreciated!!",

      "text": "Sorry you're struggling! I hope things are getting sorted out; school without meds is rough.\n\n\nFirst things first, what is the goal in sending the email? Do you want help on assignments, help figuring out how to stay on track, potential extensions? You want a specific ask, so the prof knows why you're reaching out and has something clear to respond to.\n\n\nIn situations like this, less detail is often more. So you can mention you have an ongoing medical thing without getting into details of the diagnosis. If you feel the need to give more detail, I'd go for something neutral like \"I'm adjusting a medication, but it's taking some time.\" Generally beyond that, you don't want to disclose your diagnosis or the details of your mental health.\n\n\nLastly, if you're looking for something like extensions, be prepared that some of them may fell you to go through your disability services. Not all of them, but some of them want it documented before they'll budge. Working with that office may get you some academic resources specific to your situation, so they may be helpful regardless!\n\n\nBest of luck!",

          "text": "thank you for your reply, it\u2019s much appreciated! I am not 100% sure what my goal of the email would be honestly. I have accommodations that would allow extensions for certain things so i suppose that wouldn\u2019t hurt to mention. i think i really just want to make him aware of my situation as he doesn\u2019t even know i have accommodations or that i\u2019m struggling and there\u2019s not much time left of this semester. Do you think it may be a good idea to brief him of the situation and ask him how to go about it?",

              "text": "I think it could be a good idea to bring up your accommodations and check in about using them, definitely! The good thing about those is you wouldn't have to disclose much, since you've got the paperwork telling faculty that you have need of things like the extensions. :) I'd say check in soon and they should be receptive to that conversation.",
