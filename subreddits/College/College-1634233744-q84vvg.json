  "text": "Started my major when covid started, so I only got to take online classes, plus I'm quiet and I can't help it. All the professors that responded basically say they don't really know me. Can quiet people just not get into grad school or, I don't know what to do. Any ideas?",

You might have to work on establishing relationships in the time you have left and stave off graduate school. Visa versa you can try and get professional LOR's as well to substitutive.",

      "text": "I am quiet as well, but I have found you can bond more with profs if you do research, go to office hours to ask questions, or apply to be a TA. You don't even need to have a question to go to office hours, just maybe go in and talk about how you found something in class interesting to show that you are engaged and motivated in the material. Make sure you do this with 3-4 profs though as usually you need three letters of rec. I am not sure what you want to do for grad school but these have worked for me as most of the profs know me in my department since I have done these things.",
