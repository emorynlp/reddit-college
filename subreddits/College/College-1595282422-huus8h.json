I have a friend whose working part time and also will be getting free money, which lasts until December 31st. \n\nIf you file soon enough, you may be able to catch the last week of FEUC checks ($600) which end on the 25th. If you fill out the PUA application you are automatically considered for it. \n\nWish I applied for this sooner but hey, college students can get financial assistance as well!\n\nEdit: Smart people are pointing out a bunch of important notes in the comments\n\n1. States will soon be requiring proof of a cancelled job and may investigate those who can't provide proof.\n\n2. This income is taxed, so keep that in mind\n\n3. States will soon require proof of actively looking for jobs (I'm waiting to start an internship so I will be going off pua eventually)\n\n4.
