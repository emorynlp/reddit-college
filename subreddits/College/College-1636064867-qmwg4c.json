  "text": "So I'm a community college freshman, I plan on transferring after two years or a year. I really can't afford to go away financially. I can transfer after cc to my local state school and if I did that I'd graduate with zero debt. Would that be a smarter move? My problem is my social life is absolutely miserable at community college as most of my classmates are way older than me and there is nothing going on. I also can't stand my parents and where I live. I'm really afraid of dealing with student debt. Any advice will help.",

Also, idk the amount of debt you\u2019re looking at but with interest you my be paying off debt for longer than it would reasonably take to make friends later. I know what I\u2019d choose, but im not an extrovert so the social aspect isnt as critical to me. Facing debt has been a larger burden on my life.",

To attract such students, however, the university builds fancy facilities, which increases their operating costs. So, your statement is probably right, I haven't looked into the numbers that closely, but cutting funding is the root cause of the increase in tuition, even if other factors are responsible as well.",
