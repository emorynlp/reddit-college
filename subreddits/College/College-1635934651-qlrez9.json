  "text": "so i've started college a month ago and i'm majoring business. \ntbh it's not like i dislike this major or anything, in contrast i chose this because it was the least 'bad' major out of all the options i had.\nbut the more lectures i attend the more i realize how much i don't care about them, which leads me to always being bored, unmotivated and tired after every lecture, wondering whether i really should keep pursuing this path.\n\ndespite this all, i don't want to drop out because i'm the kind of person to always finish everything properly and i'd be annoyed to have wasted time and money by just dropping out of nowhere. adding to this i wouldn't even know what to do after that because i actually had no idea what to do after school and decided to choose this major with the reason i mentioned above.\n\nso i wanted to know if anybody also studied something they had no passion for and how it ended for them, whether it's realistically worth to keep going or not",

      "text": "I have never been someone to study, I got mistakenly rejected for my preferred course and ended up doing my current course just because I didnt want to be that person who did nothing, currently im working and im doing quite well I have been promoted 3 times in my first 2 years of my career, I honestly am not exited to be at work but it is what it is, its a job which i do to the best of my ability but am i passionate about my career.. Nope... Is it difficult to study further than my current qualification having no interest or motivation in my field... Yes Lol so yeah, the working field it vast maybe you can still navigate to your field by continuing your current course you will be surprised which is what im trying to do. And the end you have to sit down and decide for yourself but to give you my point of view you will be happy you finished it is de-motivating and to tell you about my friend who successfully changed courses from doing one he didnt enjoy he is also happy. So you just have to sit by yourself and reflect and make a decision from there",
