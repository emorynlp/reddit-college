  "text": "Of the four science classes I could take for my major, chemistry sounds the most interesting but chemistry has a reputation for being hard af. I'm at 11 credits without chemistry, would taking a 15 credit semester with one of the classes being chemistry be literal hell?",

It is interesting but once you go to higher chem, it is hard. If you do like chemistry, then I guess just go with it.",
