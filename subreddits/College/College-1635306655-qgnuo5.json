  "title:": "Did terribly on my lab practical, is it impossible to come back from this?",
  "text": "So as the title says, I just had my lab practical for chemistry today. I am doing well in the lecture, just not in the lab apparently. I have a 74% (but my professor hasn't posted many of our grades) and I believe I got a 20/180 on our lab practical. I have very bad anxiety and I have been going through a lot at home, so by the time I got to the lab to do the practical I forgot everything. I had been practicing, going to review sessions, and honestly trying my best. In the past, I had talked to her about not understanding things, but it doesn't really help me because I am terrible with applying what I know from class (and I'm terrible at math). With that being said, do I just withdraw from the class or is there a chance I can see it through? Thank you in advance for reading this, I appreciate it.",
