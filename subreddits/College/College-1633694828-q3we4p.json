  "text": "So the midterm has 2 hours to complete. 65 multiple choice, six short answer and three essay. Am I insane or does that seem like a lot? I've been lucky up until now and haven't had many midterms, and when I did they were all just x amount of multiple choice questions. \n\n\nDo I just frantically blow through the multiple choice and panic vomit words our with the hour I've got left?\n\n\nEDIT: I took it and it wasn't bad actually. There were only 4 one paragraph questions and the rest were multiple choice/true false/fill in the blank. So the description was not accurate that's for sure.",

You won't be able to get it all done but as long as you answer the question you'll get points.",
