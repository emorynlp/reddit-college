Right now the chances you'll pass aren't looking high, though. Having a talk with your professor about it might be a good idea.",

The max you'll be able to get in the class given the info you told me would be an 87.2% and that's if you get perfect scores on everything else but that still gives you some breathing room. Edit: You should still talk to the professor-- they know their class the best, so they give the best feedback for your concerns.",
