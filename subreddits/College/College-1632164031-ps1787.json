  "text": "First semester last year I did the mistake to just eat processed foods and pasta and not only was I super depressed, I also had no energy. I spent the second semester at home so my parents cooked for me and I didn\u2019t have to deal with this. Now I\u2019m wondering how do I eat food that\u2019s healthy/nutritious enough for school without me spending hours cooking and a lot of money?",
