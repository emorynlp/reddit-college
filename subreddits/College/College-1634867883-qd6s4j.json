  "text": "So, I\u2019m a second-year student, and even though I\u2019m a second year, I still have many questions. Midterm exams were this week, and as always, around this time, topics came up for the exam.\n\nWell, I passed my exam with a 75%, not bad, still passing. The issue is, I\u2019m not too fond of C\u2019s, B\u2019s are ok, but A\u2019s are a must. Overall my GPA is 3.3, and I need help to understanding if my midterm will affect my GPA or will it rise?\n\nMy midterm is worth 100 points, my two quizzes are worth 75 points, and my midterm is 150. On my first quiz, I got a 95%. Do I have any chance to redeem myself? I want to finish this semester with a high B, low A.",

      "text": "So currently you have 146 / 400 total points. In order to get an 'A' (90) for the class you need 360 total points so 214 more points if you get another 95% on your second quiz you'll need 143/150 points on your final or approximately a 95%. That's provided the numbers you have are 100% of your final grade. Not impossible but also not easy. good luck!",
