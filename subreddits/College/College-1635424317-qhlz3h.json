  "text": "I am in a class where every week when the class meets he will make a student go in the front of the class and ask them 10 questions. He says we can say skip to any of the ones we don\u2019t want to answer. But I felt like some of the questions were sort of rude or not appropriate for class? I\u2019ve noticed he will ask the boys normal questions like if they could go to any concert what concert would you go to? Then he will ask the girls questions along the lines of \u201cwould you rather be dumb and pretty or smart and ugly?\u201d Or \u201cwould you rather be ugly and have all the kids you want or pretty and not have any kids?\u201d. And every girl will always choose ugly because of course nobody\u2019s going to tell the whole class they value their appearance more. The class is about dying so the subject matter is I guess sensitive enough already. But is this wrong ? Am I the only one that gets annoyed when the teacher asks that? All the other students seemed to go along with it just fine. But i don\u2019t like it.",

At first the teacher said one kid would go per class but we ended up all going within the span of 3 classes maybe. Each class is like 3 hours. And he would pick a few kids at random each time. It was something we did I guess toward the end of class. He also just said that since he is older he likes learning about \u201ckids these days\u201d. The professor seems like a really nice guy he talks about his kids his family and seems normal. But the questions just seemed a little odd for class. But given the topic of the class maybe there was a reason behind it? Everyone in the class went along with it except for one girl who was older than everyone else. It\u2019s a college class so most kids are about 20.",

Otherwise the chair is the best and fastest option.\n\n\nEdit .\n\nThe best option is actually usually bringing it up to the prof.  Which is what you will be asked when you go to any of the other higher ups.\n\nSo try going to office hours or other private meet and politely mentioning that you feel there is a gender or sex bias.  A good number of times someone is just making a mistake or has a blind spot and they will fix it.  You go via other means when that doesn\u2019t work",
