  "text": "I'm taking a math course this fall and I knew from the first day I would have difficulty learning from this professor. He talks extremely fast when giving example problems and barely gives us even a minute to do a problem ourselves before he shows us the answer. Other students have voiced that they just tune him out when class starts because he gets so confusing. My grade is already starting to slip. What should I do? Should I drop out or keep powering through it?",

I know it's easier said than done but I think you're better off powering through it, because there isn't that much of a chance you'll get a prof that's significantly better in the future.",
