  "text": "Today is the last day to drop classes and I am not doing well in my physics class. I have a 60% and I don\u2019t know what would be better for my situation. If I stay in the class and get an F, I\u2019ll retake the class and it\u2019ll replace my grade but the F will still be on my transcript. Or if I drop it and get a W and retake it but the W will still be there. For background I want to be in the medical field so whatever I decide will affect my opportunities. Pls help",
