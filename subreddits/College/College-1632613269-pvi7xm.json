I would study abroad during my last semester in (possibly) Thailand. Initially, I wanted to go to Japan or South Korea but that would mean missing commencement in May and choosing course issues, which is why Thailand works in my schedule. However, I\u2019ve never thought about going and I don\u2019t know much about the country so that makes me nervous. Getting everything done for studying abroad, while balancing classes and looking for a job has also been difficult. It\u2019s making me consider dropping it and just focusing on my courses and getting a job. I\u2019ve also looked into domestic exchange but most of them would end a few days or weeks past commencement based on where I want to go but it may be possible. If I can\u2019t study abroad/do a domestic exchange I may just travel to some places (Cali, NY) during spring break or after I graduate. Any advice?", "author": "Jaxxhere", "created": 1632613269, "retrieved": 1632945975, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hec56l1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvi7xm/should_i_study_abroad/hec56l1/", "text": "Just go. One of my friends went to Thailand and she loved it! Being in an exchange program is not only for studies but to meet new people, new cultures, and new experiences. It would add a lot for your CV an exchange experience. Also, it will change you as a person and prepare you for the future.  \nI know that it is hard to deal with pre-travel anxiety. I had the same problem. Just live a day at a time and organize your calendar, so you can have everything in order for your exchange ;)  \n\n\nGOOD LUCK", "author": "GiuResta", "created": 1632657782, "upvotes": 2}}}
