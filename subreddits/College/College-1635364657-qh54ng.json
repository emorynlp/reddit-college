  "text": "I\u2019m reaching out in hopes for some advice today. so for context I\u2019m a college junior \nso I do still have 1 college soccer season left next fall 2022 \nwe didn\u2019t make conference playoffs, I have 1 week left this season, 1 week until I know I will be feeling more depressed, contemplating everything, and bored out of my mind \nI will start to overthink everything. Normally in season I\u2019m just focused on soccer and having fun but this season it\u2019s been so frustrating and high stress with stuff on the field and off the field all I keep thinking about is how I don\u2019t have an internship and how I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to get a bad job in life because I have a bunch of diff things I could see myself doing and will never get to truly enjoy stuff and I won\u2019t get a good paying job and I will be a failure. I just feel so lost (and hopeless at times) Any advice is so appreciated!\nThank you",
