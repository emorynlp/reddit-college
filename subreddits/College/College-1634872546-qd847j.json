  "text": "I graduated college back in May. I went to community college for two years because my parents forced me to and my friend and I made this dumb conclusion that since we\u2019d only be there for two years there wasn\u2019t a point in making friends. Then we got to university and there wasn\u2019t a point there either because of being there for two years and when we got to a four year college we realized that everybody had friends from their freshman year because of the dorms and stuff. I had a wild time in college I was really in my eating disorder for most of it so I was pretty isolated. But even in the pandemic everybody has started friends. And I don\u2019t get it. I have bordeleine too so you can probably imagine how every relationship that I\u2019ve had in the past has ended. But I was looking at the people that I went to high school that all graduated this year and they literally have so many friends. Id link it but then it would give away my and their privacy. But like this one guy has a girlfriend his brother has a girlfriend because they\u2019re twins. He\u2019s friends with so many people granted that he was always very charismatic and was even nice to me in high school which said something because everybody else bullied or hated me. But I\u2019ll be driving by work and see people hanging out at cafes and be shopping. I was watching an lsd documentary on Netflix and they were like omg well don\u2019t do lsd if you\u2019re not with friends and I was like so sad that the thought ran through my head if I don\u2019t even have friends to do lsd with. And I\u2019m trying recovery and to not give into my eating disorder but it\u2019s so hard bc I\u2019ve had to resort to bumble BFF. Like how sad is that. I just don\u2019t get how everybody else seems to find friends to live with and rent an apartment and I ended up homeless for a while the past couple months and nobody cared about me. I just don\u2019t get it. And the careers I like like singing and acting are all secretive of how to get in. And I\u2019m so sick of being sad and so sick of hearing about people\u2019s boyfriends and girlfriends when nobody has EVER liked me my whole life and I always end up friendless again. How did people do it through the pandemic? It\u2019s so sad.",
