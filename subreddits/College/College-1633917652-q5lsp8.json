  "title:": "Study Abroad vs. getting a minor",
  "text": "For context, I'm a junior at a U.S. college. I want to get a minor in human-computer interaction, but trying to do so while also wanting to do study abroad next year is just too strenuous on my schedule. I'm afraid that I won't look as good to employers without the minor, but I also don't want to lose a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study abroad. Any insight is greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "That\u2019s a tough one only because there are A LOT of what ifs. From the shared experiences from my peers who did study abroad, some in hindsight regretted it since it was just over glorified classes but in another country and would have preferred to just vacation at said country after they graduated and some loved it/ saw it as an important move because they got the chance to network with A LOT of people in their field. All in all, depending on your major you mileage will vary. Same with the minor, some employers (from my experience working in an engineering/ healthcare industry) don\u2019t care what your minor is in as long as you meet the skills they require for the position and then again some do care and can possibly differentiate you from another candidate if the choice came down to you and someone else getting the job. You would have to see what you can get the most of out if you did study abroad vs the minor for the future.",

Ok, narrow it down. \n\nI\u2019m assuming that since you said human-machine interaction, you want to be in a role where you will be working with embedded and software based roles such as IoT. \n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m assuming that you want to study abroad to get more opportunities/networking as well as find roles that you want to be in. \n\nNarrow down what you\u2019d like to do first - focus more on your technical abilities or your social abilities - which one will get you further and which one will do you more good ?",
