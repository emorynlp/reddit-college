I have an 8-week Spanish online class and I'm in week 4. Every Friday, there's a test that's open till Sunday at 11:59 pm. And it's available to take on McGraw Hill. Except, here's where I screwed up. I followed that pattern all the way and expected the midterm to be on McGraw Hill starting tomorrow. In actuality, it's online from Monday to Wednesday and is actually on Blackboard, not McGraw Hill. And I missed it. \n\nI'm honestly beating myself up right now. Sure, I was absolutely thrown off and I can't tell if my other classmates were also thrown off. But I feel like this is all my fault. I should have looked on Blackboard and not McGraw Hill. The only reason why I missed it is because I was looking in the wrong place and at the wrong time. I've planned everything else in a consistent pattern. So when a wrench is thrown into the machine, it can really scare me and now, I have to live with the consequences.", "author": "Some1inreallife", "created": 1632449860, "retrieved": 1632946109, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"he57c3k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pua8jr/due_to_some_planning_mishap_i_missed_my_spanish/he57c3k/", "text": "I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but you need to get a planner and not rely on consistent patterns of deadlines.
