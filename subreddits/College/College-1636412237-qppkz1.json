It helps the teacher recognise you. \"Oh, this student always shows up on time to the online class\". \n\nJust helps to create a good impression and since professors are lousy with names, profile photos are great. Just don't use one where you're doing something stupid like smoking pot or holding a gun. Yes, really. I had students like that.",
