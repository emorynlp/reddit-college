They tried making the withdraw super complicated probably because they need to keep their students in order to keep running (I\u2019m in a trade school btw). \n\nAnyways I am withdrawing bc the anxiety over school ain\u2019t worth it anymore. I hate it here. They make me choose between my health or my grades. So I chose my health. They can suck my toe that has fungus (also something I\u2019m getting treated lmao).", "author": "Natalator", "created": 1632405851, "retrieved": 1632946178, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdytl1p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptvz21/im_withdrawing_losers/hdytl1p/", "text": "I can understand why you would want to withdraw from that situation. From what I understand trade schools are notorious for situations like this. Unprofessional, for profit, way too stressful of a schedule/ workload. Question for you, do you have a state college in your area that offers a similar program? The state college I go to has an entire campus dedicated to automotive, welding, hvac, IT, and so on. The benefit of going to a state regulated college are\n1. They are not \u201cfor profit\u201d\n2. They are meant for people who work full time jobs so the workload is manageable. (But your mileage may very depending on the institution). \n3. They have a direct path to a job in your career \n4. They are *SO* much cheaper than traditional trade schools \n5. At the end of the program you will qualify for (at a minimum) an associate\u2019s degree. \n6. A friend of mine went through their automotive program and graduated with an associates, the college provided an avenue for him to complete a lot of ASE certifications while still in the program (in fact I believe they were built into the program), and the college provided him with resources to help him build a resume. From what I understand, traditional trade schools certify you and send you on the way. \n7. It is incredibly easy to obtain scholarships, grants, tuition assistance, and so on from a state college. \n\nI hope any of this helps, if you are going to transition from a trade school to a state college don\u2019t think of it as you are starting over, but think of it as having a head start on your peers who will be learning from scratch.", "author": "Erectile_Crocodile", "created": 1632406829, "upvotes": 3}}}
