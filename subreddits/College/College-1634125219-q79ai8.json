Even if you\u2019re not pulling a quote you still need citations - taking someone else\u2019s idea is still plagiarism. Insert the page number where you pulled the idea from, or various page numbers separated by commas. The full citation only appears in the bibliography in MLA format. The bibliography is simply a list of your sources alphabetized by authors last name.\n\n[Here\u2019s a resource that goes into more depth](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html).\n\n\nFor example,\n\nThe ancient world, even before European contact with the Americas, was defined by trade and cross-cultural influence (Smith 15, 14-18).\n\n\nBibliography:\n\nSmith, Bonnie G., et al.
