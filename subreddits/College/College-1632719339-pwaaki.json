  "text": "Hi everyone. I am struggling with figuring out what I want to do for a career. I\u2019m currently a bio major, but I\u2019m very much struggling in prereq classes and now I\u2019m not even sure if I would want to pursue a career in this field. \n\nMy main question is how do you figure out what you want to do (is there something I can do to at least expedite the process?) \n\nThank you in advance for the help:)",

Maybe try taking a placement test, i can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called but it matches your interests to fields you may enjoy working in. Otherwise if you are freshman, just take a variety of classes next semester and see what sparks your interest.",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t figure out what I wanted field I wanted to pursue until junior year. Then in my senior year I decided what career path I wanted. Of course the field I want to work in is not what I was originally majoring in, so that was a waste of four years. Now I am working on my master\u2019s degree for the field I want. What I suggest you do, lest you follow my mistakes, is to research every major your college offers, find one you\u2019re interested in, then look at the possible jobs for that major",
