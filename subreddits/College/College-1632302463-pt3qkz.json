  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m 21, a senior university student in Hospitality Management (graduate in 9 months). Currently, I\u2019m searching and reading about new majors and feeling kinda stressful about it.\n\nHere is my story: I planned to study abroad in Germany (I lived in Vietnam) since I was 16, but it failed due to financial issues. I then applied to Hospitality Management in uni, as I saw the industry opportunities and the possibility of working in a fast-paced environment in any country (I really don\u2019t aim to stay at my home country due to family issues). Most of my subjects are economics-related: kinda theoretical but I\u2019m enthusiastic about working in a hotel after having some parttime jobs and an internship there. My \"safe\" plan (at the bottom of my list) is that I'll apply for a hospitality job and hopefully get a chance to work abroad. Another plan is that I still apply for a hospitality job, but only for up to 5 years. During those years, I have to decide whether I'm suitable for this industry and make changes if needed.\n\nI still aim to study abroad in Germany but turned out I don't have many choices there when it comes to this major (both bachelor and master degree). I then discovered about Sport Science major (it\u2019s like the light at the end of the tunnel for me) and started reading more about it since I\u2019m a sports fan. However, the more I read, the more confusing I am tbh.\n\nFirst of all, it does require lots of science background: chemistry, biology, mathematics, physics and psychology. Except for mathematics, those are the subjects I\u2019ve never been good at since high school. My plan is to spend about 3 to 5 years working in a hotel before studying abroad. Is it possible for me to study all those subjects all over again in 3-5 years? Sport Science major is related to medical at some points and I really want to be realistic that whether I could be able to start from scratch or not since my current major has nothing to do with science?\n\nSecond of all, is Sport Science major requires residency? And have anyone was or are studying this major in Germany? Could you share your experience with me? I\u2019m trying my best to know more about it as my German is very basic and most of the university or Hochschule only provides German information. \n\nI do know that the love for sport shouldn\u2019t be my primary motivation, but it\u2019s very vague for me at this point; not to mention about making the decision to change my career or not; so I would greatly appreciate your advice on my case. Thanks a lot!",
