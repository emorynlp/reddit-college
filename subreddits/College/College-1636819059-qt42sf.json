  "text": "Well guys,\n\nI've just finished writing my thesis. Most of the content of the thesis is basically translation ( Basically translating academic articles and papers, from English to French).\n\nI was so tired and didnt want to make efforts (suffering from severe anxiety and depression). So next thing you know, when ive tried to submit it in to Turnitin the report gave me that i have 1% plagiarized content. I was so surprised because normally all the content is translated, and Software like Turnitin and Urkund is claiming in their \"Marketing stories\" that they can detect translated content.\n\nSo my guess is, those plagiarism software companies are nothing but a fraud regarding detecting translated contents.\n\nWhat are your thoughts guys?\n\nPS: I didnt paraphrase nor change words while translating! I used Deepl, perfect results.",
