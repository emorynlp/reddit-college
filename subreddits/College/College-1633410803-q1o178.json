  "text": "hi hi, I am a undergraduate geology major interested in pursuing research as a career option (but also open to anything tied to environmental science). the options for environmental studies students who want to focus on science are either geology or soil science. I thought geology was the way to go because the env concentration lets me take a wide variety of subjects in science but soil science seems more applied and I can also minor in chemistry if I went that route. \n\nI\u2019m sure these kinds of questions are asked a lot on this subreddit. ty for your time. I just wanted to check with fellow students who know more than me to see if this is the way to go.",
