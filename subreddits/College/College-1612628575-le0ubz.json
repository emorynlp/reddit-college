Properly using any disposable mask is going to make them, at most, a one-day mask.\n\nI leave my dorm EVERY DAY because I have a DAILY meal plan. I can't bulk shop because my plan gives me 2 daily meals/$8 each in specified food (milk, certain frozen meals, etc). Yeah, i can stretch my 2 credits into about 1.5-2 days of food, but I'd be wasting my own money by skipping days of meal credits. There was no option for a non-daily plan.\n\nThat's, minimum, 7 masks a week. I'm in school for approximately 33 weeks. That's MINIMUM 231 KN95s into the garbage for a 5 minute trip where I don't get within 6 feet of more than maybe 2 people, and only for at most 2 minutes. That doesn't include masks that get wet or dirty before the end of the day, or if I toss my mask then realize I have to run to the library to print something, or if I drop my mask on the floor by accident.\n\nCloth masks just get tossed in with my laundry every week. There's virtually no waste until they wear out. The concern with cloth vs KN95 is that KN95 stops 95% of particles at a certain size vs cloth stopping, your number, 50%, but covid isn't generally spread by those tiny particles. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but it's spread via respiratory droplets. Think of when someone sneezes and you see all those specs fly out of their nose and mouth. You can see those. You can't see viruses. A cloth mask stops a significant amount of those droplets, enough to make the mask well enough effective.\n\nEven if my school offered free disposables, I still wouldn't use them. There's no point in generating that much waste when a reusable option exists for only a slight decrease in effectiveness. My school gave us 3 layer cloth masks with a soft inner layer and a tightly woven thick outer layer.

I think that a lot less students would have used the ones provided by the university if they were N95, they would have bought ones that were easier to wear for the full day.\n\nMost of our students don't even use the university ones anymore. They have just bought a pack on Amazon, at Walmart, Old Navy, etc. If you go for value you can a pack of 3-5 cloth ones for under $10 which is approachable for virtually all students. It's been a whole year so at this point it's almost the same thing as being responsible for buying your own clothing.", "author": "br1039", "created": 1612638704, "upvotes": 3}, "gm9bpm4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/le0ubz/is_your_college_giving_out_highquality_masks/gm9bpm4/", "text": "I thought KN95 were not approved by the FDA?", "author": null, "created": 1612638446, "upvotes": 2}, "gm9afx1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/le0ubz/is_your_college_giving_out_highquality_masks/gm9afx1/", "text": "We got one cloth mask.

KN95s aren't really reusable, not if you're using it properly. I think the danger in reuse is that it could be contaminated with the virus which would increase your risk the longer you wear it, hence why you're supposed to wash reusable ones after each use.\n\nPlus, I don't want to take away resources from people who need them. We still have shortages of PPE, that's why KN95s aren't available in stores and that's why the university doesn't distribute them. I go to an **exceptionally** wealthy university. Why the hell should a bunch of rich, privileged 20-somethings have free access to KN95s when there are working class folks in care homes who are going without?
