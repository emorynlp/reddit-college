  "text": "I\u2019m currently a student enrolling in OCC. My first choice of transfer is to Calpoly Pomona (ARCH major), however in case I don\u2019t get accepted, I also have to consider other backup universities. The problem is, some of these universities have different transfer course requirements. Like in Calpoly, you only need MATH A120, whereas others need you to complete MATH A180 (Calculus). Does that mean I have to take additional classes per semester?",
