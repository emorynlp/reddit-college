  "text": "I\u2019m almost done with my first semester of college and I\u2019m just about as burnt out as one can be, I have a great roommate and we get along super well, rarely have any problems, etc. That being said, I\u2019m a very to myself type of person and sometimes I want nothing more to just being in the room by myself in silence, I\u2019m sure it sounds selfish but I don\u2019t have the capacity to talk to people 24/7 and sometimes my sensory overload is exasperated by the smallest things like breathing or typing. I feel bad because my roommate has done nothing wrong, she\u2019s typically in the room a lot and our schedules don\u2019t really line up in a way where I have time to just chill in the room alone. I feel like I\u2019m always at my social limit and always getting roped into plans with friends when ever I do have time to myself or I have to make the sacrifice to do school work while I have the silence because I focus better when no ones talking to me or around me. I feel like I\u2019m being very nitpicky and rude for thinking any of this but I don\u2019t know what else to do, any advice?",

      "text": "One strategy may be to see if you can talk it out and see if you can work out a way to get a bit of time alone in the room. That being said, it's her room too, so she has the same right to the room as you do.\n\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\n\n-Earplugs may help. They can block out those small noises you mentioned so you can work without being overstimulated by small sounds.\n\n\n-Finding a quiet place to study. Usually the campus library has quiet floors, but if that's crowded, you can explore around and see if there are any places without much noise. Sometimes it doesn't even have to be quiet, as long as there's a low chance of people coming to talk to you.",
