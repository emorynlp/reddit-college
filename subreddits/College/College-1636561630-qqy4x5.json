  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m in general chemistry I as my counselors didn\u2019t tell me about the introductory chemistry class that my school offers. I\u2019m now on the cusp of failing and the deadline to withdraw is coming up. But I want to know how bad it\u2019ll look on my record to have two Ws? Would universities not accept me because of it?\n\nAny help or advice is much appreciated",
