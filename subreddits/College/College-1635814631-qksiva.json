  "text": "I'm sure you have studied hard and spent countless hours learning material taught. I have 2 brief questions for you and would love to hear your input: \n\n* What material have you learned in class either through notes or from a professor directly that you could not have just gone to YouTube or a third party to learn? what invaluable material are you being taught that made your tuition price tag justifiable? If this material exists, what college are you attending? (For non imperative degrees such as medical) \n*  Are you going to classes in the hopes that you will get a high ROI on your college investment by landing a good job because of your diploma, or are you going to college because you think those 4 years of material will be utterly beneficial and you don't care about the \"financial incentive\" a diploma will give you. \n\nThanks for your input!",

      "text": "For the first q: your not entirely wrong abt that. Most of the stuff can be easily learned online. The difference lies in the actual teaching part. Some profs actually teach much better than an indian guy on yt (despite current trends). it all depends on the execution of the material. Not the material itself. \n\nSecond q: it\u2019s diff for everyone obv. So I\u2019ll just speak for myself. I chose to study compsci for two reasons: good money, not terribly boring. With a bachelors, you will most likely find jobs with a starting salary from 70k to 100k. If u have a masters it will 99% of the time start at least 100k. Compsci is one of those fields that aren\u2019t too hard or boring that still pays good cash. IMO, the medical field seemed too hard, and law felt boring. To me, compsci is a good balance. So yea, I picked it cuz of the roi but also cuz it\u2019s more fun than most well paying fields.",

          "text": "cool, I appreciate your insight! When i say YouTube, I really just mean 3rd party platforms or personal connections. I'm sure you can find someone that's not the Indian guy on YT to teach material well and even if it is paid, at a extremely low price compared to college. Second: campsci is a cool major, and I actually learn by myself on my own time for SAAS implementations.",

You will also get more opportunities to conduct research, engage with a broader community, compete in academic challenges, etc.  You will learn a much wider and more in depth skill set in essentially any major from a university or CC than youtube.",

      "text": "I mean yes, everything I learn in my major could theoretically be learned from 3rd parties. But here's the hard part.  have no expert to ask questions to or give me feedback on my work to make sure I am understanding it correctly. I also don't have guidance on where to go next or a way to make sure I am learning everything I need to know to understand a topic correctly (I don't know what I don't know), so having an expert guide me through the material and give me feedback and motivation is vital, and also to check me and make sure I am learning the material properly.\n\nI went to college because I knew the kind of job I wanted required a more in depth understanding of a certain field, more than I could ever obtain myself. I know I could get a well-paying job without a college degree, but I know the kind of job I want requires a degree. Yes, this job pays more than similar jobs in the field that don't require degrees, but I don't want those jobs. Money is a factor, as I know a better job means more financial security, but I didn't go to college just to earn more money",

      "text": "For the first question, kudos to you if you can absorb material from those sources, but I personally can't. I need the classroom dynamic (in moderation, combined with other materials) for anything to really \"stick\". Often the internet too can still have mixed input on things depending on the topic, e.g. a lot of history topics are WAY oversimplified online. At least in a classroom I know nothing will be straight up incorrect.\n\nI honestly don't know the exact purpose of my degree yet, guess I haven't gotten that far. Definitely not purely money but its also a good bonus.",
