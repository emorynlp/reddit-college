  "title:": "I can't learn Math",
  "text": "When I started this year I repeatedly told myself I wasnt willing to change my major because of a couple of math classes I was required to take, Those classes being Pre-Calc and Calc 1, but now as im about half way through my precalc class I'm starting to slip. It started a little rough because of the transition from high-school to college but after a 56 on my first exam and a 76 on my second I was starting to believe I was figuring it all out. Now after my third exam over trig (I havnt received my grade yet) and starting analytic trig I feel like I know nothing. My high school math classes were a joke and looking back now didnt enforce much of anything and have made learning at a higher level almost impossible. I go to pre calc 5 days a week for  a total of just shy of 5 hours in class plus my around 15 hours weekly doing homework and studying and I'm getting nothing from it. I'm getting nervous that if I can't learn this information now I surely won't be able to get through calc 1 and meet my degree requirements. I guess what I'm really asking is how do I assure I actually absorb and learn everything when I Just sit in class unable to follow concepts often times confused. Should I just tutor daily and hope for the best? I don't know and am willing to hear any of you out on suggestions that have helped you or others in the past.",

      "text": "I guess it depends on how badly you want a degree in CS. If you really want the degree, I suggest going to tutors daily, reading the textbook over and over and looking for online resources.\n\nBut if you're having that hard of a time with Math, maybe a degree in CS isn't for you. Maybe look into some other technical majors offered at your school like Information Systems or Information Technology and then do a minor in CS. The Math would be easier, and you'd still get to take the core CS classes without the extra stress.",

I started off as a CS major, but Math wasn't exactly my strong suit either. Halfway through precalc I realized that I just simply put wasn't going to be able to get through all of the degree math requirements without sacrificing my mental health and social life, and personally that wasn't something that I was willing to do. \n\nJust as some advice from someone who's been there, if you're really not grasping the material by the end of the semester you should really ask yourself what your career goals are and why you want a CS degree and whether its worth it to continue. The Math you're going to take isn't going to be getting any easier.",

It\u2019s a pain in the ass and I get completely dumbfounded at times.So I\u2019m studying by doing practicing problems for about an hour minimum 4-5 times a week. The textbook is useless. I find videos and seeing direct samples of the problems drawn out are the best ways to learn for me. \n\nYou just have to keep doing the problems until it\u2019s engrained into your brain. I definitely recommend tutoring though, they may help to fill in the gaps left by your professor.\n\nKhan Academy is a great website to use. And I strongly recommend Paul\u2019s Online Math Notes for once you get into Calculus.",

I took it in high school, and I remember it was a jumble of proofs and theorems and substitutions that I've entirely forgotten. Calc I on the other hand is maybe the most useful Math class you will ever take. So my advice would be to stick it through, and see how Calc goes. If Calc is still kicking your butt, then maybe reconsider, but I imagine you'll probably be just fine.",

For programming stuff, linear is a pretty big class when it comes to matrices. Stats class material are also probably going to come up rather than Calc. I could be forgetting some other topics, I\u2019m not a CS major, but that\u2019s my take.",

Kind of like a weed out class while still teaching u basics but on steroids. During my engineering degree calc took out of large chunk of my class and then we barely ever needed to use it again after. \n\nIf you can remember back to algebra classes, they were/are run similar. Lots of complicated factoring or solving/simplifying that you never really use again or can\u2019t just use a calculator for. The point was just to learn it,prove you know how to do it, and move on to bigger and better things. Just get through if you can, and you should be good. Tutoring is a big help if the teaching method of your professor isn\u2019t working for you",
