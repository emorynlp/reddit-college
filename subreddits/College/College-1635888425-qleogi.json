  "title:": "I (F20) stopped for a year in school due to COVID, hoping everything will get back to normal but it didn\u2019t then I came back. Now I\u2019m a freshman in a new college. I\u2019m overwhelmed.",
  "text": "I don\u2019t know anyone of my blockmates and to top it all of they are a year younger. I would have been able to make friends if it was f2f class but it\u2019s not. My course is a challenge also. Plus I already some of the concepts. Btw it\u2019s Accountancy. If you have any tips, that\u2019ll be appreciated.\n\nI also have an evening job in a BPO company. I worked 8 hrs a day 5 times a week. I\u2019m always exhausted everyday. Recently, I just lost drive. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore. Any advice?",
