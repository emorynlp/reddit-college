  "text": "I really want to be a web developer or somewhere along that field, if not a web dev maybe somewhere in cyber security. I feel like it\u2019s my calling and I\u2019ve always been good with computers. But In order to be able to have those careers, they require a CS degree. And computer science requires you to know math. Now the thing is, I am absolutely terrible at math. I\u2019m pretty sure I have dyscalculia too. I never paid attention in school in math class and now I\u2019m stuck in this position. I can do the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication but I can\u2019t do division, factoring, data, etc or anything like that. I\u2019m even terrible with money handling too like giving back change. I always need a calculator by my side.\n\nI\u2019ve tried looking at khan academy but it\u2019s confusing, and i\u2019m not sure where to start. What should I do?",

      "text": "I was in exactly the same boat in pretty much the same degree, but I saw a video of a guy called FryingPan where he said that his mother didn't think he could make it in that career because he sucked at math which even he admitted to, he didn't remember how to divide and that kind of thing, but in the first semester he went to some math courses or something and pulled through his math classes he really is an inspiration [This is the video i'm talking about btw](https://youtu.be/GwT6gGMRr9s) \n\n\nI can tell you I personally took my chances and i'm currently in my first semester, it's tough but by like the third semester the hard math is gone or so I've heard, I would recommend that you take your chances but look for some math classes, I used some from Edex although they are in spanish so I doubt they'd be of much use to you, my advice is that you look especially for calculus classes.\n\n\nGodspeed friend",
