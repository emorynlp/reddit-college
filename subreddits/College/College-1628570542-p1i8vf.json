Depends on the course and teacher. I avoid them as much as I can because I hate them and my students need to be doing other stuff.",

Professors put time and effort into creating good lectures-- it's kind of shitty to show up and then just ignore them. \n\nI think most students haven't stood in front of a class and lectured so they don't realize how rude it comes off as. But I'll be honest-- students texting during class really grinds my gears.

You are correct that students don't have control over exam scheduling, but that is irrelevant.  \n\nStudents have full and complete control over how much they study over the course of the semester, how they endeavor to gain command of the material and whether they put in the work to be able to pass my exams.  As you may have expected, students who decide to start studying in the last week before exams will struggle to pass.  But no student who puts in the effort over the semester would find themselves in that position.",

Then you do not how a professor asks test questions or what sort of reply he is expecting. You don't know if he is testing over material covered in the class or applications of the material.

Could you provide some examples?\n\nI grant you --- fully and without reservation --- that some of my former colleagues had to be handled with care, had idiosyncratic grading styles and some of them were just totally weird.  \n\nBut most of them tried to be fair, were teaching for the right reasons and generally added a lot of value to the university.  Some professors are screwballs, but you just need to not take their classes. \n\nI had some screwball professors as an undergrad and in graduate school, too.
