  "text": "I am struggling with my college essay because I don't understand what the professor wants. I need to analyze the author's techniques (tone, organization, fact, statistic, personal experience, expert testimony, analogy, etc.). The book I am supposed to analyze is informational, so it does not include the literary devices I am used to analyzing such as symbolism, metaphor, and simile. I am confused about how I am supposed to analyze expert testimony in this book.",
