  "text": "i\u2019m currently a freshman and miserable  where i am. i\u2019m 6 hours from home and mid way into the semester with no friends or connections. the girls on campus have been pretty mean and a lot of them have ghosted me or said rude things to my face. the school itself is huge and i am a shy person so it\u2019s been pretty difficult. i\u2019ve been thinking more seriously about transferring next semester to a small school close to my hometown. they have better opportunities for what i want to do and it would be easier to find a job in the area i wish to work after college, but i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m making this decision prematurely. i do not want to regret transferring but not sure if staying would be good for my mental health, any thoughts on what i should do?",

      "text": "Don\u2019t transfer man for the social issues and social life, transfer if it comes down to your major and academics. I would give it another semester. The thing with the big school vs small school is it\u2019s easier to make friends at a big school because you have so many more potential people, the small school is gonna be smaller and have more cliques and since you\u2019d be joining half way through those groups are formed already. My friend goes to a 3k size college and that\u2019s what he\u2019s said, I go to 15k size.",
