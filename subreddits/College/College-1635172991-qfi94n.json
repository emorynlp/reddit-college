  "text": "So I kinda introverted irl and spend 95% of my time alone when I\u2019m not in class or home. This dude at my college recently has been hitting me up and asking if we could get a pizza and hang at his dorm. I have no excuse to say no tbh, I just like being alone in my own space yk. I tell him I\u2019m pretty awkward irl and kinda like being alone. He\u2019s telling me I need to go out and have fun and to atleast consider hanging out w him.\n\nIdk is it rude to say no when I don\u2019t have a legitimate excuse to decline hanging out w him? I done fucked up and told him I\u2019m free on Fridays and weekends",

      "text": "No, but the more you say no the less you'll be asked. At a certain point you'll need to weigh if attending the occasional social function you might feel awkward at and keeping a friend/fostering a potential friendship is more or less important than always having uninterrupted alone time\n\nSo, it's not rude, but at the end of the day there is a bit of social compromise to be made if you want to maintain relationships or form new ones. Just a decision you need to make for yourself",
