  "title:": "What exactly do you do with office hours?",
  "text": "After taking 2020 off, I\u2019m re-entering college and taking some basic classes towards my major. \n\nThe teachers have office hours, but the assignments generally aren\u2019t that difficult, and their open hours are very inconvenient. If I want an appointment I would have to schedule a zoom call, but I don\u2019t see the point.\n\nSome of my peers say they have strong relationships with their professors, but how? I\u2019m always working, so I have little time to talk to do anything else. I just study, finish assignments and prepare for tests. \n\nI have A\u2019s-B\u2019s in all of my classes, so I don\u2019t really know how talking to my teachers would help raise my grades at all. Thoughts?",

Thus is good for letter of recs, maybe they have connections to other schools, companies, etc.\n\nI always went in to office hours to hang out with my professors and this benefitted me for a couple of reasons.\n\nI got grade bumps, grade extensions, and it allowed me an in with the faculty if I ever wanted to join the department.\n\nIt's all networking and relationship building.",
