The issue has been worked out, and they have agreed to grant my degree for the semester I *should\u2019ve* graduated. Thanks, y\u2019all! \n\n\nJust curious if anyone has experienced anything similar, and if so, what was the outcome (though I hope no one else has been here). \n\nSo, I *graduated* in spring. I was accepted to a grad program, moved across the country, and have been taking GRAD classes/working/conducting research all summer. \n\nI received an email this afternoon from my UG uni stating that I could apply for readmission and graduation, if I wanted to graduate in December. \n\nSay what?! \n\nIt turns out, I had an incomplete (thanks to Covid) THAT WAS NEVER CHANGED. Mind you, this was a research course that was an elective (didn\u2019t need it to graduate). The instructor turned in the grade after the deadline. \n\nAgain, say what?!\n\nBefore finding out that a degree wasn\u2019t granted, I contacted the uni asking why I haven\u2019t received my diploma yet. They mentioned they were backordered and I wouldn\u2019t receive until the end of summer. NEVER did anyone mention that I wouldn\u2019t be awarded a degree.  \n\nIt\u2019s likely my grad school won\u2019t mind at all, and I\u2019ll continue on like nothing happened, but my mind is blown right now. And I know the pandemic has really hit academia hard, but shit. Can\u2019t a girl even graduate?! \n\nTL;DR: Found out I didn\u2019t officially graduate undergraduate despite already being in grad school, thanks to UG uni not submitting paperwork.", "author": "PaleoNimbus", "created": 1598576522, "retrieved": 1632802047, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1269, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g365ad8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ihxjz4/so_i_guess_i_didnt_graduate_college/g365ad8/", "text": "I \u201cgraduated,\u201d and walked before my final grades were released, as many grads do. I knew I had passed all my final classes so I wasn\u2019t worried. \n\nMoved out, left for a 3 months summer grad trip. \n\nGet back home to a message from the admin office saying I will not be receiving my diploma because they never received my final grade for my last neuro lab. \n\nI basically asked how that was my problem and that I am aware that I passed and finished the course. \n\nThey told me I had to come to campus and locate the professor and tell them to submit my grade by the end of the week or I won\u2019t get a degree.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?!?\n\nThankfully I only lived ~7 hours away, so I drove there, literally searched the campus. Found a grad student lingering in the lab rooms who I didn\u2019t know. Was able to convince them to somehow locate this professor. Professor wouldn\u2019t see me, but apparently would submit my grade by the end of the day per grad student. \n\nThey did, thankfully. I received my degree and diploma, but I seriously couldn\u2019t fucking believe that shit. \n\nThis was at UC Santa Barbara Btw.
