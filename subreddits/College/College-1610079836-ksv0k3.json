This schedule should also include specific pages, chapters, problems etc. that are going to be assigned throughout the semester\n\n2: Use the free digital trial offered by the textbook (or, if one isn't available, buy it digitally)\n\n(From here on, these are things you *shouldn't* do, because they're absolutely a breach of the terms & conditions and harms the 100% morally-justified-in-holding-students-hostage textbook monopolies. Again, *DON'T* follow these next steps.)\n\n3: With a screenshot software (i *don't* use Greenshot), it's possible (but VERY frowned upon \ud83d\ude21) to take screenshots of each assigned page. To abet these heinous criminal acts, Greenshot also allows users to define a capture region & assign a hotkey to take screenshots of that region with a single button\n\n3a: If specific pages/etc. are not assigned (or if one intends to read through the book), one could hypothetically take screenshots of every page. Since Greenshot labels screenshots sequentially by default, they would remain in their correct order\n\n4: Once done, a criminal could cancel their trial, or return their digitally-purchased textbook prior to the money-back guarantee\n\nI hope this procedure helps at least one person stay within the law & make sure our benevolent academic overlords can continue to reap massive profits on our education \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "author": "Austin1173", "created": 1610129028, "upvotes": 13}, "gikavbv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ksv0k3/okay_im_not_trying_to_complain_but/gikavbv/", "text": "to punish us", "author": null, "created": 1610128602, "upvotes": 2}, "gik96vw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ksv0k3/okay_im_not_trying_to_complain_but/gik96vw/", "text": "So far I\u2019ve been able to find all my books used (my favorite site is AbeBooks) or for sale in PDF form on ebay or similar.
