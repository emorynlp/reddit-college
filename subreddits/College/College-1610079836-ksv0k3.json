That\u2019s 3-4 sales they\u2019re missing out on, so they charge more upfront to get what they believe is the per-person monetary value of the material and research within the book. I am not saying I agree with this practice by ANY means. But the little digital fees and hefty prices are A) the publisher milking the product and B)university probably using the fees to pay for software licensing and upkeep of eshops/portals.",

This schedule should also include specific pages, chapters, problems etc. that are going to be assigned throughout the semester\n\n2: Use the free digital trial offered by the textbook (or, if one isn't available, buy it digitally)\n\n(From here on, these are things you *shouldn't* do, because they're absolutely a breach of the terms & conditions and harms the 100% morally-justified-in-holding-students-hostage textbook monopolies. Again, *DON'T* follow these next steps.)\n\n3: With a screenshot software (i *don't* use Greenshot), it's possible (but VERY frowned upon \ud83d\ude21) to take screenshots of each assigned page. To abet these heinous criminal acts, Greenshot also allows users to define a capture region & assign a hotkey to take screenshots of that region with a single button\n\n3a: If specific pages/etc. are not assigned (or if one intends to read through the book), one could hypothetically take screenshots of every page. Since Greenshot labels screenshots sequentially by default, they would remain in their correct order\n\n4: Once done, a criminal could cancel their trial, or return their digitally-purchased textbook prior to the money-back guarantee\n\nI hope this procedure helps at least one person stay within the law & make sure our benevolent academic overlords can continue to reap massive profits on our education \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

I'll have 4 semesters and 5 classes finished within that subscription period.",

Where you had to do the problems from the book and check odd or even answers in the back of the book. lol\n\nI did have to research whether or not my classes would also be using Cengage, Especially since I was maybe going to take the other classes at a different university. So if my teachers changed services I would have been screwed.\n\nA normal subscription for my school was $120 for just one semester the 2-year was $240, so for 4 semesters, I brought the price down to $60 saving a lot of money.\n\nAlso, it's not like all college students can even pay that much upfront. I was lucky I was at community college at the time so my fasfa refund could spare a little but if I was at the university I wouldn't be able to do that at all",
