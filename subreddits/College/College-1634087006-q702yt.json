  "text": "so I wrote my first in person midterm in over a year last week and felt like I got around high 60s, maybe low 70s, got my grade back today and I got 54%, I'm feeling like an abject failure right now and like I'm just not going to do well in the course at all going forward, how do I stop myself from spiraling and not listen to the urge to drop out right now?",
