  "title:": "If you are a college student who is seriously struggling with the costs of books and class materials, tell your professor.",
  "text": "I'm a professor. If you're a student of mine who is truly struggling under the weight of class books and materials, there is a fund available at our school to help you. But we're not supposed to announce that to our class, or else the small office in charge of those funds will be overwhelmed by rich cheapskates as well as genuinely needy students. Please take the initiative to let me know early in the semester if this is a serious problem for you, and I can refer you to that office. In addition to the special fund, I can also see if the publisher will provide you with a free copy of the textbook, which they've been known to do - particularly if our school is a good customer of theirs. Or I may have an old copy of the textbook that I can lend or possibly even give you. No guarantees that I can help, but it can't hurt to ask.\n\nP.S. I use free open source books and readings instead of expensive textbooks and materials whenever I can. But I don't always design the courses I teach, and sometimes the choice of books and materials is out of my control",

      "text": "Prohibitive costs to access to information is immoral in my opinion - though there are gray areas when lack of funding puts continuation of creation at risk. Ideally it could be perfectly calculated just how much should or could be paid, and by whom to keep production but it's complicated and takes the subtlety of the human brain but superhuman speed, memory and processing to calculate these things very well (AI will get there).\n\nI usually prefer physical books with nice delicious paper. I love that lots of Computing related books are offered online for free. Leave purchasing to the people who can afford the extra luxury of real paper - I just hope it's enough to keep the author going, if not, then next best thing is make it as cheap as possible. I couldn't possibly afford all the books I need in print - but occasionally someone does get my money. If I had to pay, I wouldn't necessarily be able to contribute more - I would just have less. FUCK THAT!!!  \n\nAnyway instead of pirating what I can't afford, I pirate whatever I need, then look at my budget for \"rewarding creators\" (which I am happy to make as generous as I can - I feel really good about paying people for their contributions) and think of what the most efficient/fairest way to distribute the money would be - thinking of human progress and happiness or peacefulness (whatever you wanna call it) as a whole.  If a creator is struggling to keep things running, I certainly feel very compelled to prioritize them. When I cannot contribute/pay them back fairly in $$$, I do the next best thing... I give (what I think is) useful feedback, write reviews in the manner and avenues I imagine would be most helpful to them, recommend them to people who CAN spare the money, etc...\n\nMaybe I'm kidding myself, but when I ~~daydream~~  consider what I would want to do if I ever had lots of money, I see myself rolling around in a mud-mobile around throwing $ at, and thanking, all the people who's work I used or enjoyed for free.",

These sites search the internet to show you the cheapest place to purchase your books.  \n\nSome other recommendations would be to check out books at the libraries. Often they will have copies for students to study with. Also, in many cases, if you search 1 edition back from the edition you are assigned, you can save a TONS. Just make sure that it will work for your class.",

Any chance you know where I can find it for free?\n\nResponse A:\n\n>I don't know, ask your classmates and maybe someone can help.\n\nResponse B:\n\n>Check the library\n\nWhich I proceed to do only to find that all the permanent copies are checked out and all the temporary loan ones are taken almost all the time. Or, the book is too obscure for anything except interlibrary loans which blocks requesting assigned books.\n\nResponse C:\n\n>I'm sorry, I don't know how to help you. Maybe Google around, if not, I would either buy it if you can or consider retaking the class at a later point when you can afford the course material.\n\nEntirely unhelpful for a senior a quarter away from graduation who has never had a quarter where I could afford the books.\n\nDefinitely students should communicate with their professors but it  really often doesn't work unfortunately.",

              "text": "It often feels unnecessary to have to buy a book if there are free alternatives. After all, there's nothing that distinguishes a free book from a book that costs money besides the fact that a free book is most likely an online PDF.\n\nI've only ever needed to buy a book once, but that class taught me that people will not hesitate (and rightfully so) to ask if an older edition is fine. If you're not the author of the book, not a colleague of the author who wrote the book, or you are teaching a course that may not have many books out there that teach the content of that particular book, I wouldn't see the point of making students purchase a book. That's just how I see it, and I'm glad your department does open-source: it really saves both sides money.",

At the very least, I'll have a professor suggest \"Find these books online, but I strongly recommend these,\" and the content taught will not be from the books or anything. Rather, they're supplements to your knowledge in case you're stuck on something.\n\nIn the mathematics department under which most of my classes are, professors will most likely have you use an online textbook written by a colleague or even them. For my calculus classes, it was the free OpenStax textbooks. Perhaps I feel that professors will only make you buy textbooks if their knowledge revolves around the textbook or the subject is best explained by the $20 textbook.",
