If you're a student of mine who is truly struggling under the weight of class books and materials, there is a fund available at our school to help you. But we're not supposed to announce that to our class, or else the small office in charge of those funds will be overwhelmed by rich cheapskates as well as genuinely needy students. Please take the initiative to let me know early in the semester if this is a serious problem for you, and I can refer you to that office. In addition to the special fund, I can also see if the publisher will provide you with a free copy of the textbook, which they've been known to do - particularly if our school is a good customer of theirs. Or I may have an old copy of the textbook that I can lend or possibly even give you. No guarantees that I can help, but it can't hurt to ask.\n\nP.S. I use free open source books and readings instead of expensive textbooks and materials whenever I can. But I don't always design the courses I teach, and sometimes the choice of books and materials is out of my control", "author": "Defiant-Engineer", "created": 1609532352, "retrieved": 1632947124, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1764, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gi73pvg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/koi7z0/if_you_are_a_college_student_who_is_seriously/gi73pvg/", "text": "Prohibitive costs to access to information is immoral in my opinion - though there are gray areas when lack of funding puts continuation of creation at risk. Ideally it could be perfectly calculated just how much should or could be paid, and by whom to keep production but it's complicated and takes the subtlety of the human brain but superhuman speed, memory and processing to calculate these things very well (AI will get there).\n\nI usually prefer physical books with nice delicious paper. I love that lots of Computing related books are offered online for free. Leave purchasing to the people who can afford the extra luxury of real paper - I just hope it's enough to keep the author going, if not, then next best thing is make it as cheap as possible. I couldn't possibly afford all the books I need in print - but occasionally someone does get my money. If I had to pay, I wouldn't necessarily be able to contribute more - I would just have less. FUCK THAT!!!  \n\nAnyway instead of pirating what I can't afford, I pirate whatever I need, then look at my budget for \"rewarding creators\" (which I am happy to make as generous as I can - I feel really good about paying people for their contributions) and think of what the most efficient/fairest way to distribute the money would be - thinking of human progress and happiness or peacefulness (whatever you wanna call it) as a whole.  If a creator is struggling to keep things running, I certainly feel very compelled to prioritize them. When I cannot contribute/pay them back fairly in $$$, I do the next best thing... I give (what I think is) useful feedback, write reviews in the manner and avenues I imagine would be most helpful to them, recommend them to people who CAN spare the money, etc...\n\nMaybe I'm kidding myself, but when I ~~daydream~~  consider what I would want to do if I ever had lots of money, I see myself rolling around in a mud-mobile around throwing $ at, and thanking, all the people who's work I used or enjoyed for free.", "author": "philosopher_nymph", "created": 1609866567, "upvotes": 1}, "gi1a9ni": {"link": "/r/college/comments/koi7z0/if_you_are_a_college_student_who_is_seriously/gi1a9ni/", "text": "I would also check on sites such as [www.PageLess.us](https://www.PageLess.us) to help you find your books for much cheaper than the bookstore.
