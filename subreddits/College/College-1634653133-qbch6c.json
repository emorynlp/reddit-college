      "text": "> Does anyone ever stop and think how academia is turning kids into alcoholics like the culture of college is messing up so many kids?  \n\nI challenge the premise that the colleges themselves are causing this.  \nI'd say the students are doing it to themselves.  \n\n> I find myself thinking about all the pill addicts, alcoholics, smokers who do it just so they can deal with this stress.  \n\nSorry. Find healthier ways to deal with or address stress.  \n\nI think it's reasonable to complain about access to mental health resources from student health services.  \n\nI also think it's a reasonable conversation to ask if a basic, entry-level mental health counselor really needs to have Masters Degree.  \n\nWe have piles of graduates with undergrad Psych degrees who can't find jobs without graduate degrees, and have difficulty financially justifying those higher-educational studies.  \n\nAs we have learned in the medical field with urgent care \"Doc in a Box\" facilities, a whole lot of basic problems can be solved by a Nurse Practitioner instead of an MD or DO doctor.  \n\nIf you need a tumor removed from your brain, you need a highly skilled doctor/surgeon.  \nBut do you really need an advanced physician to look at your crooked finger to say *\"Yep, that's broken. Lets get an x-ray and a splint...\"*  \n\nIf you're wetting the bed, or howling at the moon, or considering self-harm, yeah, you probably need a highly-trained mental health professional.  \n\nBut if you just need a life-coach to help you deal with stress and maybe find better problem solving skills, do you really need someone with $400k of education to provide that assistance?  \n\n\n> I wish it wasn\u2019t that way.  \n\nIt doesn't have to be that way.  \n\n\n> We will never be able to change it\u2026  \n\nNot with that kind of a defeatist attitude we won't.",

          "text": "That was an awesome, thoughtful response.\n\nI personally feel like even using undergrad professionals for mental health/life coaching seems a little outside the realm of the school's responsibility and budget, and that cost will just come back to you in the form of higher fees, so why not pay as you need rather than force everyone to pay. I think schools should have counselors to start the process but if you need more than 2 appointments (1 to discuss changes, 1 to discuss what did and didn't work and make a plan moving forward), probably should go outside the school is my opinion.\n\nOverall I like your positive take though and think that's a great idea for how Psych majors could leverage their degree.",

So I am the girl who gets to see if (beer or seltzer) is for sale at a store on occasion and get paid to try it. But I give a review of the product and see if they card me.\n\nMy college bestie (I am at the age where the college stories and people are fading) was going to bars 13 shots to start out with then add. COVID, was telling me 3 bottles of wine in a sitting. And now she's isn't talking to me as she's abroad trying to go to grad school\n\nI dried out of my alcohol and I wasn't that much of a heavy weight to begin with. But I like trying different types of alcohol. But then I am buying a case of X then a case of Y plus my side jobs (see above).\n\nSo I live in the constant struggle of IDGAF, then I am glad as I see myself abused in college.\n\nUltimately (and I am starting this), getting into pricing analyst and am studying for my CPA license. so its a nice transition that I intend of keeping for as long as I can.",
