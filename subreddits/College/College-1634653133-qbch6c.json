Find healthier ways to deal with or address stress.  \n\nI think it's reasonable to complain about access to mental health resources from student health services.  \n\nI also think it's a reasonable conversation to ask if a basic, entry-level mental health counselor really needs to have Masters Degree.  \n\nWe have piles of graduates with undergrad Psych degrees who can't find jobs without graduate degrees, and have difficulty financially justifying those higher-educational studies.  \n\nAs we have learned in the medical field with urgent care \"Doc in a Box\" facilities, a whole lot of basic problems can be solved by a Nurse Practitioner instead of an MD or DO doctor.  \n\nIf you need a tumor removed from your brain, you need a highly skilled doctor/surgeon.  \nBut do you really need an advanced physician to look at your crooked finger to say *\"Yep, that's broken. Lets get an x-ray and a splint...\"*  \n\nIf you're wetting the bed, or howling at the moon, or considering self-harm, yeah, you probably need a highly-trained mental health professional.  \n\nBut if you just need a life-coach to help you deal with stress and maybe find better problem solving skills, do you really need someone with $400k of education to provide that assistance?  \n\n\n> I wish it wasn\u2019t that way.  \n\nIt doesn't have to be that way.  \n\n\n> We will never be able to change it\u2026  \n\nNot with that kind of a defeatist attitude we won't.",
