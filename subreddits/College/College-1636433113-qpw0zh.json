  "text": "I've never thought about doing this in my life but here it is. I recently switched from a liberal arts major to a physics major in CC, going through the myriad of prerequisites like physics and calculus. And for me, it's taking quite a toll currently. I do understand I'd say 30 to 40 percent of what I've learned so far. I genuinely don't feel prepared enough to advance into Calculus 3 or Physics 2 (my next classes) at my current state. However, I certainly won't give up, as this is what I want to do. I feel that restarting classes, if possible, could be the right thing for me to do. I think it'll be a greater, more comforting way for me to reunite and rebuild familiar concepts I've learned so far. Could this be the right move?",
