  "text": "Hey guys! This semester has been super hard for me, because I\u2019m taking 6 classes and I\u2019m wicked stressed out. My hardest course at the moment is anatomy/physiology and it\u2019s tough as hell. I currently have a C+ in the class and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to get anything higher than a C+. I\u2019ve never gotten a C before on my transcript and I\u2019m really worried about what grad school might think if I withdraw. I currently have two withdrawals already (General education courses, these do not count towards my major) and im thinking about withdrawing from this course. I currently have a 3.7 GPA and hope to attend grad school for psychical therapy. I\u2019m just super anxious because I really do not want to withdraw, I\u2019ve been studying so much with all my courses but this is the only one that has been super hard. I\u2019m okay with taking a C+ but I\u2019m also concerned how it\u2019ll mess around with my current GPA lol. Help I need advice \ud83d\ude2d",
