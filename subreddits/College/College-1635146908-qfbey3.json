  "text": "Do people just put their phones under their pillows and wake up through the vibration, because what if both students in the dorm have different wake-up times. Or does one roommate just wake up and go back to sleep cause it's not a big deal tbh. Lemme know about your experience.",

      "text": "I had a smart watch that woke me up by vibrating on my wrist. Before that, I used my phone and kept the volume low and made sure I woke up on my first alarm. I had a roommate with an earlier class than me that liked to snooze his alarm a couple of times before waking up. That\u2019s very rude, and I don\u2019t recommend it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth having a discussion at the beginning of the year, but the expectation in college and in shared spaces like that is that you guys have different schedules. Just be as respectful as possible.",

Sometimes it wakes them up for a few seconds, sometimes not, but it shouldn\u2019t be a problem as long as you don\u2019t let it keep going for an unreasonable amount of time. Then just get ready quietly.",
