  "title:": "About to fail a class that I don't even need to graduate",
  "text": "I'm taking 13 hours this semester, and one of my classes is a calculus course. However, I've already completed the math requirement for my major--I just took it because I like math. However, at the beginning of the year I experienced a traumatic event and everything has bubbled up since. My mental health has been destroyed and I cannot do my schoolwork, especially for a class that is so difficult. I don't know what to do. I had a 4.0 at a different university last year, so I have proof that I am a good student. However this semester I cannot cope with my mental health issues. The drop period has passed and I'm not sure I'll be able to Pass/Fail the course since I'm a transfer student and do not have 30+ hours of credit at this university. I might be able to Q-drop the course, but I'm not sure. What do I do? Academics have always been so important to me, but I am so depressed that I don't even care about it at this point. I want to keep myself from doing more damage and get my mental health in check. Please leave constructive suggestions.",

A similar thing happened to a friend of mine and she ended up just having to take a break from classes.\n\nProfessors are humans, not heartless robots. They know shit happens and if they are good professors they want to see you succeed and will help you.",

      "text": "You are taking 13 credits I assume? So if you withdraw you\u2019ll only have 10 credits which makes you a half-time students, if you are on financial aid it will be a tricky situation. If the grade is still salvageable I\u2019d recommend you to do that, at least get a C. As much as I hate to say this, rules are rules, professor are humans but they are not there to piggyback you.",
