  "text": "Hey guys! I got an associate degree in winter 2019. I then took a year off and started a year ago part time. This semester I am fishing my sophomore year. (I changed majors that\u2019s why I needed more credits than had I not). Anyways, I take 4 courses and I feel if I am not sleeping, or doing housework, etc, I am working on assignments. I do care about my grade. I have finally made a few friends. I don\u2019t know how they are managing 5 courses & a part time job, while what appears like doing almost no work! My friend does her work for the week all in one day. I have spent hours on assignments before in order to get an A. She says she has all A\u2019s. Do I work to slow? Am I doing more than expected of me? I follow the prompts! Then, I have a good friend who has studied 20 hours in a week. That will never be me. I haven\u2019t found someone out their working hard daily, but not working themselves to death. From the outside, it looks like most people are doing a lot less than I and doing fine. I\u2019m jealous! What am I doing so wrong? I\u2019m tired and I want their possible secret.",

      "text": "Are these people in the same major as you? If not, then you might just be in a harder major. It's also possible that they went to better high schools and had better profs for their first year classes and so now they pick up on new things quicker because of a stronger background.\n\nAs an aside, though, I've got to be honest that I'm not sure whether you're implying that 20 hours a week is a \"lot\" or a \"little\" because that sounds about \"normal\" to me for an undergrad. For reference, full time school is designed to be roughly the equivalent of a full time job, which is 35-40 hours a week. A \"typical\" full time course-load is about 15 hours, so that's 20-25 hours outside of class that schools expect students to spend studying and working on assignments. \n\nIt's totally normal to need more than this if you have a \"hard\" major and/or packed schedule or to need less than this of you have an \"easy\" major and/or not much on your schedule but 20 hours per week of work outside of class is definitely in the ballpark range of what full time students should expect.",

          "text": "20 hours is definitely a lot for me, and those I speak to on campus! I probably spend 8-10 hours a week on assignments, which is far more than others I know. But, I know they\u2019re out there, lol! Maybe it\u2019s just my college, lol! I don\u2019t study unless I have an exam. I was never taught an effective way in high school so I\u2019ve been thinking about attending some work shops! Maybe that will fill in the gap. I have only met my one friend who studies for 20 hours a week, and she does excel and retain the information far more than anyone else I know. (We are different majors - she\u2019s just incredible!) Anyways, your comment does make me feel better and worse LOL. I am glad to know that I am doing quality work, but I can\u2019t imagine doubling what I\u2019m already doing. Sigh.

              "text": "Don't worry about it too much-- in my experience, most undergrads at the sophomore level think that 20 hours a week is a lot. I probably did, too, but now that I'm a grad student in a STEM field I *wish* I could go back to the days when 20 hours a week outside of class seemed like a lot, lol. \n\nPart of it, I think, is that with age and experience comes two things 1) better focus-- I remember reading somewhere that while most cognitive functions peak between about the ages 15-25, the ability to focus peaks in your mid-40s, so that will continue to get better for a while, and 2) you learn how to use time more efficiently. As you get more experienced at being a student, you learn to get more \"bang for our buck\" in the time that is spent studying and doing work. That's more just something that takes first learning the skills to make the time you spend working more efficient, and then practicing them. \n\nMost students come into college without these skills, because, as you said, \n\n>  I was never taught an effective way in high school\n\nThat's you and about 90% of other students, so you're all in the same boat. Like everything else in adulthood, it's kind of hard and scary at first, but once you get used to it becomes a lot less hard and scary, lol.",

You probably misunderstood what someone told you and thought they meant per class. A 3 credit course is 3 credit hours, so that means they expect 6 hours of work outside of class for that one 3 credit class, or 30 hours of work for 15 credits. I was actually being generous by saying it should be 20-25 hours a week (but I'd still say that in practice that's often about what I'd expect, especially for sophomore level courses rather than upper level courses).\n\nIf schools can't demonstrate that this is their standard, then they (theoretically) could lose accreditation, and having a degree from a non-accredited school is basically the equivalent of not having a degree.",
