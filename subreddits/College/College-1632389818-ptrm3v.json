I just started my 2nd year and majoring in business in an all online program. I have hated it from the start, I don\u2019t have a passion for business and couldn\u2019t care less about it. I never enjoyed school as a high schooler either and only went into college because it was something that was expected of me. I\u2019m not learning anything because it\u2019s all online and because it\u2019s honestly so boring and unenjoyable. I know how privileged I am to be going to college for free but I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep going on with my degree like this. I\u2019ve thought about changing my major but none of them seem interesting to me. \nIf anyone has any advice or think dropping out is worth it, please let me know.", "author": "okay230740", "created": 1632389818, "retrieved": 1632800804, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdy4w8n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptrm3v/to_drop_out_or_not/hdy4w8n/", "text": "Have you tried taking any other classes non business related? Yeah every other option may seem boring, but you never know until you try something. I understand your viewpoint of e-learning, it really sucks. Do you have a college advisor? You could talk to them about maybe doing an undecided major for now? \n\nI don\u2019t encourage you to drop out yet, at least make an effort to find something else just in case you regret it down the road. :)", "author": "epiclyfe", "created": 1632392841, "upvotes": 4}}}
