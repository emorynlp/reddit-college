  "text": "Hey all! Education journalist here. I\u2019m curious how now-college freshmen feel about virtual college tours/experiences. (They seem to really range in scope and quality, from short pre-recorded YouTube videos to interactive websites to live virtual tours you sign up for).\n\nWhat I want to know:\n\n1. Did any of those offerings *actually* meet your needs when you were a prospective student?\n2. What platforms/ models did you find the most useful?\n3. What aspects were missing that would have been helpful to you \u2014 that you wish had been incorporated?\n\nI'd especially love to hear from first-generation students, students of color, and those who \u2014 for financial, health, or other reasons \u2014 were not in a position to travel last year.\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",
