  "text": "Hey, so I\u2019m sort of stressed. I\u2019m a freshman in College and have no real motivation to do my schooling because I have no real idea what I want to do, major and career wise. I love the outdoors and nature and everything, so I\u2019ve considered Plant Biology but hate biology, and most stem stuff. agricultural stuff seems cool but also all the majors seem unappealing. Any suggestions on what to look into",
