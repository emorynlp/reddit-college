  "text": "I\u2019m not even a science major. I\u2019m a public relations major but I am taking a biology class in order to fill the science requirement. \n\nThis class is stressing me out so much. I\u2019m crying after class over my grades. I fucking hate this. \nIt\u2019s so hard for a gen Ed class\n\nI\u2019m so frustrated and tired. I want to withdraw from this class and try again next year. My mom says there\u2019s no point in doing that because I will just have to take it again. But I\u2019m just so stressed. There HAS to be an easier way to fill this requirement? \n\nAnyone else relate? I just want to drop this class, but I know that I will have to just take it again. \n\nSo here I am, ugly crying in my car \ud83d\ude2d",

At another school near here it\u2019s Geology (\u201cRocks for Jocks\u201d). Ask around to some upperclassmen in non science majors, find out what the slide science is. Take that one.",
