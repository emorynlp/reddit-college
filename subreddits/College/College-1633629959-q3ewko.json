  "text": "\n\nHi everyone, my parents really want me to go to college  and said they will pay all expenses if I go but I don\u2019t think I want to. I want to do an electrical apprenticeship but understand what a great opportunity a degree is and don\u2019t want to regret not doing it. I was just wondering if you think university is a good choice that will result in higher paying/better jobs. Realistically I would do construction management or commerce.",

      "text": "Honestly college is only useful to you if you have a specific goal in mind and want to be there. It sounds like you have another plan and many trades will actually pay more than a job that requires a college degree. College is fun and exciting, but not if you\u2019re mentally not ready for it or willing. College isn\u2019t going anywhere. Why not try the trade apprenticeship and see where it takes you? Then if you don\u2019t like it go to college after.",

      "text": "Consider doing it, at least. A degree would get you much further and since you're considering management, it seems like a perfect opportunity. Don't force yourself, but weigh out your options and do more research to find out if it's really for you and if you'd be able to manage it. Also research how far you can get in those fields with and without a degree, - that could definitely be a motivator.",
