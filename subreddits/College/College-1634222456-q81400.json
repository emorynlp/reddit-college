  "text": "Do you think I should take a gap year? I have never been on my college campus, yet I would really love to experience the campus life at least one time. The other problem, though is that after this academic year, it will be my last year of my undergrad. So, if I don't take f2f courses next year,  I won't have the opportunity to again unless I went for a masters(currently dual majoring in math and computer science). What do you think I should do? Should I take a gap year and wait for the chance to attend f2f or should I just finish the degree?",
