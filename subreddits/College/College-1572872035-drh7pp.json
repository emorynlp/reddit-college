The drive is 1.5 hours. I knew the directions and all and reach the bus stop on time. The uni is like 20 min walk from the bus stop and oh fucking well I lost my way. It took me like 40 minutes to find my university. First period was 1.5 hours so I had to walk around for 1 hour. Holy shit this was the worst experience ever. Freshers arent allowed inside library so library was not an option. It was hot today and my bags were heavy. I just roamed around uni for an hour and attended the next class. How to pass your time in situations like this?\n\nEdit: So seems like there are few confusions here. \n1. When I said freshers I didnt really mean like for a whole year. We arent allowed to enter the library without student IDs. So yeah I couldn't enter. We will probably get them in a week or so. \n2. Period = class. I'm not a native speaker so please understand. We call them periods here idk. \n3. What kind of classes start in November? In Nepal apparently. Nepal has different dates than other countries. Its 2076 (year) in nepal lol. \n\nI didnt really think this post would get noticed. So didnt really put much effort.
