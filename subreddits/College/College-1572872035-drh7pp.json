  "title:": "So today was the first day of college and I missed my first period.",
  "text": "So I commute to my uni. The drive is 1.5 hours. I knew the directions and all and reach the bus stop on time. The uni is like 20 min walk from the bus stop and oh fucking well I lost my way. It took me like 40 minutes to find my university. First period was 1.5 hours so I had to walk around for 1 hour. Holy shit this was the worst experience ever. Freshers arent allowed inside library so library was not an option. It was hot today and my bags were heavy. I just roamed around uni for an hour and attended the next class. How to pass your time in situations like this?\n\nEdit: So seems like there are few confusions here. \n1. When I said freshers I didnt really mean like for a whole year. We arent allowed to enter the library without student IDs. So yeah I couldn't enter. We will probably get them in a week or so. \n2. Period = class. I'm not a native speaker so please understand. We call them periods here idk. \n3. What kind of classes start in November? In Nepal apparently. Nepal has different dates than other countries. Its 2076 (year) in nepal lol. \n\nI didnt really think this post would get noticed. So didnt really put much effort. So kindly understand.",

Sometimes, starting out can be stressful, don't let it beat you up. Also, to pass the time, maybe find some shade or something and do some light studying for that class. Maybe you can impress your professor by knowing some early material.",

              "text": "So I know culturally Nepal is very different from the West, and you also mentioned individual components that played a role here, but I highly recommend going into the class (if they let you enter) regardless of what others may think/do. After the class is over, simply give your apologies to the professor and explain what happened. Who knows, maybe they can help you in some way, but you won't know unless you go up and talk to your professor regardless of how difficult it is. And I'm speaking from personal experience here. These interactions get a bit easier once you start doing them, but you have to start somewhere. \n\n And yeah, you may look a little disorganized coming in late and ppl could stare at you, but the impression of completely missing your first day of class when you were on campus is also not that great. Especially if you leave it unaddressed. Also, now you'll need to talk to the professor, or someone else in the class, to figure out what you missed. \n\nSo honestly my recommendation for if you are late again is simply to go to class. Someone is paying for that class (you, your parents, through taxes), so it's best to not waste that money that is being spent on you to get an education. \n\nPlus, college is a place where you learn more about yourself and what you can do because you have to struggle. Because you get put through incredibly taxing situations where you have to manage your time and overcome certain aspects of yourself. This is your first experience with that, and I recommend taking it by the horns and dealing with it before it actually becomes a bigger issue. \n\nBest of luck!",

The same is not true of the other words you're trying to verb. No one uses them that way. I could have linked you to the numerous dictionary entries describing \"adult\"'s usage as a verb, but I'm not trying to feed into the popular perception that dictionaries are the source of Truth, and that something not being there is an indication of anything. Hell, if you hate things being verbed so much, does this mean when your little sister (or brother, classmate, whatever) elbowed you as a kid, you'd whine \"Mommy, she hit me with her elbow\"?",
