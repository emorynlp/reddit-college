You\u2019re about to embark on what is likely the biggest transition of your life so far. Even though there\u2019s a lot to be excited about, it\u2019s perfectly understandable to feel sad about moving away.\n\nThe good news is you\u2019re not alone; whether they live a mile down the road or on the other side of the globe, every residential student is in the same boat. They\u2019re momentarily parting ways with their family to pursue higher education. Even if they don\u2019t show it, there\u2019s a fair chance that everyone around you is feeling just as overwhelmed as you are.\n\nEvery school differs, but speaking from my own experience, we had an orientation period that lasted a couple of days. It was mostly just freshmen on campus, and we spent our time divided into groups, going on tours, doing ice breakers, having class-wide events, etc. It was a nice way to ease into the situation and get to know a few people before classes started up. I even wound up meeting someone who is still a close friend of mine to this day!\n\nAlthough your school will do a lot to help you make a well-rounded adjustment, part of it lies on you. You\u2019ll have to be proactive. Between orientation and club fairs, your school will likely offer a lot of events specifically aimed at first year students to encourage socialization. It\u2019s up to you to put yourself out there and attend these events. \n\nThe opportunities for acclimation don\u2019t stop after the orientation period ends, either. Even once the grind of classes start, there\u2019s always the opportunity to meet new people. Make small talk with your classmates before and after class. Introduce yourself to your professor if they seem approachable. Not only will this help them put a name to a face, but it\u2019s also beneficial to network with people in your desired field.\n\nAnd of course, even though you\u2019re going away for awhile, remember your roots. Keep in touch with your loved ones back home. Tell them about *everything*\u2014the people you\u2019ve met, interesting bits of information you learned in class, your assignments, your upcoming plans, what you had to eat that day, etc. etc. Trust me, they\u2019ll love to hear even the most minor details of your day. \n\nIt might take you a few days, weeks, or months\u2014not everyone adjusts at the same rate, and that\u2019s perfectly fine\u2014but gradually, you\u2019ll find your rhythm.\n\nIt may seem daunting, but it\u2019s doable.
