I haven\u2019t been able to make any long term friends or connections at my college, and feel a general disconnect with my college. I feel like it\u2019s too late for me to transfer, but I don\u2019t want to force myself to finish a journey I haven\u2019t enjoyed at all. Yes I know I\u2019m lucky for getting into the school I did and I am already half way done, but I feel stuck in this on going cycle of being unhappy with my situation and being unable to diverge from my current path as I am afraid of regret if my choices in the future.\n\n~Thanks for reading~", "author": "CrispyMulch", "created": 1632158567, "retrieved": 1632946726, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdnwc0o": {"link": "/r/college/comments/przfgh/im_a_junior_who_dislikes_their_college/hdnwc0o/", "text": "Junior here too in a similar position!
