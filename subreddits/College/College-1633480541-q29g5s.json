  "text": "It\u2019s always the same email looking for a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d. Every one has the exact same message (with the same misspellings), except they\u2019re all from different fake emails with different fake names. \n\nI have email notifications turned on so I don\u2019t miss anything important, and these spam emails are driving me nuts. Does anyone else have this same problem? Or does my university just suck at filtering spam?",
