  "text": "So I'm 17 and applying to college this year and the country I'm currently situated in doesn't offer schools specifically for animation, the closest there is to it is computer science which offers multimedia. I was planning on majoring in that but I was wondering if it was possible to get jobs as an animator, or how likely it is to be hired by a studio for anything to do with the actual art aspect of animation with a computer science degree?",

      "text": "In animation, employers don\u2019t really care about what type of degree you have. They care more about your portfolio and knowledge of different art/animation programs. So that\u2019s what you really want to focus on.\n\nA CS degree would be good to get. Worst case scenario a career in animation didn\u2019t work out, a BS in CS is versatile so you could use it anywhere. Aside from that, you could always major in CS and minor in an art to still do something related to the artistic component of animation.",
