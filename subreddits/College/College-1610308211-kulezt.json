It was shit when I moved in.  Blown bulbs and old crappy dim CFLs, paint falling off the walls, shitty blinds on the windows, mold in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom, place hadn't had a deep clean in a long time, tub was cracking, sink was leaking, and many other little things like rusty rails and doorknobs and stuff.\n\nWhile I was living there for college, I was fortunate enough to have been working and I was financially stable.  I was also happy to have a hobby of fixing the place up in my free time because I didn't go to parties or anything.  My roommates didn't complain at all.\n\nSo, I started with the little things.  Bought some brighter and lower-power LED bulbs to replace every bulb in and around the condo, even the ones outside.  The place immediately felt way less dangerous at night with the new porch lights.  I then deep-cleaned EVERYTHING.  I went room to room starting with my bedroom.  I cleaned the walls (which I thought were beige...  They were white underneath.  Fucking EW YUCK GROSS.) and the crappy tile floor, taking special care in cleaning the ceiling as it was brittle plaster of paris.  Then I went to the kitchen, then the bathroom, then the living room.  My roommates' bedrooms were up to them to clean (which they did not).  Walls and floors and ceilings cleaned, behind and under and inside the fridge and behind and under the stove, cleaned the oven, literally threw out the fucking microwave and installed a new one (over-range microwave, which I was surprised the place had, but it was shitty and didn't work right, so I invested the $60 into a newer nicer one from eBay).  I spackled and repainted holes and chipped paint on the walls (luckily the walls were just plain white so color-matching was super easy and all I had to do was carefully blend the repairs into the existing paint).\n\nI cleaned the shower drain.  Like, REALLY cleaned it. That smelled bad and was slimy and horrible but I was happy that it was clean after. Used bathroom caulk (I forget exactly what stuff I used but it worked like a charm) to fix the cracks in the fiberglass tub.  I managed to match the color of the tub pretty well with the caulk but the tub was more or less a lost cause and had to be replaced (which I did not do lol).  The tub was leaking into the floor below, so luckily I solved that problem with the caulk.  The landlord refused to fix the problem himself.  I replaced the faucet in the bathroom sink.  It cost me about $50 I believe, again from eBay nice and cheap, and worked flawlessly after installing it.  Way better than what was rusting away there before.  Final step was de-molding the walls and installing an better exhaust fan.  The ducts were totally clogged so I concocted a wire brush cleaner thing out of some wire hangers and a toilet cleaner, and unclogged the blockage (it was a bunch of lint and dust and shit).  Yes, I wore a respirator and gloves and the whole nine yards to be safe.  Installed a cheap new exhaust fan, sanitized the whole bathroom at the end, and voila, a mold-free bathroom for years to come (hopefully).  At least, it was mold-free from then until we moved out.\n\nLast major thing I did was replace the fridge.  This was a big one and I asked the roommates to pitch in.  We bought a decent stainless steel Samsung fridge to match the stainless steel microwave.  It came out to $200 from Facebook Marketplace.  Not half bad!  Old fridge got us about $40 in scrap money, too, which went into the new one.  The reasons hat we replaced the fridge was because it was extremely noisy, sometimes didn't work at all and tripped the circuit breaker often.  (I isolated it to being the fridge by freezing a bunch of ice packs and using that to keep the food cold in the fridge for two days leaving it unplugged.  Breaker never tripped.  Plugged it in, two hours later the breaker tripped.)\n\nAnyway, the end result after about a month and a half of renovations thanks to me being way too ambitious for my own good ended up scoring us nothing other than a nicer living space than the other apartments around us.  Landlord didn't give two shits about my improvements, and while I was glad he didn't reprimand us for not asking permission first, I was also mildly upset at how indifferent he was when I had him take a look at our renovations.  He had a huge \"whatever\" mood about him.\n\nI was planning on living there again but COVID struck and my learning went remote, so it wasn't worth it to keep paying for a condo instead of living with my parents for free and with better perks like gigabit internet and free food etc.  But hey, the next folks will enjoy a very (relatively speaking) nice condo.  Our quality of life while living there was far better because of what we did and it took a lot of stress out of school.  Made us actually happy to come home to our condo after class because it was a comfortable, well-lit, clean living space.\n\nMoral of the story is that if you put in the effort to learn and act on having a nice living space, it is totally attainable.  It's not as easy when you don't have a source of income that's enough to both pay rent and pay for cleaning supplies (the new hardware was bonus in my eyes, wasn't *needed* but was definitely a quality of life improvement) but it's definitely worth it to put in the effort to at least clean the place top to bottom and keep it clean.  It may be a polished turd, but it's better than a shit-looking turd, I guess.", "author": "Nibroc99", "created": 1610343115, "upvotes": 9}, "giuc81f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kulezt/what_is_up_with_all_these_absolute_garbage/giuc81f/", "text": "Maybe the owners feared that if they renovated them, they'd be accused of gentrification.", "author": "Severedheads", "created": 1610340445, "upvotes": 1}, "giub1wg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kulezt/what_is_up_with_all_these_absolute_garbage/giub1wg/", "text": "It\u2019s almost like apartments being rented to 20 yr olds aren\u2019t well maintained", "author": "SpicyMargarita143", "created": 1610339794, "upvotes": 5}, "giuayw7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kulezt/what_is_up_with_all_these_absolute_garbage/giuayw7/", "text": "I thankfully never had to live in those dungeon prisons.
