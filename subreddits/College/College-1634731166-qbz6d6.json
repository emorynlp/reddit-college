  "text": "In one of my online classes, a professor quizzes us regularly, but, the way the quiz is formatted legit sucks.\nYou have 10 minutes for 10 questions, which isn\u2019t horrible, but once you submit an answer to a question, you\u2019re unable to return to it. Every single quiz so far, I\u2019ve had at least 1 question I remember the answer to after submitting the question, or I had clicked the wrong thing by accident. I swear, I know I\u2019m not the best student in that class, but the fact I haven\u2019t passed a single one (and that the class average on these are ~65%) should mean something, right?\nI just want y'all opinion on this format. Is it just, and I\u2019m just butt-hurt, or is it actually designed in a very poor way?",

      "text": "It's lazy. Hard assessment should come from the difficulty of the questions themselves and rigorous grading. You're from Canada, so don't you have to pay a lot for your schooling? As a paying customer, take it up with the head of your school that this is a problem. My school is a fraction of the cost of yours and with COVID being over, we're all back to in-person, non-multiple choice assessment. So this \"it's too time-consuming\" excuse is bullshit, it's your school's fault for not putting enough emphasis on assessment quality. If you don't want your GPA to be meaningless and to not have a proper idea of your understanding of the material (which comes from good quality assessment evaluating that), then take it up as an issue of institutional prestige.\n\nIf you don't get your way, try to publicise the issue to employers, other schools and news outlets. They would want to know exactly what a GPA from your school really means in terms of conceptual understanding, engagement and passion for the material.",

The lesson I think should be taken away from it is that this is only a challenge. That's it. \n\nThe challenge is clear; you can't go back to questions. This should only really change your strategy for these quizzes. Going to the professor isn't a strategy. \n\nI think that this is a concept that is missed in college when encountering challenging moments like this. To succeed in college is to adapt accordingly and constantly improve. If a test method doesn't suit you, it's not the tests fault. \n\nMy opinion that these sorts of challenges are valuable. To succeed in these sorts of things is to show that you're flexible. We can take these challenges one of two ways, either 'It's the quiz format that's doing me wrong' or 'I need to change my study habits to succeed at these quizzes'.",
