      "text": "If you don't know the answer within 15 seconds skip the question as a later question might give you a hint. Cross out choices that are obviously wrong to narrow your choices down. If you've never heard of something then more than likely it was made up. Be careful going back through questions as you might change a right answer.",

      "text": "For me the biggest help is simulating test taking conditions as much as possible. If your prof releases past exams or even just puts out review problem sets I would try to do them in a quiet area under timed conditions. It can also help to try and come up with possible questions they may ask based on areas of common confusion. Even if they don\u2019t ask any of the questions you might\u2019ve anticipated you\u2019ll still have a deeper understanding of material that\u2019ll serve you well. Sometimes it helps to get a small group of a couple people to quiz each other so you can reveal your content weaknesses as well. Over time you\u2019ll figure out which method yields the best results for you. For now try out what I said and ask your prof what their recommendations are.",
