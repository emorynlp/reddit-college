      "text": "If you don't know the answer within 15 seconds skip the question as a later question might give you a hint. Cross out choices that are obviously wrong to narrow your choices down. If you've never heard of something then more than likely it was made up. Be careful going back through questions as you might change a right answer.",

      "text": "For me the biggest help is simulating test taking conditions as much as possible. If your prof releases past exams or even just puts out review problem sets I would try to do them in a quiet area under timed conditions. It can also help to try and come up with possible questions they may ask based on areas of common confusion. Even if they don\u2019t ask any of the questions you might\u2019ve anticipated you\u2019ll still have a deeper understanding of material that\u2019ll serve you well. Sometimes it helps to get a small group of a couple people to quiz each other so you can reveal your content weaknesses as well. Over time you\u2019ll figure out which method yields the best results for you. For now try out what I said and ask your prof what their recommendations are.",

Some of the highest scorers are ones familiar with the language format of the questions. You have to take tests to be good at taking tests if that makes sense. Then see if there is an answer key or ask your professor if they wouldn\u2019t mind grading it to help you study",

It really helps me to remember most of the lessons. And also it will  be more easier to review, because you are really not reviewing, you are just simply recapping the lessons which I found less hassle and not a time eater",
