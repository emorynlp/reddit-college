  "text": "So i have a presentation this Tuesday. English is not my first language but all my classes are in English and we have to speak English during presentation. I don\u2019t have any problem with speaking English but i have social anxiety and I\u2019m thinking about taking few shots of vodka or tequila before going to school. Has anyone ever tried this before or is it just a myth?",

      "text": "It depends on how your body and personality interact with alcohol. If you react negatively during your presentation, slurred speech, unfocused, and struggling to recall information/make decent points about the material, that is going to show. This, compounded with the fact that English is not your first language, I think you are better off appearing nervous than risking appearing drunk or out of it during your presentation.\n\nGo slowly. You\u2019ll be fine.",

Just so you know, more and more research is showing that the social effects of alcohol (ie. increased confidence) is a psychological (or placebo) effect. Good luck, and you'll do fine without the alcohol.",

Drinking before presentations, will slowly slowly start getting you addicted and you'll end up becoming fully dependent off of alc, and you'll fuck your liver, kidneys up. \n\nsame went with avicii, dude had anxiety before performing he kept taking shots, drinking more and it became a permanent thing he couldn't go without drinking before going out. Eventually he fucked his organs up, and later commited suicide.\n\nThis question is dumb af btw man, this is just plainly stupid to even think of wtf.\n\nIf you also get a bit drunk, and go around your class you could get arrested for public intoxication. So don't do dumbshit like this, and OP why are you even like wanting to do this? tf.",

I find shots are super weird that way where there's a big delay between taking them and actually feeling them. if anything I would say have a beer since it's carbonated and seems to get that happy lil buzz going faster. but yeah IDK as someone who has relied on alcohol to have confidence in social situations, it's just so much better if you can find your own confidence in yourself than relying on alcohol. it's not a good way to live.",
