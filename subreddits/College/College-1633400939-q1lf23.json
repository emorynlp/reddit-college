  "title:": "Can professors tell you to be in class 10 minutes before class starts or they will take 1% off each time?",
  "text": "My education courses are requiring us to be in the class room by 7:50 or it\u2019s 1% off your grade each time you are late. The class is scheduled for 8:00-10:45. I have been getting there around 7:53 everyday. I just got an email from one of the professors reminding me to be in class by 7:50 and to adjust my morning routine to make that happen. Are professors allowed to do this? They don\u2019t even start class till 8, I drive 25 minutes just to sit there for 10 minutes and do nothing. They say it is to prepare us to be early for jobs, but the syllabus says they will take off 1% each time.",

I will make an effort to be there earlier but it\u2019s just ridiculous to force students to be there outside of class time and penalize for being late.. before class even starts",

It\u2019s definitely wrong for them to do that, but if the professor is in your major and you\u2019ll have them again, it might be worth it just to stick it out for a semester. Not the answer you want to hear, but just be sure you pick your battles.",

He just wants to be a hardass because he thinks that makes him a good teacher. \n\nTalk to the department chair instead. The chair will then go to the prof and say \u201cI have had complaints about making students show up 10 mins early to your class, knock it off\u201d and won\u2019t mention your name. This gets the issue resolved without putting a target on your back. If you talk to the prof then the dept chair, the professor will know who went to the chair.",
