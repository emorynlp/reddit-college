But I'm just so mad and stressed at my situation.  I'm a senior in my last semester.  I'm supposed to graduate in May.  My first year of college (2017-18) was fine, pretty lonely but I made some friends and got to party some, all classes went fine.  Second year was more of the same.  My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard.  Then just when things started to look better COVID hit.  And everything just went to shit.\n\nSo now I'm accustomed to half assing everything.  Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting.  Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later.  Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.  When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying.  Now compare that to now, I'm half listening to lectures on my phone at my apartment, getting B's on open note open internet tests, trying to piece together what I'm supposed to do from canvas announcements, emails, and groupMe messages.  Never socializing, just spending all my time with my boyfriend and aunt and uncle.  Never partying or going out or doing anything fun, just smoking too much weed at home in a desperate attempt to keep myself entertained.  On top of all that this goddamn Texas snowstorm just threw a fucky wrench into everything even further.  So I'm dealing with a natural disaster on top of a pandemic.\n\nI've gotten so depressed in college no doubt because my experience has devolved from the fun normal college experience to the life of some bored commuter living in a post apocalyptic wasteland.  And in two months I will graduate and then it's all done.  I have no idea what comes after that because COVID has made it incredibly hard to get job opportunities in my field too.
