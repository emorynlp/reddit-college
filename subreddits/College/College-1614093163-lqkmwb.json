  "title:": "COVID has ruined college",
  "text": "I know that's not exactly a hot take.  But I'm just so mad and stressed at my situation.  I'm a senior in my last semester.  I'm supposed to graduate in May.  My first year of college (2017-18) was fine, pretty lonely but I made some friends and got to party some, all classes went fine.  Second year was more of the same.  My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard.  Then just when things started to look better COVID hit.  And everything just went to shit.\n\nSo now I'm accustomed to half assing everything.  Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting.  Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later.  Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.  When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying.  Now compare that to now, I'm half listening to lectures on my phone at my apartment, getting B's on open note open internet tests, trying to piece together what I'm supposed to do from canvas announcements, emails, and groupMe messages.  Never socializing, just spending all my time with my boyfriend and aunt and uncle.  Never partying or going out or doing anything fun, just smoking too much weed at home in a desperate attempt to keep myself entertained.  On top of all that this goddamn Texas snowstorm just threw a fucky wrench into everything even further.  So I'm dealing with a natural disaster on top of a pandemic.\n\nI've gotten so depressed in college no doubt because my experience has devolved from the fun normal college experience to the life of some bored commuter living in a post apocalyptic wasteland.  And in two months I will graduate and then it's all done.  I have no idea what comes after that because COVID has made it incredibly hard to get job opportunities in my field too.  But that's a post for another day.",

I was thinking of pushing back my graduation by a semester but hey life goes on and I need to start making something out of it. I regret so many things like not partying harder or interacting with a lot more people. I miss being on campus studying until 2, 3am or pulling all nighters with friends. I miss laughing at eachother knowing we were going to fail a test. I miss walking in cold weather to the campus store.",

As someone who's had an eternal struggle at college (mainly related to the social aspect), it's always been rough, but in Fall 2019 I finally transferred to a college I was comfortable with, and it felt like I had a promising social life. I had a job with good hours & good pay, I was socializing more than I had in my first couple years, then boom. COVID comes in and ruins everything. And now I'm stuck at home, while everyone else is back at school.",

      "text": "Man this hits so close to home. I was in my dorm with all my friends in NYC, we\u2019d all go out to the movies like once a week, we\u2019d throw big parties in my dorm and my friends from NJ would all pile in and we\u2019d have a crazy fun time. I was (and still am technically) learning a language I was really passionate about, and I was taking computer science courses. I had a great group of friends and I was making some good friends in some of my classes. \nNow, however, those connections have been severed. I lost all motivation to do computer science and ended up switching majors. I haven\u2019t seen any of my College friends since June because I\u2019m too scared to go to the city, and most of my friends from home are either extremely busy or have gone back to their dorms. My language class is really a shining light in all this because I still am really passionate about leaning it, but it has started to become more and more of a chore, with all my other classes being nothing more than tasks I must complete. Those friends I had started to make quickly turned back into just classmates when we went online. I used to talk with these people from my language class, sometimes I\u2019d walk from class to class with them, and I still have class with some of them, but it\u2019s really just become a purely educational interaction now. It\u2019s been really sad. Like, I could see something new and exciting was starting to develop. I was making new friends and I was finding new things that I loved. And now that potential future is gone and those would-be great memories never happened.",

As a junior in college now, it feels like I sit around all day doing nothing, when in reality I attended multiple lectures back to back, did my homework, among other things. But it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing anything. I was a chemistry tutor at the college too, and I loved it! I talked to so many people and I was super passionate about teaching, and then COVID. Tutoring went online, barley any people showed up, and when they did it was hard to help them because I wasn\u2019t there. I ended up quitting the best job I\u2019ve ever had because once again, it felt like I was doing nothing. Lots of the other tutors stayed because they were okay with the idea of getting paid to sit behind a computer endlessly waiting for someone to join the zoom call, but I wasn\u2019t. On top of that, I loved going to school, I was a straight A student. I got a B last semester because online schools hard. Not hard in the sense people usually think, but it\u2019s even more independent learning. Also it\u2019s harder to get the help you need and network with your peers. Yea life as a full time student during a pandemic just feels pointless and I have been struggling with depression in spite of it. I have no motivation to do anything. Making my bed every morning and preparing nice little meals has helped though, but otherwise I just feel stuck, lost, and unmotivated. Keep your head up, well get through this together!",

It\u2019s being put into an environment that is all about learning and there are barely any distractions, like when your at home. \n\nWhat makes it even crazier is that the tuition is the same or even more??? When the educational aspects have gone down significantly?? It\u2019s just crazy to think my college experience ended on some random day in April. Before that I was doing significantly well for myself (networking, friends, jobs, internships, future) and then it all went away because of the pandemic. I also havent physically seen my friends since September and it\u2019s hard to keep in touch. It sucks Bc the virus and being at home 24/7 and practically never leaving has given me too much time to overthink about my life. Over the past months I think I\u2019ve had a new quarter life crisis every week. I\u2019m question my career choices, my future, if I should go back to school for a masters or a second bachelors? It\u2019s just like now I have all this time to second guess myself and think of a new future when at school it was just go go go and never stop to think.",

Do you think it might be anything like you or the hundreds of other people that post here about being lonely on a daily basis? Sometimes the majority of a group wants something but each individual is too afraid/uncertain to start the conversation. The irony of the situation is that other people do probably feel like you and want the same thing, but everyone thinks these thoughts are unique to them. Maybe you should propose a weekly \"bagels & coffee in the park\" or something people would like doing.\n\n\"I have no idea what comes after that because COVID has made it incredibly hard to get job opportunities in my field too.\"\n\nWhat's your field?",

What I mean is I miss being able to go to parties, fun events, public places, or even just say \"hey man\" to some other student in the lobby of the dorm.",

              "text": "You can still go to public places without being unsafe, that is entirely your decision though. Your experience is going to remain poor if you irrationalize stuff and think you can't go hiking with people or simply chat with someone like you mentioned.\n\nI miss large events too. Just stick it out through this semester! Policies will likely change a lot over the summer as the vaccines are more widely distributed.",
