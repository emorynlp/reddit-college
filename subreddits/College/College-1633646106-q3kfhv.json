  "title:": "Improving grades with a tenacity to procrastinate, poor time management, and memory issues?",
  "text": "Note taking, recitation, using the pomodoro method, mnemonics, practice tests, improving my nutritional and physical health--no matter what I do I just can't seem to be as scholarly as my classmates. Everything I learn takes a long time to be remembered, I can barely understand any assignment or exam questions if they're even remotely vague too.\n\nI've only been a freshman for 7 weeks but my grades so far are very mediocre, mostly because I can't get things done on time (usually turned in last minute from procrastination) and all the spoken information I learn in class just goes into one ear & out the other or becomes an obscured mess.\nThe \"learning styles\" thing doesn't really work for me either since my professors don't accommodate their lessons to fit each type. \n\nI'm afraid to ask for help with these issues since I doubt they would accept an \"I just can't\".\n\nI have no motivation to study outside of class time without getting overwhelmed, incredibly bored, or frustrated.\nI've been like this since elementary school and I'm at a loss, I'm a Nursing major so I don't want to graduate with the lowest passing grades possible like I did in highschool.\n\nI'm at a bit of a loss, I feel like a complete idiot",

      "text": "This was me a freshman. One easy thing that helped turn my grades around was entering every assignment into my reminders app on my iPhone. Every time I saw an assignment was due, I scheduled a reminder to go off a couple days before (longer if it was a big assignment). I would schedule them weeks or months in advance because I will forget EVERYTHING if I don\u2019t write it down. I still do this as a senior. Also, taking notes and paying attention in class will make everything so much easier. If you have trouble paying attention, make cute notes or work on your handwriting. I take notes on my iPad and I like to make them fancy, so now I actually look forward to taking notes in class. Hope this somewhat helps, good luck!!",
