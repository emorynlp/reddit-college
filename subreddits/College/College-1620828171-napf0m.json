  "text": "I think this is a cry for help more than it is anything else.\n\nI am unable to sit down and get any work done. I barely concentrate for 20 mins and then I don't get anything done for the rest of the day. I spend more than half of the day sleeping and the other half daydreaming (I have maladaptive daydreaming disorder).\n\nThis is my last semester, I have thus far maintained a 3.7 CGPA and 3.8 MGPA studying honors economics and math, so I am not a bad student by any means. I'm used to juggling my studies with lots of extra-curriculars AND an internship.\n\nI don't know what is wrong with me these past few weeks. I have missed the deadlines for 3 papers and I just can't bring myself to finish them (some are half done) nor do I know how to approach any of my instructors. \n\nIf anyone has any tips on how to get out of this slump or on how I can communicate what I'm going through to my instructors, I would gladly appreciate it.",

Remember that whatever's going on, it's probably some sort of burn out and it's not your fault. Don't be too hard on yourself. \n\nAs others have said, your main goal rn is to just get stuff done, and furthermore, have a solid plan as to how you can realistically do that. You're not gonna get a million things done in one day, but aiming for one thing, while difficult, may be much more realistic. \n\nAlso, in terms of professors, just be honest about your situation. Not all professors are nice and will care unfortunately, but some may have empathy and recognize just how difficult this year has been for everyone and how easily susceptible we all are to burn out. I talked to professors and told them the ugly truth regarding my mental health and got extensions, made a plan with them and had some support.\n\nUltimately, you got this. You're probably so incredibly overwhelmed rn and a little hopeless but so was i just a month ago since about September and now i can finally see the light at the end. At the end of the day though, we all have worth outside of our bad brains and all of our academic mishaps. Whatever happens, I'm proud of you.",

              "text": "No problem, and also if you have been a really good student in a class all semester and are truly dire, consider fishing for an extension or possibly an incomplete. I have only received an extension twice ever (once for one final exam paper this semester, and for a midterm paper this semester). I never actually asked for one, I just emailed my professor asking for advice bc I was really panicked, and they just offered me an extension. I am only a rising sophomore so I am going to work on my academic skills over the summer so that I do not have to have these worries again. Of course do not abuse this if you have asked for extensions before, but in some cases, they can make the difference you need. But consider reaching out to your advisor or professor before you submit anything (assuming you have not missed deadlines yet). Submitting something is almost always better than a zero. If your professors are hardasses I would be very careful about any email requests, however.\n\nAlso consider pass/fail if your school offers it and if you are going straight to a job. I know grad schools do not look highly upon it but if they do not accept a class because you got a P in it, you could probably just retake it years from now.",
