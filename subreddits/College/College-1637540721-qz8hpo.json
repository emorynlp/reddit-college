  "text": "I graduated from highschool 6 months ago.\nI was slacking off the whole time but now that 2022 is coming, i need to decided on what to study. I cant just stay here at home doing nothing.\n\nIm not particularly interested in anything big and high paying. I just want a typical job that i can enjoy and pay everything that i need in my daily life.\n\nI do have some hobbies that might help me pick.\n\n* Video games!\n(maybe i could pick game designer, software developer or somthing idk)\n\n* Animations!\n I like both 3D and 2D animations but i dont know how thats gonna earn me money (3D animator)\n\n* Heres my favourite: Content creating!\nThe past 3 months ive been learning how to edit videos for my youtube channel.\n I try to make my videos as entertaining as possible and im really passionate about working on them full-time. \nIt would be the perfect job for me since i sit on a computer everyday.\nI really think i have potential but my parents wont allow it so content creating will just be a hobby for now.\n\n\nThere isnt anything else i could think of so..\n\nYes pls help me haha if you have some other programs that i could study for college pls do let me know in the comments! Thank you!\n\n\n\nEdit: omg i read through my post again and i sounded so lazy and annoying im so sorry \n\nIm very bad at explaining things and on top of that, english isnt my first language so i apologize if this came out really frustrating to read",
