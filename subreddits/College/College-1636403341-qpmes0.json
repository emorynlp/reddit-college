I have not attended my professors office hours at all this quarter, and I have to as I am currently failing the class. I haven't been able to attend his hours because I have been sick quite frequently (flu) and busy. I want to hear out on how should I should I come across and if there's any tips y'all have towards being on his good side. Thank you.",

Go in and explain your situation and what led you to this point. Ask about what you can do to improve your grades. Make sure to come across as if you really want to try and make the effort, not just nonchalant and uncaring.",
