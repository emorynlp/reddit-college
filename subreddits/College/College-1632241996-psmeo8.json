  "text": "My (18m) girlfriend (18f) girlfriend isn't going to college or at least isn't going right now. She wants to focus on work and see if she likes the field she wants to go to before school. I'm going to University and she lives about 15 minutes away from her. She's constantly on campus with me, and it feels a little weird that she doesn't go there. She goes to frat parties with me and it feels a little weird that she's not going to school there. \n\nWe are going through a rough patch I would say. She's jealous that I'm interacting with girls on campus, and I don't want to go to sorority functions without her, but my fraternity did not like that idea at all. People do think it's weird she's around so much but not enrolled. \n\nNot really sure what to do? I really like her and we've been dating for about 5 months, but I'm not sure our paths are compatible. Does anyone have any experience with something like this?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t really think this needs to put a strain on your relationship, but the fact that it is might be a sign that it just won\u2019t work out. Then again, I don\u2019t know the full situation so it\u2019s hard to say. \n\nI\u2019d try to talk it out. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s weird for her to be around. People like to have fun. She is getting all of the social benefits of going to college without actually having to enroll. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird. Even if it is though, doesn\u2019t necessarily make it an issue.\n\nIs there a good reason why she is jealous of you talking to other girls? What exactly are you doing? \n\nDid you tell her your fraternity doesn\u2019t want you going to sorority functions with her?\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to give advice without more information. What exactly is causing the tension here?",

          "text": "Well it really started when I told her about the sorority events and she did not like that at all. I just said I wouldn't go to them, but brothers said it's not a date setting it's just getting to know people. She still didn't like it, so I asked if she could go, big no. So I'm just not going and that resolved the situation.\n\nI guess the big overall issue is, she's not really taking her life or future seriously. She doesn't know if she wants to go to school or when, which is fine, but I don't know if our lives are going down the same path anymore, because I have no clue what her path is going to be like.",

              "text": "Oh, so she did not want you going to the sorority events, so you just gave in and did not go? Did she explain why? That is a bit strange, but knowing her reasoning would be good.\n\nAnd if you do not think she is taking her future seriously that is pretty important. That is honestly kind of tough. If you think she seems like someone who would be more of a burden since they seem irresponsible in general, I would think about that. But if she just does not know what she wants to do yet and is just working in the mean time I do not think that is a bad thing. It is okay if your lives are not going down the same path. It is more about is she responsible enough, does she respect you, do you get along well enough, etc. It is more about what her not having a plan yet says about her character rather than the act of her path itself being different, if that makes sense. Maybe it says nothing, and this is just temporary while she figures things out. Or maybe it shows that she does not really care and just wants to have fun. Then you would need to think if you can be okay with someone who thinks that or not. To figure this out, you really are going to have to talk to her and see if she knows what her future plans are yet, and really try to understand what she is thinking, why, etc. You basically need to analyze her character and understand why she is doing what she is doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps. I can see why it is a tricky situatio",

And if she\u2019s getting jealous about you just talking to girls, that\u2019s super toxic. You\u2019ve been together 5 months, just don\u2019t let her pull you down or make you feel guilty for having fun and talking to people.",
