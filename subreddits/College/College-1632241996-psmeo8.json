She wants to focus on work and see if she likes the field she wants to go to before school. I'm going to University and she lives about 15 minutes away from her. She's constantly on campus with me, and it feels a little weird that she doesn't go there. She goes to frat parties with me and it feels a little weird that she's not going to school there. \n\nWe are going through a rough patch I would say. She's jealous that I'm interacting with girls on campus, and I don't want to go to sorority functions without her, but my fraternity did not like that idea at all. People do think it's weird she's around so much but not enrolled. \n\nNot really sure what to do? I really like her and we've been dating for about 5 months, but I'm not sure our paths are compatible.
