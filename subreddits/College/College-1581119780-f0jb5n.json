  "title:": "Locked Out of Dorm Building for 5 Weeks Running",
  "text": "I recently went back to college for some postbacc work and decided to live in the dorms as I never had that experience in my undergrad time. \n\nWeek 1: They told me when I signed up for the dorm, that the system for making ID cards was down and would be back up in a week. As a result, I would not be able to enter or leave the dorm building outside of business hours until the ID system was back up. Ok, seems like that should be something to be fixed faster, but whatever, I don't plan on being out late or super early. \n\nWeek 2: ID card system is back up, I received an ID but they failed to tell me that the system to give people access to my dorm building was down. Maybe one week more until it's up. In the meantime, your Dean has ordered you a mechanical key for the side doors.\n\nWeek 3: I run into my Dean, he's surprised the key hasn't been made yet and puts in another request. Housing extends the time for the proxy access system to be back up to two weeks. \n\nWeek 5: Still no key. Door lock timers are horribly timed, 5pm - 10am I cannot leave nor enter the building, and Friday at 12pm till Monday at 10am I am unable to exit or leave. I'm cooped up or locked out entirely on weekends. Housing keeps making excuses, the system won't be working until Spring quarter now, maybe later. Facilities has failed to make a key for four weeks, I've called everyday and asked in person multiple times when the issue will be resolved and they say they can't even find requests. \n\nBeginning Week 6 (Present): I'm not sure what to do now, I've been getting along, waiting for friends to get out to let me in and out (every entrance is electronically keyed for entry and exit). I've personally spoken with the Housing Director twice, two different Deans multiple times, and the Facilities Managers and not a single person is able to help resolve this problem. \n\nIt snowed recently and was unable to get into my dorm when the door timer switched early and was left outside, no jacket in the snow for 30 minutes with some groceries while waiting for a housing staff to let me in. \n\nThe first couple weeks I could understand the problem and I can spend a couple weekends cooped up, but it's halfway through the quarter and it's frankly getting irritating. \n\nI've talked to so many people that are literally at the top of the food chain and don't know who else to go to now. Any advice on what steps to take next?\n\nEdit: The facilities manager finally produced a key for a side door for me today that can be used at anytime. I will be talking to the Housing Director about a partial refund for the time I was locked out/in as some of you suggested. I really appreciate the insight guys thank you.",

      "text": "I would encourage you to write an e-mail with the timeline of events.  \n\nWho did you speak to, on what date, when did they say it would be resolved.  \n\nI would request:  \n\n1. That proper instruments of 24x7 access be provided in accordance with your housing agreement.  \n2. Payment be refunded for housing for if not the entire semester, half of the semester.  \n3. If these things are not possible, then you need to be relocated to another housing unit where they are able to provide instruments of 24x7 access.  \n\nI would end with a reminder that they are in violation of the housing agreement, and as a tenant of said housing you have rights.  \n\nI would send that e-mail to god and every disciple.  \n\nThen I'd print it, and bring it with a copy of all document to the office of the president of the university, and plop my ass in his waiting area and ask for a meeting.  \n\nThe fact that you are being quite literally locked out in the cold should be an issue that gets their attention.  \n\nIf they can't seem to figure out how to remedy your problem, ask if you can sleep on the couch in his office. Since it shouldn't be a problem for them to provide you access to that space 24x7.\n\nIf you end up waiting, I would butter up the Administrative staff.  \nThe boss's secretary has tremendous influence among the rest of the staff.  \n\n\nIf things get ugly, you need to engage an attorney. For all practical purposes they are a landlord and you are a tenant, and the city & state where your university resides has laws that govern that business arrangement.",

          "text": "I've been thinking heavily about the legal action that could be taken, at least as leverage to speed up the process. Currently the methods I have of getting into the dorm building (not the room but the building itself) is to call security and wait twenty minutes, wait for someone and follow in behind them, or wait till 10pm when a front desk worker arrives.",
