  "title:": "A good way to reach college students for a temp job?",
  "text": "What is a good way to reach out to local college (engineering or CS) students for a temp job? The job is fairly short-term and doesn't qualify as a co-op (for example, Drexel requirement is a minimum of 20 hours a week for at least X months - and my business isn't in a place yet where I can commit to that much work). It's a technical job that requires someone local, so I can't outsource it and college engineering students are probably my best option when it comes to having the right knowledge, being affordable, and being OK with a part-time temp gig.  If you are/were an engineering student, where would you look for some work that wasn't necessarily a full-blown co-op or internship?",
