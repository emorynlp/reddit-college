  "title:": "My manager doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m a college student",
  "text": "I\u2019m a female who is currently a junior in college. I have a part time job with a big makeup retail company that I will not mention but isn\u2019t the one that starts with a U. So I got hired at the company over the summer and I told the manager straight out that even though I was available during certain days ( I was only taking 2 summer semester classes at the time and one was online) my availability will change during fall semester as I was going to be taking 4 very hard classes and all of which were going to be in person. She told me she would work with my schedule and help me out when she can. Fast forward to now where I\u2019m basically working 6 days a week even though I told her I can only work Tuesdays, Thursdays and the weekends due to class. She schedules me for over 7 hours a shift and with a 2 hour on call which usually means I have to work 9 hours a shift. I tell her I can\u2019t do these hours and I\u2019m only a part time worker but she is treating me like a full time one. Hell she keeps denying me days off when I request 2 months in advance for them and that\u2019s only during my exam week so I can actually have time to study. She talks to me about this and is like \u201cwhen we first hired you at \u2014\u2014 company it was because of your availability \u201c. Since then when I tell her hey don\u2019t schedule me on this day please because I have class call day she gives me the same speech and gets upset when I call out that day for school. Or she will get upset because I\u2019m scheduled and can\u2019t come in and that I didn\u2019t give her notice ahead of time so she can schedule someone else. The thing is I do tell weeks in advance what times my classes are (they never change but she still makes me tell her) and yet I\u2019m still scheduled. I\u2019m literally claiming a 10 day sick leave because I\u2019m so overwhelmed with exams and she scheduled me on exam days. Last week she sat me down to tell me that maybe the company isn\u2019t right for me because of my schedule. It wasn\u2019t even about my worth ethic or how I am with clients it was just simply because I can\u2019t do 9 hour shifts 6 days a week even though I\u2019m only a part timer. I\u2019m being told to quit the company by several people including my parents and psychologist etc but she is leaving the company in a month so is it worth it. The other manager understands that I\u2019m a student and works with me about my schedule but has been on sick leave for a while cause he COVID. I like working there and like my pay plus my discounts and coworkers but my schedule is way too much. My schedule is affecting my mental health and I don\u2019t know if I should put in my 2 weeks in or not.",

      "text": "Do you know what day exactly your current boss is leaving? If it is just in the air about her leaving, I would say leave. If it is something you can stick out until you get a better boss (*hopefully soon), I would say consider staying ONLY if you know they absolutely will decrease your number of hours. \n\nCollege is your priority and no job will EVER be worth your mental health. I wish you the best and I hope things work out how you want them too.",

If you schedule me any other days/times I will not be here. One I hit x hours in a week, I will not be coming to work. If you need to fire me over this, go ahead.",
