  "title:": "Is it reasonable for a professor to ask me to tutor students for free?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in a physiological psychology class this semester. Since I already have a good foundation in biology and anatomy, I\u2019ve been doing quite well, but it seems like quite a few students are struggling with the material. My professor reached out to me after I aced our last exam and told me she had several students asking for help improving their grades, so she asked if I would be willing to tutor one or two people. I already have a student reaching out to me saying he is \u201cdesperate\u201d for a tutor and has never struggled like this in a class before.\n\nI\u2019m feeling conflicted about the situation for a few reasons. I feel bad for the students that are struggling and it seems fair to offer help when I\u2019m doing so well. However, no one in this equation has any plans to compensate me for my time and effort - my professor said it would look great on my CV if I could say I improved a student\u2019s grade by x%, but otherwise I don\u2019t stand to gain much here. I know tutors are usually paid for their time, and I already work a lot of unpaid hours as a research assistant. How should I proceed in this situation?\n\n\n\nEdit: Just wanted to thank you all for your feedback, it was very helpful! I think for now I will speak with the student looking for a tutor to clarify what their expectations are (i.e. if this will be a recurring thing or just a session or 2) and go from there. I would also like to clarify that this was certainly not something that I was expected to do and I realize I have the option to decline - I was just hoping for a bit of middle ground between saying yes & getting taken advantage of or turning down someone who could really use the help.",

      "text": "the professor isn't asking you to tutor them, the professor is asking if you are *willing* to tutor them. the difference is that in the former, you are being asked to do something. in the latter (the current case), you are being informed of an opportunity and the professor, who knows you are qualified due to your grades, wants to know if you are interested.\n\nyou are free to say no. the professor has literally 0 expectation that you will tutor them. In fact, the prof probably doesn't even care. \n\nI don't know how the professor set any kind of expectation that \"tutoring classmates is free.\" She most likely means study groups and helping each other out, not flat-out tutoring. Perhaps she doesn't understand the distinction between helping each other out/study groups  and formal tutoring. In the United States, there is no way to set that expectation without saying the words, \"You can receive free tutoring from classmates.\" The common understanding of \"tutoring\" is always formal and one-way (tutor is not going to receive help from the student, student only goes to tutor to receive help).\n\nThe prof is obviously not going to dictate the terms of payment, that is not her responsibility. **You can arrange payment privately with the students.**\n\ne.g. \"sure, I am willing to tutor them for $15 an hour. Can you tell me their names so we can meet?\" or whatever you want.  Or if you don't want to tutor them at all, \"Sorry, but I do not have the time to do so\" or whatever excuse you want.",

Gift them an hour or two of your time, every 2 weeks or so. \nIt\u2019s a nice, selfless gesture and you\u2019ll leave a mark on them for life. \nDon\u2019t look at this as a liability, a burden or a waste of time. Consider it to be an enhanced study session.\n\nExplaining things to someone else requires a profound understanding of the topic. It will make a you a better student and you will gain lots of insight.\n\nBut as another commenter said, you can probably be hired as a student worker and make some bucks. \nGood luck",

Your professor cant just say oh yeah Jane will do it. No. Its absolutely fair to request payment if this is a side thing between you and the student, not something handled by the college",

So kudos on that.\n\nSecond, it's ridiculous for your professor to assume you have the time that she doesn't. I would bring that up and ask why she assumed you had that kind of free time?\n\nThird, if it's a casual study \"group\" like once a week, I see it as a networking opportunity. It's a great way to meet people who might even be friends and help YOU out one day. I wouldn't look at it in a manner of compensation, unless you're spending all your time doing this and it's affecting your work/life situation. I don't agree on the CV thing, most people are not going to even look at that, at best, they'll see it as student responsibility in a moral/ethical setting. That's what I think.\n\nFinally, if you're not comfortable doing this, just tell everyone you can no longer help them study bc you have your own obligations. That is your choice, after all. I help out people all the time almost weekly several weeks in a row to help study for the exams we have going on now. And I work almost full time and go to school full time.\n\nEveryone wants to make money for their time, I understand that, but if it's not going to affect your personal life I don't see it as a problem.\n\nEDIT: Also, consider who you're tutoring, most of us are broke af haha",
