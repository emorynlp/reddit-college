  "text": "The transition from in person to online sucked. It sucked, but it was doable. But going back in person... I'm struggling so much. Granted, I'm overloading my credits and hold more jobs and responsibilities than I did when we were in person but... In person is tough. I miss online classes when I could watch lectures at my own pace, rather than almost fall asleep during in person lecture and have to go over that content at a much later time, which wastes more time for me. My days run for 12 hours straight for school and work, which could be worse but I don't have enough sleep, I don't have enough time to cook and clean, I don't have enough time to exercise, and I don't have time to do the things I used to love to do. I just feel like in person classes wastes more of my time, and I'm struggling so much. I've been a consistent A/A- student pre- and during covid, and now I'm projected to get a few B's and C's which will negatively impact me for graduate school. I don't know. I feel tired and burnt out. I miss online classes. I'm dreading the push for even more in person for the future terms. I miss feeling not sleepy and so, so done with everything. I really hope I'm not the only one.",
