  "title:": "Professor locked me out from taking a quiz for showing up at exactly 8am (when class starts)",
  "text": "I showed up at exactly 8am (the clock literally just changed from 7:59) and when I went to open the door, the professor slammed it back against me and gave me a nasty look.\n\nThis guy lets in kids who are late but slammed the door for me, at 8am. The quiz had not even started. \n\nSince I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).\n\nI went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should\u2019ve showed up at 7:59.\n\nI WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.\n\nEdit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. \n\nEdit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) \n\nEdit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL\n\nTo everyone saying I\u2019m clearly lying: I took this screenshot when I was standing outside showing my professor my phone. 8:00 on the dot: https://imgur.com/a/tJnfWPn\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been banned from commenting",

      "text": "It seems like every university has at least one professor with a major chip on their shoulder. Often times, all it takes is them having a bad day and they pick a target/targets to take their frustrations out on.  \n\nYour dean was was right; your first recourse should always be to discuss issues privately, one-on-one with professors. If they can't see reason, a letter or email to the dean allows for eloquence that you may not otherwise have due to present frustration.\n\nMy botany professor had a major chip on his shoulder about colleagues stealing his work and plagiarism in general, so he was always out for blood. I once had a botany assignment that required students to write paragraph or two to explain how they would go about diagnosing insect behavior. I knew exactly what I wanted to write but I didn't know the name for a vessel that contains insects\nfor observation and thought there might be a standard name for one like a Bunsen Burner would be for heating in chemistry, for example. So I Googled it. \"Stationary Simulated Flight Apparatus\" is what every Google result showed, so that is the term I used in the paragraphs. The professor gave me a zero and threatened expulsion from the university. He did the same thing to other students, but they clearly plagiarized word-for-word. I ended up having to write a letter to the dean and the result was that she had him simply deduct 10 points from my overall assignment. Her wording in her response letter implied she sided with me but still had to show him some respect in the process.",

It\u2019s set up to protect the system. Definitely talk to the Dept head and the academic ombudsman (if you have one) but understand that this process doesn\u2019t favor you unless you have overwhelming evidence of the professor going against the syllabus. For the most part, professors are feudal lords and you, their serf. You have a better shot the smaller the uni. I wish it weren\u2019t so but it is. Additionally, students that get the label of difficult or the in vogue \u201ctypical millennial\u201d have trouble getting letters of recommendations, introductions and/or help in the future. I completely disagree with what happened to you but ask yourself this, \u201cIs this the hill I make my stand and die on?\u201d  \n\n",

Intentional unkindness towards a student is never acceptable. \n\nYou know the context here better than us internet people. Take a breath and reconsider the situation, previous interactions, and what\u2019s at stake if you escalate. Are you really willing to alienate your professor by going over his/her head?  Is there any reason that this professor has to make an example of you?  Is there any way you can turn this into a positive and rebuild this relationship with your professor.",

He routinely shows up barely before class starts while wearing the clothes he slept in. That tells me it's solely his fault for not planning effectively. The professors reaction is inconsequential to all this and likely exaggerated to win favor.\n\nHow do I know all this? Not long ago i was almost as lazy as OP except I at least dressed myself in appropriate clothing. What changed? I took a serious job at a top restaurant in my city and the chefs taught me that when it's time to work you need to be ready to work and not changing or sipping coffee or smoking a cigarette outside. And that punctuality and preparation helped me out when I went back to finish my degree. Instead of habitual absence and tardiness I am posting the best grades of my career while having the highest workload I've ever had. I've missed 3 classes and have been late a grand total of once, wherein I emailed ahead of time and avoided any penalty since that teacher  penalizes participation for tardiness.",

Two days later that professor made an announcement at the beginning of class that textbooks are strongly encouraged, but not a necessity for coursework.  The miserable bastard had been teaching the same course for 20+ years (still \u201clectured\u201d by writing using an oldschool overhead projector for an hour every class).  \n\nThe look on his face as he stared me down while making the announcement was priceless.  No one hailed me as a hero or anything, but it felt good nonetheless.",

You need to get your hands on that footage. You'll need to go to the campus police/security immediately and ask if you can review the footage for the time and date because you feel that you're being profiled. This should immediately get you in to see it. If you can get him on video shutting the door on you and allowing late students in, you have a smoking gun. This happened to me about 1 1/2 years ago at a SUNY school. I told the campus security that I was being profiled by a teacher and was afraid of him. Note: when you say you're afraid, you don't have to be specific, and it's not considered lying as you're genuinely afraid of him because he can alter your grade and fail you out. Now, if you can't do it that way I'd recommend filing a formal complaint against him. This means he'll have to show up in front of someone (board director/Dean, etc.) with you there as well. If they review the footage and/or he admits to it you can ask to switch to another teacher or have the test retaken. \n\nAlso if anything like this ever happens again, record it. However again, be sneaky. Record audio only and leave the phone in your pocket.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck.",

And if he is giving a quiz, it's not like he can do something else to kill those 10 minutes to wait for all the stragglers. He has to get the class going, and waiting for late people might not be in the cards. I also am betting this is not the 1st time the professor has addressed this issue.

If you've ever worked anywhere as a professional you know hardly anyone is on time because meeting go late, there's travel time between, you're double/triple booked, etc. I say don't worry about it, deal with the prof for the class and then completely forget about him because his class likely doesn't really matter much anyway. Oh and B's get degrees which don't really matter much compared to experience anyway.",

Some dept chairs are stipend positions so they get paid peanuts to deal with people like you who have beef's with their instructor. \n\nStep #1: Go the dept chair. You did this. \n\nStep #2: Per the dept chair advice, schedule time with the instructor and work it out. Be professional.....dress snappy casual and be early to the meeting. Then outline your points.....be apologetic.......eat crow.......take it in the ass.......just make it sound like you learned your lesson. Then state that you are paying the college to learn and part of this process is taking the exam and being assessed by the instructor. Ask him for this chance to take the exam and complete the learning process. Say please.   \n\n\nStep #3: If he says no. Thank him for his time and leave. Don't threaten the instructor with further action. Just leave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep #4: If you have an advisor. Go see your advisor. They might be able to advocate for you.   \n\n\nStep #5: Still no luck. Go to the Dean of Academics. Schedule a time to meet. Be professional and on time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep #6: Still no luck.

If I were you, I would humbly take the small drop from an A- to a B+, and maybe express your regrets in private to this professor, and ask what you can do better in the future. It's not fair, and doesn't make sense, but having been in grad school, I guarantee you the more you push it, the more you're going to piss him and other people off. If he is tenured and made up his mind, there is fuck all anyone can do anyways.

Explain the situation but do so in a professional manner and request a meeting personally with the provost to explain yourself and come to them with all the facts.

Never had it happen in college, but I had a teacher in high school refuse to give me credit on a major assignment I'd worked my ass off on after I walked into class as the bell was ringing (not even after, as it was going off). Refused to discuss it with me, actually gave me the silent treatment (literally sat there silently and refused to acknowledge my presence when I approached her after class). It was one of the most childish things I'd seen an adult do. School administration sided with her after I complained and it ended up dropping my grade down.\n\nGood luck fighting this, people who are going to be that petty deserve to be taken down a peg. Hopefully you have more luck than I did.",

Anybody that's willing to get in your way and say \"tough titties\" when they won't move should have to deal with this. Worse thing for you is you might not get to retake the quiz but you still pass. For your professor and the department head, they're going to have to deal with a disgruntled student because the professor decided to swing his dick around and the department head is actually a figure head. It's literally that person's job to handle disputes like this and instead they're saying \"handle it between the two of you, not like theres a huge power struggle there or anything\". \n\nI'm actually baffled that something so petty happened to you. Good luck and I hope you get your A that you deserve. These people are supposed to be teaching you and helping you. Not this shit.",

They likely wouldn\u2019t be fired if they showed up at 8:05 if their work was good and resulted in product being shipped.  Businesses don\u2019t care about that kind of thing; they care about being profitable.  Pedantic managers care about those kinds of things deeply though.  Sometimes it\u2019s because the timing matters, sometimes it\u2019s because the manager is a small person who needs to exert control over other people.  The difference is that good managers make it clear early on what behaviors are important and how they impact the business and coworkers.",

Plenty of time in my schedule but one of them had one specific requirement they offered once a year max. Never the same class, mind you, it was one of those designations that mean nothing like \"oh this is a WC class, etc.\" I was talking to the department head about it, trying to plan things out, when she decided to tell me they weren't offering ANY of those designations that year and that, on top of that, she was removing one of mine that I earned.

That\u2019s ok though, you\u2019re a young liberal with no life experience.  You\u2019ll learn kiddo.   Make sure you pay those student loans on time since you obviously have issues with time.  It\u2019s clear you\u2019re insecure since you felt the need to bring up college.  It\u2019s pretty pathetic that is all you have to your name.

I know you know that, but I just wanted to say it because it bears saying.\n* Most relevant to your case: **unless the course syllabus states that there is a policy of being denied entry due to lateness**, this dude can't just decide to selectively enforce this policy.\n* You are an adult. Don't be intimidated by this clown. Yes, be early to things and all, that's a good rule to live by. But in this specific scenario, arriving on time =/=  being late unless again, it was clearly stated ahead of time that this would be the case. I doubt a fucking sociology quiz required such fine concentration that a person entering the class late would affect it.\n* In this explicit scenario, I can tell you that no professor where I work could get away with shit like this because students could have classes prior to their own - therefore, they can't be penalized for not showing up PRIOR to the start of class.\n\nBy all means, follow the department head's advice and take it up with the prof. at his office hours, and if he refuses to budge, go back to the department head. Sometimes there's policy that requires you to go through the motions before they can act more directly (i.e. you and your prof are unable to come to an agreement). Hopefully that's all it takes for them to get this guy to stop being an asshat.\n\nThis is a small enough issue that if you're persistent enough in complaining, they'll likely capitulate just to be rid of you. But, it's also a significant enough case of your instructor being petty/unreasonable that you're justified in pursuing/escalating it.\n\nI'd consider speaking with your registrar / dean of student life / student union to see what else can be managed.",

In some cases (big test) it could be as late as 30 min but you only get the remaining scheduled time to finish your stuff. I thought that was incredibly fair as people do end up being late sometimes despite their best intentions not to. Unless it is a repetetive behavior, shit happens. \n\nEdit: also write about that guy in ratemyprofessor or some shit like that. Maybe other students will weigh options if they have any. ",

Them missing out on lecture is their punishment. But, if the syllabus says class starts at 8 sharp and a student pays for that class, there are really no excuses barring a car accident or medical/family emergency that they shouldn't be there on that time especially if they pay for the course, why wouldn't they want to be? Because of that, I'm definitely not pikachu-facing at this result as much as some folks are. To the guy it happened to it sucks, rate the professor or whatever, but best take it as a lesson learned and move on. B- is not the end of the world.",

So I would say learning this lesson early and only taking a hit to a final grade although frustrating is fully warranted. Rather learn how to be on time by seeing actual consequences than assuming that everyone should/can/will sit around and wait for you when you are scheduled to be somewhere at a specific time.

                      "text": "I'm 24, got Cs and Bs throughout college, graduated with a 3.1. Hell I was in college for 5 years finding the right major and not at an Ivy League.\n\n\nWorked as a glorified telemarketer for a marketing company beginning sophomore year of college, promoted to team lead after 6 months, 6 months later senior data specialist, data admin 6 months after that.\n\n\nGraduated with two years full-time work experience - jumped to a Big 4 consulting firm (handling finance software and CRM). I doubled my income and never was asked about my GPA once. They care more about work experience. Moreover - I didn't include GPA on my resume and have never been asked. Nor why I was in college for 5 years. \n\n\nRecruiters, headhunters, and hiring managers care about how confident you are, how you frame yourself, how you sell your skills and present yourself.\n\n\nJust jumped to a new position and broke 6 figures in a state where people with a lot more experience can see half of that.  My 3.1 never mattered, except if I want to get into grad school. I now qualify for a top 10 internationally ranked grad school due to my work experience - despite my GPA.\n\n\nFor you, your grades will be a big advantage (for your first job out of college) and it's beautiful you care about a B+. But know grades won't get you everywhere, work experience is important as is valuing yourself highly. \n\n\nKnowledge and passion matter as does willingness to take on special projects and raise your hand for opportunities at work. Following up on raises when they should be given. Knowing your worth and even overselling a little.\n\n\n\nSome advice, if you don't have a bomb LinkedIn and plenty of endorsements for your skillsets and haven't added people in the industry you're in who you'd want to be down the road - set that up and add thousands of connections, including a bunch of in house recruiters for major consulting firms or whichever companies you have been eyeing. Dont upload your resume. Get endorsements on your profile.\n\n\nMake sure your resume is awesome and oversell on it. Everyone does. Print it on natural fiber paper and have a folder to hand it from to an interviewer. Dress snazzy and be confident in interviews. Imagine yourself already having worked there for a year before you walk in. Think about and ask good questions during your interviews.\n\n\nIt makes sense you're pissed about the B+ because your professor was being a bit of a jerk but also keep in mind that at most offices, showing up at 8:00 for an 8:00 meeting isn't acceptable. I'd still counter it further down the line with the school board if it means that much to you.\n\n\nBut you'll be fine without it.",

It sounds like OP still has a chance to change things. Better to give it a shot than simply shrug and let it slide, especially since the job market nowadays does mean GPAs can matter.\n\nWhen nothing more can be done, and it's firmly in the past, I agree with you that you can't dwell in negativity.

Show me one post doc in any discipline that thinks even remotely like you claim- I\u2018m certain you won\u2019t find one.  \n\nStudents are paying for the commodity of being educated at the facility they are attending with the style of education provided by that facility. If you go to a research university, you are going to an educational institution whose stated priority is the generation of knowledge. Just because you believe that the priority should be education of undergrads doesn\u2019t make it so. People who are surprised by this made an investment in a commodity they didn\u2019t understand. If you want to pay for an education where teaching is a priority, then you shouldn\u2019t attend a research university.

Was the class warned that they had to arrive *before* start time? Had the test actually begun yet?\n\nTo answer my own questions: 1) It's ludicrous to lock the door at the exact moment class starts, in case there is a tiny discrepancy in people's time pieces. Because the clock on the wall in the room is 27 seconds faster than my cell phone time, I get 0 on a test? Wtf? 2) Personally, I have never, ever been told that I had to be early to class to avoid being locked out of a test. This is through highschool, undergrad, teacher's college, and postgrad studies. If OP was warned to be early, sure, but I wouldn't *assume* he was. 3) The purpose of not letting people in late on a test day is to not disrupt the test. If the test hasn't begun, there is nothing to disrupt. So locking someone out at that point is petty and vindictive.",

You're right, this bastard wants you to beg for forgiveness for not being early to his class on quiz day, and I'm doubtful it would make any difference at this point. You've already tried going over his head which means any possibility of appealling or otherwise stroking his ego will be in vain. He gets off on watching you squirm and beg for grace and providing him the opportunity to reject your pitiful attempts tp appeal to his good nature is just the cherry on top for this hardass. Don't give this asshole the satisfaction. \n\nIf you don't really need the grade and you're just trying to fight this on principle and you don't think you have anything else to lose (e.g. Dignity, time, respect from your other professors who may feel inclined to take their colleague's side and punish you in their class, punishment from administration who might choose to get involved and defend their faculty in every case rather than listen to reason) I would 100% get petty at this point. The department head obviously forwarded your email to the professor and since it's your word against his, they took his side immediately, so I guarantee there is no path for justice or redemption at this point.\n\nEdit: Sorry I've had a rough day and your post obviously triggered something for me lol\n\nMaybe try the diplomatic approach one more time and see if any of your classmates can vouche for you having been on time.\n\nIf not, then fuck that guy straight in the.... *deep breath* Sorry",

No need to deal with the nonsense if it is continuous.\n\nIf you haven't had problems before with this professor,  *and* you don't know of anyone else who has a similar experience with the professor, don't go directly to the department chair or higher up person. Instead, *email* the professor to set up a time to meet to discuss what happened. One of four things will probably happen:\n\n1. The professor will realize that they were unreasonable and will apologize.\n2. The professor will not apologize, but will acknowledge the time line of events and will try to not have you go to the department chair over such a stupid act (by the professor) that can affect his career.\n3. The professor will acknowledge the chain of events without apologizing, which you then use when you talk to the department chair.\n4. The professor sends a response worthy of going to the department chair by itself, which you then use to go to the department chair.\n\nBad days by professors shouldn't effect our students. If it is a bad day, the professor should make it right. If it's a symptom of being a bad professional, then the higher up professionals should help rectify this. ",

Sure, trying to squeak in after the scheduled start time is acceptable to most teachers and professors but maybe an apology on the student's behalf is also warranted.  Late is late.  A professional discussion is needed and a mea culpa on both sides will probably lead to a mutually acceptable resolution.

They protect each other and will almost always side against you unless they fucked up badly enough that you can sue them (for something like discrimination). Depending on where you study, $ is most likely everything. They will do everything they can to hold on to a professor who gets them tons of $ in research grants. \n\nYour only \u201cpunishment\u201d should have been that you had to miss some time getting your pencil out to take the quiz. \n\nGood luck in office hours.

But you're being SO ridiculously rigid. What happens if you have a meeting with another lecturer before then? What happens if your bus is delayed by 45 minutes? What happens if someone trips you over and it takes you 5 minutes to recover? Etc. In this case it's his own \"fault\", but don't you dare defend the staff member for being an asshole.",

I participated. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, but we simply have different ideas as to what is important or not. I honestly loved a lot of my electives (I stutter so I was exempted from taking a language and got to take sort of culture themed classes, like one on all the French-speaking countries instead), but I personally think sociology is a bit of a joke. That's just an opinion. I'm sure some people consider one of my degrees, in history, to be a joke as well and that's perfectly fine. I'm simply not going to take a class where we watch movies and write two paragraph synopses on sociological themes as seriously as I take, say, a bacterial genetics recitation. For one, the exams are about five hundred times more in depth and actually require studying. The concepts are more difficult to put together and require quite a bit of structured coursework beforehand. Nothing in sociology is difficult to understand.\n\nAnd most of my school was paid for by the maximum of grant money allowable so, no, not really my own money. Unless you mean in a roundabout, tax-involved way. One of my very best friends has a degree in sociology and I respect the work she put into it, but even she agrees the material isn't exactly difficult.",

But for a quiz, all you even need is a pencil which takes approximately 5 seconds. Professors usually don't even start these quizzes until 5 minutes after to account for students rummaging through their backpacks, turning phones off, etc. What's so different about getting there at 7:59:50 vs. 8:00:00? It's literally going to take the same time to get ready.",

I don't not believe this though. Some professors are just sticklers for time and some professors will have favorites as well. It's reasonable to assume this actually happened.",
