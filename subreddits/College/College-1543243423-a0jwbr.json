The quiz had not even started. \n\nSince I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).\n\nI went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should\u2019ve showed up at 7:59.\n\nI WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.\n\nEdit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. \n\nEdit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) \n\nEdit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time.

If they can't see reason, a letter or email to the dean allows for eloquence that you may not otherwise have due to present frustration.\n\nMy botany professor had a major chip on his shoulder about colleagues stealing his work and plagiarism in general, so he was always out for blood. I once had a botany assignment that required students to write paragraph or two to explain how they would go about diagnosing insect behavior. I knew exactly what I wanted to write but I didn't know the name for a vessel that contains insects\nfor observation and thought there might be a standard name for one like a Bunsen Burner would be for heating in chemistry, for example. So I Googled it. \"Stationary Simulated Flight Apparatus\" is what every Google result showed, so that is the term I used in the paragraphs. The professor gave me a zero and threatened expulsion from the university. He did the same thing to other students, but they clearly plagiarized word-for-word. I ended up having to write a letter to the dean and the result was that she had him simply deduct 10 points from my overall assignment.

I know you know that, but I just wanted to say it because it bears saying.\n* Most relevant to your case: **unless the course syllabus states that there is a policy of being denied entry due to lateness**, this dude can't just decide to selectively enforce this policy.\n* You are an adult. Don't be intimidated by this clown. Yes, be early to things and all, that's a good rule to live by. But in this specific scenario, arriving on time =/=  being late unless again, it was clearly stated ahead of time that this would be the case. I doubt a fucking sociology quiz required such fine concentration that a person entering the class late would affect it.\n* In this explicit scenario, I can tell you that no professor where I work could get away with shit like this because students could have classes prior to their own - therefore, they can't be penalized for not showing up PRIOR to the start of class.\n\nBy all means, follow the department head's advice and take it up with the prof. at his office hours, and if he refuses to budge, go back to the department head. Sometimes there's policy that requires you to go through the motions before they can act more directly (i.e. you and your prof are unable to come to an agreement). Hopefully that's all it takes for them to get this guy to stop being an asshat.\n\nThis is a small enough issue that if you're persistent enough in complaining, they'll likely capitulate just to be rid of you.
