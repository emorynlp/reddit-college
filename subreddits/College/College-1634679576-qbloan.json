  "title:": "To what extent can I edit my siblings essay",
  "text": "I was wondering to what extent I should edit my brothers essay. I\u2019m currently a PhD student, and whenever I present slides or submit manuscripts my advisor will suggest/edit sentences that she thinks don\u2019t sound good.\n\nFor my brothers undergrad college essays, is it okay for me to do the same level of editing? Or is it important that the essay should read like a high school student has written it?\n\nI think my writing skills only really got decent after a few years of grad school, so I don\u2019t really like how my brothers essay sounds and I feel like changing a lot. \n\nThanks",
