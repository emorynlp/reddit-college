I had very little freedom from my parents and spent most of it just going to class, cross country practice, or competing in FIRST robotics competitions.\n\nLikewise my brother's college life included stuff like renting an apartment in San Francisco that didn't exist during his summer internship and spending two weeks homeless there, taking his friends for a weekend trip to Montreal just because, and dislocating his kneecap while drunk at a frat party, popping it back into place, and then walking it off before waking up unable to move his leg the following morning.\n\nHis high school life was mostly split between being a lifeguard at the local pool and being on the swim team.\n\nHonestly, college life is just more interesting in general, but high schoolers are the ones spending their parents money watching these things so...",
