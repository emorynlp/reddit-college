I feel like I would get mixed up between the two if I took them both in the same semester.\n\nEdit: Whoops, literally what Neo just said lol.",

It\u2019s actually back to back with the same Professor so sometimes I get confused in what assignment is due each day \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut other than that is actually pretty helpful. Some things I learn in macro are applicable in micro. But they\u2019re also very different. \n\nI\u2019m actually glad to be getting them done at once because they can be pretty annoying at times. \n\nI\u2019ll do then at the same time again if needed.",
