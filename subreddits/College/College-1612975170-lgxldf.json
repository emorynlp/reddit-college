  "text": "This isn\u2019t another \u201chate on online learning post\u201d, but i see it as more of a reminder that feedback in person is good. \n\nIn person, your teachers remind you that your quiz is coming up, you should be about done with your project, etc. \n\nWith online learning, i get none of that interaction so it\u2019s all on me to navigate the syllabus and hope I\u2019m doing everything correctly\n\nI had a dream last night that i forgot i was taking another class and i was missing deadlines. So, my fear is that i am missing deadlines when there are no reminders and no one with whom i can discuss the content",

Then for the rest of the week I wake up and look at my sheet of paper and know what has to get done :)",

Not a google calendar but a planner.  So you dont only put in the due dates, but also block out time to do the things.  One of the things in my planner is to do over everything on Monday morning and make sure all my dates are right and everything is in my planner.\n\nSounds old school but believe me it works and it is such a stress relief.",

Whether that's really true, I don't know. I continue to send out reminder announcements 2x/week for my smaller classes, but I've tried to avoid it in larger ones.",

Plus, depending on the prof, updates might come sporadically so it very quickly begins to feel like one must be constantly on the lookout for updates or information.\n\nIn person with regular reminders as OP referenced is very regular, as in you get them at the same time every week consistently. There aren't any 1AM emails full of crucial information for one's success in the course.",

I relied so heavily on them and not having them has been extremely detrimental to my academic performance.  \n\nIt also doesn't help that professors are using a million different websites for assignments, homework, and tests.

Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing by ghosting during class. YOU ARE A JERK. And if I try the same behavior you finally get how I feel. It\u2019s AWFUL teaching to a blank screen.
