  "text": "I always hear stereotypes about majors (usually CS/Engineering being either a) antisocial nerds or b) reaaally douchey about their intelligence and Business and co. being dumb/not doing any work) and I'm curious, have you seen these stereotypes in the wild? Of course they don't apply to everyone but im curious if you've seen anybody be the spitting image of their stereotypical major",
