What a scam. They offer a baseline here of $7.25/hr. I increased the wage for our student hourlies a few dollars in my dept. but it's still so low.\n\nI also learned that federal work-study students have a large percentage of their wages covered by the government so I don't understand how there isn't any room in the budget to pay students more. I haven't seen this topic discussed much even amongst the student population at my school and I think it deserves some attention. Work-study is supposed to help \"pay for tuition and living expenses\" but this has to be a joke of an idea at such a low wage.", "author": "housepunny", "created": 1632267350, "retrieved": 1632946632, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hegz0f2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psv0s3/how_are_the_student_hourly_wages_at_your_school/hegz0f2/", "text": "Mine pays $10/hr.
