  "text": "I'm the captain of my school's club lacrosse team, and there's only one other club team in the area. My club is new and all funded and run by students while the other one gets university money, so they're the only team we can afford to play due to their proximity. However their club officers have been extremely shitty about responding to my emails, and will either respond a whole week later or not all despite expressing some interest in playing a game. I can't give up because I don't want to let the other guys down, and I'm trying my hardest to control myself. I even got one of their phone numbers but this guy ignores texts apparently. What do I do?",
