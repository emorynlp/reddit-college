  "text": "Hi! So I'm technically the equivalent of a highschool junior (I got my GED equivalent shortly after turning 16, but I'm continuing the four hs years) and am currently finishing up my actual grad reqs through my local college as a full time student. Now, I'm historically a high achiever and have had straight A's or close-to throughout my entire weird college/highschool fusion career. . . until *enter this semester*. I was sick for about a month with bronchitis and have been dealing with relapsing depression on top of that so now it's looking like I'll be ending this semester with a drastically lower gpa than usual.\n\nSo, if you can spare a moment, oh mighty council of college kids, any advice on how to remedy or compensate for this? Whether it's just mentality stuff or actively barging into my profs office hours and asking for extra credit assignments, go wild :')",
