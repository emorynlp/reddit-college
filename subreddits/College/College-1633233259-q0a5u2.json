  "text": "So I\u2019m transferring from my community college to a 4 year university and I\u2019m requesting my official transcript and the transfer acceptance rate is about 45.04%. \nMy grades have been fairly good at community college I had either A\u2019s or B\u2019s (there\u2019s no negative or plus letter grades btw) but my last semester in spring wasn\u2019t the best due to some family issues so I only was part time last semester and got two c\u2019s and a B and it brought my gpa from a 3.6 to a 3.4 so I\u2019m not sure if I should send my transcript immediately and more spots open and could get an answer right away and more likely to be accepting by applying early or if I should wait for my fall grades to be in so they could see improvement but the deadline for this school for the spring semester is 12/01/2021 and grades come out in Christmas for my school so would I be risking it ??? I\u2019m a bit paranoid as you can see",
