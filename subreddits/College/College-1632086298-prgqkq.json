In the past I've explored majors and I like psychology and am interested in doing I/O psychology. I'm just having some reservations because of the fact that I don't wanna put myself too behind and I'm not 100% if any courses overlap. I'm just on this subreddit seeking advice on how I should approach this. I also want to know if a psych degree is really considered \"useless\".

One of my friends has their bachelor in psychology and then their masters is in mental health. Another has bachelor in psychology and master in behavioral therapy. Another has bachelor in psychology and masters in school psychology. So if you are going into psychology, at least in my area, you definitely need a masters to choose a career path. I would only consider it useless if you don\u2019t continue into grad school.
