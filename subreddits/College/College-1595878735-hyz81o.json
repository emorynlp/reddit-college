Maybe not. \n\nSo my professor ended up contracting COVID-19 and disappeared. With about 2 weeks left in our accelerated 6-week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn 6 chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A1 and now need to take class A2) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. \n\nSo here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its 100% online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. \n\nLife happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass. \n\nPS: fuck you COVID ...you are really screwing up my graduation timeline and everyone hates you", "author": "yUmmmmmie", "created": 1595878735, "retrieved": 1632947245, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1303, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fzj5j8n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hyz81o/update_prof_has_covid_and_disappeared_after_the/fzj5j8n/", "text": "I guess your professor won't be using 5G anymore", "author": "jlin02", "created": 1595957049, "upvotes": 1}, "fziuonm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hyz81o/update_prof_has_covid_and_disappeared_after_the/fziuonm/", "text": "So glad to hear that your professor is all right now and that you did well in the class. \n\nFWIW, the advice you give is good even in a non-COVID life.
