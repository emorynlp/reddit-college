  "title:": "UPDATE: Prof has COVID and disappeared after the first week of class...",
  "text": "Some of you asked so here it is .... the big update!\n\nFirst - if you end up in a situation as I did in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gzw2lb/prof_has_covid_and_disappeared_after_the_first/ftioerr/?context=3), this may be helpful info. Maybe not. \n\nSo my professor ended up contracting COVID-19 and disappeared. With about 2 weeks left in our accelerated 6-week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn 6 chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A1 and now need to take class A2) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. \n\nSo here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its 100% online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. \n\nLife happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass. \n\nPS: fuck you COVID ...you are really screwing up my graduation timeline and everyone hates you",

Most of the institutions I work at don't have any kind of formal subbing system in place. You just teach through illness or cancel class and don't tell anyone. Only the CC where I worked had strict guidelines around subs and offered high hourly pay to sub in for someone's classes.\n\nAlso, there's a good chance your prof is an adjunct, or a part-time teacher, and would have been fired if it had become known he was sick. Adjuncts often piece together teaching classes at several colleges or other part-time jobs to make ends meet. Your prof could've been out thousands of much-needed dollars if he'd let anyone know he was sick.\n\nI agree it's a fucked up system. Colleges have been broke-ass since the '90s at least.",

They generally have no benefits, health insurance, or other employment guarantees.\n\nThus, if you can't teach a large part of the class you signed up for, it'll be given to another adjunct (or full-time employee) and you won't be paid. Getting assigned classes every term is up to the whims of the department and enrollment. If you're seen as someone too \"unreliable\" to teach or make back-up plans if you fall ill, it's unlikely you'll receive future class assignments.\n\nIf this seems crazy to you, it's quite common. Over sixty percent of your college classes are taught by adjuncts nationwide. \n\nI was in a faculty meeting recently where our HR director was answering questions. An adjunct asked her directly if adjuncts would still receive full compensation for their courses if they got COVID. After a massive pause, the HR director said, \n\n\"I expect we'll be able to do that.\"\n\nThe adjunct said, \"You expect to, or you will?\"\n\nShe eventually capitulated and said that they would \"honor the contracts,\" but that raised even more red flags to me--those contracts haven't gone out yet, so it would be all too easy for them to add a cute clause exempting adjuncts from pay in the event of COVID.",

We're talking some of the most competitive jobs on the planet.\n\nThere's a lot more to say, but here's a start.

                                  "text": "Whoops! That's what I get for writing in haste. Thank you for the correction. \n\nI'll own that my instinct about adjuncts and teaching is anecdotal. At the same time, there truly is no reason to adjunct aside from a love of teaching, whereas TT faculty have more varied demands on their time, more personal reasons for working (research, the expectation of promotion), and receive better pay and benefits. I think, on the whole, the academic system produces more experienced and devoted teachers among adjuncts. My opinion.\n\nI've certainly met FT faculty that \"had it all,\" but I find them uncommon. Because that's hard work!\n\nI like to impress upon students that an instructor's level (adjunct, NTT, TT) has little bearing upon their teaching skill. Students come from high schools where teachers are employed to teach and must have the requisite education credentials, so I think they're surprised to find that colleges function differently and don't require any kind of formal teaching training. I've worked at one school for 4 years and have never been officially observed (they actually refuse to observe), and the other 3 schools I've worked at have required similarly minimal classroom observations--once a year, optimistically. These are well-known R1 and R2 state and private institutions. \n\nI often joke with the students that professors could be teaching them to make meth and no one would ever know. The lack of regular oversight with regards to teaching quality is absurd. The institution where I work full-time is gearing up for reaccreditation (that's like renewing your license for a college, for students reading this) and I discovered that many teured instructors don't know the difference between a prompt and a rubric and have never used a rubric. Students say that they turn in papers and never receive written feedback on them, just grades at the end of the term. I work in the college writing center and collaborate closely with these professors, and have seen this behavior first-hand. \n\nI'd ask, \"What are students paying for, if not the opportunity to learn through a skilled instructor?\" but we already know the answer. \n\nSince faculty are often hired for their research chops, not teaching skill, and especially when there's uneven teaching requirements for any academic position across universities, I regret when students are upset that the famous Professor X at Y R1 school turns out to be a less-than-passionate teacher. I want them to understand the college education system and how to navigate teacher bios and take classes with the instructors that fit their needs. Maybe they work with Prof X in a lab, but take their lecture with another instructor. Maybe they set their schedule to take a tough organic chemistry class with the better of two lecturers and then pick randomly among instructors for a language requirement because they're already a native Spanish speaker. This is the kind of intentional thinking I rarely see students use when it comes to shaping their college experience because they generally can't pick their high school teachers and assume things will be the same in college.\n\nI wish colleges could be a de facto supportive learning environment, but they're not. With a bit of savvy, though, I think students can still manage to have a worthwhile experience.\n\nThis discussion entirely excludes community colleges, which are a different (and awesome) beast altogether.",

State comprehensive schools (predominantly undergrad) and liberal arts colleges are very different than what you describe.

Whenever there's a budget cut (or now, because of COVID) the administration likes to remind faculty that there are \"emergency provisions\" in contract language that allow faculty to be fired at-will for the good of the college. What defines an \"emergency\" seems up to the whims of admin. \n\n>  The first full-time equivalent to NTT in many other countries is a permanent job with roughly the same protections as tenure.\n\nHere, I've seen most NTT faculty work on a contract basis. They work for 3-4 years and then have to in effect \"reapply\" for their job. Most often it's assumed the contract will be renewed (unless you've messed up in some way) but I've seen more and more of my colleagues kicked out suddenly due to budget constraints. It's not truly a permanent position. \n\nYeah. It's all insane. I'm not trying to be strident about it, but I'm also tired of pretending this system is justifiable. It's been broken for decades and needs to change.",

Two FT faculty members joyfully volunteered. I provided them with all printed materials and detailed lesson plans.\n\nWhen I got back, my students were in uproar. Neither of the subs had touched my lesson plans. Apparently they'd just come into the room and talked for an hour and sort of made it up? My carefully copied materials had even been returned to my mailbox, untouched.\n\nIn my 10 years of experience of college teaching, subs have never worked out well.",

We both teach 4-6 unique courses and a similar number of hours per week, often falling during the same timeslots. I've taught most of the courses he teaches, but he hasn't taught any I teach. If he falls ill I'll do my best to keep the students on track, but I can't ask him to do the same for me. As a college, the general plan if an instructor falls ill is either to have another faculty member lend a hand if possible, or just expect the sick faculty to teach remotely through their illness. I've confirmed that this may mean cancelling a week or two of class before the instructor is well enough to resume instruction remotely. There's really nothing else that can be done in some cases; colleges refuse to hire enough faculty to even comfortably cover normal course loads, let alone having enough to help substitute under circumstances like this.",
