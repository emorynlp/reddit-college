  "text": "I am 21 and I had to drop out of school in 2020 because I couldn\u2019t afford it. Now, I am wanting to pursue my bachelors, but I work 5 hours a day Mon-Sat (11:30-4:30). I am the only employee at my office, so my hours are not flexible. I also can not quit or move.\nThe closest university to me is an hour away and I\u2019d need to do some in person classes to qualify for scholarships. Some can be online, though.\nI am worried that I\u2019m going to be putting too much on my plate if I do this, but I\u2019ve always been motivated and done good under stress. I want this for myself, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s realistic. Do you have any advice for doing this, or do you think this is an unrealistic goal?",
