  "title:": "Should I pursue in Computer Science major even though my passion is art (concept art/digital art) ?",
  "text": "I have always been passionate about drawing and games but I don't come from a well-off family, people have been telling me to just pursue what I love but it isn't realistic because of the financial status I'm in and the art industry here doesn't pay well and there's a high chance where I won't be able to pay off my study loan after graduating.\n\nHowever, I am good with Mathematics, I even work as a private tutor teaching high school mathematics and have a foundation in the engineering stream before, I had to drop out from my first year because I struggled to keep myself up with Physics and Chemistry, my brain doesn't work well with science.\n\nWould it be realistic enough for me to major in Computer Science with a specialization in Game Development in my situation, and perhaps doing art on the side with my free time? As far as I know CS major would bring in a stable career and better pay. I am just worried if I am making a mistake majoring in CS even though my passion is art. I really need some advice on this and would appreciate any kind of comments.",

I think your thinking is in the right path. Major in cs, get a stable job, and use that money for art. Because art is damn expensive. Good luck :) don\u2019t stress out too much",

      "text": "I might cross post to /r/CScareerquestions (or game dev / art specific sub) and /r/ArtistLounge as both tend to get us a degree worth it questions.\n\nMy immediate guess would be CS with possible art minor / dual major, try to get a co-op and be artist on a game jam game, graduate with a decent portfolio, look at YouTube for portfolio flip throughs.\n\nMy warning with this is it would likely extend your degree by like a year, due to co-op and extra classes and both are very project heavy degrees.\n\nI know game dev is notoriously full of overtime, but that seems to be slowly changing and also unsure how that effects say modelers but might make art on the side hard. That being said everyone I know who went pure art either took an office job that didn't 100% need a degree (insurance underwriting kinda stuff) or spent eons trying to get a job in like a museum for low pay. \n\nI'd also suggest if nothing else, taking some life drawing classes. Either in school or at your local gallery. It helps.\n\nAlso personally, I don't think you need to work in your passion. That's kinda bull, it's a 9-5. You gotta like the work in a general term, and enjoying the topic helps, but I didn't have a \"passion\" for fixing financial issues at the insurance company I was at. I just enjoyed B2B incoming calls only, being able to email people back, and a little bit of going wait how would a computer file this horribly labeled payment...",
