It was terrible, and I don\u2019t want to make the same mistake again. \n\nAfter extensive research and numerous phone calls/emails, I\u2019ve narrowed down my transfer to two universities:\n\n- Bellevue University \n- Maryville University\n\nThey both appear to have good Math programs, and I spoke right the director of the Math Major at Bellevue earlier today. I have a meeting with Maryville\u2019s director later this week. \n\nHas anyone attended these schools? I would love to hear people\u2019s experiences as I make my final decision. \n\nMaryville has 8-week semesters, which I think could be very intense, but the curriculum is very good. \n\nBellevue has 12-week semesters, and the curriculum is OK.\n\nIf anyone has attended either school I would love to hear about your experiences.
