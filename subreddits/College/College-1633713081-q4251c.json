  "text": "I regularly reach out to random strangers online via a variety of channels (Email, Linkedin, Twitter, Reddit \u2014 to name a few).\n\n**I do this for a few reasons:**\n\n* To learn from someone new\n* To make a connection in a new industry or business\n* To pitch a partnership or service\n* To form an introduction\n* To make a new friend\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly, I\u2019d attribute a lot of career success to my ability to \u2018network\u2019 and form new relationships with folks over the internet.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: ***it\u2019s not super intuitive.***\n\nWhen I first started, I was *way* too lengthy with my emails and would lose my ability to capture someone\u2019s attention. Other folks are too brief, which may come across as overly direct and discourteous\n\nIt\u2019s an art form that takes a bit of trial and error.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past *six years* honing this skill by sending out thousands of emails and messages to peeps on every online platform imaginable.\n\nAnd as a result, I\u2019ve made quite a few connections and formed deep relationships with people that I now call close friends, mentors, and mentees.\n\n**I\u2019ll sum up the elements of an effective cold outreach into 5 rules:**\n\n>**Introduce Yourself, Briefly** \u2014 how would you describe (and sell) yourself in one or two sentences?  \n**Give Specific Praise** \u2014 provide genuine praise and mean it.  \n**Demonstrate Value** \u2014 not always needed, but often helpful to signal the value you bring to the table.  \n**Show Appreciation** \u2014 an authentic \u2018thank you\u2019 is always nice. And remember, there are multiple ways to say thank you.  \n**Have A Clear Ask** \u2014 be direct and specific on what you\u2019re asking for.\n\n95% of cold outreaches can be done with the existing formula above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Here\u2019s how it works in action:\n\nI\u2019ve included a sample of a recent cold email I sent out to a writer and tech executive, that converted into a chat.\n\nHi \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,\n\n###### INTRODUCE YOURSELF, BRIEFLY\n\n>A bit about myself: I\u2019m a Business Planning & Operations Lead at \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ based out of New York City. Our team is focused on improving the performance of our global sales teams.\n\n###### GIVE SPECIFIC PRAISE\n\n>I\u2019m a big fan of your writing on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ . My favorite articles are \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I also closely follow \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, and I think you\u2019re all best-in-class writers who are great are evoking emotion, passion, and conviction via writing.  \nInspired by your thoughts, I started journaling, writing, and sharing my thoughts publicly on growth, productivity, and performance.\n\n###### DEMONSTRATE VALUE\n\n>A few months later, by diving into different growth-hacking and audience building rabbit holes, I\u2019ve grown my newsletter\u00a0[**Musings & Perspectives**](https://www.andrew.today/) to 1,400 readers.\n\n###### SHOW APPRECIATION\n\n>I would\u2019ve never gotten started if it wasn\u2019t for your spiel on writing. Thank you!\n\n###### HAVE A CLEAR ASK\n\n>**If you have 20 minutes to chat in the coming weeks, I\u2019d love to ask you a few questions**\u00a0on your career journey (principles, habits, investments), your writing process \u2014 how you\u2019ve optimized it, and what you\u2019re currently focused on today.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nThis example is for a virtual chat, but the same principles apply for other asks as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI write more on tools, frameworks, and tricks to improve your business performance at [Musings & Perspectives](https://www.andrew.today/about).",
