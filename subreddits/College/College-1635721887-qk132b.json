  "text": "Hello all, I have enrolled in a graduate program in a community college in Canada. I\u2019m not sure whether to get a room in campus or find an accommodation somewhere in the city. I\u2019m a very social person but I\u2019m worried about being surrounded by teenagers if I decided to stay in campus. I would rather have a place off-campus but in this case I won\u2019t be able to meet other students or make some friends since I know no one this city. Any advice on how to decide?",
