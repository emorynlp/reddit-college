  "text": "my confidence and motivation has plummeted since finding out colleges will ask for an explanation for the gap in my education. i graduated hs in 2018 and took a gap year while taking a couple classes at my local community college (got an A, B, and W). then found out that i would have to finish 2 years at community college before i could transfer to a different college. so i started 4 more classes fall 2019 but withdrew after my mom passed away in september. i planned on starting classes back up in spring \u201820, but of course covid hit so all classes were online. I did my senior year of high school online (mental health reasons) so I know from experience that I do not learn, am not motivated, and overall just do worse in online classes. so, i figured i would wait for them to be in person again. in the mean time, i\u2019ve been taking care of my younger sister (who is in hs) since my dad decided to move to a different state after my mom passed, and we stayed here. i am fortunate enough that i didn\u2019t have to worry about getting a job during the pandemic (and so grateful for that), but now i have this huge gap in education that colleges will want an explanation for. i do not want to bring this pity party into my transfer apps, so how do i explain the gap? is there even hope that I will be able to transfer to a good school (UC Berkeley is my dream but I\u2019d be grateful for any UC) with that big of a gap in my education, as well as the 5 W\u2019s on my transcript? not that it matters anymore but I got a 3.6 or 3.7 unweighted gpa in hs and 35 ACT.",

You had a lot of setbacks that just let to a negative educational experience and situation. It happens.",
