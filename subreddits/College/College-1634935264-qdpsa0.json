  "text": "My transcripts are being held because I can't pay the amount they want to remove the hold. I want to transfer to a free college and finish my bachelor degree. (I had to drop out of my old one years ago because there was a mistake with my student loans that caused a gap, and I couldn't afford to pay out of pocket.) But they need a transcript. It looks like the only way is to declare bankruptcy to get the hold removed, but that's too extreme and I don't want to. Any advice? They said they would release it to an employer if they need it to hire me, but obviously I don't have one.",
