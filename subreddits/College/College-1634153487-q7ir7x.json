  "title:": "I'm so sick of Zoom breakout rooms",
  "text": "This semester all of my courses are online. In one of my courses (has about 20 people) the instructor keeps putting us into breakout rooms. Most students are extremely shy to the point of being rude and  negatively impacting my performance on group works. I'm an introvert too and I have social anxiety yet I don't slack when I'm put in a breakout room and given an assignment. Although I'm introverted I'm not shy, at least not in class. I always try to encourage others to speak up and make sure to be inclusive. I kindly greet them, ask about their day, make a few jokes to break the ice. Today we had a group of 4 and were supposed to discuss/compare 3 texts and summarize each one. We only had 20 minutes and my peers didn't even respond to my multiple \"hello\"s for the first 10 minutes. I ended up doing the whole assignment for the group. This happens all the time and I'm sick of it. I don't like small talk either but I force myself to be more outgoing and make contributions since it affects my academic performance. I'm thinking about talking with my instructor and telling her the issues I'm having with breakout rooms, should I go through with it?",
