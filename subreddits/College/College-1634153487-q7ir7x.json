  "title:": "I'm so sick of Zoom breakout rooms",
  "text": "This semester all of my courses are online. In one of my courses (has about 20 people) the instructor keeps putting us into breakout rooms. Most students are extremely shy to the point of being rude and  negatively impacting my performance on group works. I'm an introvert too and I have social anxiety yet I don't slack when I'm put in a breakout room and given an assignment. Although I'm introverted I'm not shy, at least not in class. I always try to encourage others to speak up and make sure to be inclusive. I kindly greet them, ask about their day, make a few jokes to break the ice. Today we had a group of 4 and were supposed to discuss/compare 3 texts and summarize each one. We only had 20 minutes and my peers didn't even respond to my multiple \"hello\"s for the first 10 minutes. I ended up doing the whole assignment for the group. This happens all the time and I'm sick of it. I don't like small talk either but I force myself to be more outgoing and make contributions since it affects my academic performance. I'm thinking about talking with my instructor and telling her the issues I'm having with breakout rooms, should I go through with it?",

When we were online and I used breakout rooms, I would constantly rotate through them every 2-3 minutes, sometimes getting in on the conversation and sometimes just listening. \n\nBut I think my regular presence signaled to my students that these weren't just time fillers but an important part of the learning process so they generally all actively participated, even the ones I knew were shy or had anxiety etc. \n\nIf the instructor isn't participating and just uses group work as filler, which many sadly do, the results are bound to be awful.",

The rest of the time should be used to flesh out what came from that time and supplement it further.\n\nSadly some instructors are just not good, and find ways to try to hide it. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt that she just can't figure out how to teach online effectively, but there are so many helpful resources.\n\nSometimes you just get a stinker. I had a few in college, and in grad school. Maybe change sections if you're still interested in the course.",

I get panic attacks in crowded areas or my body just goes into fight or flight mode when I'm meeting new people. Obviously everyone has different experiences, I understand and respect that. I just find it hard to believe that 20 people are dealing with severe social anxiety and panic attacks that hinders their participation in breakout rooms. People are either the former or they simply don't care.",
