  "text": "I graduate this December, a semester early with my Bachelors in Sociology, and minors in Business Administration and Communication. I know I should be excited but I feel so lost and confused. For starters, I had a really rough college start, with a lot of family issues and mental health concerns. My first year I did so terrible, I don't think my GPA will ever recover. Currently, I'm at a 2.7 and I think the best I can get it up to is a 2.8. I'm taking a gap year to study for my LSAT because I want to go to law school but I feel like with a GPA this low I really won't get in anywhere good. I'm interested in the tech industry too, like UX/UI and digital marketing, but I don't know how to approach that either. I feel like I spent 3 1/2 years wasting my parents money and didn't accomplish anything. I'll take anything you guys give me, advice, comments, suggestions. I feel so lost.",

      "text": "I suggest you think long and hard about the law school plan. The job market for new lawyers is still very competitive, and you are right to assume you won't be able to get into a prestigious school. If you attend a lower ranked law school and take out student loan debt to pay for it, that's a serious gamble that might not pay off.\n\nIf you were my friend and asking for advice, I'd tell you to apply for jobs in marketing and marketing-adjacent fields, and see whether you like that kind of work. Alternatively, consider becoming a paralegal so you can work in that field for a while and better assess whether you really want to be a lawyer.",
