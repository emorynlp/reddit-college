  "title:": "\"Supportive\" Professors that don't respond to emails.",
  "text": "Not exactly sure what to title this because I do genuinely love my professor and I am very sorry to have to drop the class but I am out of options. So recently I secured a full-time job at my college. This job is an answered prayer and comes with great benefits. However, the process of securing this job has been long and drawn out and distracted a lot of my attention from my classes. I knew that I was going to be stretched too thin with my new hours so I spoke with my professor last Wednesday one-on-one explaining to her my situation and how I was very stressed and upset at the fact that withdrawing might be my best option. She was incredibly reassuring and comforting, offering to work with my hours and even do some one-on-one zoom calls with me after work for the next few weeks, if I still felt like leaving I could. This was great news to me and gave me the motivation and encouragement I needed. Sadly though, after our zoom call about that, I tried emailing her multiple times to discuss our plan of action and was left hanging for the next week. It is now midterms week and the deadline to withdraw is creeping very close. I am very upset and honestly disappointed in my professor. She is amazing but I don't understand why she spoke of these big plans then left me hanging just the same as I was before. I don't know what to think of her now and honestly feel very distraught over the whole situation. Any advice on emailing professors when this thing happens? I feel very lost right now.",

Also, just to double check, are you using your school email? Are you certain you\u2019re sending them to the right address? If yes to both, then does she have an office phone you could call during regular hours?",
