  "text": "I'm debating whether I should drop my college pub application, I just got into the interview and there are still no results. Do you think it would benefit me in the long run? I am someone who likes to read and to write, a student journalist from 6th grade until I graduated highschool, however, I am someone who doesn't really like to deal with conflict and current affairs. I'm worrying if I'd be able to commit with juggling other orgs I'm handling outside uni, part time job and the load of the course I'm taking. My program is technology communication management by the way.",
