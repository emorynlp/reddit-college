  "text": "So I\u2019m contemplating different colleges to transfer to and honestly I want to be independent and move to a state away from my current friends and family. I\u2019m a social person who\u2019s relatively good at making new friends but it still worries/excites me to move somewhere that I have to start from scratch since I haven\u2019t had to completely rebuild my social network like this before. How did some of you do with the adjustment and did you have an ok time meeting new people?",
