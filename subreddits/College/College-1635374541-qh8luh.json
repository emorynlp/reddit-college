If you truly did nothing wrong, then there is no reason to worry.\n\nSecond, respond to the email or the respective superior about the situation and ask for clarification. If the email was as vague as \"You have been suspected/found of academic dishonesty.\" then you should get more details on the specifics.\n\nThird, something like this should not encourage you to drop out. I suspect there may be other factors towards that decision, but this small mistake should not be one.\n\nHope that helps, be sure to get details asap.",
