  "text": "I\u2019m curious to know you all\u2019s opinion on this. Something has happened that is really effecting my mental health so I went home for the weekend and my parents know about what happened but they are adamant that I need to put what happened to me behind me and just study for my exam I have on Tuesday. I literally can\u2019t. I\u2019m already upset to the point of thinking about s****** and the only thing they have to say is for me to study. It\u2019s super hurtful and makes me feel invalid for feeling what I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m so tired of this. I know for a fact that trying to study is just gonna push me over the edge. I can\u2019t do this.",

Also, you might want to look into if your uni offers counseling/therapy, especially if you're considering s******. I hope whatever is causing you stress comes to pass. Take a deep breath. You can get through this. Asking for help doesn't make you weak, but it can make you stronger than ever.",
