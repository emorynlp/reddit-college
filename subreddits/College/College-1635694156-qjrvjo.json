  "text": "Halloweekend, people out getting blasted Friday nights, Saturday nights, pregaming showing up blasted to games\u2026 that was something I gave a lot of shits about in my freshman year, but I\u2019m a junior now and I just have stopped caring about those things.\n\nLike two years ago I was a freshman and used to wanna be out till 4am at parties and now I\u2019m a junior and it\u2019s Friday night sometimes and I just wanna be inside reading a good book or sleeping early. My friends circle has changed too, used to go out a lot with these group of guys but now they live that lifestyle still which I just feel like I have out grown and now I just hang out with these other 4 guys where we just sit and talk over a beer or something or going out in the city for a walk or for dinner. \n\nIt\u2019s weird but I feel like I\u2019ve just outgrown the college experience and over-matured compared to my peers where now i just  want to focus on getting my life together as a man while still having the company of people.\n\nI just lost that energy and drive to be out partying and living that lifestyle and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good sign or not. I\u2019m preferring a more lowkey social environment rather than these flashy lights loud music party scenes from freshman year and I just feel, well, old.",

      "text": "It's pretty normal, but as you've found, people reach that stage at different ages. I think it has a lot to do with how much freedom you had as a teenager and how many years of \"wild living\" you've had. Someone who goes through all of high school being very straight-laced might take all of college and a few years after that before they get sick of the regular-hard-partying scene (or maybe they never get sick of it). Sometimes people avoid partying until their later college years so they'll stick with it longer too once they start. I think it can be very hard on them when they want to keep partying but all of their peers want quieter evenings. \n\nOne of my friends is like this. He was a proper nerd all through school and university, and now he's interested in partying but he's a math PhD and few of his peers have the same interest. \n\nFor me, I was a hard partier by 17 so at 25 I'm now well and truly over it. I can go to a bar or club whenever I want, I just no longer want to. Also, hangovers and drinking in general gets less enjoyable as your body ages and as you get used to drinking less. I don't drink at all anymore, but a single beer is enough for my partner (24) and 2 beers has him feeling bleh.\n\n>I just feel, well, old.\n\n[ETA] I say you're 'officially' old when you get excited over buying 'boring' things like new plates, or socks, or a clothes airer. My best purchase this year has been a little cable organiser thing to stick on the side table next to the bed, so I don't have to scrabble around the floor looking for my phone charger.",

I\u2019ve had a lot more experience with people who stay in shaming those who go out them I do people going out and shaming those who stay in. \n\nPersonally I stayed in and had small gatherings with minimal alcohol until I turned 21, then I drank every weekend the last six weeks of my junior year, I never did the fake ID thing, and wasn\u2019t huge into house parties. It wasn\u2019t until my senior year I found a good balance for myself and realized neither activity is inherently bad, it\u2019s possible to get tired of both if you over do it.",
