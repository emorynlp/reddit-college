  "text": "I\u2019m (19M) currently a junior at a small liberal arts college, and I\u2019m hoping to get some advice on having some sort of social life.\n\nI\u2019m pretty lonely at the moment, and I feel as though I\u2019m missing out on many aspects of the college experience (parties, dating, etc). I don\u2019t want to graduate and just go right to work having missed out on these experiences.\n\nAs I\u2019m in a program that\u2019ll give me a  degree without much of a job prospect, I have two side jobs in my interests to help me find a job after I graduate. My time is basically spent now on my full class load, working 20-30 hours a week and being in my room to eat or relax. \n\nDoes anyone have ideas on how I could meet new people?",
