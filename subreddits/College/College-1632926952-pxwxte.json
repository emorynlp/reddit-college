  "text": "\nHey all, I'm looking for advice.\n\nI'm a Junior currently living in a 2br/1bth apartment on off campus student housing (that is not through the school). Things have been weird with him since the very beginning as we're just polar opposites. We keep to ourselves and our common area is clean and our interactions have always been respectful and normal. Two weeks ago he approached me (with my girlfriend present) and stated that \"My brother is homeless as of recently and he has no place to stay so he's going to sleep out in the living room for two weeks\". He was not asking me, instead he was telling me in front of my girlfriend. I discussed it with him and stated I would not be comfortable with his brother living with us. Fast forward to today, and he gives me a short notice that his brother will be living in his room for the next two weeks, with absolutely no warning. I'm in the kitchen cooking food with my girlfriend and he's trying to talk to me about other things and referencing his brother and I dismiss him telling him I'm going to speak to him about it later. He drops the conversation and goes out. A little while passes by and his brother and him pass me in our hallway, and neither of them say anything. I am absolutely livid. I have already told him how I felt about this situation and he does this?\n\nOur apartment has a guest policy stating that nobody is allowed to spend more than 3 nights in a row, and for a total of 6 nights in a month. \n\nMy girlfriend drives down from her state and stays a few days with me. I've talked with my roommate before when I first moved in and he told me he had no issue with my girlfriend spending multiple nights with me. She's always with me, and we're never outside the room unless we're out making food or putting groceries away. We spend all of our time in my room or out of my apartment doing whatever. \n\nIf I'm to go to the leasing office, I'm afraid that I'll lose out on having my girlfriend stay with me every weekend and cause further turmoil with my roommate. If I do nothing, it is highly likely this two week stay is going to extend into a much longer time period. \n\nCan anyone offer some advice?",

      "text": "Look, I totally get where you're coming from. Your roommate was super uncool about this and moving him in after you guys had discussed this and you had said you're not okay with it was a total jerk move. However, there's not a lot you can do about it unless you're going to personally adhere to those guidelines yourself. You know what's going to happen if you bring it up and fight him on it because you're also breaking those guidelines. Yes he verbally agreed prior, but that's not a contract. Unless you can change the way your girlfriend visits and adhere to the guidelines yourself, I recommend waiting out the two weeks and seeing what happens.",

He\u2019s living in your roommates room. He\u2019s doing his best but family comes first, cut the guy some slack.",

I\u2019ve spoken to the office here and they\u2019ve mentioned the guest policy is only there if an issue occurs. It\u2019s dependent on what your roommate agrees to.",
