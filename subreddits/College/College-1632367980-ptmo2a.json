  "text": "Hey everyone I\u2019m 20(f) I\u2019ve been pretty stressed out and driving myself crazy and also sad about my situation. So it turns out I have to pay $7k every semester for school when I got my awkward later it seemed like everything would be covered but I guess I misunderstood. Anyway I already spend all my save money on fixing my car and other problems that would present all the time. My parents don\u2019t really want to help me pay for college or co-sign for a loan. I\u2019m going to school for aerospace engineering in New Hampshire and even though this wasn\u2019t my dream school it turned out to just be the ideal school for me. But now I can\u2019t stop stressing about how am I going to pay for school since I can\u2019t get a loan without a co-signer. I recently got a job at chipotle and work three days but it can be very tiring and it gets hella busy there. I have a lot of homework so now I\u2019m considering only working two days. Anyway the money still isn\u2019t enough to get $7k in four months which is what left of this semester. I really love this school and really want to have that mindset and will power to get things done and be hard working but damn I can\u2019t really enjoy anything and can\u2019t stop stressing and thinking about what\u2019s the best option. Am I going to be able to keep this up for all the four years plus working all summer and saving all the money for school ? Should I go to college community college ? I don\u2019t want to waste more time I took a gap year and also didn\u2019t do well my first year of college so basically still a freshman.",

      "text": "I went to a community college and got my Associates before transferring to a university. I definitely don\u2019t regret that decision because I transferred with no debt. Unfortunately I\u2019m not able to afford tuition at my university either, so I took out a loan with Sallie Mae and I pay monthly payments towards my loan to try and keep my financial situation under control while still putting money into my loan. I\u2019m 20 as well, I called to talk to them before applying and explained my situation and they were very helpful setting up a plan for me over the phone without a co-signer! I do have some credit built up from car payments and such, but they were able to talk me through the process since my parents didn\u2019t help. I would try to talk to your financial aid office as well and explain your situation, just in case they can do something to help. I wish you the best!",
