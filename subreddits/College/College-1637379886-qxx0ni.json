  "text": "I am a college freshman right now, and I feel terrible literally all of the time, especially on Friday nights like these.\n\nI never get invited to do anything, hang out, party, nothing. I have to be the one to ask people to hang out, and I am honestly just sick of it. I used to hang out with my suitemates a lot, but one of them I am pretty sure doesn\u2019t like me so I have decided to distance myself from them and that group, mainly because I feel awkward and like a burden anytime I am around them. I have other groups of \u2018friends\u2019, but one again, I feel like a burden asking anyone to hang out or do something. I sit alone many nights just crying in my room, wondering why nobody appreciates me. People generally tell me that I am cool dude to hang around, so I don\u2019t understand why I am so lonely on nights like these.\n\nI have gone through the horrors of contemplating suicide, because I sometimes feel like no would care and no one would miss me if I were gone. I know it\u2019s probably not true, but it\u2019s hard to not feel that way when no one hits you up to hang out or asks how you\u2019re doing. I feel hopeless and useless in this world much of the time. I want it to stop. I am posting on Reddit because I don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to, and even if I do, I would just feel like I was being a burden on them if I did.\n\nSomeone please tell me what I should do to fix this, I am on the absolute edge right now and I don\u2019t think I could take much more of it",

Big college parties are just loud music, annoying drunk people, it\u2019s not a place I find much satisfaction. Over time you\u2019ll find your people and you\u2019ll do things with them that are actually fun. Please don\u2019t feel like you aren\u2019t good enough for those parties, don\u2019t let that push you to the end. Those moments are glorified in pictures and you\u2019re not missing out on anything i\u2019d rather sit home with a pizza and drink with my best friend than go to a dumb party. And also as you get to meet people you\u2019ll be able to experience parties and see if you like them for your own. Rooting for you!",

My best advice would be to keep your circle small, most people you meet are/were never your actual friend. Feel free to PM me and we can definitely have a talk. But tbh man, parties are overrated. You\u2019re in college man, everyone gasses up the college experience. It\u2019s all bullshit, all those people partying are most likely doing the worst in college. You will never find a pre-med partying. If you care about your future, trust me, study in your free time, read a book, invest in yourself. Like I said feel free to PM me whenever.\n\nEdit: My sister passed away 2 years ago to drugs. She started off by going to parties and smokin weed, I haven\u2019t been to a party once in my life, I am 18 with solid ass friends and a GF. Don\u2019t let that party shit bring you down, What really helped my confidence and distracted me was working out, I would 100% recommend it.",

My issue is that I don\u2019t even get invited to casually hang out with people or go do anything fun. Like do people just not care about me? It makes me feel very sad and lonely to the point where I have thought about those dark thoughts. \n\nI guess I have never really told anyone how I feel but like I have said I don\u2019t wanna be some debbie downer to people telling them my real feelings",

It seems like you have major depressive disorder, so try getting a counselor and see a doctor about it.\n\nAdditionally, if you're not being invited to things, is there anything you can invite yourself too? Any clubs you are interested in? It's probably going to be hard to do so, but to be invited to things you kind of need to invite yourself first and find a group of friends you click with. For instance, I found a group that plays DnD, but I had to go to a club night first to be invited to that group.\n\nIt's hard, but hang in there. You can do it :)",

It\u2019s soooooo awkward at first but I made some pretty good friends/colleagues. I wish I had done that in my early days of college because it may have been easier for me then to not quit school or suffer from mental health issues. I was like 26 when I went back to school and still made some decent friends despite most being younger than me. Don\u2019t let yourself feel like a burden unless they tell you straight up they don\u2019t want you there. Sometimes our own mind can make us think things that aren\u2019t true. Hang out with you suite mates, just don\u2019t do it often so you don\u2019t feel weird. Try different clubs or organizations. Join some intramural sports if they have them. Just try anything and everything. Who knows you may find something you live along the way too.",

If you\u2019re feeling left out and contemplating suicide, going out and getting invited by people that don\u2019t care about you will only push those problems under the rug,  trust me partying or a social life doesn\u2019t make that go away. i know it may seem like loneliness of some sort is what is getting to you, but this is your brain telling you that you need to pay attention to yourself!!!!  overall once you put yourself first you will attract the right people and you will start to appreciate alone time as well. good luck and take care of yourself \ud83d\udc97\n\nplus i have totally been there. i have gone through self harm and attempted many times because i was convincing myself it was that loneliness was consuming me. the only reason i hated being alone so much was because i never prioritized myself and ignored all the signs my body was sending me. trust me when i say that being alone is sooo underrated and once you are able to be alone with yourself, you will end up with the people that make you feel that tou belong :)",

I later came to the self-realization that I'm on the spectrum? But seriously, don't buy into this \"college experience\" bs, which is that you have to party all the time and hang out with people for the best time of your life. Remember that you should be there to study and get your degree. Once you graduate you will have a successful life and with money you will be able to buy whatever you want to make you happy. And please don't consider suicide all of this will blow over I'd recommend trying to talk to a therapist to get some help. Try to connect with people, but do it on your own terms and try to find good people that you get along with. Do you have any special interests?",
