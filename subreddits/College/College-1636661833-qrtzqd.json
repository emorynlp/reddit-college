  "text": "Got a class on political policymaking with respect to digitization (social media, broadband access, etc.) Professor is one of my favorites--funny, experienced--but he warned us at the beginning of the semester that he was going to, quote, \"be a hardass on this one\". Everyone was freaking out, we had people swapping ideas in a group chat and everything. It was a 10-something page paper, I poured my heart and soul into it and I was expected a B at the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter three weeks to almost a month after submitting, he finally gave us the grades back and **I GOT AN A !!!** High was 95, low was 64, I ended up with a 93 and I'm walkin on air. No submission comments for some reason, but hey I'll friggen take it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to share my happiness. Thank you for reading.",
