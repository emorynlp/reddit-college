      "text": "Workstudy jobs on campus can be good. I worked in academic advising with lots of random downtime in the middle of semesters, but not at the beginning or end of the semesters (class registration/students failing and needing help). I had friends who worked at the front desk of our campus bowling alley and they only worked hard on special discount days and weekends. Same with the bookstore. They worked their asses off on gameday, too, but otherwise would read/study at the counter. Bonus for on-campus jobs-- no commutes means more time to study.",
