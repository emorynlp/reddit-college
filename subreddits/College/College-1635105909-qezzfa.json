Docs does this automatically too. \n\nFuck them, don\u2019t feel bad about throwing them under the bus, they deserve it.",

Its one thing to half ass or not do work at all and that affects only your grade which is fine by all means, but then to do that and affect somebody elses grade and then try to take full credit is mind boggling.\n\nImagine spending 4 years of your life and thousands of dollars to pull off this kind of shit. Get the fuck outta here man.",

I went though a similar thing staying up til 3am... it's just fucking insane how they're ok with putting all the work on one person. \n\nAnd it's even worse when they don't even show any sort of appreciation to you for saving their asses. I'm sorry you had to go through this too.",

      "text": "I understand how you feel. I've been in the same situation for an entire semester full of group assignments before. \n\nI can't say anything in terms of practically solving the issue. The only solution is to do the assignment, tell the professor in an email/after class, and actively keep on the professor if they don't do anything. \n\nBut, I can say that you're not alone. Most groups mutually assume the leader to be the one who sent the Google Slides to everyone and, from there, no one does anything until the leader outlines all of their work or plainly writes it for them. It is quite annoying, but its the nature of college. \n\nEveryone wants to get a grade. No one wants to do the work. This is what any communication/political science class calls the \"Free Rider Dilemma.\" Someone will inevitably do work and take initiative...it is always just a manner of who bends first to do it. \n\nI hate group projects with a burning passion. It is the worst thing ever 2/3 times they happen. I'm sorry you had to be up that late. Ruins your night and the next day of work as well. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CARRY THE PRESENTATION WHEN IT HAPPENS BECAUSE IF YOUR GROUPMATES TALK, THEIR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE SHOWS AND EVERYONE LOSES THEIR GRADE :(\n\nman it sucks",

      "text": "You should absolutely approach your professor about this. I find it quite frequent that professors will state in their syllabus that students who do not do their work for a group project receive no credit, and will not have their name on the project. Regardless, if work was done through an online document editing service (like Google Docs), then it's very easy to see edit history. You could email your professor with a link to the shared document and they'll be able to see the edit history.",
