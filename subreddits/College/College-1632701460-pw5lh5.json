The more you practice speaking another language and piecing together the vocabulary and grammar that you do know the better you will become.\n\nFinally, it's okay to be wrong! Learning is HARD and if you aren't struggling you aren't learning. Make sure you are self testing yourself (flashcards, pretend test questions, conversations without notes) as often as possible.
