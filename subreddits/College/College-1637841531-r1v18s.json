  "text": "So i had a presentation in class today and i was like sleepy the whole day and in the last session of presentation, it was my turn to present idk what gotten into me.. like i was all red and a bit shaky and couldn't find any words to speak but i did complete it. I myself knew i didn't give a good presentation and when my professor said 'you should really work on your communication' i completely agreed. And then one of my friends came to me and was like 'what were you singing like uh,uh!? Its not a big deal and sometimes friends make fun of you its okay but I can't stop thinking about how i was whole red in front of everybody. Its never been happened before to me i have given quite a few presentations. And its not like that i didn't knew my material, i knew but still.\nThis sucks tbh man",

      "text": "Try not to be too hard on yourself. I teach public speaking and almost everyone who presents manifests their speaking anxiety. Red faces, shaking voices and/or hands, talking very quickly, saying um/like/so are examples. \nEven as someone who teaches how to speak publicly, I get nervous too. My voice cracks and sometimes gets wobbly. \nTake this and learn from it. And know that your classmates have likely will forget about it.",
