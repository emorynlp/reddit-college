  "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first reddit post. I am a Freshmen in college.\n\nHere is the thing I went to this college back in 2019 for a semester but I then dropped out and took a year and a half off. I was not sure if I wanted to go to college so that is why I took the time off but I soon became miserable working these hourly waged jobs. I worked at Home Depot and Starbucks during that time off from school. I realized that this is not what I wanted to be doing so I reapplied to the same school I dropped out of and I am now back at college. \n\nI commute to school from my house (I live with my parents) and I actually really look forward to learning but I am always sad and lonely on the weekends because I do not go out. The thing is though I know people at this college from my first semester back in 2019 and they invite me to go out with them and hangout in general but I just don't really want to hangout with them or go out with them because I don't feel any connection with them really. They are nice people but I just don't connect with them like I have with friends in my past. They also just never seem that interested in talking. When I do hangout with them I try to talk but they all just sit around together on their phones and don't really listen or say anything. Its just not for me I guess. \n\nI feel lonely though because I just haven't really been hanging out with them as much and I see them all go out to parties and I feel left out even though I know I could just ask to go out with them and they would say yes. It may also be because I just don't understand everyone's love for drinking in college. Drinking is fun but there are better drugs to do besides drinking. I don't understand a lot of things about college I guess but I really do want to meet people and make real connections with people. I would enjoy drinking more I guess if I had a group of friends I felt a real connection with but I do not. I have been making an effort to meet people which I feel is good. I have joined clubs and I am pretty social and I think agreeable in general so I hope I make new friends and find my group of people.\n\nThanks to anyone who read this and I hope it was easy to read. I have often been told that when I write it is confusing. I hope this was the right place to post this. \n\nIf anyone could explain the love for drinking that most college kids have that would be great",

      "text": "I never was big drinker myself but in college I went to parties just to connect with people. Most of the times I would just have 1 or 2 drinks and then I would pretend to keep drinking alcohol.\n\nGetting drunk with people is just a lighthearted way to get to know them better. No need to party 3 times a week and get drunk till you pass out. Just have a drink or two, be there and connect with people.",
