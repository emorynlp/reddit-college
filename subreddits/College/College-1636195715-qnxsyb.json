  "text": "Hello! I've been attending APUS (American Public University System) for a little over a year now, I'm about half-way through my associates. I really like the school, the online format, and the professors I've had. It is, however, EXPENSIVE. I can transfer to a state school, but a lot of the courses I've taken won't apply to the degree offered by my state school and I'd essentially be restarting from scratch. When I do graduate, are employers looking for specific school, or do they just want to see you've graduated with some type of degree? I'm going for an associates right now, as that's all I can wrap my head around.",

      "text": "I don't think it matters as long as the university and program has the proper recognition by education boards. Well, in 90% of cases. Usually if you are in that 10% who needs a fancy school name due to working in a field like law or finance, you would know that without having to ask.\n\nI'd be more concerned about high cost, low graduation rate, and just the type of school you are attending right now. Not too familiar with it but a for-profit with lots of older students doesn't inspire much confidence from me.",
