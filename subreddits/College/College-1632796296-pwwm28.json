As we all know, everyone for as long as we can remember has said they wish they were a kid again, or something along those lines. I just don\u2019t want to adult if it\u2019s truly as miserable as everyone says it is. I will miss my family and my room and my dogs and my life. It\u2019s scary to think about how much change is about to come. Does anyone have any personal experience they are willing to share or tips/ advice. Also, I\u2019m mildly depressed and I deal with panic attacks often. I just don\u2019t want to face this.

I grew up in a strict household so it's amazing to be able to make my own choices. Obviously you have to be responsible and I'm not making reckless decisions, but this morning I just spontaneously decided to go for a walk and enjoy the sunrise and quiet morning and no one could tell me not to... it was beautiful.\n\nAs for missing things, you can call your family and visit home. (Missing pets is tough because you can't just call them on the phone... my cats are probably what I miss most). And you'll make friends wherever you head off to next so you'll have a new support system and social network before you know it.\n\nAs for mental health, I would reach out to the college's counseling center or try to find therapists on your insurance network in the area when you get to college. (Starting therapy is another decision I've been able to make now that I'm an adult, and let me tell you, it is great.)\n\nAnyway, I'm not super experienced as far as being an adult goes but I definitely don't think it's as bad as you think. Maybe it's just me but so far it just seems like there's way more freedom without many additional responsibilities or stresses.", "author": "91p348", "created": 1632798140, "upvotes": 1}, "heju0w6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwwm28/is_growing_up_as_devastating_as_i_think_it_is/heju0w6/", "text": "Ngl I feel like a kid with adult money.

I\u2019m 27, decent career, my own condo in SoCal, able to buy what ever I want (within my budget), a lot of vacation time to visit family/friends or to just sit at home and literally do nothing.
