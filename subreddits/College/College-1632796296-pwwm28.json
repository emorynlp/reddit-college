  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school and will be graduating in may. As we all know, everyone for as long as we can remember has said they wish they were a kid again, or something along those lines. I just don\u2019t want to adult if it\u2019s truly as miserable as everyone says it is. I will miss my family and my room and my dogs and my life. It\u2019s scary to think about how much change is about to come. Does anyone have any personal experience they are willing to share or tips/ advice. Also, I\u2019m mildly depressed and I deal with panic attacks often. I just don\u2019t want to face this. Help?",

      "text": "Honestly, it comes down to awareness. When you're an adult, you naturally have a level of awareness about life. You're aware of the responsibilities on your shoulders in a way that you'd never pay attention to as a kid. That can be mentally draining, but it can also be freeing.\n\nBeing a kid is easy. You go to school, you come home, you hang out with friends. There is nothing wrong with grieving the loss of a season of life; you'll do that many times across your lifespan, and not just over your age. Situations. Opportunities. Being an adult is harder - you're responsible for your actions and thoughts and decisions. But I promise you, as you become more confident in life, you'll find that being an adult is just as good.",

My advice?\n\nBe careful with your money. It\u2019s easy to swipe a card, but you\u2019re still spending it. Have fun, but don\u2019t go overboard. \n\nHave at least two healthy meals a day. Three is ideal, but not everyone has the time to do this. \n\nWhen you feel overwhelmed, there is NO shame in asking for help. Your professors, for the most part, understand that this can be a big transition. Send them an email if you\u2019re struggling. And if your university has a mental health counselor you can talk to, take advantage of it if you need it. There is NO shame in asking for help. Please remember this. \n\nAnd lastly, don\u2019t fall to peer pressure just to fit in. If something doesn\u2019t sound right, if you have any sense of \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d then don\u2019t do it. \n\nBut have fun in college!

But, only as long as you work a good job that pays great money and has good benefits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor 80% of other people, NGL, it is rough, especially if you have a lot of college debt.  All your money goes to rent and insurance, basic necessities, and debt service loans.  If you go to the hospital once, any savings are wiped out in a flash, and you may even go into medical debt, just for basic surgeries (and that is WITH insurance).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference in happiness level between myself who had nearly no debt, and got a solid job out of college, and the large portion of my friends with student loans and not great jobs is stark.  Of course everyone still has fun, but the overall lower-contentment and stress level with those burdens is high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake sure to put serious thought into your career path, and how much college will cost.  I recommend working a regular job, and going to CC to figure out for sure what you are good at for a low cost.  The WORST is 18-year-olds going into come crazy expensive 4 year for a shit degree that earns them barely above minimum wage.  Your life is screwed at that point, for like 15-30 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm a college professor, and too many people go to college.",

There will be terrible times that you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll make it through. These times will sometimes catch you off guard. \n\nThere will be times in your 20\u2019s when you feel old and tired and creaky. There will be times in your 30\u2019s where you have endless energy and motivation (I got my first college degree at 38). \n\nThere will be hard times and fun times and poor times and times where you suddenly have more than expected. \n\nLife is a combination of unexpected circumstances and what YOU make of it. Some people lose someone they love and hold onto the grief their entire life. Some people lose someone they love and go on to research or advocate on the cause. Be the latter. Seek help when you need it. \n\nWas being a kid easier?  Of course. Does that make it better?  Not by a long shot. I love being in control of what I do and what I eat and who I spend time with. \n\nWhatever happens, you\u2019ll be ok.",

I can tell you love will never feel the same as an adult as it does as a teenager. Teenage love just hits differently. But I sure as hell would never go back to the rules a teen has to abide by or living with my parents. \n\nLife changes. That's it really. There are different life stages and with each one of them comes pros and cons. For you the next few life stages are 18-21, 21-24, 25-30. You will realize that at this moment you don't know shit about fuck. Then you will turn 21 and realize how exhausting those under 21 can be. At 24 you'll laugh looking back at 21 y/o you for thinking you knew what being an adult was. \n\nIf you make it miserable, it will be. I'm 26 now. I'm not the same as I was at 18 or 21 or 24. Do I still act like a child sometimes? Absolutely. But I also am thinking about getting married and maybe buying a home. Do I still go to clubs with my friends? Sure do, it just isn't as important to me as it was at 21. \n\nYou will make mistakes, relationships will end, and you will have regrets, but you will also make achievements, build new relationships, and there will be moments that swell you with pride. \n\nI really like the way the movie Tag puts it, \"You don't quit playing because you get old, you get old because you quit playing.\" \n\nIf you simply live life you'll be fine. Trying to hold onto whatever you have now will just leave you disappointed and you'll miss out on experiences and opportunities.",

There are great things about this stage in your life too, and you\u2019ll enjoy it more if you aren\u2019t constantly looking back with rose-colored lenses. Change also happens a lot slower than we think, so \u201cgrowing up\u201d is a gradual process that you\u2019ll have time to adjust to.\n\nAs for mental health, I also have depression and anxiety, and while you can always turn to your family via phone, it helps so much to have great friends and a support system at school as well.\n\nGood luck!",

They stay in their run and don't decide to experience new things. \"YES MAN\" is a great movie to realize and combat it.",

Obviously you have to be responsible and I'm not making reckless decisions, but this morning I just spontaneously decided to go for a walk and enjoy the sunrise and quiet morning and no one could tell me not to... it was beautiful.\n\nAs for missing things, you can call your family and visit home. (Missing pets is tough because you can't just call them on the phone... my cats are probably what I miss most). And you'll make friends wherever you head off to next so you'll have a new support system and social network before you know it.\n\nAs for mental health, I would reach out to the college's counseling center or try to find therapists on your insurance network in the area when you get to college. (Starting therapy is another decision I've been able to make now that I'm an adult, and let me tell you, it is great.)\n\nAnyway, I'm not super experienced as far as being an adult goes but I definitely don't think it's as bad as you think. Maybe it's just me but so far it just seems like there's way more freedom without many additional responsibilities or stresses.",
