  "title:": "Is it possible to get an AA in two years?",
  "text": "Everything I've heard in my life is that you can get your AA in two years when taking four classes each semester. However every community college I've looked into provides only three credits per class, with a requirement of sixty credits to pass. This math obviously doesn't add up to two years. Is the two year four-class per semester just a myth at this point?",

      "text": "Full-time is considered 12 credits per semester (this is a FAFSA rule, so it applies across colleges). If you take 12 credits per semester, that would be an Associate's in 5 semesters.\n\nHowever, 12 credits is the bare minimum for full-time. Most students take 15 - 16 credits per semester, for 4 semesters to an Associate's.\n\nWith that in mind, Community Colleges tend to cater to non-traditional students and offer summer semesters as well so you can accomplish your goal in two calendar years without stressing yourself too much in any individual semesters.\n\nLastly, you may be over-emphasizing the importance of two years *and* the importance of an Associate's degree. Associate's degrees are not normally terminal degrees. If you're taking trades-related classes, the degree itself isn't all that relevant compared to what you learn and your ability to get a job. If you can get hired with 3 semesters worth of auto repair classes, then no one is going to care if you finish your degree.\n\nOn the other hand, for academic degrees you're normally looking to transfer elsewhere. By far the most common route is to pursue a guaranteed transfer program with the state university system. These programs require a specific curriculum to be taken but often don't require an Associate's degree. As long as you follow the 4-year university's curriculum path, they don't care if it meets the Community College's guidelines for an Associate's degree.",

      "text": "Depends on your CC. I was able to graduate with my AA within 2 years, but I was taking 5-7 classes because I started below the average on my math and English courses.\n\nI didn't use my ACT/SAT scores to determine what classes would best fit for me because I took the accuplacer. So instead of starting at step 5 and get it over with like some students who were already sitting at the requirement, I had to start from step 1 and build it up to get to step 5 to graduate.\n\nIt is possible if you already reach the requirement to take the classes that's needed to graduate, otherwise if you're like me who started below the requirement, you have to take extra classes and build it up. This may also be the reason why some people end up staying longer than the \"normal\" 2 years.",
