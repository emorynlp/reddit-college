  "text": "so I try to hand write my notes in class/during lectures, but type them up on google docs for study purposes (since most of what I write at first isn't completely legible lmao)\n\nik a lot of ppl make one google doc with all the notes for that class, but some ppl have a separate doc for each week's lecture. what do u think is better?",

      "text": "I think that is a person dependent choice. Either method can be good, but I think it is up to you as far as what is better. Personally, I would prefer to have all notes for one class in the same place, so I don\u2019t have to jump around different sections. Others may find having multiple docs better because you don\u2019t have to dig through as much info to find the details you need",
