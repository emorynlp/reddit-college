While I was doing my laundry this afternoon, I discovered that several of my clothes were missing. Not moved. Gone. \n\nWhoever took my clothes definitely appreciates style. Not everything was taken, just my best pair of jeans, some cute tops, and, yes, a few pairs of my underwear and my two favorite bras. Gross. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that this has happened in our dorm and it\u2019s definitely no accident. There\u2019s a camera at the entrance to the laundry room but I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to stop anything. Tons of students go in and out every day. Stupid idea to put a camera at the entrance and not IN the laundry room! \n\nThe student housing office has taken the extraordinary step to -- wait for it -- PUT UP A WARNING SIGN. How does that help?? This is super frustrating and I\u2019m not sure what to do. It seems crazy to me that A) we can\u2019t get a camera IN the laundry room for some insane reason, and B) we can\u2019t get dryers that LOCK (the washing machines are all locked while the cycle is going!!).\n\nSorry for venting, but if you have a favorite pair of jeans, I\u2019m sure you understand the frustration!! \ud83d\ude2d Has anyone else encountered this and found a way to solve it?? How can I convince the housing office to get cameras installed in the laundry room? Or something!

One course of action you could take is reporting the theft to your campus security.
