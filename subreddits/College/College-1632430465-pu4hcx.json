I know I probably don't need to worry about money, but my mind right now is worried about what to do if I end up running out of money. That kind of thing, I do gave people who would support me and give me money if I needed it, but I don't know. I have a hard time accepting help (due to mental health issues)",

      "text": "Hello, I am also thinking about getting a part time job, just not this semester. I have a lot of mental health issues and the way my class schedule is right now, I can predict that I would totally burn out and become more depressed. Balancing work, school, and friends is extremely hard, maybe even damn near impossible. You need to do what\u2019s best for you right now, if you think you can get a part time job and feel OK, go ahead try it out. However, trust your gut. If it\u2019s overwhelming quit, and try again when you feel ready.",
