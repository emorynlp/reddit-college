  "text": "First semester my adviser scheduled my classes, but now I get to choose myself. Took classes from 2-5 this semester and it was shitty, couldn\u2019t concentrate. Will probably take earlier classes, what\u2019s a good time to start. Do I stack classes on certain days or spread them out Monday-Fri? I don\u2019t have a job and have a lot of free time, my tuition is covered. help me out",

      "text": "If you want to be free a big part of the afternoon then you could start as early as possible. If you don't have too many classes, start at around 10 if possible. Before 9:30 or 10:00 your brain isn't working optimally. I'd personally do pretty long days so i'd have more entire free days, but i'd choose a time where you can still focus till the end of the day.",

If so try to take classes between 10AM-2PM. Do you like 8AM? I don\u2019t recommend them at all. Anything after 4PM is the same. Makes you not want to go to them.",
