Because I\u2019m still in school I can\u2019t pay for a place. I don\u2019t want to work full time and be a student full time. My mom has no issue with me staying home. Similar situations with my friends. \n\nWhen we hang out we still avoid parents and rip nicotine sticks and get high. It\u2019s fun but it\u2019s getting repetitive and old. This morning my friends mom made us breakfast. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about it. We\u2019re 23 and still having sleepovers and having moms make us breakfast.

I found a partner much younger than most of my friends, were 29 now and we are one of the only few that has a kid (2 yr. old).\n\nIts no problem living with your parents, just make sure that you have something that gives you purpose and makes you feel confident. We don't really have a rite of passage in our society, something that tells you when you have become a man. So you have to decide for yourself that you want to be a man, and then do the things that good men would do.\n\nDoing things on your own, such as paying your way through school or paying your own rent, make you feel confident in yourself. I had to do it at 18 because I grew up with my grandparents and they could not afford to put me through school or pay my rent. I went through a lot of rough times making sure I saved my money and had enough for bills, but at 29 I now know how to do it and I know that I could make our situation work no matter what. I also got a bit of a head start on life. We started working young and now we are further ahead in our career and finally making \"good\" money, even through the pandemic. \n\nFind a good girl (or boy). They will make you want to have your own place, be able to buy nice things and become more of an adult. It sounds like your situation is pretty comfortable. Put yourself out there into some new situations and force yourself to be uncomfortable. It will make you grow quickly. When you grow quickly and realize how much you can do on your own, your confidence will grow. Then go visit home when you want and on your terms. \n\nGood luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMelissa", "author": "BoyMama17", "created": 1600297595, "upvotes": 1}, "g5ghmkd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/is2vv5/afraid_my_friend_group_isnt_maturing_fast_enough/g5ghmkd/", "text": "Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up.

Typically, it starts around age 12 and ends when the person has matured and is mostly independent from their parents. Traditionally, adolescences used to end when someone was about 18 or 20. But that was way back when people left home, found a job, and got married at an earlier age. Now, it\u2019s not as easy to leave that adolescent stage for several reasons.
