The syllabi are worth more than their weight in gold.\n\nYou will also want highlighters and pens.

That way I could bring only the notebooks and folder for classes I needed that day; no extra weight carrying other subjects along with me.  I rewrote class notes each day and inserted the new notes into the 3 ring folder. Original notes went into a thick 5 subject 3-ring notebook that I kept at in my dorm room. \n\nLaptop in case the professor walks you through online communication.  \n\nPen, mechanical pencil with HD lead and a good eraser, highlighters.  Buy a pen that you really like so writing is enjoyable.  Ballpoint is your best choice because other inks run when they get wet. \n\nKeep a couple of granola bars in your pack. Some days are more hungry than others.  \n\nSome classes do best with handwritten notes. Mine were anatomy, physiology, chemistry, math, physics. \n\nPractice walking the route between classes for each day (including going into each building to find your classroom) before school starts.  \n\nGet to know your professors even if you are shy. Stop by office hours just to say hi, introduce yourself and what class you\u2019re in.  Use office hours to get questions answered or information clarified. It\u2019s ok to be shy.  \n\nLook classmates in the eye and say hi. Make friends. Exchange phone numbers.  Later, make a note in the contact about what class you know them from. \n\nAnxiety management: \nAs much as you can, make your schedule so you have a break between classes.  Use that break to sit down and copy your notes over again. Use stickies to write your questions on.  (See above)\n\nFind your classrooms inside the buildings before Day 1. \n\nYour school probably has free tutoring. Ask your instructor about it at the very beginning of classes.  The time slots fill up fast, and you might miss out if you wait. \n\nMake a paper master calendar of exam dates and when things are due so you can glance at it to make your plan of attack.  Photograph the master calendar.  Make a photo folder for each semester.  Add to it as needed. \n\nLook online for your syllabi. Print them. Make notes on them.  They go in the folder. \n\nStart early on projects, papers, and studying for exams.  If you wait until the last few days, you will get stressed and tired.  It\u2019s not worth it. \n\nEat well. Crap food is not your friend.  Stay well hydrated. \n\nSleep on a schedule.  \n\nBreathe very deeply and slowly to destress.  \n\nExercise daily. It matters to your mental and physical wellbeing. I don\u2019t mean walking around campus to classes.  \n\nExpect every electronic device you have to die at the worst time. Hardcopy is your friend.  If you don\u2019t back up your phone and laptop, the chaotic results are your own fault.  \n\nLaptop:   Save, and save often. \n\nSave EVERY piece of paper and electronic file you are given by any professional at the school until that school year ends.  If needed, just throw it all into a box or electronic folder. This will become more important as you get into your major classes. It can save your skin.  \n\nHave fun, work hard and smart.
