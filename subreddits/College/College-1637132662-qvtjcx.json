  "text": "I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019m a year and a half into a bachelor degree\u2019s in architecture. \n\nI struggled throughout the first year due to covid and a lack of motivation and effort on my end but was optimistic about the years to come, thinking that I\u2019d pick up the pace this year and the next. However, after having almost completed my third semester, I realised that I don\u2019t really like my degree and what I\u2019m doing. I used to always think that I had an aptitude for design, but I never produce anything good and am never confident in my work. The whole culture of work and the way we constantly have to compare, work, compare and work in studio has made me feel extremely anxious about showcasing my own, impeding my ability, and it doesn\u2019t help that I don\u2019t fit in within the university culture and wanted to leave the school ever since the first few weeks. I thought I would be able to shoulder on for the next three years because of some friends I made, but I\u2019ve gotten increasingly anxious and depressed over my work and my degree to the point where I stopped going to the studio sessions and even had to leave the room during a review because of a panic attack. I wake up with a feeling of dread every day unable to do the work because I don\u2019t know how to even with multiple attempts and multiple requests for help, and I feel like it\u2019s going to be of a low quality anyway. I had an internship over the summer at a small firm, but I found that I was impartial to the work I was doing there.\n\nI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth another 2 years of suffering, but options for me are limited because it\u2019s hard to switch majors at my university as I don\u2019t live in America and I don\u2019t have sufficient funds to apply to any of the universities I wanted to go to. My mental health is worsening and I\u2019m scared that it\u2019s just going to get worse from here. I cry every few hours and every time I open my work up it paralyses me and I just start crying. My only options are either to apply for an internal transfer to another faculty, which my school would only allow with a high GPA, or to stick it out for the next 2 years. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated as to what I can do to alleviate the situation right now and in the future, thank you.",
