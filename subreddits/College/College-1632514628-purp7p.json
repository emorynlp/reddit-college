For example, I made a groupme in one of my classes and I sent a question and no one responded, even after more people joined the group. I'm also in another groupme but it's like a conversation between me and another student since the other two people never respond.",

A week or two before assignment due date, his group members started to panic and texted him. At the end they still managed to finish it. But of course, during that period of silence in the groupchat, my brother did some research and refer to other classmates' works. Yea, so...\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

People are also more willing to help you if you help them too. Other classes (usually with worse professors) are very active and pretty much everyone helps, really depends on the people in your class and how tough it is.",

My group made it out that I wouldn\u2019t allow them to do any work(even though we each had our own sections to do and communication was all over text as they refused to zoom) but I was made the group leader by our professor(which one of them really didn\u2019t like since they wanted to lead). So everything they did, I had to check and consult the grad student that was helping us with it. She had ended up changing it drastically the night before. I told them of the changes and they were all on board with them. I turned it in and was graded lower than two of the others. They had told the professor I had over managed things. I\u2019m not sure how I could over manage things when I\u2019m the literal group leader and any changes to their section of the project were done by the grad student. I know what people look like that try and take all the work and leave none for the others. I dealt with that all throughout high school where I wasn\u2019t allowed to have any input whatsoever. So I know I didn\u2019t do that here. I\u2019d just cover your ass in case they try to turn this on you\u2026",
