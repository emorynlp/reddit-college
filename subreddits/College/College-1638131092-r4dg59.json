  "text": "I know my community college has a work study program that pays very little however it also has student worker positions that pay the same pay I'm getting at my current job. \n\nAnyways I quit my old job because I was given an awkward schedule I found a new job but now they give 32 to 40 hours a week.  I'm taking next semester off I might leave my job in 6 months.  Anyways I know colleges understand your classes better and give you 15 to 20 hours my counselor recommended that range for work. So for anyone that works or has worked at your college is it for one a stable job until you leave college? How easy was it to get hired? What jobs did you do in work study/student worker positions? I can't succeed in college if I only have 4 hours a week to do 1 to 2 assignments for 4 classes.",

      "text": "If you can do work study, do it! I did work study for about two years at my community college, and it was the best. A lot of work study jobs are really easy and you can usually do your homework during the job since they are made for students. I worked between 14-28 hours a week when I had my work study job. I had a front desk job for the testing services. We couldn\u2019t go past 28. Now, I have a regular research job working 12 hours a week and wow, everything is way more difficult than the work study job I used to have in cc.",

      "text": "It really depends on your situation. I\u2019m a gallery monitor, but I\u2019m in the art department and was offered the job by a faculty member I already knew very well.\n\nI work 15 hours a week and as far as my specific situation goes, it is stable. My understanding is that as long as the gallery is open and I have work study they\u2019d like to keep me on. I think this is especially true if you seek out a position in your own department because you can become more familiar with faculty and they\u2019ll place more trust in you than in someone random from an unrelated department. I can apply for a different job at the end of the semester if I don't like it, though. Most work study positions in my school are pretty simple and a lot of them involve sitting at a desk and occasionally dealing with visitors. I have a ton of time to read, study, and do homework",
