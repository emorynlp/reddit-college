You can save and finish assignments later, flip back through the slides on worksheets, whatever. When I say everything is open notes, I mean everything. The final isn't.\n\nOther two classes: one is run by a well meaning but unintentionally sociopathic professor that doesn't understand what is an appropriate level of coursework for a 101 class. I've already taken 3-400 level classes; the only reason I'm back in a 101 is due to scheduling and needing it to check a box. My upper level courses in the same field were vastly easier. I cannot understand how he's going to format the exam (which is of course on Friday) because he's trying to have us memorize so much niche content I'm overloaded. Second class is run by a prof that does cutting edge research and is insanely important to the field, but is horrific at teaching. Listening to her ramble about nothing for five minutes is when class is good. Her trying to explain the exam was 1.5 hours of utter incoherence. Idk what I'm supposed to be doing there. I'll probably crash and burn on both. \n\nMy other two exams are for a Russian language course where they dropped a new case on us last minute and a Soviet history course by a notoriously difficult professor which will ironically probably be the easiest. \n\nOn top of it all, I got rejected for an on campus job this fall, just like every other time I've tried to apply for anything. I have a week to decide if I want to continue in my program; if I don't, I lose application access to a study abroad scholarship, which with my luck I wouldn't have gotten anyway, but would really be the only way for me to afford it. I need to study for my exams but when I try I get physically ill out of frustration and anger. My memory is shot from depression and there is no way I can remember even half of what I need to.

I'm not gonna necessarily say that what you're going through is \"normal\" but it makes sense to me and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Ultimately, you'll be okay with time and a change of pace or scenery. Taking a break for a semester or maybe even a gap year if possible might be really beneficial.\n\nI wish you the absolute best.", "author": "uss_soup", "created": 1619641482, "upvotes": 9}, "gw7pcqb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n0jidk/failing_an_entire_semester/gw7pcqb/", "text": "Please know and remember you\u2019re not alone.", "author": "TheStudyUpGuys", "created": 1619640880, "upvotes": 3}, "gw7n9kq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n0jidk/failing_an_entire_semester/gw7n9kq/", "text": "Try meditating and maybe starting yoga, also cold showers \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f,I also don\u2019t like the whole online school thing and I ended up withdrawing from my classes, it\u2019s okay to take a break especially to work on yourself.
