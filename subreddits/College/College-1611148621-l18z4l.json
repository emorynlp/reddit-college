  "title:": "Is it common to feel \"empty\" at the start of the semester?",
  "text": "One of my classes has the menial bullshit \"submit a video introducing yourself\" assignment and in the moment I saw it I thought about dropping college altogether. Not in a \"fuck this\" sense, just extreme apathy. I get bored and distracted with reading syllabuses or filling out my calendar. I'm attending synchronous meetings but doing the bare minimum to look presentable or be engaged.\n\nI haven't felt like this before- not overly anxious about everything. I get a little mad reading about future group projects and stuff, but not exactly worried whether I'll succeed this semester. It's a blessing and a curse. I'm actually more anxious right now that I'm not more stressed, because this isn't normal for me, and being stressed is and has been the only reason I can get through school. \n\nMaybe it's just residual longing for a bigger break, maybe my brain just can't take the dreariness of covid college anymore. Whatever it is, if you're experiencing something similar, it would reassure me to know I'm not alone.",

It's always felt quite dreary to me so the only real difference is less movement commuting to school which may have impacted my general mindset.\n\nOn a slight side note, I adopted the mentality of optimistic nihilism shortly out of high school. Feels more fitting in the current times actually. Everything is fucked so why not try and make the best out of it if you can.",

I almost lost my academic scholarship, I had no friends, and my family relationship also started to fail. Nothing seemed worth it. I was in a state of apathy. Seeing a therapist helped me through all of this. \n\nIf not a therapist, might I make some recommendations that will help you? These at least helped me. \n\nClean your living spaces: these are the places you want to go home and relax in, so make sure they are decluttered. An exterior reflects an interior. \n\nWrite out your feelings: sometimes it\u2019s hard to talk to people and that\u2019s okay, but don\u2019t bottle things up. It\u2019s also a good way of congratulating yourself on the little things in a private manner. Cause sometimes we want to be appreciated for the work we\u2019ve done, and perhaps that\u2019s why you feel the way you feel.\n\nFind a hobby: it helps with those feelings of apathy. Like I said previously, what you\u2019re feeling may result from feelings of underachievement or the inability to see your own accomplishments. Doing a hobby will force you to see your own accomplishments as when you finish a project, you have to see all of the work you\u2019ve done. \n\nCry. I know it\u2019s tough but it\u2019s okay. You can cry. I do have to warn you. Once you start it\u2019ll be hard to stop. And that\u2019s okay. You many not feel like you need to cry, as you\u2019ve expressed apathy, but trust me. You need it. You deserve it. Because it will be a hard push into feeling the feelings that you\u2019ve been suppressing. Make sure you have plenty of water on hand, though, because crying will dehydrate you. \n\nYou will be okay.",
