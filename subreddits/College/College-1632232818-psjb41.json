But they aren\u2019t stupid to give you trials for the whole semester lol. Some of my profs for my programming classes used Cengage and had the email of the liaison in the syllabus for us to reach out if we needed another trial in case we needed more time to scrounge up the money to pay.", "author": "XenOz3r0xT", "created": 1632233480, "upvotes": 4}}}
