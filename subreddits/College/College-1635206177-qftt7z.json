  "text": "Hi everyone! So im currently a sophomore in college and I have big plans for my junior year. However, im not completely sure what I should do. Since last year I've been saving up money because I am planning to study abroad for a year next year. However, I'm also thinking of transferring schools (one college being literally across the US). I mean...I'm not too unsatisfied with my current college (but it could be better lmao) but also I want to go to another school where they provide better classes and opportunities for my major. Any advice?\n\nAlso I want to point out that my family and I don't have an insane amount of money so both options worry me a bit lol. I want to study abroad because it sounds fun and its something I've been wanting to do since high school (my current college also has great study abroad programs). But I'm also interested in transferring, specifically to a school that accepted me my senior year of high school and has a program I'm interested in (I didn't accept the offer bc its pricey and it would be a lot for me and my family but now I think I've saved enough money that can help me out for a bit)",

      "text": "When colleges give you financial aid offers out of high school, that's their best offer. You will likely not get nearly that good deal as a transfer. Just wanting a step up is not a good reason. Stay where you are, go abroad if you want, and consider the other school for grad school.",
