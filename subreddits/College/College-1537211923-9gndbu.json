Firstly like every college scam we have to buy a book but with an online code that we could do hmwk online but here's the thing when we do it online it never matches up with the lesson on what we are learning. As well for some reason the prof has stated that shes not allowed to speak English and only does so but very quietly when the door is open so the \"department chair\" doesnt hear her speak so she speaks 96% of the class in French and attempts to use hand signals/gestures and points and expects us to understand it. \n\nMy issue is just the fact that this is our first time taking this language and speaking only in French to English speakers about how certain phrases or words or meanings in French is just absurd so we basically have to self teach; so the prof is essentially useless bc at home we have the online hmwk and in class we're just trying to figure out what's she saying, if pay thousands for tuition and get an online code to do hmwk and the teacher doesnt give us anything in return then what's the point of the prof anyways? I've been looking at the syllabus constantly to see if I can poke holes but idk if it's worth the time fighting for this nonsense, more so since I'll most likely have the same prof next semester bc to graduate you need 2 language course to graduate so I'm stuck in this hell. \n\nMore so I took japanese as well early on (had to drop for family reasons) and we needed no online code and the teacher spoke to us in English and Japanese but explained everything nicely and was right infront of the Language office so taking this class I assumed it would have some similar steps but I'm just as shocked on how bad it truly is. As well for the online hmwk you get 3 chances to do it properly and after that it would be input as wrong; so you're basically trying to teach yourself, trying to understand teacher, trying to understand text book (when you order it online it doesnt even come binded.

You don't get any training on how to teach a class effectively, how to comunicate technical ideas, how to make a lesson plan, etc. Getting a PhD is the minimum requirement to become a professor at most colleges/universities (aside from community colleges), but all the experience you gain through your PhD is about doing research not teaching. Yes, many PhD students *do* get some teaching experience by TAing but TAs aren't usually given any instruction on *how* to teach a class aside from maybe a day of orientation they have to go to their first year. And you often don't have any control over the content of the class(this varies widely by discipline). The professor you are TAing for will usually provide you with the course materials and assignments and your job is mostly to grade. \n\nBut more importantly, you are judged primarily on your research accomplishments than your teaching. Universities don't necessarily hire a professor because they think they will be great teachers. They hire them because they think they will be able to publish quality research and get awarded grants for their research, which in turn rakes in more money and prestige for the university. Yea, when hiring for tenure track positions they do consider what classes you've taught and your teaching evaluations. But arguably your publication record and research accomplishments are more important. A big part of the interview process is usually a pitch that describes the kind of research you plan to do as a professor at the university. And when you are being considered for tenure, one of the main focuses is on your research output during the time you've worked at the university.  \n\nOf course, everything I just described is probably more true for big research universities than say small liberal art colleges that don't have a graduate program. But ironically the \"best\", most prestigious schools are usually large, research universities...\n\nSo, basically, a lot of the garbage professors fall into two categories.

It's at least low-engagement teaching, but it's a necessary evil because it's not practical to have one-to-one teaching if it's hundreds of students in each class. \n\nIt's not like people haven't tried to get accountability for teaching in the classroom, but most of that is aimed at the lower grades, specifically high school. There is a lot of continuing education high school teachers have to go through to continue teaching, but I don't know if that necessarily translates into better teaching. \n\nJust curious as to what you describe as \"bad teaching\" in your classes currently? Teaching is like any other skill...it's like a bell curve. So most teachers fall somewhere in the middle and in the rare cases you get a really bad or really amazing teacher.

These are faculty who have not earned tenure and cobble together a career out of contingent semester-long contract appointments.  They often are there because the university simply doesn't have the money to pay a regular faculty member.  Maybe you get what you pay for.\n\nSome of those professors are tenure track.  Those profs have six years to build a scholarly portfolio that will either result in a job for life or getting fired.  While every university and department is slightly different, a research university like Florida probably emphasizes research at the expense of teaching.  No one ever got tenure for being an amazing teacher, but many have been denied tenure for being sub-par researchers.  You do the math.\n\nSome of those professors are tenured.  Presumably they've been through one of the most rigorous selection processes this side of the Navy Seals, but that process may not have focused much on teaching, and once tenured, promotion opportunities are still heavily research oriented.\n\nSome of those professors are \"true adjuncts\".  These are professionals with day jobs in industry who are hired to teach a class here or there to fill a gap and presumably to lend practical experience.  Many have no background at all in education or academia, and it will take them a while to get good at teaching.\n\nI think in the end what matters is what your university and department emphasize.  There are plenty of colleges that emphasize teaching and have great teachers -- community colleges and liberal arts colleges are often among this group.  Research universities typically are not.\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "ecklesweb", "created": 1537213288, "upvotes": 247}, "e65dv66": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9gndbu/i_feel_like_colleges_are_scamming_students_with/e65dv66/", "text": "Vote with your wallet", "author": null, "created": 1537212050, "upvotes": -14}}}
