Others are the opposite.\n\nAs a professor, I try to mix the two into grading. But then students who can't or won't participate in class complain that it's unfair to penalize them for their shyness, anxiety or sheer lack of personality (all of which probably help make them better test takers). And those who can't translate what's in their head to what's on the paper complain that they \"know\" the material but don't get good grades.\n\nIt's odd that our educational system often undervalues interpersonal and group skills while overvaluing the ability to perform well on exams. Perhaps it's because evaluating the former requires a level of subjectivity that neither faculty nor students are comfortable with.\n\nIf it's any consolation, the most important things you will learn at college are not on examinations (unless you are in the hard sciences, some health professions or, perhaps, math).\n\nAlso, as someone who rose through the ranks in the \"real world\" before returning to the classroom as a professor, I was always suspect of a GPA higher than 3.75 or so.

You will be forced to educate yourself in order to build a strong understanding in the topics that interest you.\n\nDo not feel bad at all. The world operates on an evaluation centered education system that does not always care about your learning in the classroom. It is going to be one of the great challenges of our generation to solve without making high quality education exclusive to the rich.\n\nTo elaborate on what I mean, exams are designed solely to assess each group of individuals on some target content; courses revolve around these exams, which results in courses being centered around evaluation, which is not necessarily education. For example, many professors will artificially manipulate the difficulty of a course to generate their desired grade distributions. Increased difficulty can have unintended effects, such as students \"overfitting\" to lecture material without spending much time on understanding the big picture of each subject (which is why you feel like you don't know what you studied!). Connecting micro and macro details in lectures is usually a tell tale sign of a higher quality course.\n\nThere are several reasons for why this happened, the biggest being the inability of professors to keep up with all of their students. There is also the issue of professors (somewhat quietly) relying on the fact that you have access to the internet, which causes some of them to get lazy and produce really bad lectures.\n\nSolving this problem will require us to rethink how we structure courses; I am personally inclined to eliminate the examination model, which would certainly be expensive to do until we are able to automate some aspects of education. 1000 years of higher ed in the west has shown us that learning by doing is simply the best way to educate individuals, and we will need to find ways to do that efficiently for mass education to remain viable.\n\nCredibility: EE and BIOE PhD student with 300+ university credit hours in the US.", "author": "pcicales", "created": 1602538793, "upvotes": 1}, "g8mmbt1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j9s66c/good_grades_yes_remember_what_i_learn_no/g8mmbt1/", "text": "It's a no in both categories for me", "author": "KING_COVID", "created": 1602535968, "upvotes": 5}, "g8mmayu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j9s66c/good_grades_yes_remember_what_i_learn_no/g8mmayu/", "text": "All the time and I'm just in 1st year.
