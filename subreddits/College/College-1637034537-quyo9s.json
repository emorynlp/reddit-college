  "text": "Okay so I had two classes per week, on zoom (Tuesday and Thursday) for my calc class, in which my instructor would teach us the new material and answer any questions we have. But then two weeks ago, my instructor decided to get rid of the Thursday class all together, and now we have to teach ourselves the new material we are assigned on Thursdays. I paid for this class to be two days per week, I\u2019m not good at math and never have been so now I\u2019m pissed. Anyone else have this happen to them? And what do I do about it, if there\u2019s anything I can do?",
