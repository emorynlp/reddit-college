  "text": "I was a troublesome kid in high school, frequently skipping classes and flunked classes here and there, if I attended I got C, D, and even Fs sometimes.In my final third year I started to become more serious, attend more classes, although still has some skipped class, got some Bs in quizzes and midterms and even As in my English. \n\n\nI enter a major that is rather unpopular (Physics) that has and a moderate acceptance rate. But the problem still lingers, I couldn't integrate properly with my peers started skipping orientation and some classes, and within the first two months decided not to attend class at all.\n\n\nNow 3 Years of not doing anything and only sitting around in my room, I got a small chance to enter a private university with 5 months to prepare. Despite the fact I'm a piss poor student and I should think about the fact of preparing this entrance exam first, i have some lingering doubts.\n\n\nFirst, Would these 5 months of revisiting high school maths be adequate to prepare me for cs cources? I still remember the subjects, a moderate amount of knowledge like: radiant, trigonometry, quadratic formula and function, substitution and elimination, although admittedly only a small amount in derivatives, limits, complex trigonometry equations, and integrals. I try to read Concrete Mathematics, but wasn't so sure of my abilities so after the first chapter I quit.I did some CS50 but after 6 classes idk why but I quit.\n\n\nSecond, is it possible to earn at least 3.3 GPA and above during my years in college? I want to go to a graduate school, and if I can maybe earn some financial help by having a decent GPA and gre.\n\n\nI'm asking in this sub Reddit in the hopes of honest but maybe uncomforting answer, this also driven by the worry of high drop out rates of computer science.",

I started off strong in CS\u2026\n\nI\u2019m about to withdraw a course because I am flunking\n\nNot saying you can\u2019t do it, but old habits die hard OP. The CS courses expect diligent people who are good with details, don\u2019t get frustrated or discouraged, and don\u2019t procrastinate. If you\u2019re not a genius, you better be that",
