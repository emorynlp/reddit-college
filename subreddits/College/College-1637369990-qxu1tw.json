  "text": "To put things short, I\u2019ve dropped 2 classes my first semester due to covid. The switch from in person classes to online classes was too much for me. Currently on my second to last semester and am taking a class that I really want to drop, but if I do it\u2019ll be my third one. Would this be too much? I plan to my associates by the end of spring 2022. Will transfer to a 4 year university by Fall 2022.",

The standard load is 5 classes, and you'll need to maintain that at your four year unless you have special financial circumstances that enable that option. You need to work at time management so you can handle at least 60% of your future courseload.",

Attend office hours, go to the tutoring center, and put the time in. \nI was also a CC student and I failed a class, withdrew from 2, got 1 D (at least), and quite a few C\u2019s. I still got into every school I applied to and I\u2019ve done very well since transferring. \nPut in the work and you will see results!",

Also, for fafsa if you have too many Ws on your transcript they can give you less money for financial aid and it will hurt you in the long-term. What I would do if I were you is try to stick it out and hopefully pass. You can always retake the class for a better grade the second time around and it will replace the previous grade from your transcript so it does not hurt you as much.",
