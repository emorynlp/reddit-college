Most people who are successful in this field have had this as a passion for a long time and have gone into this field from the beginning with the intention of making it in the industry, not just switching into it because they don't like their current major. \n\nSecondly, you mentioned your losing out of cybersec scholarships by switching majors. Depending on the financial circumstances, it may be important to re-evaluate. It is never good to graduate in debt, especially if the job prospects aren't spectacular. \n\nFinally, you need to consider the demographic of this sub. It is mostly composed of incoming college freshmen or current underclassmen. Most of these people don't have much experience with being a new grad and many have their college paid for by their parents. As a rising college senior who has friends that have graduated this past Spring, a common consensus among those in less employable majors is that they wish they'd done something more employable or worked harder. I often wished I had switched majors (I didn't in the end), but the money that I'm making through my internship and the general prospects of my major have made me a lot more optimistic about my future (compared to had I changed my major). Had I listened to the \"follow your passion\" crowd, I would be in an objectively worse place now.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are the one left to live with the consequences (both good and bad), so it's up to you.

If she's paying your tuition and you can safely be in the same room with her, you need to sit down and have a conversation. Explain what you're doing with the degree and what your plans are after college. Tell her that you've heard what she's been saying, and that it's not fair to you. And yes, you need to establish that you've been having mental-health issues that have caused serious damage to your life. If your mom is a decent person, it may be possible to assuage some of her concerns by reaching out. But don't let this discussion turn into an argument -- and cut it off early if she escalates. \n\nIf she's not paying your bills, it may still be worth doing this, but you don't necessarily owe her that conversation.\n\n**2) You're having major issues with depression that have tanked your grades.**\n\nSwitching majors will not fix this. There are miserable, boring, stressful parts to any major in any college. This is also true for just about every job. If you can't endure and get the work in anyway, then something else is wrong. If you haven't sought out professional help yet, you may want to consider it. See what resources your university has available, and what might be covered under insurance. (I recognize this isn't an option for everyone -- but if you have those resources, *use them.*) There's also things you can do at home for self-maintenance. If you're not sleeping, not exercising, and not eating well, this will make any pre-existing issues much worse. If you don't have a routine, and don't have a study spot outside your bedroom, it'll be that much harder to function. I've been there -- ask me if you want me to elaborate on this. \n\n**3) You switched majors from cybersecurity to game animation, and lost a decent amount of financial aid in the process.**\n\nThis may not be a mistake if you have a solid plan in place. Game animation is an extremely competitive field, with long hours and low pay. That doesn't mean it's impossible to make it, but the major will not be enough to get you into the industry. Who are you planning to work for, and how are you planning to get by? Have you started looking into opportunities to build some experience in the field? \n\nIf you *don't* have a plan, well, it really might have been a better idea to grind through the cybersecurity degree and just use it for something you enjoy.
