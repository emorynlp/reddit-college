  "text": "Long story short I live in Canada, I am 26 years old. I finished Highschool and went into trades and became a Journeyman Electrician. Recently I have been growing tired of my work and seriously need change in my life. I am seriously considering going back to school, I may have to do some serious upgrading as my marks from HS were below average ( not because I couldn't do good but just because I had no interest in school whatsoever) but my real problem is figuring out what path I want to go down. There are alot of careers/degrees that interest me but there isnt one that stands out above the rest. Even when I look at my hobbies/interests I cannot find something that truly draws me in. I feel like im 18 all over again and have absolutely no idea what to do. Are there any good quality aptitude tests I could take? Or any advice in general to help push me in the right direction? Earning potential is a big consideration for me but not enough to make me a spend years learning something I hate.",
