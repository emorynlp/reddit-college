  "text": "title says it all. I just wanna know which one is overall better and if USC is worth the tuition (if I go there I'm doing cc then transfer) or if I should just go to UCLA (full 4 years). I've looked at majors and minors for both and USC doesnt really seem to have a major for the field (? might be wrong) while UCLA has financial actuarial mathematics and stats minor. USC is my dream school but UCLA is awesome too.",
