At no point did I think I was going to have a problem with him. But the first day started badly ... First, he asked me if I was gay or atheist. I answered him no (although I am an atheist) and he said \"We are going to get along well then.\" \n\nOf course I didn't pay much attention to this; but he literally never buys food and eats what I buy, he wears my clothes and my cologne (he asks my permission but I don't say no). \n\nThis in itself had begun to fill me up but the end came when he invited his girlfriend and they had sexual intercourse in the kitchen (or so I think because I did not want to look). The worst thing is that later he came and told me that I should get used to it and when I answered him badly for the first time and I said \"Go to the room next time\" he told me that \"he is free and that I am an envious virgin\". (Lol I'm not a virgin but I don't understand why he uses it as an insult and I'm also asexual). \n\nWth do I do now? I am shy and I don't know how to act and be more decisive.", "author": "AdmirableEngineer236", "created": 1631963244, "retrieved": 1632801489, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdgetiw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqkgzc/my_roommate_is_a_little_toxic_and_idk_what_to_do/hdgetiw/", "text": "To OP: EVERYBODY is going to tell you to report your roommate, apply for a roommate change, etc (aka...to do something about your problem).
