Instead of going to different countries, go to different states. Travel outside the US when you can actually afford it.",

New York, Florida, and California just to name a few. Go to a foreign store and talk to people, they can suggests places like restaurants or hubs where they tend to congregate, talk to people there and then rinse and repeat. It's like traveling to another country without the traveling part.",
