{"sid": "pxijxu", "link": "/r/college/comments/pxijxu/slacking_off_after_big_exams/", "title:": "Slacking off after big exams", "text": "On days that I have big exams, after the exam I usually just let myself do whatever I want. For the rest of the day, I can just relax, have fun, eat cake, buy a plant, whatever, and not feel bad about any of it. I usually do some homework and stuff too if I feel like it, but I don't force myself to if I don't want to. I had a major exam this morning and afterwards took a nap and then spent the entire afternoon just exploring the campus and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nI feel like this is a nice way to unwind from the stress of the exam and the studying leading up to it, and reward myself for a lot of hard work and focus. Normally I would feel bad about the lack of productivity, but for some reason I don't care on these days. However, occasionally I worry I'm just making up excuses to slack off and waste time. \n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this habit? Does anyone else do this too?", "author": "91p348", "created": 1632871176, "retrieved": 1632945404, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hepvvo4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxijxu/slacking_off_after_big_exams/hepvvo4/", "text": "Whenever I come out of an exam I usually feel dazed and exhausted. I\u2019ll literally walk out of the class and just start walking without purpose. It\u2019s kind of funny cause I\u2019ve had my friends come up to me after asking how I did and I\u2019ll just be so out of it. Idk about you, but if I feel that way it usually means I did well.
