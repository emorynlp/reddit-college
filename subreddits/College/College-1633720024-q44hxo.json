  "text": "I\u2019m taking five courses (plus two labs for science courses), and it\u2019s killing me.  This week I had three tests/exams which I had to put in 200% effort to study for, along with work from my other classes.  But I got through it, and felt like I could finally take a breath and pat myself on the back.  But then my workload replenished itself and I have almost as rough a week ahead of me, along with a couple more tests.  Today I got my score from an exam last week, and I got 55%.  And I was pretty confident in that one, too.  So that doesn\u2019t give me much hope for the tests I took this week.  And if 200% effort gets me a barely passing mark, how the fuck am I going to get through the rest of college",

      "text": "You can definitely get through this. What\u2019s your major?? One suggestion I have in the form of an example is to take hard classes with fluff classes. For instance, if you need to take organic chemistry, microbiology, and human anatomy. You also have a minor in creative writing or a minor in something else. Take one of those hard pre requests (or two if you\u2019re up for it) and the rest fill it with classes that will be easy to accomplish or not lenient. This applies if you\u2019re able to do this. It also might be best if you take 3 or 2 of those classes instead of 5 and finish the rest next semester (if that doesn\u2019t affect your financial aid).",

I\u2019m pretty sure I need all of the classes I\u2019m taking this term, and there\u2019s not really a way around it without taking an extra year, which wouldn\u2019t be worth it.  That\u2019s true though, maybe after I complete this term I\u2019ll see if I can work something else out and take a few easier classes",

I feel the same exact way about getting through the rest of it too.. but I think if you look too far ahead, it will only make things worse. The whole one day at a time helps me sometimes. \n\nAlso, time is moving really fast. Like I know it\u2019s super garbage right now, but I feel like the semester will end in the blink of an eye. For me, it\u2019s already Week 6 of 14. Just need to keep pushing for some more time. Hang in there! It\u2019ll hopefully all be okay :) (take a walk when it gets to be too much\u2014that helps too)",

I think the worst thing that I didn\u2019t expect going into college is not having any breaks/free time.  Like even when I make time for myself to relax or go for a walk/run, the stress doesn\u2019t leave me alone, it only plagues me more as I\u2019m not working towards alleviating it.  So I can\u2019t actually relax and give my mind a break, as there\u2019s never a time when I have *nothing* that needs to be done.  Have you struggled with that?",

I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not healthy\u2026 \n\nAlso same here! Like just when you think you\u2019ve finally finished everything that needs to get done for the week, there\u2019s literally a load of work for next week. I\u2019ve been just working and working away. I used to be more of a procrastinator, but being in college makes me a lot more afraid because there\u2019s a lot on the line. I\u2019m just trying to stay afloat and not get kicked out of this program :\u201d)\n\nBut I also will say that after having done nonstop work for the past month, it\u2019s finally weighing on me. Like I hate work so much and sitting down to do it is hard! I can sit down for a few hours but once I get up, I\u2019ll take literal hours to get back. It\u2019s really crappy :/ I\u2019m actually trying to find at least one day in the week where I can shut off and recharge because I don\u2019t think working all the time is doing me any good.",

For real though, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s healthy to have your brain in work mode day in and day out.  That\u2019s why weekends are built into the structure of work, but we don\u2019t get that privilege in college:/  I refuse to believe it\u2019s possible get through college without sacrificing every last shred of mental health.  Anyways, good luck lol",
