  "text": "One of our kids is applying for college for whom we will be filling out financial aid forms. Another of our kids has a disability because of which he will be either completely or partly dependent on us in his adulthood.\n\nDoes the financial aid process somehow take into account this additional obligation we will have? We have not done any financial planning for our disabled kid yet. Would appreciate it if people can point me to appropriate resources.",
