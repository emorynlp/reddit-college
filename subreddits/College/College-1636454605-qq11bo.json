  "text": "I\u2019m a fifth semester, third year junior majoring in Computer Information Systems. I\u2019ve got a pretty good GPA (3.78) and I work part time at a place that pays pretty well.\nI\u2019ve got no debt thus far and have managed to do pretty well.\n\nHowever, I feel as I may be behind the curve considering i\u2019ve never had (or really never applied) for an internship. \nIs this going to effect me in a substantially negative way? I like my job, I get to sell computers but it\u2019s just that - I sell computers, not really what my major is all about.",
