  "text": "Some of my classes have random due dates and it's extremely annoying having to basically shuffle my schedule around each week in order to meet those due dates. I do have some classes where everything is due on Fridays, but the other classes have things due every couple of days which does not help me have a structure to follow. I have a planner and it works ok I just get lots of stress and anxiety from the situation. What apps or methods do you guys use to make everything just chill for you?",
