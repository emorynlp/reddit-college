  "text": "I need help! I\u2019m in Linear Algebra 1 and am really struggling with this teacher. She goes through material so fast that I can\u2019t keep up. She talks through material while writing and so I find myself writing everything she is writing instead of listening and I\u2019m not able to ask questions because I don\u2019t know what to ask questions about. I have not gone to office hours because I\u2019m scared that people will think I\u2019m behind,even though I am behind in the class. I don\u2019t want to drop the class but I need advice on note taking, over coming office hour fears, and how to listen and take notes. \nNote: she takes notes on a chalk board so none of it is documented digitally.",
