  "title:": "Is it too weird to write thank you letters to your two favorite professors?",
  "text": "Context: I never got a lot of support at home, and my parents were deeply abusive. They made me doubt my intelligence and made me feel small/worthless, and despite not living with them anymore I still live with the effects of their actions.\n\nThese two professors, in the three years I've been in school, have given me more life advice and have treated me like someone who's got something to contribute to the world and that I'm a good person worthy of respect and kindness. They're vaguely aware of my problems at home, only because it poses a significant challenge when it comes to my studies (PTSD does that to you!), but it's not like I gush about my problems to them. However, it's no little thing that they've helped me become the stronger, more self-assured person I am becoming.\n\nWhen I graduate, I want to write them both a letter about how I am thankful to have been their student, and how they positively impacted my life. However, I don't want to sound like a teacher's pet/brownnoser.\n\nIs it weird to want to do this? They're professors, not family, but they're still very important to me.",
