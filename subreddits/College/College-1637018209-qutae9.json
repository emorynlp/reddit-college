  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and I have never felt more alone in my entire life. Currently 2 1/2 months in, I have yet to make a friend. I\u2019m not looking for advice I just wanted to see if anybody else shares my opinion. I feel like people are more disconnected than ever. Next to every interaction I have on a daily basis has some level of social awkwardness. It\u2019s as if people have been brainwashed into trying to be as nice and polite to everyone to the point where they\u2019ve forgotten how to be themselves. I rarely ever use my phone. Waiting outside with 10+ student for out professor, I found myself staring at a wall while all other students buried their faces in their phones. This also occurs throughout elevator rides. Nobody wants to be friendly anymore. I\u2019m not sure if it is an insecurity thing or if people are just more interested in what\u2019s going on within their phones. Everybody who I pass on the street who isn\u2019t on their phone carries their head staring at the ground ahead of them. My entire door building is like an apartment complex, with every door shut, and nobody greeting each other. I don\u2019t know if I happen to be in an unlucky situation or I am just an asshole. Please don\u2019t hesitate to share opposing thoughts I just felt alone on this topic.",
