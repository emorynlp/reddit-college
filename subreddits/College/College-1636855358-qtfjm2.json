      "text": "I think the program differs for each college but in my case I dropped from it. I got admitted with honors and already in my first semester I plan to drop out but I\u2019m just staying in for early registration.\n\nFrom what I researched and experience the perks are:\n\nEarly Registration for classes( I got to register with seniors while being a freshman)\n\nHonors camping housing( don\u2019t know much since I commute but is suppose to be better than regular and I think honors have to room with someone in my program at least so if you want solo you would want to look into it.)\n\nResume clout ( Can add and distinguish yourself from others, you can research more though if you think this perk is worth)\n\nGet an honors mentor mini advisor( probably just my college but i can ask her things about anything)\n\nPotential waiving of some foundational study courses ( in my program, taking honors waives some courses so you have to check for your case)\n\nPersonal Satisfaction \n\nNegatives to the program\n\nLots of Extra work\n\nI personally dropped as none of those benefits were worth it to me. I commute so the dorms are useless. I brought in a lot of dual credit so I could just register with like Sophomores instead of freshman. I\u2019m still in it cause I had to take an honors class first Semester that I couldn\u2019t drop due to having 13 credits. I\u2019m still in it for the early registration which isn\u2019t worth all the extra stuff to me.\n\nAll of the benefits may or may not apply to your college so check before you decide.\n\nIf you have any questions or need clarifications just ask.",

      "text": "It's one of the cases where you get out of it what you put in. In terms of specifics though, I'm in my College specific honors program (which is itself separate from the university honors program, but grants immediate membership in the university honors program upon acceptance). The biggest impacts have been:\n\n*  Cohort Structure. I'm going to be taking several classes with the other students who qualified for and were excepted into the specific honors program over the rest of my college career. Now, this does mean that my autonomy in terms of choosing when to take my honors courses is severely limited, but I find that made up several times by the knowledge that I actually know people from semester to semester and they are all actively engaged students and high achievers.\n* Priority Registration. Not having to worry about classes being full before you get to them is sweet. \n\nThere is no guarantee that your school's honors program offers these benefits, so check what your honors program actually does before making any decisions.",
