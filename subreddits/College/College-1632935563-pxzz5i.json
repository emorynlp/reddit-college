Got accepted into college, filled out FAFSA, Got government loans, unsubsidized and subsidized loans, and after all of that, I still have a balance of around 4k. My school offers payment plans but it is only broken up into fours. I can\u2019t just pay $200 one week, and then again the next week, the system only allows for the installment plan of $1,000 until balanced is fully paid. I reached out to Student Aid (twice!) and haven\u2019t heard back, BUT I keep getting emails that if I do not pay, I can no longer attend my classes. I can\u2019t take out a student loan because I don\u2019t have a credit worthy co-signer. Can\u2019t do the parent loan since I am 26. I don\u2019t know what to do! Any advice is greatly appreciated! Please don\u2019t state the obvious and suggest I just don\u2019t take the classes, I\u2019m hoping to get some logical advice :) \n\n-on mobile", "author": "theysaidmaybe", "created": 1632935563, "retrieved": 1632945352, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
