  "text": "I\u2019m 17, currently a senior in high school, and I honestly just feel like school isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019ve heard of people that did terribly in high school but did fantastic in college, and although that could possibly be the case with me as well, I don\u2019t want to risk drowning myself in student loans to test that theory. \n\nAlthough my parents would most definitely prefer if I went to college, they aren\u2019t completely against the idea of me doing something else, because they know how much I struggle in school. However, I\u2019m at a loss as to what other viable career paths are out there if I choose not to go to college. \n\nWhat do I do from here? What are some viable career paths? Am I completely fucked in life if I don\u2019t go to college? \n\nI would greatly appreciate the help, because this is something that has been weighing down on me HEAVILY these past two years. I\u2019m terrified. I don\u2019t want to be a disappointment/failure.",

      "text": ">Am I completely fucked in life if I don\u2019t go to college? \n\nNo, but you'll be completely fucked for life if you go to major in woman's studies or English or any other \"economically worthless\" degree with 100k in student loans. I will mention these subjects are NOT intellectually worthless, but don't expect to get the same job as an accounting major.\n\nIf a job you want to do REQUIRES or benefits from college, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Accounting, Nursing, Computer Science, medicine, etc. and you can go without debt, then go. It is very worthwhile.\n\nIf it is in a degree that doesn't give you hard skills and you have to take on 100k in debt, don't fucking go! Simple as that.\n\nYou could consider going to community college/ non for-profit trade school for a 2 year degree or a certificate in something like HVAC, IT, Engineering Technology, Dental Hygiene, Automotive Technology, etc.)\n\nI personally advise against for-profit trade schools because they are way overpriced compared to CC, lack the same recognition and accreditation standards, and are just as predatory as for-profit universities like ITT Tech, U of Phoenix, and DeVry.\n\nThe military is an amazing option if you want to have your education paid for or you want training in a career field without paying for it at a trade school, or both (for example, you are trained in becoming a car mechanic and then you go to college to study mechanical/ automotive engineering. These two things compliment each other and you have no debt because it is paid for.)\n\nJust my $0.02",

With a college degree- or getting one which you're in it- you'd easily make 7x what you'd make without a college degree.  But if you don't want to get to school, $1,700/ month.\n\nAny trade profession you'd have to go to school for training and then an apprenticeship. No school?  Ignore that option.\n\nA liberal arts program would teach you how to write, critical thinking skills, and so on.  Good jobs after that. Doesn't have to be a 6 figure school.

No school?\n\nIf it is a trade that requires licensure you will need that on top of trade school. I was saying learning auto-repair is a good way to compliment a mechanical engineering degree.\n\n\n>So, the answer- yes, you'd be fucked.
