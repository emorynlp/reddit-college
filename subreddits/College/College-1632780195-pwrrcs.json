I'm enrolled right now as a history minor but want to switch colleges to major in history, as my college doesn't have it as a major option. Right now I have no classes related to my major or minor and am stuck in Communications and English classes. Is there any possible way that I can go to school and just learn what I want to? I have bad untreated ADHD and can't focus or function in these boring and dull classes. If I go to community college can I just do history and transfer somewhere later?
