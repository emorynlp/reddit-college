Never in my life have I heard that getting the writing rubric, which I have received so many of in the past, to get a general outline of the work I have to do is considered cheating.", "author": "Formal_Rhubarb_3175", "created": 1632252199, "retrieved": 1632800964, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdraac7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pspxv2/professor_refuses_to_share_rubric/hdraac7/", "text": "You're right that it's weird that your professor considers sharing a rubric to be \"cheating,\" but it is also worth noting that no professor is obligated to share a rubric. Part of becoming a more advanced student is learning how to write an essay on any topic without needing a \"walkthrough\" of how to do it-- all of the necessary information on how to write an essay should have been covered in your writing composition course, so you don't really need any additional info from your current professor. \n\nThat being said a quick google search leads me to believe that [this may be helpful to you](https://twp.duke.edu/sites/twp.duke.edu/files/file-attachments/visual-analysis.original.pdf).", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632253768, "upvotes": 4}, "hdr9q1r": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pspxv2/professor_refuses_to_share_rubric/hdr9q1r/", "text": "Some rubrics are more like an answer key.
