  "text": "I had absolutely no fun in highschool, like absolutely NOTHING. Never went to parties, never got a single date, didn't drink or smoke (very occasionally when I was sad), never had any hangouts with friends, dealt with mental health problems galore, and so on. I went to all girls, religious, private school. I'm a freshman in college and I've gotten drunk everyday this weekend, gotten high several times, madeout with a guy for two hours under the influence in front of 6 people, and blacked out and woke up in a random room. I feel like my behaviour is absolutely obnoxious, and I'm not sure if I'm doing this to make up for all of the things I missed in highschool, or because I'm trying to numb my feelings to some extent. I'm not doing bad in my classes, but I'm just not so sure if I should be doing all of the crazy partying stuff for my wellbeing. Is everything that I'm doing normal & okay? Like am I having too much fun?",

      "text": "Thinking about if it makes up for all the things you missed in high school means you are indirectly comparing yourself to those around you. In addition, you went to a private all girl religion school which influenced you to compete with yourself on a greater level since you weren't given such autonomy. What I can say is that we have a tolerance in life, and we adapt to certain things. If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll most likely only merge into it more. Life is a tolerance, so try your best to cut down on such instances. You are asking if you're having too much fun, but ask yourself, are you having fun for the right reasons? Are you trying to fit into a concept that people created, that makes you assume you are having fun? Were you trapped into something that you couldn't wait to get out of (private all girl religion school)?  \n\n\nI should also have you know, many of my friends who went to a private religion school came out partying more than those who came from a regular degular public school. I really do think it has to do with one being limited to certain things, and then given the freedom that one still is not used to (after leaving private school). You could say its competition. Hey, it's a new life you're in, but don't try to consciously or unconsciously \"fit in\" to perceive if you're \"missing out\".   \n\n\nAlso, you have mental health issues. Your actions may only influence you to keep going, or you're more likely to get into drugs. I could be wrong, I am no expert. See a therapist if possible or a counselor in your college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: You are NORMAL, but I do not know if you are OKAY. I do not know you well enough to know that, but many people go through what you go through!",

      "text": "You can try to aim for a nice buzz the next few times you drink and see the difference. You don't have to go so hard in the paint every night. You're completely normal for young college students though, surprisingly enough, how to drink is one of those things you have to learn and practice at.",
