  "title:": "Should I Switch Majors?",
  "text": "Im currently a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major and I'm not going to lie, I'm starting to really hate biology. I'm not sure if its because of the fact that I'm still just in gen-eds, or if the professor is just really bad and that's why I don't like my biology classes, but either way the point still stands. I do, however, discovered that I really like chemistry and math and despite my calc professor not being great I still like it. I'm considering switching to something else that's more chemistry and math based, like chemical engineering, however, because my current major is in a different college than engineering I'm a little behind and if I do end up changing majors I should start taking classes as soon as I can so that I'm not as behind. But I'm also considering just being a chemistry major? I really have no idea what I want or what I want to do in the future so that just doesn't help things. I'm a little lost and confused and just want some general advice on what I should do.",

      "text": "Usually there are advisors specific to each major. Does your institution have an advisor specific to chemical engineering or chemistry? If so, you should arrange to talk to them and find out more about each degree and your future options with both. You should also take a look at the requirements and curriculum for each of them and read the class descriptions to see which major is more interesting to you. At the end of the day, it's your life and your choice, the only advice we can give you is in the form of guidance, not saying \"choose A\" or \"choose B\". All the best with your decision :)",
