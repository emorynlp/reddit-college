While I didn't have to face issues around a diversity scholarship, I'm racially somewhat similar to you -- my father's side is white Jewish American (and Jewish people are conditionally white anyway), my mother's side is Chinese American, and I pass for white.  I still have to face many microaggressions, most of which my white peers don't ever have to experience, and many of which are doubted by my POC peers -- and erasure is itself a form of racism.  Examples...\n\n* I still have to hear all the insults against Asian people and Asian culture, and often people don't tone them down b/c they think I'm white -- for example, a coworker told me that \"Chinese food just runs right through her\"\n* People refer to me as white to my face, despite knowing my heritage, and then when I call them out on it, they say \"well, you know what I mean.\"  Yeah, I know you mean you're racist and thought I'd go along with it.  \n* I still occasionally get \"Where you from?  No where you *really* from?\", I'm sure it's less than for \"full\" Asians, but for me instead of just guessing different East Asian nationalities, they also guess different Hispanic groups/nationalities and Native American as well.  \n* When I do get included in POC groups, the \"full\" POCs give me dirty looks as an interloper.  \n* White people share white savior stories with me about how they help POC, forgetting that I'm a POC.  \n* \"What is your race? Check only one\" forms make me want to throw my computer through a window. \n* I know a few Asian people who look down on white people, and they look down on me even more.  My own aunt told my mother \"why are you bothering to teach her to use chopsticks, she's never going to be Chinese.\"\n\nEven if you yourself haven't experienced racism or erasure personally, the Mexican side of your family definitely has in America, and they have been denied opportunities as a result.  If they had been allowed to rise to the level they of course deserved, think of how different your own life could have been -- for example, maybe they would've gotten rich enough you didn't need scholarships for college.  Scholarships like this are intended not just to help counteract the racism you yourself have faced, but the generational effects of racism that have changed your life for the worse as compared to \"full\" white people.  \n\nAnd if you really actually don't need the scholarship, you can still accept it to honor your heritage and ancestors, and then make a donation to the scholarship fund to help other deserving students get the help as well.  Heck, even if you *do* need the scholarship now, you can aim to donate to the scholarship fund in the future.", "author": "AceyAceyAcey", "created": 1596639932, "upvotes": 27}, "g0g89qf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/i46prn/should_i_accept_the_scholarship/g0g89qf/", "text": "it\u2019s free money tho", "author": "calebgbrimhall", "created": 1596639326, "upvotes": 435}}}
