  "text": "I\u2019m a mixed race student and recently applied for a scholarship for diverse students. In the school\u2019s scholarship acceptance letter they said that I will be put in a group of other students of color. \n\nThe problem is the side of my family that comes from Mexico all have white skin tone. The other side of my family is Canadian. Because of this I\u2019m thinking about turning down the scholarship. However, when I told my mom about my decision she felt offended that I was turning away from my heritage. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEdit- Thanks everyone! I will take the scholarship.",

I've met people who look really European (white), but guess what? They were actually Puerto Rican! Plus, nationality, race which is a social construct, and ancestry and all different things! \n\nYou have southern and northern European ancestry mixed with Native American and you should be proud of that!",

The US puts all Mexicans and Latinos, no matter if they are white, black, indigenous or mixed as people of color",

But as a 3rd yr student in a diversity scholarship, let me warn you. \n\nMore than likely, the school that is offering you the scholarship will be primarily white, with your scholarship group being the minorities. And it will be unconfortable the entire time. Even now, I still haven't made friends because there is a stigma involving me and my scholarship group. \n\nIf you truly care about the college experience and making friends, then you may need reconsider. But friends in college are temporary, and your future is a bigger priority imo.",

While I didn't have to face issues around a diversity scholarship, I'm racially somewhat similar to you -- my father's side is white Jewish American (and Jewish people are conditionally white anyway), my mother's side is Chinese American, and I pass for white.  I still have to face many microaggressions, most of which my white peers don't ever have to experience, and many of which are doubted by my POC peers -- and erasure is itself a form of racism.  Examples...\n\n* I still have to hear all the insults against Asian people and Asian culture, and often people don't tone them down b/c they think I'm white -- for example, a coworker told me that \"Chinese food just runs right through her\"\n* People refer to me as white to my face, despite knowing my heritage, and then when I call them out on it, they say \"well, you know what I mean.\"  Yeah, I know you mean you're racist and thought I'd go along with it.  \n* I still occasionally get \"Where you from?  No where you *really* from?\", I'm sure it's less than for \"full\" Asians, but for me instead of just guessing different East Asian nationalities, they also guess different Hispanic groups/nationalities and Native American as well.  \n* When I do get included in POC groups, the \"full\" POCs give me dirty looks as an interloper.  \n* White people share white savior stories with me about how they help POC, forgetting that I'm a POC.  \n* \"What is your race? Check only one\" forms make me want to throw my computer through a window. \n* I know a few Asian people who look down on white people, and they look down on me even more.  My own aunt told my mother \"why are you bothering to teach her to use chopsticks, she's never going to be Chinese.\"\n\nEven if you yourself haven't experienced racism or erasure personally, the Mexican side of your family definitely has in America, and they have been denied opportunities as a result.  If they had been allowed to rise to the level they of course deserved, think of how different your own life could have been -- for example, maybe they would've gotten rich enough you didn't need scholarships for college.  Scholarships like this are intended not just to help counteract the racism you yourself have faced, but the generational effects of racism that have changed your life for the worse as compared to \"full\" white people.  \n\nAnd if you really actually don't need the scholarship, you can still accept it to honor your heritage and ancestors, and then make a donation to the scholarship fund to help other deserving students get the help as well.  Heck, even if you *do* need the scholarship now, you can aim to donate to the scholarship fund in the future.",

Many of those folks will understand when you clarify that you're Latinx yourself and you just pass for white, but others won't.  In that situation I try to say something like \"hey, I know that my passing privilege gets me benefits others don't have, but I'm here to learn not to be colorist myself, and to try and leverage my relative privilege.\"  That doesn't appease everyone, but it does get through to many of them.  \n\nAnd dang that's horrible what your grandmother had to go through.  My mother came here as a child with her parents, and her only friend in high school was \"the black girl\" since everyone else was white.  For much of my childhood she actually tried to erase as much of my Chinese heritage as possible, such as not teaching me Shanghainese, only giving me Western (American) lunches to bring to school, only dressing me in Western clothing, etc., in the hopes that I'd be white enough to be accepted by my white peers.",

We\u2019re all Facebook friends now, it\u2019s cool. \n\nMy father\u2019s side, in 2014 relatives in Australia tracked us down when doing a genealogy project, so my father and I learned more about our family members who fled Europe in the 1800s (including our branch to the USA). I also learned we did have family members who stayed behind and their descendants later died in the Holocaust, which was a surprise to me since my family never talked about that in front of me, I guess it was too hard for them to discuss, but I guess it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to me since unfortunately every Jewish family has relatives who died in the Holocaust. \ud83e\udd2c\n\nDo you still have family in Mexico or Canada, and have you ever gotten to meet them?",

They keep complaining about the Asians moving in to my dad, expecting him to agree with them, and either forgetting my mom\u2019s Asian, or else counting her as \u201cone of the *good* ones.\u201d \n\nI swear the weirdest experiences I\u2019ve had though was Chinese people being biased against me for being mixed. It\u2019s like those individuals had a ranking with Chinese at the top, then whites, then other Asians, and mixed white/Asian people like myself are all the way at the bottom jockeying for last place with the Black and Brown people. (Of course this completely disregards the fact that many Asians can be brown, but these individuals I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t admit that.) And Asian people can pretty much always tell that I\u2019m mixed, white-passing mixies like me have a distinctive eye shape that Asians can identify, while still subtle enough that white guys with yellow fever can pretend they don\u2019t notice so they can pretend they don\u2019t have an Asian fetish. \n\nPassing privilege / erasure is a double-edged sword, even when it doesn\u2019t draw additional anti-mixed biases.\n\nEdit: And good on you for recognizing these issues and supporting your husband.

We haven\u2019t lost anyone to that AFAIK, but the laws weren\u2019t as strict and the process to legal wasn\u2019t as hard when my families came over.

But then once he was here, he applied for asylum for my Nga Boo and my mother. I think my father\u2019s side all came here legally, but back in the 19th century legal immigration from Europe meant hop on a boat to Ellis Island, and arrive without any obvious diseases. \n\n(But of course, we\u2019re all on land stolen from Native Americans, so by that measure, we\u2019re *all* illegal. It\u2019s just that Native Americans have varied between being compassionate enough to not want to deport the colonists, and not having the firepower to deport / slaughter the colonists, so there\u2019s that.)",

If you know you have a problem with too much oil, as many people do, look for more authentic Chinese restaurants. They tend to have less oil, better quality ingredients, less deep fried stuff (General Gao\u2019s chicken is no more Chinese in origin than fortune cookies, surprise!), healthier overall, and also taste better overall.
