  "text": "So I\u2019m a 19F sophomore and this is my first year on campus. Basically my dad has been pushing me to go to parties and nightclubs and I keep telling him I prefer not to do that because I\u2019m introverted and have only 2 friends lmao. \n\nI guess he doesn\u2019t want me to become bored and depressed in my room all day and sometimes I feel like he thinks I have to live the crazy college experience like he did. \n\nMy mom is the complete opposite and tells me to stay on campus and to not go to parties but either way I don\u2019t listen to either parent and make decisions for myself and whether I want to go to parties or not should be up to me. How do I get him to realize that I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019m doing now which is staying in my room and hanging out with friends on campus opposed to going off campus and going to parties?",

You are lucky to need a lot less to feel excitment. We simply don't get the same level of satisfaction or enjoyment from the lifestyle you are living. It's hard for us to relate to it because it is very contradictory to our personal experiences. He might not ever understand it but you should tell him you are happy and ask him to be accepting of it.",

      "text": "Years spending inside the campus could be your most valuable time in life. So do not pre determined that you should stay in the room as you have always been. Actually, university is the best place to get help with going  outside your comfort zone. It could be either good or bad, but at least you have to try. Cuz you cant say about something that you haven't tried before. Maybe you ideas could change by time, who knows! So think more openly and try to get socialize with some strangers,  but not in the way your father advising. I mean you can still remain as both social and introverted at the same time. Just find strangers like you and become a part of that society,as a foundation.\n\nYou are not evolved to stay along. Our ancestors lived thousands of years ago spent the most of their time in a team. But now we have limited to our rooms since very a few years due to technology, education, work or what ever name you would like to give it. So human in general is not ready to stay alone. But when you force(even you say that you prefer it) you are creating a conflict with your true psychological nature. That conflict will bring you suffering(depression, anxiety, fear, anger, violence and all the negative emotions )in the long run. Therefore, i do not recommend any one to stay alone home, what so ever!\n\nAnd you do not support to get anyone(even your parents) to any kind of understanding about you. Just live your life freely. One day they might understand you with time or unfortunately if not,  that is still not your fault. \n\nUltimately, try to maintain the perfect balance between family relationship and your own free will.",

      "text": "Honestly I can understand more both of your parents are coming from but most people do make friends and meet new people at parties if you don't want to go to them then I would recommend maybe at the very least going to a club meeting people that way or joining some sort of internal sport organization. Just because you're an introvert doesn't mean you shouldn't socialize and if parties aren't your kind of thing then find somewhere else to make friends. Most schools have at least some kind of computer science association a gaming confederation federation help some schools even have a formula one team take a look see if any organization strikes your interest that way you still have an opportunity to socialize with people that share an interest.\n\nI think your dad is coming more from the perspective that he made most of his friends partying and that was the easiest way for him to meet people and college is like the easiest time after high school to make friends it's very difficult to do after you graduate so I think he wants you to go out and experience things meet new people grow as a person and it's a person and just build a solid foundation for interpersonal relationships that will continue for the rest of your life.\n\nBeing an introvert doesn't mean you can't hang out with people just means that you might not like parties so you have to take a look at other options and quite frankly everyone should experience a party at least once in their lives just like everyone should watch some old movies or read books they don't think they'll like but they might just because college is the time to grow as a person experiment with new things and and see if there's anything that catches your interest if your interest if you don't want to go to parties then don't but but maybe check out some other options on campus that's not the only way to socialize",
