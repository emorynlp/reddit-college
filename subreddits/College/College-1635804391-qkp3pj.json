  "text": "I am struggling a little in some of my classes but Im still passing. Just not doing so hot on exams recently. I think it\u2019s because all of my classes are online. I really hate my math class being online and I dont feel like im actually learning anything in the others, yet it seems like other kids are just fine. I had to take all online because of moving and covid shutdowns (no options for in person classes) so am I right in thinking i would do better in person because thats what ive always done or am i just doing something wrong because it\u2019s unfamiliar. Idk if i articulated what i mean right  so\n\nTldr: I never took online classes until now, im having a tougher time than im used to and want to know if its normal to feel like I should be doing better in irl classes rather than this poorly in zoom classes.",
