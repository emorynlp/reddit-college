  "title:": "Safety Tips for college women",
  "text": "I am reposting from a list made by girls at my school. \n\n1. Share location with good friends. I understand you don\u2019t want your parents tracking you but it is a good idea for your friends to know where you are or your last location in the event you go missing or need help sent to you. If you have a date that night let someone know. \n\n2. Be very cautious when meeting anyone from online for the first time including tinder, bumble etc. when meeting someone for the first time meet them in public or in your housing. Do not go alone to a strangers house. You could be assaulted by the person your meeting or worse walk into a set up. \n\n3. Have your own alcohol (I would include drugs in this too) Do not take random drinks from anyone including other women. Bring your own alcohol to parties or stick to sealed beverages such as cans or drinks being served to everyone such as beer from a keg. Avoid any random concoctions. \n\n4. Drink among friends. Do not go out alone always have at least one friend with you. Be aware of each other\u2019s where abouts throughout the party. \n\n5. Make sure everyone is accounted for. Everyone who came together leaves together. (I personally have seen this problem happen) While going out in a large group of friends may seem safer but it is not. The more girls, the easier it is to lose someone without realizing. If two girls go out they are unlikely to leave each other during the party and you would notice immediately if the only person you know is missing. In a group of friends it can be easy to lose someone because of diffusion of responsibly, everyone is talking to someone else, someone must know where she is mentality. It is easy to lose one girl when party or bar hopping throughout the night in a group. Keep track of your friends. \n\n6. Do not go to the bathroom alone. (I personally know of a girl who was followed into a bathroom and raped while at a house party) This one is more so for house parties than bars as bar bathrooms aren\u2019t single stall so many women are in there at once also bar staff tends to keep an eye on bathrooms for all sorts of reasons. Bring a friend into the bathroom with you or at least to stand outside. It is very easy at a party for a predator to follow a girl into a bathroom and for bystanders to assume they are a couple looking for privacy. Never use a bathroom in a secluded part of the house alone.  If you are followed into a bathroom scream your head off for help. People will care I promise. \n\n7. Make sure your phone is charged before you go anywhere. You do not want to be in a situation where you are unable to call 911 or a friend or an Uber. Keep your phone on you as much as possible. \n\n8. Always have a healthy level of caution in a professional or educational setting. Meet professors before class instead of after. Schedule one on one meetings in less secluded places if the option is given to you. Such as meeting a tutor in a library instead of dorm room. Bring a friend along if the matter is not confidential when meeting a professor or other college staff member. \n\n9. Have a healthy level of caution among friends. Predators are stereotyped as strangers who hide in bushes but many sex crimes are committed by a person who knows the victim such as a friend of a friend, friends boyfriend or brother or even a friend themself. Be careful where you sleep. Always sleep in your own bed whenever possible. Do not sleep on a friends couch in a house with many people in the house. \nBe selective about who sleeps in your house as well. \n\n10. Just because someone attends the same school as you does not mean you \u201cknow them\u201d. Many girls who would never dream going back to a strangers house think it\u2019s safe to go back to the room or house of someone they just met simply because they are also a student at that school. This person is still a stranger. \n\n11. Other women are not always friends. (This one applies mostly to sex trafficking and abductions) Many girls are lured by other women into being victimized. Predators are often smart and realize women are much less suspicious of other women. Be wary of anyone who randomly approaches you with a \u201cjob offer\u201d like modeling or photography. A random woman in social media trying to get you to meet her somewhere is another one. \n\n12. Stay away from the worst. In college do not let a little youthful rebellion or college partying make you think there is anything glamorous about a life of crime. You may feel invincible but you are not. There is a very big difference between college kids experimenting with drugs or making fake ids and being a career criminal. Practice good common sense. College aged women are very vulnerable to being manipulated into sex work by drug addict boyfriends or pimps. College is a time for taking risks and having fun but do not take it too far. \n\n13. Educate yourself on the signs and behaviors of an abusive boyfriend. This will allow you to educate yourself before potentially entering an abusive relationship that will ruin your college years.\n\n14. Do not go home with anyone you met that night. You can give your phone number and agree to meet another day. If you really want to see more of them that night bring them back to your housing. This will you to be in control of the situation and your safety. If they refuse to go to your housing instead of theirs that is a major read flag. Going home with a stranger after drinking leaves you vulnerable to many potential problems or high risk behaviors. Ranging from assault from the person you went home with or his roommates, to impulsive consensual unprotected sex.\n\n15. If you see something not right happening get involved. Be a friend to a girl who needs it. Do not let your school be a place where violence against women is tolerated.",

Luckily I had a good friend with me who kept an eye on me and took me back to my dorm, but I thought I was going to die, I had no control over my body, and not everyone will be so lucky to have a good friend. Please be careful, especially w jungle juice (also frat parties are way overhyped they suck, find a club that throws parties, at my school marching band is wild??? Those types of parties are usually safer and not as grody)",

Don't think you are immune to having your drink spiked because you're not having alcohol. There's nothing stopping a rapist from putting roofies in your orange juice. Typical date rape drugs aren't the only thing you have to watch out for. Sometimes, rapist will just add extra shots of vodka to your drink instead. \n\nBe carful about guy friends. It's ok to have them, but be careful about drinking around them, especially if you are the only woman present or if they've brought male friends you don't know well. \n\nBe extra careful if you have a family history of alcoholism. Especially if you already have issues with stuff like self control, overeating, video game, smartphone or porn additions, smoking or addictive, impulsive behavior. You might think it won't happen to you, but that just pride and arrogance talking. I have watched far too many people ruin their lives with alcohol. \n\nLastly, read up on situational awareness. It's very helpful in preventing bad stuff before it happens.",

Still, seems we should be passed that now. \n\nThen you challenged me to be honest and proclaim that I \"generally\" hate men again.

So whether something happens to you or a friend, keep that in mind and don\u2019t let self doubt or victim blaming stop you from getting help or helping someone else. These tips are done just to kinda keep everyone aware of the dangers out there but it doesn\u2019t mean that the survivor of an assault is at fault if they didn\u2019t follow these rules! So just keep that in mind. It\u2019s always helpful to look up your college\u2019s sexual assault resources, such as a title IX office, a women\u2019s resource center, or counseling center, for yourself or in case you need to help a friend!",

The biggest example of this is that **clothes do not determine consent!** Just because a girl is wearing revealing clothes/high heels/full face of makeup/etc does not mean she\u2019s asking for it. Girls also aren\u2019t safe from creeps just because they\u2019re wearing modest clothes.\n\nI\u2019ve been followed into a parking lot once and the creep got out of his car and repeatedly shouted some degrading things at me when I ignored him. He then hopped back in and sped off. At the time I was wearing very modest clothes and no makeup. That proves that sexual assault is *definitely* the perpetrator\u2019s fault.",

Alcohol is just that harsh and hard to cover.

Most of my students won't know that being \"black out\" drunk is not the same as passing out, and you can appear to all the world to be only a bit buzzed while in fact being very dangerously drunk, so it's actually pretty tough to tell how drunk your friends are, and extremely hard to tell how drunk you are.

As a freshman in college my friend and I got drunk at a small party. We met up with a guy who was a mutual acquaintance. We were both tired, and when the guy offered to help get my drunk friend to bed, I let him. He ending up raping her. We later found out he had raped multiple girls on campus. The school knew but did nothing about it. I will never not regret not making sure she got home myself and for letting that guy around her. \n\nIt\u2019s not embarrassing to get drunk at parties. It happens in college. But that is the time when most women get raped. When they\u2019re drunk and out of it, and don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. So if you want to go out drinking, put as many plans in place as you can to protect yourself and your friends. Make a pack with your friends to not leave each other alone with a guy. Even guys you consider friends. Especially guys you consider friends. Don\u2019t let them go home with someone they just met. Sometimes guys are drunk too, and aren\u2019t aware that the girl they\u2019re with isn\u2019t conscious / able to consent. Do everything you can to prevent that situation. Rape and sexual assault in college is so so common, and I would give anything I could to prevent it from happening to more young women.",

You press on the button the entire time you're walking to your destination and if you let go of it and don't enter your PIN in the allotted time it will notify the authorities of your location and I believe it will also notify your emergency contacts if you set that up in the app.\n\nI honestly didn't use it too much this last year but it was still nice to have, since my dorm was pretty far from the central area of campus and there wasn't a lot of lighting.\n\nAnd look into if your school has any sort of free/discounted ride service! Mine had a student run service where they would pick you up and drop you off anywhere on/near campus for free from 9pm-2am. They also had a deal with Lyft for off campus housing.",

I never even thought about #6 or #9 but it's so true that young women in particular should always exercise caution even around friends and use the buddy system when drinking and going out. I hope incoming freshmen read this and are smarter than I was.\n\nAnother tip: if you're going away to college in an area with high COVID-19 cases, the partying, meeting up with strangers, and packing into spaces with lots of unmasked people is NOT FUCKING WORTH IT. I know it's exciting to be on your own, maybe for the first time, but I promise you that you will have the rest of your late teens, 20s, and your life to make new friends and party! It's not worth having to be out sick during the education you're paying for, or bringing it home to roommates or parents and having to live with the guilt. You're gonna want to be healthy so you can have the rest of your life to have fun.",

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s their fault, it\u2019s clearly the abuser\u2019s, but that doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. Drinking at all is dangerous in and of itself for people that are young and don\u2019t even know their limits. People can drink illegally if they want to, but they should be fully aware of the risks and not see drinking in college as a given. It\u2019s still a choice. Most of the women you\u2019re talking about are underage.",

If your college is teaching you to dismiss research data because it doesn't support your narrative, you're not getting an education.]\n\nThere's not actually any research or data to back up fears about drinks being spiked. In fact, the research cuts the other direction.\n\nThe data that seems to confirm these fears is all based on people's self-reports that they had a drink spiked.\n\nHowever, studies (there's one in the UK, one in Australia, not sure about others) that looked at actual blood tests from people admitted to hospitals after saying they were drugged found that almost without fail the drugs were alcohol and other things the patient took themselves.\n\nBasically, people have very little understanding of their limits or how alcohol works, they drink too much too fast, and end up thinking someone else has drugged them. The reality is they drugged themselves.\n\nAnd now, we think covering your drink is one of the most important things you can do, but missing from the list? Pace yourself and learn your limits.",

I'll excerpt a bit of the article for people without access (emphasis added):\n\n>The study, published in the British Journal of Criminology, found three-quarters of students identified drink spiking as an important risk \u2013 more than alcohol or drugs. More than half said they knew someone whose drink had been spiked. But despite popular beliefs, **police have found no evidence that rape victims are commonly drugged with\nsuch substances**, the researchers said.\n\n>Nick Ross, chair of the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, commented: \"**There is no evidence of widespread use of hypnotics in sexual assault**, let alone Rohypnol, despite many attempts to prove the contrary.\n\n>\"During thousands of blood and alcohol tests lots of judgement-impairing compounds were discovered, but they were mostly street drugs or prescription pharmaceuticals **taken by the victims themselves, and above all alcohol was the common theme**.\n\n>\"As Dr Burgess observes, it is not scientific evidence which keeps the drug rape myth alive but the fact that it serves so many useful functions.\" Dr Burgess and his team questioned more than 200 students at universities in London and south east England.\n\n>Earlier this year, Australian researchers found that **none one of 97 young men and women admitted to hospital over 19 months to two Perth hospital claiming to have had their drinks spiked, had in fact been drugged**.",

If something doesn't feel right with you, your location, and you feel you should get out...do it.

It is best to listen to it and see why that feeling happened. This applies to men and women. \n\nGreat list, and one that should be given to every individual!",

Bring pepper spray or some kind of emergency alert system with you wherever you go. You can buy a high pitched alert keychain, pepper spray, and other similar items. If you're in a pinch and need to get somewhere, it gives you enough time to cause a distraction or some harm and find a safe spot. Plus, if you're out around others, loud noises will draw attention and can create a safer situation. \n\nAnother good tip is to learn some basic self defense tips. Weak points include groin(especially for males), eyes, and the back of the knee to take someone down easily. If you feel/are being threatened, deal enough damage to take down your predator. If you can't escape and you're caught in something worse, make marks to the best of your ability. Not only does it help leave physical evidence, but DNA can also be collected from fingernails and other small areas to help catch a criminal. \n\nThese things can happen to anyone, not just women and it isn't only caused by males! And remember, just because you're in public doesn't mean you're safe. Practice safety and caution wherever you go, especially in new areas, and follow general rules of safety and gut instinct when you go out.",

          "text": "Good tips, but the groin is definitely not a great place to hit a male attacker. For some men it might be a fight-stopper, but if they're drunk or just really dedicated, it won't go so well. It might hurt them in a minute or two, but it won't make them stop (especially if they are under the influence of alcohol or other drugs). The eyes would be my recommendation, since it could incapacitate them pretty easily. The back of the knee is a good area too, but harder to access and you need to use a lot of force to make them fall. The nose is also a great place to hit someone, since it's a very fragile area of the face, and it will make breathing and seeing very difficult if you manage to break it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the most important thing to remember when you are fighting for survival is to *not stop*. A single hit will most likely not stop them, no matter where you hit them. Always follow up with another hit, and even when you think they're incapacitated, hit them again.",

People jump out of second story windows to avoid cops and you didn't mention any of that in your list. While most of the things you wrote are common sense and applicable to everyone, you removed accountability for your actions.\n I'm not saying you deserve crime to happen to you, no one does, it's just a situation that makes it very likely to happen and you can't expect to play with fire and not get burned.\n\nI dropped a girl off at a party with a male friend and within 20 minutes she came back to my apartment drunk and crying so that I could drive her back to her dorm. The male friend went back to partying. I'm no longer friends with him because of that. I spend the next hour with her and her friends comforting her over the guy dumping her after what was a hookup from the night before. She knew what she was getting into and I asked if she was certain that she wanted to go to that party and she said yes. After all the support she got that night guess what she wanted to do a few days later? Go to another party.\n\nEdit: To you downvoters, I hope you feel empowered when you're running away from the cops drunk while you were at a party and then criticize them for not taking your issues seriously after you get yourself into more trouble.",

Sometimes it\u2019s a girl wh  on invites you to there dorm and expects something from you, and that is awkward, but it\u2019s usually not a problem to leave. But me and A couple of guys I know have been put in very compromising situations by gay guys actually. It\u2019s not taken as seriously but it does happen somewhat often and guys should be aware of it",

The overwhelming majority of men don't sexually assault or rape girls. It is a slippery slope if we start to not trust whole groups because they are statistically more likely to do something.\n\nFor example, for rape family members have a high chance to be involved. Yet that shouldn't mean that you cannot trust your family anymore per se. \n\nI was rapred by a female friend 2 years ago. And as horrible as that was, having to not trust all my female friends anymore for my whole life would be even way worse than that.",

If **anything** happens - you see something suspicious (Campus police are all over that shit (or should be anyways)) - report it and document it **immediately**.\n\nIf you are not comfortable talking to campus security - talk to a trusted professor. They will help you.\n\nAlso, if you're scared to go somewhere - your car, class, dorm etc. - ask campus security to escort you (Not sure if every campus offers this but it is worth asking - they should do it everywhere) or go with a friend.",
