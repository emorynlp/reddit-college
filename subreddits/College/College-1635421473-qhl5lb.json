  "text": "So I live in a 6 person suite, and we have plenty of great friends around the dorm hall. One of my roommates however non-stop berates me over the smallest things. I understand that some things I do can be weird or off putting, and I can handle some criticism, but I\u2019m getting non-stop beratement and harassment from him. Where I live was once my safe space from bullying but now I just can\u2019t escape it. It\u2019s nonstop. I\u2019m getting yelled at by him for sitting on the couch in the common room \u201cwhen [I] could be doing homework or going to the gym\u201d. I\u2019ve talked to a few of the other roommates but one of them just makes fun of me because I\u2019m poor (I\u2019m able to tone him out, he doesn\u2019t do this constantly), another one says he doesn\u2019t approve of it but when he\u2019s next to the problematic one half the time he joins in. The other two simply aren\u2019t around enough to help me out. \n\nI\u2019ve made friends with a couple of people down the hall, but all their dorms are full, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to move in with them. If I move to a different hall I wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out with them as much, and maybe at all considering they don\u2019t see the constant harassment I\u2019m receiving, and they\u2019re still friends with my bad roommate. I don\u2019t want to take a risk with a new roommate, so I\u2019d like to live in a single, but those only exist in other halls. What should I do?",

      "text": "Stand up for yourself don't let others have that kind of power over you. You are your own best advocate. People super friendly but rhey will pile on you if you're a pushover. So stand up for yourself. \n\nIf you're not ready to do that then move to another room. You'll make more friends you'll be ok. You don't need to hangout in a dorm to make friends you can make them in all your classes and college activities they don't have to live with you in the same dorm.",
