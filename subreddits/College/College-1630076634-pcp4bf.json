If you have time go in a read the parts you don't understand/detail relevant to the material you'll need to know.  \n\nRecord the audio from lecture.  I used the recordings to clarify my notes or better understand something I didn't catch at the time and I'd relisten to lectures before a final.  It was amazing how listening before a final would help with recall to answer questions. Or provide the points to write papers. \n\nPut assignments, deadlines then schedule studying/work time on a calendar and set reminders.   Review the syllabus and find out what is worth the most points, due dates, and what must get done (incrementally) to keep you afloat.  Don't procrastinate and prioritize your workload before you start.  Decide if you don't have time to do everything, what must be done so the time you spend is spent on the most important tasks.  This allows you to be strategic.   Occasionally you might have to turn an assignment in late but talk to your professors. Communication is everything.  \n\nAlso, college is an adjustment.

But, its everything that you can handle. i really feel that getting organized is the best way for you to calm the heaviness you are feeling. i also am saying this because i feel overwhelmed and i know this is how i feel every first week of a semester lol.\n\n\\- when you study... this is important.... set a timer... study for 45 minutes and take a break for 10-15min. studies have shown this is the most effective way to study, retain information and not get burnt out. \n\n\\-\\^ also its consistency. when you are learning a subject make sure to go back to what you learned the week before and review when you have time. this way you can pull it from your memory which increases the chances of it staying in the \"long term\" memory part of your brain. i have studied the book \"ultra  learning\" as well as the relation of quality of sleep and studying retention and i like to learn about the most efficient ways to study and learn overall.  Don't get me wrong I have rewatched an entire semester of lectures the days leading into finals etc and it works for me but the consistency over the entire semester is what will help you most!\n\n\\- get outside, whether its a short walk or sitting outside to call a friend and siting in the grass... it helps A LOT\n\nI hope these help you and maybe help someone else. if you want to ever chat please message me i would love to answer any questions you might have I have been at UNLV since Spring 2019 and I've gotten familiar with a lot here.

There's also the fact that high school level studying tactics kinda hit it a dead end in university, you might need to go back to the drawing board in terms of study habits and organizing. \n\nThat said,  I recommend talking to a counselor or something about this. Tou might have chosen a major that isnt for you, which in that case means that switching majors now would be a better option than trying to tough it out and almost fail like I did. I promise you withdrawing from a class or two or changing majors now is much better than doing it two years from now. \n\nYou know yourself best though, so just pick the advice and options that suit you best", "author": "Silver_Shadow360", "created": 1630092202, "upvotes": 5}, "hald22m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pcp4bf/already_burnt_out_5_days_into_college_how_do_i/hald22m/", "text": "go work a 7.50$ job and wana die then go back go college youll love it", "author": "mattsilo", "created": 1630091604, "upvotes": 10}, "halczi6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pcp4bf/already_burnt_out_5_days_into_college_how_do_i/halczi6/", "text": "I don't think taking five classes is an easy amount to handle. My school was on the quarter system, so 3 classes were considered full-time).  And that was a lot of work - even though I did quite well in college, it was still difficult to keep up AND have a social life. In my first quarter of freshmen year, I really struggled. it was hard to get used to the idea of living on my own and being able to do what I wanted instead of HAVING to sit in my room to do homework on school nights. As happy as I was for the freedom, I also missed my family and pets a lot and that was hard to get used to.  Maybe you should have started with a smaller number of classes/ and taken an elective class pass/fail. You can still drop a course without consequences. Who cares if you are taking a lighter load? it is better than doing badly.\n\nAlso, colleges usually offer free tutoring in any subject. Find out where that is and do not be afraid to reach out. You should also talk to your professors or TAs... and be sure to visit them during their office hours or email them with any questions. Let them know feel that you are struggling and would like some extra help. You can even ask them to go over a paper and help you figure out what you need to fix - you just have to finish the paper a few days before it is due so that you can email it to them/ bring it to their office. Most of my TAs/professors were willing to go over my paper ahead of time and tell me what I needed to fix to get a good grade.  If you are struggling to find on-campus tutoring, don't be afraid to reach out to me. I can help you understand any subject but math or chemistry (evil evil courses!). Finally, ask some people in your classes if they would want to form a study group/ be your study buddy. Having someone to study with can really help!\n\nI would try to get through the first year at least before you decide if college is right for you or not. Everyone struggles in their first year - especially their first semester.  Don't feel bad if you believe you are behind your peers. That is very likely not the case, but if there are some people who are ahead of you, it is probably due to their high school preparing them better than yours did (some fancy private schools are called college prep for a reason!). That is not your fault, and you will soon catch up.\n\nReach out to me if you have any questions/ need some encouragement.
