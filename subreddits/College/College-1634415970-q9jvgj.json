  "title:": "Does anyone else struggle watching pre-recorded lectures? Any tips to not make them so boring?",
  "text": "I'm going into my second year after one year of pre-recorded lectures, and honestly if it weren't for lecture notes I would've failed my first year.\n\nSomething about pre-recorded lectures is just so boring, I've tried many times to watch them (and actually pay attention to the whole thing) and I couldn't. I honestly miss high school and the ability to just have someone present the stuff without making it feel like a low effort youtube video, that I happen to pay a lot of money for. Thankfully there is one class this semester that is in-person and it just feels amazing, it's like a breath of fresh air after what felt like drowning for one and a half years. I'm paying attention, I'm asking questions, and I don't walk out feeling like the information just entered one ear and exited through the other. Not with the other classes though, when I watch the pre-recorded lectures at some point I just lose focus and can't remember shit afterwards, so I end up not even trying in the first place.\n\nSo does anyone have any tips on keeping focus and not making them a complete chore? Thanks",

      "text": "I fucking HATE pre-recorded lectures. But what I do for studying/watching lectures is to watch half the lecture (or as much as you can without losing focus), take a 5 min break, then finish it up. Also it\u2019s good to remember that you chose your specific major for a reason. Assuming your class pertains to your major, you\u2019re going to need to know the content in the future. Look at  it is as \u201cfun\u201d studying (hope that makes sense). To be successful in your future career, you\u2019re going to have to constantly study as new technology/research comes out.  That\u2019s what helps me get through courses. Sorry if this was long, I\u2019m trying to motivate myself too lol",
