  "text": "I know this depends on the career path, so I'm going for technology, STEM, computer science. My current school doesn't offer a computer science degree but they offer other ones that are similar, the university I had in mind offers a computer science degree. How important is it to get a computer science degree specifically and why? Can't I just get another technology based degree and still get the same or similar paying job?",

          "text": "Ok let me explain. So in my state we have \"state colleges\" which are basically community college but also offer trade school programs, certificates, and bachelor's degrees. Then we have \"state universities\" that offer bachelor's and master's degrees. I know it's confusing to hear the term \"state college\" and not immediately think \"oh yea that's a university\". At this point I really don't care if I do computer science or underwater basket weaving lol. As long as I can just get a job already and not take a million prerequisites I'm good.",

Two of my friends are making $70k while in college, both IT majors. You can do almost anything in the tech industry with an IT/IS degree. You can be an engineer, cybersecurity analyst, software developer, etc. with either degree, but you might be limited to less math intensive jobs(software engineering jobs involving math, data engineering, anything with machine learning/AI is probably out of reach without a CS degree).",

          "text": "> College is a scam and you are going for the piece of paper.  \n\nI'll agree that college isn't the right path to a career for everyone or for every career.  \nI'll also agree that too many people choose the wrong college or university for the wrong reasons.  \n\nBut I do not agree that college (or university) is a scam at all.  \n\n> Yes it matters where that paper is from  \n\nI'll agree that **some** career fields or industries care about the pedigree of the institution or the quality of the education, and therefore only recruit from specific institutions.  \n\nBut the number of employers or industries in which this is a serious concern is a really small percentage of all career options for recent graduates.  \n\nFor the vast, overwhelming majority of employers, I believe the following is true:  \n\n\nThere are over 4,000 colleges + universities in the US.  \n\nFrom an employer perspective they can all be divided into 4 categories:  \n\n* Universally and industry recognized elite institutions known to produce exceptionally well prepared graduates.  \n - This is probably about 100 schools.  \n\n* Institutions known to be absolute dogshit.  \n - This is probably 25 schools or so.  \n\n* Universities & Institutions that the employer/interviewer has a personal connection with.  \n - Hey, my brother went to that school.  \n - I've got a niece who went there...  \n - This is probably 25 or so schools.  \n\n* All other universities.  \n - Never heard of it, but I'm sure it's fine.  \n - This is over 3,000 schools.  \n\n\n> So a university will look better for jobs that care about status whereas a community college will look better for those interested in the learning process.  \n\nI don't agree with your word-choices here, but I think I agree with the general sentiment.  \n\nDifferent employers have different priorities regarding the level of and quality of education in their applicants.  \n\n\n> At the end of the day all that matters is that you get to know people in the field because connections are the key and you gain experience so that you have already done the job by the time you are hired.  \n\nI will also agree that too many people underestimate the value or importance of a good people-network.  \n\nA large university with a large, strong Alumni Network can be a powerful tool.  \n\nHere is a simple example of this:  \n\n[University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address - Admiral William H. McRaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70)  \n\nThat is a video of Remarks by Naval Adm. William H. McRaven, BJ '77, ninth commander of U.S.Special Operations Command, Texas Exes Life Member, and Distinguished Alumnus.  \n\nAny member of that Admiral's command could throw the University of Texas Hook-em Horns at him and immediately establish the connection of having shared the University of Texas experience. Now that by itself isn't going to get you promoted or anything like that, but it might get you that 30 second window you need to open a door of opportunity.  \n\nThat's the power of a people-network.",
