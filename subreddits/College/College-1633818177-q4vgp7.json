  "text": "I flew in from India almost a month ago, for my further studies abroad and have been trying to settle in better. But the fact is, I come from a family with kind of a comfortable lifestyle, but we obviously have our budgetary restrictions. Here, I met a lot of Indians, some that are from my previous university & some generally from Mumbai, my city. Now the thing is I haven't seen much, but from what I have seen with the people I mentioned & a few others, the kids that come from wealthy families have a very happy & outgoing lifestyle here, as they can afford it. And the expenses of this city are taking a toll on emotions of people like me. Some people here are in tighter (financial) situations than me too and it's kind of heartbreaking to see their faces when it comes to overanalyzing (financially) about something as basic as eating. I am one to empathize with people well & I wanna accept my situation and be happy here, but where exactly do I go to fit in/find my people? I can't just put on the University whatsapp groups - \"Hey, everyone here wanting to spend less & not from rich family backgrounds, let's catch up.\" I mean I know I'm here for studies mainly, but that's easier said than done. I personally wanna completely get out of this victim mode & live my life here, working hard but in a smooth manner. This is a new chapter for me & I really need suggestions/help/support on having a more positive life without a subconscious cage all the time, when it comes to living here.",

      "text": "Try joining a club and budget for atleast one meal a week with a friend. College is oftentimes a pretty lonely place (for me atleast) and it takes a lot of effort to find a good friend. Just get into a disciplined rhythm and try to talk to people in your classes or outside. \n\nAlso, see if you have any other Indians that that know that you can talk to. Surely most people coming here aren't wealthy.",
