  "title:": "Professor deducted points for handwriting a homework assignment",
  "text": "I was assigned a homework assignment for one of my computing logic classes. The instructions simply said questions 1-6 on this page of the textbook. There was no rubric or anything. I did the assignment by hand (my handwriting is not messy, so I know legibility is not as issue) and submitted it on time. I spent a lot of time studying for this and I didn\u2019t miss a single question. However, I got a B because the assignment was \u201cunprofessional\u201d for being hand written. This was the first project of the year so there was not an expectation set beforehand in previous assignments. Would it be unreasonable to reach out to the professor and ask if the assignment can be redone (typed out of course)?\n\nEdit: for those of you asking, there is not any mention of formatting in the syllabus or assignment. His message said that it must be done in a word document. I sent him a message stating that I was not aware of this requirement and asked if I could re-do the assignment. I am still waiting on a response.",

You did what you could by asking to redo it, but if your professor is stubborn you may have to take it above him if it really affects your grade.",

      "text": "For anything about computing, a typed up assignment is expected. Sometimes they make an exception, but this is a default.\n\nAs for Discrete mathematics and logic, you may see it as a borderline, but if it's not a situation where you show calculations work, but rather computed work, it should always be typed. Sometimes for concepts like truth tables, this can be annoying. \n\nSometimes it can be a pain, but realistically, no one wants to see a photo or scan of written work unless it specifically needs to be, such as for traditional math, where mandating typed up documents would be absurd if it weren't a project. Projects need to be professional and organized, and tools like Microsoft Word have math functionalities as clunky as they may feel.\n\nBecause it wasn't specified for your situation, your professor should be generous and allow you to type it up. Note they don't want extra things to grade, so they might turn you down. If this was a large portion of your grade, you should consider going higher up if the professor doesn't reason with you.",

However, triple check all the resources the class has given out before hand as you want to be sure when confronting the professor and brushing up on the school's policy for grad disputes could come in handy.",

No offense, but typing your work out should have been an assumption when you are submitting it digitally.   \n It's just a norm to submit typed work instead of hand written.  It's a B on one assignment, so I'm sure you can make it up.",

I can't say how much time it adds for math, so I'll grant that it could add some time. I doubt that it's 2 hours though. 2 hours a week doesn't seem like much until you get a sense of just how much work a professor has to do outside of class each week. For me, I'm grading 4-5 page essays, for over 100 students, times 5 essays a semester. 1 extra minute per student was a conservative estimate. If I had to read handwritten essays it would probably add at least 5 hours of work for me a week, and that's still a conservative estimate.",
