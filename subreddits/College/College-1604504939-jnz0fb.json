The instructions simply said questions 1-6 on this page of the textbook. There was no rubric or anything. I did the assignment by hand (my handwriting is not messy, so I know legibility is not as issue) and submitted it on time. I spent a lot of time studying for this and I didn\u2019t miss a single question. However, I got a B because the assignment was \u201cunprofessional\u201d for being hand written. This was the first project of the year so there was not an expectation set beforehand in previous assignments. Would it be unreasonable to reach out to the professor and ask if the assignment can be redone (typed out of course)?\n\nEdit: for those of you asking, there is not any mention of formatting in the syllabus or assignment. His message said that it must be done in a word document. I sent him a message stating that I was not aware of this requirement and asked if I could re-do the assignment. I am still waiting on a response.", "author": "swisscheesepanini", "created": 1604504939, "retrieved": 1632947434, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 942, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gb6tutn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jnz0fb/professor_deducted_points_for_handwriting_a/gb6tutn/", "text": "I had a professor tell me that you should always do assignments on the computer, as it's more professional, but if the professor didn't state it as a requirement I don't think he should take off point.

Sometimes for concepts like truth tables, this can be annoying. \n\nSometimes it can be a pain, but realistically, no one wants to see a photo or scan of written work unless it specifically needs to be, such as for traditional math, where mandating typed up documents would be absurd if it weren't a project. Projects need to be professional and organized, and tools like Microsoft Word have math functionalities as clunky as they may feel.\n\nBecause it wasn't specified for your situation, your professor should be generous and allow you to type it up.
