  "title:": "If your professor gives you 3 free excused absences, should you still email them to let them know you won't be there?",
  "text": "In the syllabus it says attendance is required, but we are given 3 free no questions asked excused absences that don't deduct from our attendance points. A little over 2 weeks ago I emailed to say I wouldn't be there but then she ended up canceling class shortly after that anyway. I just want a break from class tonight and don't want to go. If I'm using one of those absences should I still email her to say I won't be there? Or do I just not go?",
