Not enough information, you didn't even include the subject. \n\nMy advice, absent that information:\n\nWork with the professor on this. \n\nIf he has office hours, go to every single one available. If you have a class or something during office hours, ask him if he will meet with you at a different time once a week or so. The worst he'll say is no.\n\nIf your school has a learning center or offers tutoring, start going.\n\nDo your homework, every bit. If you get stuck, go to tutoring or the professor.\n\nDo your homework far enough ahead of the due date that you can go to tutoring or the professor.\n\nLastly, if you are failing for reasons like you or a family member caught covid, problems as related to a disability, a death in the family, you broke a bone, or some other really disruptive thing outside of your control, ask the professor if he would consider an incomplete so that you have more time to complete all of the work. Keep in mind you still do have to complete the work though.",
