I also have struggled to socialize because of anxiety or just feeling mentally dead. The counseling center at my school was no help pretty much just sending me somewhere else. So yeah.",

      "text": "I feel lucky because a professor gave us an assignment in the first week worth 10%. The assignment was to make a calender of all the due dates from all classes. Without that I'd be missing deadlines like crazy like I did for the last 2 years. I've also been using the 'pomodoro' study method where you basically set an alarm to study for 25 minutes, then give yourself a 5 minute break. After  4 of these cycles (2 hours) you get a 30 minute break. It helps me to not get distracted every few minutes, cause I know I don't have to wait long for a small break. Also helps to make a weekly to do list every Sunday.",
