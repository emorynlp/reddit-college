Wanting me to greet him when I get home before him then we can chat. Or come watch Lifetime movies with him in the evening, so he can tell me how dangerous people can be in university. I was making a video for my speech class today and he interrupted it by yelling my name. \n\nIt\u2019s quite annoying for a problem. Trying to tell him I have work to do without trying to seem rude or feeling a bit bad is tough. I know I save money going to a community but staying home kinda sucks in this regard. I feel like I\u2019m expected to keep him company. It makes me envy the people that already live on campus.", "author": "sirNumber_one", "created": 1632529936, "retrieved": 1632800351, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he5v85d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puvztl/do_people_balance_school_work_and_family/he5v85d/", "text": "Same bro I want to go to university so bad, my dad and grandparents on his side feel they have exclusive access to me whenever and wherever I\u2019ve never been able to tell them shit tho", "author": "xnnyboi", "created": 1632531177, "upvotes": 2}}}
