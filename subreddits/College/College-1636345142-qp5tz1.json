      "text": "I wouldn't call it motivation, more like something that needs to be done. I will set aside time to write and will keep myself to that schedule. For the best results I will typically break my writing process into sections. First know what you want to write about and create a thesis and find supports; second, create your main points that will support your thesis. I will typically write my first sentence for each body paragraph to give me an idea on how to continue. Third, write your intro or your body paragraphs. I'll typically do 1 or 2 paragraphs a day depending on the workload. Kind of chaotic but it helps me.",
