      "text": "I\u2019m going through three major changes:\n\nLiberal Arts English because my counselor told me it\u2019s the closest thing after I said I want to teach English as a foreign language.\n\nCIS Web Development and Programming after realizing that first major really won\u2019t set me up to teach the English language or be an actual teacher in general, in any way, and thinking I should do something more practical.\n\nI realized that I\u2019ll probably have a hard time transferring those credits after I get my Associates done, so next semester I decided I should choose between switching fully into a real Computer Science major, or switch back into liberal arts and go for History because it\u2019s what I really like. This has been the one I put the most thought into so I\u2019ll go into the most detail here:\n\nWhat I realized recently is that I enjoy programming and web development, but I\u2019m absolutely trash at math even at lower levels of college classes. I really don\u2019t want to put the extra time into a topic that makes me wanna die when I look at it, and I haven\u2019t even taken a calculus class yet (in college OR in high school). Another reason to not switch into Computer Science is that while I\u2019d only need 10 classes to finish it and move on to bachelors degree, those degrees are notoriously so hard that they encourage most to only do two or three and then an elective or two to offset the workload while keeping financial aid. That way you\u2019re not taking like 3 levels of CS classes or 3 hard math classes all at once. Since I have all my gen Ed requirements out of the way now, having to extend my time in school by taking unrelated classes I don\u2019t need anymore is a big waste of time for my priorities (I\u2019m 25 years old and want to hurry tf up and graduate and move on with my life). \n\nSo now my plan is to do History so I can have a degree and enjoy my time in school while not stressing out every single night, and a bonus is that I can finish it much faster than a CS degree. Just having a degree will open doors for things like being an Assistant Language \u201cTeacher\u201d abroad in Japan or Korea, which isn\u2019t prestigious but sounds fun and like something I\u2019d wanna do for a couple years at least anyway. And in the meantime I\u2019ll continue teaching myself skills in web dev and programming (which honestly is done a lot faster on my own than in school) and build personal projects to be able to use in applications for jobs in the tech industry. \n\nHopefully this will be the final major switch unless whatever school I transfer to has majors more related to language or education focusing on teaching languages, but for now I\u2019m excited about my current plan for the future.\n\nGood luck on deciding your major OP, I hope my experience with it helps. You\u2019ll have a few semesters to narrow down your interests and what major you want to stick with before it starts getting more complicated to stay in a certain track without making your schedule kind of wacky.",

      "text": "I worked in a very niche section of my  given industry (NDT)  that peaked my interest. From there I went to school and doing second year of a 2 year materials engineering technology program. From there I\u2019ve learned materials preocessing, corrosion, heat treating, metallurgy, welding, machining, and of course some NDT. There\u2019s still a lot to learn but I love what I study despite it kicking my ass sometimes. \n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t know what you want to do right away. I took 5 years off high-school before I decided to go back to college. And I wouldn\u2019t of found wHat I love if I hadn\u2019t done that.",
