  "text": "I used gpa calculator and it says it\u2019s possible as long as I maintain a B average this semester. I\u2019m taking 19 credits. But I\u2019ve seen other sources say it\u2019s impossible. Anyone have any idea or other gpa calculators I can try?\n\nI'm a first semester sophomore and taken 34 credits so far.",
