  "title:": "Do I transfer home? Depressed, Homesick, etc.",
  "text": "Context: I\u2019m a first year at a university that\u2019s 4.5 hours from home. It\u2019s a pretty expensive school, but I got a scholarship so i only pay room & board, and do a 10 week summer research program. I love the city here and the campus and I\u2019ve made a good group of friends, and have great grades. But I\u2019m so miserable. I\u2019m depressed and am losing motivation. I\u2019ve been here for two months and I just want to be home. My favorite memories of the past two months are either when I visited home or when my parents visited me. My mom is my best friend and the only person I feel like myself around, and doesn\u2019t completely drain me. I feel so alone here, even though I have friends. I love living away from home, but I just want the comfort of knowing I can see my family without planning a four hour trip weeks in advance. I am also struggling with a bit of an eating disorder relapse. I am considering transferring to a college 15 minutes from home, where the cost will be just a little higher than my cost with full tuition scholarship here. I would still live in the dorms, but be able to go out with my family when I need it. I\u2019m in one of the worst places mentally, and it hasn\u2019t gotten better like everyone said it would after the first month. I spent today holding back tears in every class because I wanted to be comfortable. This feels like too much at once. I would be supported by my family is I transferred, but I feel like I\u2019d be letting everyone down by doing so. \n\nTLDR: mentally going downhill, homesick, depressed, and wanna feel safe.",

      "text": "I think it depends on your current school and the school you\u2019re thinking of transferring to. I would only really consider transferring to a school you\u2019re going to pay more for if it\u2019s better than your current school in some regard other than it being closer to home, especially because it\u2019s more expensive.\n\nIn the meantime, you really just have to try and stop thinking about home. I\u2019m a freshman too and I was so homesick in the beginning that literally whenever I talked I could barely get a word out because I wanted to cry. I still miss the comfort of home and my parents, siblings, and pets, but it\u2019s not as bad as before. When I was super homesick, I tried to distract myself with literally anything, which I think you should try. I just walked around campus and in town, and it helped a bit. When in was in my room and didn\u2019t have anything to do, I\u2019d always go down a rabbit hole of thinking about how much I wanted to go home that just made that feeling worse. I\u2019d look up busses and anyway to get home wishing I could go. So I would say if you feel yourself starting to get homesick, go do something to distract yourself immediately.\n\nThen again, I never really felt super homesick even while I was busy, which it sounds like is happening to you. Idk what your school is like, but I\u2019d try to see if you can meet with a therapist or something. If that\u2019s not possible, honestly just call your parents and tell them you\u2019re homesick. I tried to hold it in the first few days, but even just telling my mom I was homesick and wanted to come home (she said she thought I should try and stay but would be happy to see me if I did come back. I ended up sticking it out) helped a ton. I\u2019d try to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling even if it\u2019s just a friend you\u2019re comfortable with. Letting it out helps",

          "text": "I also wanted to add that I definitely feel the same way with my parents and siblings. Even with my best friends, I don\u2019t feel 100% comfortable around them like I do with my parents and it is tiring to always be around them. I also feel pretty alone at college. I have some friends but I don\u2019t feel completely comfortable around them and feel like I can\u2019t completely be myself, which makes me feel pretty alone. Idk what to do about that though",

      "text": "That seems like a tough decision to make. Have you talked to your parents or loved ones about it? It seem's like your depression and feeling alone is making it hard for you to have motivation in your courses, which is not good! I urge you to talk to a therapist ASAP. I really do hope you find your answer! Keep us updated! Not having familial support is tough especially when you're going through something stressful like completing your undergrad!",
