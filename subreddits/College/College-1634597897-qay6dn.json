  "text": "Context: I\u2019m a first year at a university that\u2019s 4.5 hours from home. It\u2019s a pretty expensive school, but I got a scholarship so i only pay room & board, and do a 10 week summer research program. I love the city here and the campus and I\u2019ve made a good group of friends, and have great grades. But I\u2019m so miserable. I\u2019m depressed and am losing motivation. I\u2019ve been here for two months and I just want to be home. My favorite memories of the past two months are either when I visited home or when my parents visited me. My mom is my best friend and the only person I feel like myself around, and doesn\u2019t completely drain me. I feel so alone here, even though I have friends. I love living away from home, but I just want the comfort of knowing I can see my family without planning a four hour trip weeks in advance. I am also struggling with a bit of an eating disorder relapse. I am considering transferring to a college 15 minutes from home, where the cost will be just a little higher than my cost with full tuition scholarship here. I would still live in the dorms, but be able to go out with my family when I need it. I\u2019m in one of the worst places mentally, and it hasn\u2019t gotten better like everyone said it would after the first month. I spent today holding back tears in every class because I wanted to be comfortable. This feels like too much at once. I would be supported by my family is I transferred, but I feel like I\u2019d be letting everyone down by doing so. \n\nTLDR: mentally going downhill, homesick, depressed, and wanna feel safe.",
