  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m on my way to start a bachelor of finance and I had some questions regarding the career path I wanna take.\n\nI took a couple of courses in political science/international relations, at first I loved the topics discussed in the courses but the reading for me was way too long and I just couldn\u2019t keep up with the assignments. I then decided to switch to economics but since Arabic is the first language in my hometown some majors were taught only in Arabic and economics was one of them. The next best thing for me was finance and thankfully it was taught fully in English so I applied.\n\nAs of right now I still like the jobs an international relation degree might lead to which is exactly why I applied in the first place but unfortunately the workload wasn\u2019t the best for me. \n\nI have seen some discouraging talks about the future of a finance degree, what are your thoughts about this discussion?\n\nI\u2019m not that good with numbers but I think a bachelors in finance isn\u2019t that hard with numbers however going for a masters might be challenging for me. What other majors (masters) could go well with a Ba in finance?\n\nLastly, as I mentioned I love the jobs an IR degree leads to so is there any jobs that require more movement and communication rather than in a desk at the office that I could apply to with a finance degree? I haven\u2019t decided my masters yet. It could potentially open up more doors\nIf I was to switch to another major.\n\nSorry for the long post :)\nThanks!",
