  "text": "Now that everything is in-person again, I've had a really hard time feeling motivated to actually *go* to my classes. \n\nI just turned in the worst essay of my life and I spent 3 days getting through the readings, taking notes, and trying to organize my thoughts. I put so much effort into it, but it still turned out awful and I feel like absolute shit. Also, unbeknownst to me, the deadline passed to take the course Pass/Fail so this is really going to fuck up my GPA. \n\nOn top of that, I'm just very disappointed in in-person learning. I thought it would give me some sense of pride-- getting up in the mornings and having a place to go-- but it feels even lonelier than online school. I'm around so many people but no one talks to each other and it just feels like this huge inconvenience having to rush from class to class with barely a breath in between. \n\nAt least when everything was online, I could cook or do my makeup during class then head to a caf\u00e9 afterwards to do my homework. I'm so drained.",
