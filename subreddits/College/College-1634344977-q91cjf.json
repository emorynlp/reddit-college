  "title:": "First time having to use Respondus on a midterm. How bad is it?",
  "text": "So, I've searched Reddit but I am still a little clueless as to how sensitive Respondus is. I don't have any intention of cheating. I've been studying more for this class than the other 4. I am also struggling the most in this class but passing with a borderline B. That being said, I have been doing a lot of HireVue, Zoom and Google Meet interviews these past few weeks (over 40). And every single time I've had to redo them multiple times because when I talk (think) I cut my eyes for a sec or look up or close them and I have a freaking lazy eye which makes me both self conscious and sketch. I also fidget a lot. I have anxiety and being on camera stresses me out. I've passed up on jobs requiring video interviews until Covid when I basically had no choice, but I have some control in the output. I'm just worried that I'll trigger a flag because of my fidgeting. Can I hold my cup of coffee or Juul? Like how serious is this web cam monitoring? It feels so weird, especially being for my IT Sec class.",

I move around a lot while taking exams and talk to myself and occasionally it will message me for not keeping my face in frame. Not sure if it notifies the professor or not but I've never heard anything about it. The only time I know a professor reviewed my footage was when my computer glitched out on me.\n\nMaybe let your professor know you have a lazy eye and anxiety... then at least they will know.",
