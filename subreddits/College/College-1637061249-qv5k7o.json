  "text": "So, I'm on my period with horrible cramps and having to go number 2 every hour.\n\nToday I had a statistics practical, and another practical (which got turned into a high tea) which I called in sick for.\nI can only miss attendance twice a YEAR (it's mandetory), and I literally traded it in for this.\nI feel like I missed out and I'm behind (even though that's not true, it's literally the first week of the new term).\n\nHow do you deal with having to miss classes? We only get a couple of practicals and I missed this one.",
