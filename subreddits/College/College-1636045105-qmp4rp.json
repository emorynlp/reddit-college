  "text": "This class has nothing to do with my major and I have failed the midterm which brought my A to a low C. I\u2019m in a competitive major too so I don\u2019t want this useless class to bring down my gpa so is it worth to just drop it? For reference, the class is a business class but I\u2019m in liberal arts",
