I recently began Nursing school, and both of my brothers have graduated with an electrical engineering degree. My father recently said and I quote \"your work doesn't even come close to what they did in engineering, not even close.\" Here is the situation, my brothers never needed to work towards their education because they just understood the material instantly, meaning they didn't need to study. This ability was great for them, and I am happy they had an easier time in school. However, I don't appreciate when they put down my major constantly. \n\nPersonally, I need to put effort towards every class I take, whether its math or science, because I sometimes don't understand those materials right away. Not only that, but my mother wrote every paper my brothers had assigned since they were in high-school, whereas I have always done my own work to obtain my grades. Is it true what my brothers say that electrical engineers don't write many papers in college? I guess what I'm trying to say, is an electrical engineering degree truly harder than nursing?", "author": "Federal_Listen_5299", "created": 1632847214, "retrieved": 1632945432, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heotkei": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxac5v/which_major_is_more_difficult_electrical/heotkei/", "text": "I'm gonna say to you what your family *should* be saying to you: I'm sure you will be incredible at whatever you choose to do.

We\u2019re both struggling lol. However, I say this time and time again, I feel like personally I\u2019d much rather solve a problem or use a tool to work my way through a problem than memorize information. So far from what it seems, nursing school seems to require FAR more memorization than what I\u2019m doing right now. So I feel like for me personally, nursing school would be way harder. Also, it\u2019s important to mention that my grading scale for many classes are curved to where a 65% is a C, while my girlfriend needs a 78% for a C in most classes. \n\nIt\u2019s silly to compare college majors though, they\u2019re all difficult in their own way\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sorry about your parents. What they should be doing is commending you for your hard work, and how much you\u2019re giving back. Nurses are vital to the healthcare system, and it would fall apart without them.

Generally electrical engineering and any engineering major take tons of work and studying. EE is a Stem degree which are notorious for being the most difficult degrees to get both in terms of complexity and work load. \n\nHOWEVER, and i must insist on this, it is not okay to put anyone down for the major they have chosen. i\u2019m sorry that your in this situation. Just remember no matter the difficulty of the degree, a degree is still a degree. Get a one that allows you to do something that makes you happy, and makes you a living.
