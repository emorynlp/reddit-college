      "text": "Are you looking for a monthly number? What is your lifestyle? Do you own or finance a car? Any monthly bills like cell phone or subscriptions? What is the cost of living where you are moving to?\n\nThe middle 50% probably spends $200-600/mo outside of tuition, rent/living, and associated college expenses (books, etc.) The number will change dramatically based on the individual and their expenses.\n\nWe can't really answer this. You need to make up a monthly budget based on your lifestyle. \"Activities\" could be $20 or $500 per month to two different people.",

              "text": "Food: $50/mo for a meal out once a week or $100/mo for a meal out twice a week\n\nPublic transit: $50-75/mo to take the bus/subway a few times a week\n\nActivities: $50/mo should be enough to have three or four movie tickets or museum admissions each month\n\nEmergency/misc expenses: $50/mo and you save whatever is not used to expand this emergency money\n\nSo I would assume $250/mo as a floor. Word to the wise, try to have savings padding this because you might be over or under budget in certain months. For example you have a lot more in savings if you need it but $250 gets transfered to checking each month. You want to have two different bank accounts.",

Try and reserve at least $5000 as a rainy day fund in case something goes wrong. Don't worry if you don't have that money now, you can easily get that by working part-time or by knocking on the bank of mom and dad.",
