  "text": "Average GPA for veterinary school admissions is 3.7 and in my state's school it is 3.8-3.9. My GPA sits at a 3.7.\n\nI've been finding myself getting upset at less than 100% marks on assignments and exams. Then there was one time I got a 103% on an exam and I basically felt nothing. No happiness, just \"okay cool\" and moved on. Sometimes it feels like I am going through the motions if I try to get excited about a high grade. If I get a high mark I think i got lucky and if i get lower marks i think i am stupid even when I have always scored above the class average.\n\nFor me, I never do \"all or nothing\" because I put in my all each time. But if I get less than perfect I just flat out think I am a failure. Idk if it is totally a bad thing though. Tieing my academic success to my self-worth has overall worked to power me through many tough classes and I recognize that I am strong because of that perseverance. \n\nIs it a wrong mentality to have when it motivates me to be the best person I can be?\n\nEdit: the thing is that I always practice positive thinking along with all or nothing. For example, \"this exam score isn't good enough, I'm not at my best and this isn't good enough, I can do better next time\".",

      "text": "It can defintely be unhealthy if you tie your worth to it, and it fosters a negative mindset. But if it works for you, then so be it. I'm a perfectionist myself, so this is how I push myself to work hard even when I'm depressed and lack motivation.\n\nThe harsh reality of \"grades not mattering\" only applies to those who do not wish to proceed with their education beyond college or get into a prestigious graduate program. Or it's a way to comfort those who may be failing despite giving it their all. C's and D's get degrees, but GPA does matter when finding your first job with no real experience or qualifications to make you stand out or applying to get into graduate programs that aren't from no-name institutions.",
