I haven't made a single friend, been invited to any parties or hangouts, been drunk, been in a decent class that didn't make me want to pull my hair out, and the only time I had sex it was with my SO who's not even from the same damn state, yet alone from my college.\n\nI don't know. I'm in my last year and about to graduate, and I'm looking at several paper-filled classes and a senior thesis for a crappy major I don't even care about. I've tried to put myself out there multiple times by being more outgoing during classes, speaking up in class and between class times, trying to join a club (tried joining our school's Smash bros club as a chubby socially-anxious Asian girl among a bunch of frats -- guess how that went), and trying to talk to my classmates off-class, but I never click with anyone. People either make it clear they don't want anything more than a classmate acquaintance relationship where they could mooch off my work, or it's just is a really uncomfortable atmosphere where it's clear we don't connect at all. \n\nIt's worse because I'm not going to be dorming this year so I'll be commuting, which is gonna make my originally microscopic chance of making a friend tank even more dramatically lower. I'm starting to lose faith because college has been nothing like the fun-filled, memories and experiences and partyfests with amazing people like I heard about and hoped it would be. It felt like high school except worse. At least I had two friends in high school.\n\nLike at this point it's probably a personality flaw bc the chances of someone making out of 4.5 years of college without a single friend is through the dirt lmao", "author": "FlyFreeWithMyself", "created": 1632193183, "retrieved": 1632946682, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdozm8i": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psa0ru/im_in_my_senior_year_of_college_and_im_losing_hope/hdozm8i/", "text": "First off, that\u2019s fuckin rough. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been denied and subverted the experience you had been led to believe you should have.\n\nI\u2019d evaluate what is it exactly you\u2019re looking for. Are you more interested in developing those long lasting friendships? Or is it more the exciting times you\u2019d been promised that you want and nothing else?\n\nIf nothing else, keep on trying. You\u2019ve mentioned a lot about classmates, but it\u2019s possible they\u2019re just shitty people to be around. Branch out and try some radical strategies. Start more spontaneous conversations. And if nothing else works, just let it come to you. Sometimes if you\u2019re trying too hard you\u2019ll miss things. But if you want those experiences, they\u2019ll come- maybe not now, but if you want it- and it seems like you do- you\u2019ll find a way to get there.", "author": "TotalitarianPotato", "created": 1632210224, "upvotes": 1}, "hdott3h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psa0ru/im_in_my_senior_year_of_college_and_im_losing_hope/hdott3h/", "text": "This is going to sound crazy but, if you want the college closeness you didn't get, graduate and join the military as an officer. I had close friends in highschool but, my first go at college was weird. I'm a pretty social and outgoing person, but I was so used to being around people I grew up with that I clearly didn't know how to make new friends. I took a hiatus to join the military and THAT experience turned out to be everything I had thought college would be.
