My entire life I had slept in until 10 or 11AM without fail. Sometimes it was because I went to bed at 2 or 3AM, sometimes I just wanted 12-13 hours of sleep. Waking up has always been the difficult part for me and until my third year of college I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. How on Earth would someone wake up at 6, maybe 7, AM and be okay with that? I had done it for high school and 8AM college classes but I absolutely hated it.\n\nThe answer seems trivial now, but it boiled down to 2 things for me: going to bed earlier and self-discipline. It\u2019s really easy to roll over and hit that snooze button or shut off the 5 alarms you set for yourself. It\u2019s much harder to let the alarms ring, turn then off, and then get out of bed. That part just takes time and discipline. You won\u2019t develop that skill overnight.\n\nSecond part was the hardest part for me though: going to bed earlier. I HATE losing time in my evenings, and having spent a lot of my life staying up late with friends on Discord or Teamspeak it was hard to let that go. However, the math is pretty simple. Most people need 8 hours of sleep to feel rested when they wake up. I found out that I need 9 to really feel rested. If I want to get up at 6:30, that means I should go to bed at 9:30 to feel awake and rested in the morning. And as much as it sucks to go to bed so early, I found out that as much as people talk about sleep being \u201cfor the weak\u201d and whatnot, if I DON\u2019T get that sleep, I feel terrible. So I bit the bullet and now go to bed around 10:00PM so I can wake up at 7:00AM,\n\nI\u2019m not perfect in the slightest, and I hope people understand that it\u2019s okay to stay up late sometimes and sleep in. It\u2019s just not okay to make that a habit when you want to sleep and wake up at earlier times.

In high school I would sleep around 3-4 hours a night (ex. 3AM-6AM), take a nap when I got back home, and stay up late. It fucked with my mental and physical health, and I can easily say that my lifestyle in college has been a lot better, especially due to setting a sleep time (usually 11:30AM-7AM).\n\nWhat works for me in college:\n- I have a friend who lives to sleep. So she has definitely had a positive influence on me.\n- Make a \"goal\" to get out of bed. For me that was working out.\n- Work out in some way. My past year at college I was consistently getting 15000+ steps a day and I would work out 2-3 times a week. I used to hate working out but being able to work out in the morning helps clear my mind of frustrations and it's a rare alone time I have at college.\n- I used to see sleep as a obstacle and hindrance between me and doing activities. But sleep is so important, I would say more than studying. Sleep is the time for your brain to process the day's information and for your body to rest. So try to be kind to your body and let it get it's reward for doing all the amazing things you did that day.\n- I love food, and my favorite meal is breakfast. In high school I would sometimes do 10PM-3AM, then have \"breakfast,\" take a short nap, then eat another breakfast. Food shouldn't be something to keep you awake but something to satisfy your hunger.\n- Again, I love breakfast but I began intermittent fasting. I got really lazy trying to eat breakfast before class and it wasn't worth the time crunch, so I would either eat very little before class or not eat at all. Now I fast from around 8 or 9PM to 11:30AM, and I have lunch and dinner with 2 snacks in between.\n- Don't push back homework.
