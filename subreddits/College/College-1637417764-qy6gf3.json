  "text": "Hi. So it\u2019s been a couple years since I\u2019ve started college, and I\u2019ve suddenly had this urge to know what my high school teachers wrote about me in their letters of recommendation. I waived my ferpa rights back when I was applying, and I hadn\u2019t thought about those letters at ALL until the thought of it occurred to me today. I know some teachers will let you see it once you\u2019re enrolled in a school, but I have heard that some take it to their grave. I know it\u2019s probably advisable not to do this, but has anyone had experiences asking their old high school teachers to see their letters? How did they respond? Thanks!",
