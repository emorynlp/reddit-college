  "text": "I'm not a smart person, but I am a hard worker. However, lately, I feel a bit hopeless. I entered university last week and I feel as if I am already behind. Everyone around me has had exposure to the courses being taught. I, in contrast, came from an underfunded area and have never had a chance to take those classes. \n\nI sometimes feel as if I don't deserve to be here. Please give me advice on how I can boost my self confidence and do well in college.",

      "text": "I'm a junior engineering student. Every semester, I start out feeling behind. The teacher talks. Other students seem to understand, I don't have a clue what we're learning and I feel dumb, I work my behind off, and I more often than not, I end up understanding the material better than my classmates. \n\nBut I only started realizing this recently (junior year) cause my classmates don't feel as shy to ask questions when they don't understand something now that they know pretty much all of us are being exposed to the topic for the first time. \n\nYou're not behind unless you haven't been attending class and completing assignments. My advice if you feel like you're struggling, visit office hours, see what free tutoring is available at your college, talk to other students, and ASK QUESTIONS IN CLASS. Don't worry about it sounding like a dumb question. You paid good money (or got sweet scholarship money) to be there and learn. You deserve to actually learn in your classes.",
