Starting now, **I will not add your university unless your comment specifically includes all of the info for me to add, in the format of Name, From, Until, and a source.** Date announced is assumed to be the date you made your post, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThought it'd be nice to consolidate them somewhere. The below list is fairly close to chronological order. I suspect that the shutdowns announced on Monday have essentially forced a lot of colleges' hands into shutting down: any school that hasn't announced a shutdown by the end of today will just look bad. Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:\n\nVacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.\n\n|*School*|*Date announced*|*In effect from*|*Effective
