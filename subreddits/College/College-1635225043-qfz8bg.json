      "text": "Start with a good outline- write a brief introduction, and bullet point your ideas that you want to convey throughout the essay. Once you have your ideas begin to hone in on those parts and research why these ideas are essential to your argument. \n\nWith research it is strongly recommended that you use primary sources whenever possible, and only rely on secondary sources as tools to help facilitate your research. Wikipedia is a good starting point for research papers- the bibliography can provide strong sources. Moreover with research make sure you are using your university's search engine/vpn so you can get access to academic journals that would otherwise be locked behind paywalls. Google scholar, jstor, and ebsco are good search engines. Also when you are researching you can use AND and OR to help narrow search results. For instance, \"World war one AND red cross\" \"Eugenics or Survival of the fittest\", researching this way will give you more accurate sources that pertain to your topic. \n\nLastly, always cite your sources (check with your professor what format they want).",
