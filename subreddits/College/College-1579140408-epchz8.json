This is continuing on from high school, where I found that I developed a pattern of exhaustively isolating myself from everyone but my family, and wound up leaving school with little to no practical social skills. In college it's only gotten worse, as I've found that, for whatever reason, I'm so scared of people that I will go out of my way to avoid them both physically and conversationally. I constantly move away from people, I never sit next to anyone and I always move as far away as I can if someone sits next to me. I also don't make conversation unless absolutely necessary, and I have no experience with small talk. However, since I'm in college I want to have fun and try and enjoy myself, since I know I'll likely never experience anything like this again. How can I change this and try and reach out? I've tried doing clubs, but there aren't any good ones on my campus so I feel like I've run out of options.", "author": "Adam_Drivers_Ass", "created": 1579140408, "retrieved": 1632947877, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 721, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ff58se3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/epchz8/is_it_weird_to_be_aggressively_asocial_during/ff58se3/", "text": "Not sure how much I can help since I feel the same way, but one thing that helped me alot was working part time at Chick-fil-A. As I worked, I felt my confidence increase and usually a coworker at the register over would try and do small talk with me. But probably what made me feel really confident and gives me confidence is that the more I worked, the more I got the impression that the customers were actually as awkward and antisocial as me. Although I'm not sure its right to interpret it this way, I now carry this view that \"this person is probably as awkward and insecure as me\" whenever talking to a stranger and it gives me some confidence. If you like to game, try finding someone to play with you via discord call(if you play halo or l4d2 hit me up, I'll play with you), I'm not sure, but that might help you along the way and not require you to put alot of effort.(Might actually be worth researching). But remember, baby steps, you can start by finding your local college esports discord or gaming discord, find people to play with and start by playing online with them from there. Then maybe switch to local play from there. Now I know this is kinda exclusive to gaming, but hobbies usually are a good way to get started. \n\nTL;DR: Getting a part time job will teach you pretty fast the basics. Also understand that people are insecure, you don't have to feel like taking 30 seconds of their time to try and initiate an conversation is a big deal, if they ignore you or avoid you, fuck em, you'll never see em again. Also try and listen and watch instead of speaking, don't feel forced to try and initiate a conversation, people love talking about themselves, let them do it.", "author": "Regicide62", "created": 1579583637, "upvotes": 2}, "feol16e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/epchz8/is_it_weird_to_be_aggressively_asocial_during/feol16e/", "text": "Something I got used to doing is just introducing myself to the person next to me.

Growing up, I\u2019ve never been that person who would avoid social interactions. I was the exact opposite all through my K-12 experience. I thrived off the energy from people around me. I was super outgoing and was a member of several school organizations. \n\nHaving said all of this, when I entered my freshman year of college, I became the exact opposite. I was reclusive and similarly to you I avoided interacting with anyone. I would always eat lunch by myself and just feel extremely lonely and isolated. I\u2019m not entirely sure if it was the fact that I wasn\u2019t familiar with the new surroundings or perhaps I wasn\u2019t sure how I could mesh with the already established different social circles. For the first two years of college I went to a community college so I think that in the beginning there was no need for a tight knit relationship. People would attend class and then when it was over, generally people would leave the \u201ccampus\u201d and go home.\n\nI was only like this during my first semester. The big changing point in which I could start enjoying my college experience was when I made that step to interact with others. Three factors went into this.\n\n1. I figured that since I\u2019m already paying for this (tuition, books, etc.), I might as well make it the best experience that I can possibly get.\n\n2. I wanted to have that strong sense of a friendship system that I had in high school again. I knew that in the long run I could end up making life long friends which I extremely happy to say that I now have. I never would have forged these bonds with them had I never taken the first step. I found that having a reliable support system was CRUCIAL to maintaining a relatively sane outlook during my undergrad life. \n\n3. I also knew that once I graduated I would be thrusted into the \u201creal world\u201d and could no longer have those same carefree experiences that college readily has available. Well thinking back at my previous sentence, you can still have those carefree experiences but you might just have to juggle more things compared to when you were in college. As you previously mentioned that you only have this one chance to enjoy all of those experiences. \n\nI know that at first it seems like it will be difficult and I total see where you\u2019re coming from but I can assure you that once you make the first step to creating friendships and being more social then everything will turn out better.
