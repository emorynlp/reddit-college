Do you know how many students they are responsible for? It\u2019s nearly impossible for them to effectively help every student, especially at schools with a huge student body. Not all professors are helpful either and they definitely do not have the time to guide every student who comes their way.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know everyone\u2019s parent situation. \u201cTalk to your parents\u201d is not an option for everyone for numerous reasons.  Some parents simply don\u2019t care/support their child when they go to college and other parents may know absolutely nothing about higher education whatsoever. \n\nCertainly, Google can provide answers to some questions, but not all of them. What\u2019s wrong with seeking some input from actual college students who generally experience the same situations in one way or another? Just because someone asks for the advice of strangers, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re going to do that 100%. Besides, what\u2019s the difference between listening to an answer created on Google by whoever and someone who actually goes to or went to college?\n\nNot everyone can afford to see a therapist. Yes, some schools do provide students with someone to speak to along those lines, but it\u2019s not easily accessible for everyone at every school. Some require separate payments. Some require a bunch of sessions. Just because someone had a bad day and posted about it on Reddit, doesn\u2019t mean they need to see a therapist. \n\nEverything is different for everyone. Sometimes, we just like to have others to talk to who experienced or who are experiencing similar situations.
