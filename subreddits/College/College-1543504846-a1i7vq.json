Do you know how many students they are responsible for? It\u2019s nearly impossible for them to effectively help every student, especially at schools with a huge student body. Not all professors are helpful either and they definitely do not have the time to guide every student who comes their way.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know everyone\u2019s parent situation. \u201cTalk to your parents\u201d is not an option for everyone for numerous reasons.  Some parents simply don\u2019t care/support their child when they go to college and other parents may know absolutely nothing about higher education whatsoever. \n\nCertainly, Google can provide answers to some questions, but not all of them. What\u2019s wrong with seeking some input from actual college students who generally experience the same situations in one way or another? Just because someone asks for the advice of strangers, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re going to do that 100%. Besides, what\u2019s the difference between listening to an answer created on Google by whoever and someone who actually goes to or went to college?\n\nNot everyone can afford to see a therapist. Yes, some schools do provide students with someone to speak to along those lines, but it\u2019s not easily accessible for everyone at every school. Some require separate payments. Some require a bunch of sessions. Just because someone had a bad day and posted about it on Reddit, doesn\u2019t mean they need to see a therapist. \n\nEverything is different for everyone. Sometimes, we just like to have others to talk to who experienced or who are experiencing similar situations. ",

Put yourself out there, temp agency, volunteer.  Something.  Even as a marketing major you can make up some flyers for a food bank with a map and hours.  Even if you have to work for peanuts at first.\n\nLEARN TO MANAGE YOUR MONEY.\n\nGO TO CLASS.\n\nIf you find your self in a major that is way over your head, back out.  \n\nIf this is your 5th, 6th, or even 7th attempt at (example) Calculus or upper division Physics....change majors.  Not every job at there requires Calculus.  Not everyone is good at that kind of math/science.  Not everyone is good at English, History, or theater.\n\nIf your parents demand you attend a certain school and/or earn a certain degree- pay for college yourself.  Get the degree you want, not what they want.\n\nMany, many jobs only require an Assoicates degree to be successful.  \n\nDon't let money or status dictate your major.  Yes, earning enough money to support yourself is great.  But if your in a major just because you might end up earning $110,000 a year and your failing half your classes and your miserable, it's not worth it.\n\nYes you will have to go into debt to afford college.  But be smart.  Virtually no degree is worth graduating $100K in the hole.\n\nPsychology majors and Liberal Arts Majors are still needed.  People do still hire them.\n\nDon't assume the minute you earn you undergrad means your done learning.  Never stop improving your skills.",

Having options and people laying them all out in front of you, having more support of one option over another, listening to people debate about the different ways and reasonings behind different ways is helpful for us to come to a calculated and well-prepared decision and also prepared for the realistically possible consequences that might differ from what we imagine. \n\nespecially when it comes to human interactions with people you have no choice but to maintain a good relationship with or continuing interacting. If i had my way I would say what I wanted to and confront everyone about a lot of things that grieve me, but in the end it could potentially ruin my relationships with those people and others - negatively affect my reputation, endanger my job. If it were like a roommate situation I could end up having more fights or the person being petty or behaving worse in retaliation and making my life more miserable, end up kicked out of the home or without a roommate and unable to afford the rent - these are just general examples I can think of off the top of my head from my own personal experience.  \n\nAnd yeah, maybe some people would rather not do anything at all. Because it's unpleasant. Not everyone is so gung-ho about doing things they don't like to do or give them more stress as you seem to be. *eyeroll* ",
