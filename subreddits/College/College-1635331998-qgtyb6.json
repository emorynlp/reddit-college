  "text": "Hey sorry if it\u2019s wrong here. But I have this professor who is kinda strict with student but he\u2019s messy himself, he haven\u2019t posted the date of the midterms nor the date for the finals which make it hard to plan, also he have a no make up exam policy(even if you have medical reasons), is that allowed? It\u2019s a state university by the way in the US if it would help.",

      "text": "I mean, no, it\u2019s technically not allowed.  Your syllabus *should* be clearly defined and count as a contract you can rely on\n\nIn reality\u2026. Even administration has difficulty making faculty do things, so even a complaint to the department head is unlikely to get much to change.  It is almost always worth telling them, but the ability to effect immediate change in faculty behavior is extremely limited in my experience \n\nFinals dates/times get published by the University, in my experience, so you may be able to obtain that from a posted University exam schedule \n\n\nDefinitely mention it on your course eval\n\nHe probably *cant* get away with no make up exam for a medical absence.  That\u2019s definitely a stronger case",
