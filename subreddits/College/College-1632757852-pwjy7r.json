  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore engineering student, and I\u2019m really starting to hate my college experience. \n\nWhen I was in high school, I was an incredible student. Great grades, great extracurriculars, solid academic plan, and I worked hard to get a scholarship into a great school/program but now I\u2019ve just\u2026 stopped.\n\nMy entire freshman year was online, so I got an apartment near campus and joined a fraternity in the spring since it was the only thing I could do in person (I know it was irresponsible during covid but I was desperate to have some aspect of a college experience and too selfish to stay at home). Last year was a dream come true for me - I got great grades, secured a paid (remote) research internship at the university, and spent all my free time enjoying the partying and good times that come from greek life at a big university.\n\nNow I\u2019m one month into my sophomore year living in the fraternity house and I hate almost everything about my life. I\u2019m struggling with a severe coke addiction and my response has been to drink and smoke every night until I black out because that\u2019s the only time I don\u2019t think about it. I\u2019m burning through my money and lying to my parents about where it\u2019s going. I lost my internship because I was too busy \u201chaving a good time\u201d to realize I missed the reapplication deadline a month ago. I\u2019m skipping classes because I sleep all day, and I\u2019m barely keeping up by buying adderall to binge homework sessions. I haven\u2019t joined a single club or gotten involved with anything outside of greek life, and I can\u2019t bring myself to join the one student organization (a renowned engineering build/design team that was a huge part of the reason I chose this school) because I\u2019m embarrassed of how the people in it will view me. I\u2019m everything that\u2019s wrong with greek life and I feel like a fraud for even being at this school. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to my brothers about some of this, but I\u2019m too embarrassed to be completely honest with them. I love my friends here and I have found some of the most genuine friendships of my life, but they all seem to balance everything perfectly. My closest friends in the frat are doing everything right - staying on top of school work, applying for internships, participating in clubs, only going out on weekends, all of it. They all have this perfect discipline that I just don\u2019t. I can\u2019t live in this environment where I\u2019m surrounded by opportunities to fuck up and get fucked up because I don\u2019t know how to say no. I\u2019m never pressured or forced into anything but in a house of 100+ guys there\u2019s always someone looking to just hang out or have a little fun\u2026 and the next thing I know I\u2019m waking up the next day remembering nothing and I\u2019ve missed all my classes. I feel like nobody else has this struggle and I\u2019m the only one dealing with it because I\u2019m now just too fucked up in the head.\n\nI know I need to get myself out of this environment but I\u2019m terrified of what that will mean. I can\u2019t get out of my lease until the end of the semester without forfeiting all my rent (which I can\u2019t afford) but even if I do that it means cutting ties with the only friends I have at school. I have so many friends here that I care about and I feel truly care about me but I literally don\u2019t know a single person outside of greek life. If I deactivate then I\u2019m starting over completely on my own. And at this point I feel like I\u2019ve fucked up my future career by wasting the first two years of college doing nothing but fry my brain. I\u2019m so overwhelmed and stressed about pissing my life away I haven\u2019t slept in days and I don\u2019t feel like I can handle it anymore\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone will even want to help me because this is entirely my fault and I\u2019ve done this to myself but I\u2019ve completely lost control and I\u2019m going off the rails and I don\u2019t know what to do",

Definitely recommend the medical withdrawal to work with the addiction then come back when you\u2019re ready. There is no bad in taking a withdrawal to work on your health at all. If you do come back to the same college after dealing with this, I recommend staying away from the frat that may enable or make you think about the addiction again.",

      "text": "You need to take it one step at a time at this point cause you\u2019re overwhelming yourself with all the things you need to fix. \nFirst off please consider seeking out help, if your school offers free therapy I would consider doing that. Talk to your advisors about your school situation as you seem to be skipping a lot of classes and that ain\u2019t no good for your grades. Having an honest talk with your advisor to see what you can do can help you figure out if you need to reduce the classes you\u2019re talking or if you can muster through them.\nDrug addiction is a real issue and clearly being in that frat enables you somehow since there\u2019s always gonna be one dude that wants to have fun\u2026. You have friends who \u201cperfectly balanced\u201d everything but in reality they may have had their own struggles too. \nTry to keep yourself busy, stay away from your frat as much as you can during the day, use the resources in your school to study or take a breather outside. I don\u2019t suffer from addiction but I\u2019m sure being around the source can make you want to take it more.\nIf there is professional help in your school solely for drug addiction, I highly recommend checking it out asap. You can still take control of your life but you can\u2019t just expect it to change within a day. It took you a while to get to this point and it will take you some time to get out of it. Patience, self discipline, self love and self motivation is the key! You acknowledge that you already did this to yourself, now you can move on from that! If you need to cry, cry about it, if you have friends to vent to, vent it out and Complain all you want! But after you left yourself feel your intense emotions, bring yourself back to reality and rationalize yourself to start making steps to a better life! It sounds easier than it is, but taking things one step at a time will help you. Now go take a breather outside! You got this! C:\n\n(P.s. I\u2019m not a professional when it comes to therapy or understanding addictions, I just wanted to comment something and see if I can somewhat give you clarity! If I sound insensitive I\u2019m sorry and if I didn\u2019t clarify some points or kinda jumbled my speech I\u2019m sorry too :/ good luck to you c:)",

      "text": "You have to find someone to talk to. You have to let go of some things too; you have bigger problems than keeping friends around or getting good grades. Your life, health, and finances are at major risks. I would recommend you consider taking a leave from college to figure this stuff out so you can come back in a better place. Coming clean to your family might be the best move if you feel they will be helpful and receptive. Otherwise, you need professional help. Drug addiction and mental health issues are a bitch; you probably won\u2019t beat them if you\u2019re trying to do school at the same time.",
