  "text": "Hello, I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore. It feels like I can do everything right and then when a major test comes around I flunk even if I\u2019m confident. I\u2019m going to fail my classes because of this and I\u2019ve tried everything it feels like. \nDifferent studying techniques, therapy, tutoring\u2026 I just feel like giving up.
