  "title:": "Anxiety over my supposedly \"useless\" biology major",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a junior in college. I am currently majoring in biology, and minoring in chemistry. I had origninally planned on going to medical school, but I'm not sure it's right for me. I am certain I want to go to graduate school, but am not sure how long after obtaining my bachelors I would like to persue more education.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hear often that a biology major can be completely useless, unless I want to be a doctor. I am passionate about biology, so I feel as though I should continue with this major, especially since I am nearing the end of my bachelors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not so sure about my minor now, however. What good will a chemistry minor do for me? I'm considering completing a  buisness minor instead, because I feel it will give me more practical skills. I'm not sure how a biology major and a buisness minor will go together though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest fear is graduating, struggle to find a job, and feeling like I wasted my time and money on a worthless degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit\\] Thank you for all of the replies! I am completing an internship this semester that has given me tons of connections in biology fields, and has really opened my eyes to all of the options biology has to offer. \n\nI am now planning on applying to vet school when I graduate! Wish me luck. ",

ENVR management is a mix of science, business, law and a little bit of history. While ENVR science is science studying the various interactions occurring in the environment and can break off into either ENVR biology, ENVR chemistry, ENVR chemistry, Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Safety. Both ENVR's management and science materials connect and can lead into various business and scientific jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, if you haven't already, start networking, volunteering and getting as much experience as possible while you figure out what to do. I'd tell any college student to do that regardless.",

I used to be a bio major and then changed my major to computer science for this same reason, thinking that majoring in computer science would make finding a job easier. It turns out it is not easy at all. The competition is really high and finding a job is still a very stressful process.  \nSo, I'd say if you are passionate about your major, then try to stick to it. I'm not saying passion is the most important aspect of such a decision, but I think having a passion will ease the stress that you go through during your study period and afterwards.  \nGood luck!",

The common wisdom is that you can\u2019t do anything with an English major if you don\u2019t teach. But I am 28, work at a place I love, and just finished my Master\u2019s degree and bought a house this year. Now, I will say to take those particular results with a grain of salt because scholarships allowed me to finish school with no debt, and I won\u2019t pretend that being debt-free made no difference in my ability to afford a house. But I was definitely still able to find a job with my \u201cuseless\u201d degree, and my work paid for most of my Master\u2019s degree, too. It\u2019s okay to not have your career path completely decided before graduation. When people asked me what I planned to do with an English major if I wasn\u2019t going to teach, I just shrugged and said, \u201cEvery company needs someone who can write well.\u201d There are plenty of uses for biology, too!",

There I learned just how many jobs there are available for any science degree. I saw people making a killing in commission selling lab/medical equipment that cost thousands and I mean thousands. There were techs coming in to fix and calibrate our equipment that made like $30 an hour (and I knew how to calibrate some of that stuff, super easy). Biologists making a killing consulting for companies going through FDA audits and inspections and so forth and so on.  \n\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. Do your research and know you\u2019ll have to start at the bottom (a tech like I was) but you\u2019ll see a lot of different jobs and network which will help you. I was a tech and I didn\u2019t have even an AA at the time so I doubt you\u2019ll struggle. You just need to be prepared to move somewhere more lucrative for your industry. \n\nEdit: I also wanted to go to med school but decided against it. My plan is to get back into the lab with my 3 years of experience and maybe get a nice gig as a microbiologist so I can consult one day. Good luck and God bless!",

I did both chemistry and micro and actually changed my major from chemistry to micro because of it. I love bacteria I can\u2019t explain it lol but it was cool being able to grow them and observe them with super high quality equipment. I already did most of the stuff we do in labs because of that job. \n\nI liked it because it was nice and easy but interesting. I didn\u2019t feel bored or like it was mundane and I got to do both Chem and micro which most places have. Micro does the bioburden (how much bacteria is present in this product if any) and Chem does the physicals (viscosity, small, pH, etc). We also did testing in the plant so I got to be social with the factory workers. It was a nice gig and I made $17 an hour without a degree. For half a year I worked overtime (60 hrs) every week and bought an almost brand new car lol. They let us work overtime frequently but I just took advantage of the opportunity to do so. What I\u2019m trying to say is that it was a really nice opportunity as a whole, for anyone but especially someone in or straight out of college which was the majority of us. My friend started a month before me and she\u2019s now a microbiologist 2 at a large pharmaceutical company so growth is also possible if you\u2019re a good/ hard worker. I left to finish my degree so I could basically do what she\u2019s doing and I have a guaranteed job with her when I\u2019m done because of the networking. So yeah I think it\u2019s great. Also to add to that my boss is the head microbiologist at the company my friend is at and he makes well over $100k a year. It\u2019s good work and great pay once you get settled.\n\nI keep thinking of more stuff to say lol but once you get experience one place, it\u2019s easy to work for other places. I met people who worked for cover girl, Johnson and Johnson, Mary Kay, etc. I learned a lot of secrets lol about a lot of different brands. QC labs are pretty much the same in every company so it\u2019s easy to move to another place of the opportunity occurs.",

Even the bosses had molecular bio or biology degrees because it doesn\u2019t really matter honestly. Well, it does and it doesn\u2019t. \n\nAs for finding a job, I think I got super lucky but it\u2019s worth a try. How it worked for me is that I got a paid internship (through my community college believe it or not) and after like 5 months they hired me as a tech. I would look for jobs and just apply to tech jobs and when you get the opportunity, share with them that your in college. Many listings will say that you need a bachelors but they\u2019ll hire someone if they fit the job who doesn\u2019t have one. There were a couple techs who didn\u2019t even have AAs and weren\u2019t going to get one but they had experience so they were hired. The only downside to that is that you\u2019ll never get promoted but you\u2019re getting your degree so that doesn\u2019t matter. LinkedIn is good for finding jobs I\u2019ve noticed. There are a lot of places with labs: the food industry has labs like Coca Cola and Pepsi, as well as personal care items like sunscreen or makeup. It\u2019s easier to find a job in these areas without a degree in my experience then like a pharma company. Anything that goes on your body or inside it has QC labs. Products have to pass USP/USDA/FDA regulations to be able to be sold. \n\nWhen I graduate I will have a BS I thought about a masters but maybe in the future. I\u2019m so ready to graduate lol. I just want to start my life already lol which is why I decided against med school.",

But unfortunately I don\u2019t think you can do much with just a bachelors degree anymore. Someone told me it\u2019s equivalent to a high school diploma.

Ask for advice, work on mastering the craft (go to any trainings they offer), offer to help setup labs, volunteer to tutor, or run any events they\u2019ve got going on... then when a spot opens, they will put in good words for you.\n\nOh, and a community college only requires a masters and is a WAYYY less stressful job than at a university. No research required, smaller classes, better one-on-one with students, you get to go to conferences all over the country still, and weirdly (at least in my area) it pays way better!",

I love teaching (worked as an English teacher for two years abroad), and would love to do it in an adult setting, where everyone is choosing to be there. A few years ago as an undergrad student I took an extracurricular evening class and it was such an amazing experience. The small class sizes made the experience more intimate and by the end of the year we were almost like family.\n\nI'm now back in school getting my masters and would love to teach in community college.\n\nI don't suppose you have any advice for someone in the UK who wants to move to the US to become a community college professor?

Spent most of my time in Scotland visiting colleges and the anatomy museums. \n\nI\u2019d say my best advice is to start out as an adjunct, the pay is shit, but every college I worked at but one used it as a training ground and a sort of a trial run. Adjunct jobs are easy to get, just highlight your teaching experience as much as possible. They eat that up.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in an adjunct spot, get in good with the department chair and full time faculty by making sure to attend meetings you\u2019re invited to, volunteer to help the department whenever you can, and just be an all around great professor and team mate. Then when an opening comes around, apply. They always ask the full timers who they think would be a good fit from their adjunct pool (and at my college the full timers serve in the hiring committee too). \n\nJust be patient since full time spots take time to come around (took 2 years for me), but my teaching got tremendously better the longer I adjuncted, so it wasn\u2019t wasted time. Adjunct at a handful of colleges and keep at it! If you have passion for it, it\u2019ll show and you\u2019ll get hired on in time (and it\u2019s SOOO worth it when you do).\n\nGood luck to you!!",

You cover a ton of information in a pretty wide variety of areas, so some parts of it were definitely more interesting than others, but I like pharmacology/toxicology and real-life applicable clinical type classes, and thankfully there was no shortage of those. \n\nBefore you go into pharmacy, just keep in mind that our job market is super saturated, so getting a job straight out of pharmacy school isn't as easy as it used to be, and it's not projected to get any easier. There are definitely jobs out there, but finding one in a desirable location in whatever setting you prefer will be difficult. You'll have more opportunities if you choose to pursue a fellowship or a residency after school or if you do a dual degree program to get an MBA or Ph.D. with your Pharm.D., but those programs are all extremely competitive. Lol I don't mean to scare you, because I'm sure with a lot of hard work you could do it, but I think it's important to have that realistic picture of where the profession is at and where it's likely to be going before you make that commitment to it.

              "text": "To get started in research in undergrad, what I did was email professors who had labs to basically say I was interested in their research and would love to join their lab, and if we could meet to discuss this. I went to a SLAC so there weren\u2019t many labs at my school - fortunately I got into one of them, but my plan had been if I didn\u2019t, I would email profs at larger nearby schools too. Bringing that up because you don\u2019t necessarily have to do research at your own school if your college doesn\u2019t have a lot of options. Anyway, I started out as a volunteer, but then eventually had my work study job as a research assistant in the lab which was nice. That all said, I have no idea how covid is affecting how labs are bringing in undergrads :/ but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask- maybe you could even start out virtually.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure how covid will be affecting this, but if you can, I\u2019d apply to a bunch of summer research internships (such as NSF-funded REUs). I remember I applied to about a dozen of them and got into 2, so those are pretty competitive, but I had a really great time in my REU. I believe the apps for those are mostly due in Jan/Feb, if I remember correctly?\n\nLastly, if you still want more research experience after you graduate, I would highly recommend a postbac research program. There are PREP programs at various schools meant for underrepresented minorities in the sciences. And then there\u2019s also the NIH Postbac IRTA fellowship, which is what I\u2019m currently doing- you get to work in a lab at the NIH for 1-2 years. How it goes def depends on your PI, but I\u2019m having a great time here. The admissions for this program are rolling, which is also nice, but I\u2019d recommend applying around this time next year when you\u2019re a senior. I\u2019m sure there are other postbac research programs, but those are the ones I\u2019m familiar with. Also, if there\u2019s a specific lab you\u2019re interested in, you could email them to ask to work as a lab tech for a year or two after you graduate, rather than doing a more formal postbac program.\n\nAlso- if you\u2019re more interested in biotech research rather than academic/government research, I\u2019d recommend trying to get a job or internship at a biotech company. One of my friends had an internship (for academic credit) to work at a biotech company one semester senior year, and then worked there after he graduated for a bit.",

There\u2019s also private companies. Again, a lot of it is seasonal. But my job this past summer $16ish but I got free housing (it was actually a vacation rental house on the coast of Oregon. Super super nice). A lot of people in my field will do a wildlife job from April-August and then a fish job from like October-December or do a winter lab job. You do two or three seasons as a seasonal and then you can get permanent positions. Or really lucky people can get permanent straight out of college. It\u2019s definitely not for everyone. But I loved it cause I got a lot of variety in the work I was doing and what animal I was studying and got to see a lot of the country and was able to pay my bills and save quite a bit. Im only going back for my masters now because I want to do more with academia. But I would\u2019ve been totally fine with doing another year of seasonal stuff then applying for permanent positions.",

For example, I'm fairly certain that a minor in business data analytics (major in CS) helped me land an internship at a financial institution. However, it's definitely not important enough to agonize over. My general advice to first years has been to pursue a major in a field that is different enough from their major to give them a cognitive break and satiate some interest. Getting a chem minor on a bio major seems hardly worth it, since a minor will only express basic knowledge on a subject and bio majors are already expected to have a basic competency in chemistry. Same can be said for CS majors who do math minors. Sure, it might show you're better at math than most CS majors, but CS majors are already expected to be good at math. \n\nIn OPs case, I would recommend getting something like a statistics, data analytics, or computer science minor if any of those things interest them. If those all sound boring as hell, either drop the idea of a minor or choose something that is actually interesting to them regardless of job prospects. For example, after that internship I dropped the analytics minor in favor of a European History. completely useless to my career but extremely interesting to me personally. Later I turned it into a major, but that was definitely an emotional choice rather than a rational one.",
