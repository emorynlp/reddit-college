I am currently majoring in biology, and minoring in chemistry. I had origninally planned on going to medical school, but I'm not sure it's right for me. I am certain I want to go to graduate school, but am not sure how long after obtaining my bachelors I would like to persue more education.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hear often that a biology major can be completely useless, unless I want to be a doctor. I am passionate about biology, so I feel as though I should continue with this major, especially since I am nearing the end of my bachelors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not so sure about my minor now, however. What good will a chemistry minor do for me? I'm considering completing a  buisness minor instead, because I feel it will give me more practical skills. I'm not sure how a biology major and a buisness minor will go together though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest fear is graduating, struggle to find a job, and feeling like I wasted my time and money on a worthless degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit\\] Thank you for all of the replies! I am completing an internship this semester that has given me tons of connections in biology fields, and has really opened my eyes to all of the options biology has to offer. \n\nI am now planning on applying to vet school when I graduate!
