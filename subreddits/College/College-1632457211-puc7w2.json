  "text": "Hello,\nI'll be starting my classes for Computer Science Engineering in college after a few weeks and I am super stressed right now. \nI feel like, thanks to the pandemic and online classes, I don't remember a thing I was taught in Class 12. \nI am scared that one of the professors will ask me something basic and I won't be able to answer it and I will humiliate myself in front of my peers and professors for the rest of my life. \nCan anyone please suggest any good tips as to what formulas I should revise up before going to college in subjects like Maths and Physics? Also, can someone suggest any way I can reduce my stress levels?",
