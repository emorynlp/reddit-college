The mumbles are consistent, like MMmMMm three times for a few seconds, but every once in a while it is apparently replaced with a frightened, curt yell/scream. I feel so bad for my roommates (and i can't hear myself doing this). Is there a solution? I don't know what's the source of this but it might be stress?",
