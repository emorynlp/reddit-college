  "text": "My classes are all online right now. I work on my coursework every. day. I haven\u2019t had a day off in two weeks. My brain is fried. If I have to explain in detail the Caribbean Diaspora or GNI one more time I think I might actually lose my mind. How do people do a full time schedule????? Sure I get a rest in the evening\u2026but my brain is like, at capacity right now. How am I supposed to have a break? Is it some sick joke? Sure feels that way. \n\nMainly my GEO 101 class; my professor is one who is very specific and gives so. much. information. She\u2019s super nit picky and it gives me anxiety. She has a 12 page syllabus compared to the three page ones for my other classes. All her assignments might as well have an essay for instructions. \nPlease send help I have depression I don\u2019t have the mental health for this. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about that assignment i\u2019ve yet to finish. \n\nAnything would be helpful. Like study and organization tips, anything. I use a planner, and have a notebook for each class with the schedule. I try and do things in order of due dates and importance. The sheer quantity of work is maddening. Especially when I\u2019m trying to maintain my 4.0. Help",

      "text": "I barely graduated highschool with a perfect GPA and vowed to not stress over it nearly as much in college. Helps a lot with decreasing the sense of overwhelment from work since you know that it won't have to be executed perfectly.\n\nalso think of the work as meaningful practice for your career instead of schoolwork and that might help too",

          "text": "Thanks. I\u2019m mostly just worried about getting accepted into the University I want to attend, otherwise I would probably care much less about my GPA. I understand I should probably worry a bit less anyways. I guess I\u2019m just shocked that full time means full time\u2026 and overwhelmed because I want to do a good job on everything. You\u2019re right though, thinking about it in context with my goals for the future helps. I\u2019m super passionate about what I want to do, so that helps at least.",
