  "text": "So at my college we all sorted our self's into the groups and made whatsApp group so we can send stuff about homework, projects and shit like that.\n\nSome of the people there can be somewhat mean tho. So far no one wronged me but who knows if they might in the future. Couple days back couple of them were somewhat rude towards this one guy for no reason. I would have said something if my future at college didn't depend on those assholes. I need them for extra information and stuff u don't hear or understand. So it is for the best to not make enemies and keep my feelings under control.",
