  "text": "I am aware that APA accreditation is the gold standard for psychology counseling/clinical programs and that there are currently no online accredited programs. I am looking for an online program within this realm (I am interested in developmental psych) but that is more research based rather than clinical.\n\nWith that, are there any online programs that might fit this bill and not be looked at as a joke? I have always wanted to get my doctorate to work as a professor eventually. I am graduating soon with my master\u2019s. I have a baby now so unfortunately attending on campus classes is not a possibility for the foreseeable future, nor are there any local schools with programs I am interested in. Let me know if you are aware of any good programs or not",
