In high school we would get yelled at for bringing backpacks to class lol. Sorry I probably sound really stupid but I don't know what to bring.",

You should bring your laptop (and charger) and/or a notebook and pens to take notes (up to you if you prefer typed or handwritten notes), a bottle of water/whatever you want to drink, and any other basic thing you might want to carry in a backpack (like hand sanitizer, tissues, whatever). Good luck!",

It is advisable to bring a water bottle with you. As far as food goes, your rooms will likely say that food and drink are prohibited, but no one really enforces that. On the other hand, eating in class kind of makes you look like an ass, so I would avoid bringing food. Water though is fine.",

      "text": "Faculty here.\n\nYes, backpacks are fine.  Just be sure it's not an enormous bag that takes up lots of room.  Space is at a premium these days because of social distancing rules.  But a standard sized backpack, purse, or any other conveyance that you can easily store next to your feet on the floor should generally be fine.\n\nYou should also bring all supplies you will need to participate in class - notebooks, pencils, pens, highlighters, calculator, etc.\n\nLaptop - this will vary from class to class.  Some faculty allow laptops or ipads for note taking.  Some faculty don't allow electronic devices so that students are not tempted to just sit there on social media or Youtube for the whole class period.  So if you want to bring a laptop for taking notes, just ask each of your professors what the rules for that particular class are.\n\nBeverages - most professors don't mind students having a small beverage with them (a water bottle, cup of coffee or tea *with lid*, soda, juice, etc).  Just keep it reasonable, nothing outlandish like bringing your own coffee pot or espresso machine and expecting to sit in the back brewing your own beverages.\n\nFood policy can be a bit more variable from professor to professor.  Some don't mind you bringing a small, *unobtrusive* snack to the lectures.  Most of us would prefer you do not bring a full three course meal and unpack and eat it during the lecture or anything like that; it's just too distracting.  Also, make sure whatever you bring is not disruptive, which means no foods with strong or pungent odors (like the unwritten etiquette for bringing food on airplanes, basically).  Finally, keep in mind that some universities simply ban food and drinks in their lecture halls, but if that's the case, there are usually signs posted.\n\nGood luck with your in person classes.",
