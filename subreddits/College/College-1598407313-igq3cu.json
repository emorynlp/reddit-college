  "title:": "Please, please, please do NOT party during a pandemic. Please keep your community safe and healthy.",
  "text": "I know this topic was already talked about. I wanted to share this because if you party, you are threatening the whole fall semester. \n\nKeep in mind people can rat you out. \"I hope your having a good time...by the way the campus police are on their way.\" Keep in mind you can get reported to the university. They're taking anonymous covid reports at some universities and it can cost you and your education.\n\nUniversities are taking this seriously. They don't care about your opinion on covid-19. They will take the precautions and send you HOME.\n\nEdit: Hello. I just wanted to share a few things. \n\n1. This post was for people who are attending large gatherings with no mask on. There have been reports at my school for partying and large gatherings which was concerning students, staff, families, and the community. Please keep in mind that old people, non-college students, and families live in your area.\n\n2. Yes, college can be about fun. I loved going to parties and bars with my friends. Right now we need to wait. We are literally going through a PANDEMIC. Yes, you may not be high risk and healthy but those around you may not. \n\n3. One semester without partying isn't gonna hurt you. \n\n4. Do you want the same scenario that recently happened at UNC? No? Then practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you are really exhausting me so I will explain it again. This post is in regards to those that are attending large parties during a PANDEMIC. There's a difference between going to a party that has 30 people with no mask on vs hanging out with your friend wearing a mask and practicing social distancing.",

      "text": "As a broad warning: I consider any comments *encouraging* students to party (Zoom parties exempted!) to be a breach of rule 3 on the sidebar. I consider it a breach specifically because it is against university rules in most places, or is outright illegal, on top of it being a dangerous activity in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n**Good:** Discussion about the relative risks for university students/staff. Discussion of university rules and their appropriateness. Just... civil discussion.\n\n**Not good:** Saying you're going to party and no one can stop you. Telling others to go out partying. Telling others to catch COVID on purpose. \n\nIf you see someone being a right ass or breaking the sub rules, please report it to us so we can get to it faster. In the meantime, try not to feed the trolls because it makes it harder to clean up.\n\nThank you to (almost) everyone for having civil conversations! :)",

      "text": "I can\u2019t believe my senior year comes down to 50k and a weeks of classes before we go online. There are parties everywhere. If there are 20 in a yard and I know the house has maybe 5 bedrooms, chances are they don\u2019t all live together. Oh and they all show up at the new party down. But it\u2019s not just the pandemic rules. My downstairs neighbors have been partying and making tons of noise. We tried so hard to reason with them. Party below me until 3am with work at 8am sucks. Obviously we don\u2019t want to just get someone into huge trouble, but can\u2019t you all be a little more considerate about your partying on a Tuesday night??? \n\nAlso yes my school did have a video find it\u2019s way online that showed a whole bunch of freshmen partying on the quad. How can a huge university ranked as top party school not see this coming? Some students are dumb, but man the school feels a little too willing to look the other way and let students in campus.",

I lost my physical health gains, but back on the weight I lost, lost the scholarships I busted my ass all last year for because my grades tanked. Emotionally I lost the gains I made and went back to the emotional trainwreck I was before. And then the connections I made with people were all lost. Most friends made no effort to stay in touch despite me trying to reach out. Loneliness has always ate away at me and I've never felt lonelier than now...\n\nSo that's about why I feel so bitter about this whole situation, off the top of my head. I'm sorry for being rude to you. I'm just really struggling with this whole situation and my anger comes out sometimes. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from",

No one is listening and no one is doing anything to enforce social distancing in our college town. we even have cops playing a few throws of beer pong in an outdoor group of well over the max (without masks). I do not understand... I understand when you stick a bunch of young adults in an environment with this much freedom, there\u2019s going to be a desire to party. I just wish more people could set aside that urge just for a little so that someday soon we can get back to it. Trust me, I wanna get fucken zonked at the local sticky club and their unspeakable activities just as much as the next guy, but I can get belligerent more in the long run if we just do what needs to be done. I pray we contain our cases, and remain open not only for the partying sake but most importantly the health of others. Too many lives have been lost already..losing more for the sake of getting drunk does not sound worth it to me, but I know not everyone is going to think like I do. \n\nSigh.",

Many towns have little to no cases, my town in particular had 11 cases from illegals and we basically have zero cases from locals.  \n\n\nAs for the big cities, even if they didn't shut down, the cases would be negligible.  \nWe also have a very real problem that hospitals are classifying deaths as covid victims when there was other issues with the patient.  \n\n\nWe keep seeing this articles about some \"healthy\" person dying, when you look at their picture they are a donut away from a heart attack. They could barely breath walking up a single flight of stairs as it was.  \n\n\nCanada's cities are probably worse off because humidity is higher as well as having people far less healthy in general. Many of the Canadians I've met are dying from veganism, or dying from eating too much red meat. It's always the extremes with Canada, very nice or very rude.  \n\n\nAsian countries are insanely populated, and way more dense than other western cities.  \n\n\nBut even then, out of all the deaths WORLD WIDE, 822,000 deaths out of 7,800,000,000 is only 0.00010538461%\\~  \n\n\nThat's nothing in comparison to our typical deaths from other random stuff.  \n\n\nThere will end up being more deaths if healthy people are being told to be afraid and stay inside under threat of persecution if it leads to civil unrest and eventually civil war.  \n\n\nThe people have nothing else to do, while small community businesses are being denied and big businesses are allowed to further monopolize.  \nWe have people who think if they don't get their version of justice they can terrorize the people. Yes, the \"No justice, no peace\" crowd. Text book insurgents.  \nWe also now have people going out to fight those terrorists. Text book freedom fighters.  \n\n\nReddit can't be that obtuse to the unfolding reality.",

If it isn't partying it'll be something else. The virus is going to spread on campuses, it's impossible to enforce the rules to prevent it unless you lock students in their rooms.\n\nIt was an incredibly bad idea to ask college students, many of whom have never even lived away from their parents before, to take responsibility for controlling an extremely contagious virus that is of little threat to them individually. It simply doesn't matter how much you plead for them to behave, enough of them will fuck it up and it snowballs from there. Punishments don't un-spread the virus. This was so painfully obvious to everyone that it speaks more to the ineptitude and greed of college administrations than it speaks to the irresponsibility of students.\n\nWhen people's lives are on the line, keeping those people safe is not a responsibility you give to teenagers and people that just hit drinking age. You just don't fucking do it.",
