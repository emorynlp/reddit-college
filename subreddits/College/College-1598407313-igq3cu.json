Please keep your community safe and healthy.", "text": "I know this topic was already talked about. I wanted to share this because if you party, you are threatening the whole fall semester. \n\nKeep in mind people can rat you out. \"I hope your having a good time...by the way the campus police are on their way.\" Keep in mind you can get reported to the university. They're taking anonymous covid reports at some universities and it can cost you and your education.\n\nUniversities are taking this seriously. They don't care about your opinion on covid-19. They will take the precautions and send you HOME.\n\nEdit: Hello. I just wanted to share a few things. \n\n1. This post was for people who are attending large gatherings with no mask on. There have been reports at my school for partying and large gatherings which was concerning students, staff, families, and the community. Please keep in mind that old people, non-college students, and families live in your area.\n\n2. Yes, college can be about fun. I loved going to parties and bars with my friends. Right now we need to wait. We are literally going through a PANDEMIC. Yes, you may not be high risk and healthy but those around you may not. \n\n3. One semester without partying isn't gonna hurt you. \n\n4. Do you want the same scenario that recently happened at UNC? No? Then practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you are really exhausting me so I will explain it again. This post is in regards to those that are attending large parties during a PANDEMIC. There's a difference between going to a party that has 30 people with no mask on vs hanging out with your friend wearing a mask and practicing social distancing.", "author": "agentjakethedog", "created": 1598407313, "retrieved": 1632801567, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2724, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"g2w4qjd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/igq3cu/please_please_please_do_not_party_during_a/g2w4qjd/", "text": "As a broad warning: I consider any comments *encouraging* students to party (Zoom parties exempted!) to be a breach of rule 3 on the sidebar.
