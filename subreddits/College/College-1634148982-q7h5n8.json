  "text": "I had fall break recently from October 9th to October 12th. Instead of having an in class midterm, I was assigned an essay to write out of class. Classes resume on the 13th, and it is due on the 14th(when my class meets). Because I actually used my break to do a minimal amount of work, I now have to write a 1200 word essay(not that bad but still) in a day. Why is school like this",
