Dorm Room String Lights Have No Off Switch", "text": "I recently purchased and set up string lights in my room, and I am in love with them. They use up three AA batteries, but the problem is that they have no off switch. I just either put in the batteries and have the lights on or take the batteries out to have it off. \n\nDoes anyone have recommendation on how I should go about this? Should I just keep the batteries in and the lights on the whole time or take them out when I\u2019m not using the lights (AKA in the morning/afternoon and when I\u2019m not in the room) or any other suggestion? \n\nI really want the batteries and the lights to last as long as possible.
