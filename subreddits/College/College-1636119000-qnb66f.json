If you plan on going to a school with more than just engineering students you will likely be studying and having a little less fun than a lot of other students at the school. If you can become good with time management there is definitely time for fun though. Once you get to upper level courses it can become really interesting, especially if you can take classes in fields you enjoy. But along the way you will definitely encounter some really tough classes that may honestly make you feel like quitting while you\u2019re taking them. If you can power through and pass these classes (not always the first time necessarily), with a decent gpa, you can likely get a secure job that pays very well. Not trying to discourage or encourage you, but just be prepared if this is your choice.",

If you are interested in thinking about language scientifically, then linguistics is a great field to pursue. Taking an introductory course can help you see if you are interested as they tend to be a survey of the \"core fields\" along with some additional content on more applied fields.",

I started out with Business because I envisioned owning my own business and thought it was a major with guaranteed money-making results. I quit because the content was just so fucking boring and a solely money-oriented mindset doesn't get anyone far .\n\nSecond choice was Criminology. I thought about becoming a police officer and eventual FBI agent. While motivating in theory, the amount of reading and writing about theories and the law turned out to be just as boring. I realized this too late because I ended up going to the UK as an international student and later withdrew.\n\nBut while I was there after quitting Criminology, I gathered an interest in Biology so was able to stay and began pursuing Pharmacology and Physiology but with no clue as to where I wanted it to lead. But this is where I withdrew because schooling the UK is far more difficult and ultimately proved to be a monumental waste of money for me as a non-UK/EU students. So it was time to abandon this one, and my interest in Biology faded. \n\nNext up was computers/programming. Intended to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science/Engineering. While I did obtain a College Credit Certificate as a Computer Programming Specialist, this was the extent of my journey here because I literally still have no idea how to code nor do I understand any of it, and so, again, I quit this major. I cheated my way through with github and Chegg. Programming was just far too complex. I may as well have been learning Korean. Another big regret, unfortunately. \n\nNow I'm where I am today, pursuing my Associates in Medical Sciences. I don't regret any of it. I absolutely enjoy the science and math and am on my way to earning excellent grades in a major I both understand and don't dread looking forward to genuinely doing the work. So much so that I am happy to plan on getting my Bachelor's in Biomedical Science and considering med school at some point. I have no idea what life has in store but being a doctor will remain as a career option for now.",

My first degree ever :) \nI chose it because I have a mild form of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bone Disease) that's primarily in my wrists, ankles, and hands/feet. So I can't stand manual labor, and I can't be on my feet for long hours due to pain. So my original plans of being a Doctor or a Lawyer are kinda out the window. \nBusiness is something else I was interested in, and I figured out that if you get a business degree in certain fields you can work for the legal side of HR. Thereby allowing me to be in the legal field in some degree. \nIn other words, two birds one stone lol",

Yes, I hate myself. \n\nJk, I actually have a really long and funny story about how this all happened. I started out as a biochem premed major. I was aceing the classes but I hated every second of it. I decided to try biomedical research instead, but I hated that too. So eventually I decided to try pre law and changed to the humanities major. I got really bored in the humanities major so I added engineering, just to see if I could do something to get out of my funk. \n\nIt turns out I love engineering, but still want to go to law school. Either for patent law or something else. So I will graduate having taken five years, with a dual degree in engineering and humanities, and hopefully go to law school. It\u2019s been a very interesting ride, lol",

I changed to env eng a few years ago because I knew I wanted to do something environmental/to help combat climate change and protect the planet, but it turns out I hate engineering and would rather off myself than  get an engineering internship or job. I\u2019ve always excelled in and loved advanced math, physics, and chemistry, and I\u2019m a weirdo who enjoyed my thermodynamics and fluid mechanics classes in engineering. I liked the science basis of the field but designing stormwater pipe systems or wastewater treatment plants was beyond boring and made me want to stick needles in my eyes. \n\nI got involved in climate modeling research in January out of pure luck. I was still engineering at the time and I was looking for a way out, and I was thinking about grad school in an earth/geoscience field since I realized I love the science, not the application. And this was easily the best thing I\u2019ve done in college because it finally (in my fourth year \ud83d\udc80) gave me a sense of direction and purpose. \n\nAt the end of last semester I changed my major to atmospheric sciences. I wanted to learn more about the earth instead of about man-made systems, and I was fed up with the engineering department at my school. I love the department and classes I\u2019m in now and adding a semester is definitely worth making this change. It\u2019s nice to know what you want to do with your life lol",

However, I took what was supposed to be my one and only college level math class and I loved it so much. The professor told me I had the mind of a mathematician, which was so unheard of for me. I never thought I was even good at math. I ended up messing around with various STEM majors since now I was supposedly good at math, but I eventually ended up as a math major. I graduated with my BS in math and then got my MA in math. I'm now in a PhD program for math education. I want to help other people like math and make it a better field so more people can feel like they have the mind of a mathematician.",

I thought going to community college to start with my GEs would give the universe time to let me know but since I still didn\u2019t think of the future/ didn\u2019t really have any major career deciding events happen I still had NO IDEA!! I even considered joining the military so I could have even more time!!!!\n\nOnce I pretty much finished my GEs I tried getting a culinary certificate because I was a cake decorator and liked what I did and thought I would go for it. Turns out I\u2019m not the best baker (but really good with the artistic side of baking haha) and the hours/ amount of time carrying heavy items and standing on my feet literally killed me. I remember calling my dad from the Whole Foods Market employee bathroom to tell him I didn\u2019t want to do this for the rest of my life and that I would be dropping out of the program. \n\nHe let me take a semester off but told me I HAD to choose something by next semester so I just picked Studio Art in hopes of gaining the skills to become an animator since I LoVE cartoons and animation videos\n\nI\u2019m now on track to get my Studio Art associates this spring! And hopefully transfer to my top pick of state schools! Wish me luck! (I\u2019ve been putting off sending in the applications because I\u2019m nervous XS )",

      "text": "Funny enough I started out as a French ESL Education major but switched to Linguistics once I realized I would only have a K-12 teaching certificate when I want to be a professor. So I switched from the Education track to Linguistics and just recently, I've added French as my second major since I really adore French and plan on taking a course every semester if I can. So currently I'm dual-majoring in Linguistic and French!\n\nI initially majored in Linguistics as I am really interested in connections/influences between languages but I'll most likely make it my minor as my university requires Linguistic majors to learn a non-European language, as well as a European language and I'm just interested in learning Romance/Germanic languages! My dream would honestly be able to learn German and focus on how German and French have influenced the English language (Americanized English). \n\nAs for why I dual-majored with French, I took Latin for two years during high school with the purpose of learning French or Spanish my senior year. In my last semester of high school, I took French and *immediately* fell in love with the language. Its music (Stromae, Angele, Indilla), movies/tv shows (The Monster in Paris, Lupin), YouTubers (Bob Lennon, French Mornings with Elise), etc... I just felt this immediate connection to it on my first day of class that I've never had with any other subject. I'm taking French right now and, while the class is absolutely terrible, I still adore the language and love learning it, so I hope that it's a sign that this major is the right choice pour moi!",

The way I came to choose that major is an interesting story: so, when I started college back in the fall of 2016, I initially was a chemistry major with intentions of either going to medical school or pharmacy school. I didn't do well in Gen Chem (general chemistry) and I found out that the college I initially attended wasn't a very good fit for me, so I transferred to my local community college to figure out what I wanted to pursue.   I chose computer forensics ad a major (with the intention of potentially getting a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity), but after a programming class I took with a horrible professor, I decided to not pursue that degree either. I knew I had to take a couple criminal justice classes for that degree (and the switch of major was going to take time for the system to update) so I registered for those classes, and I ended up really loving it and doing well with it! I graduated with my Associates Degree in Criminal Justice, and then I transferred to the college I currently attend to continue my education and get my bachelor's degree. I'm now on track to go to law school (I'm currently studying for the LSAT) and I have an internship at the DAs office in the county where my college is.",

When I was applying for university I considered doing premed (Bio or Chem) but I just hate everything med-related so I discarded that option, then I found Economics and started searching more and more about it, I even took a short course about it and I just fell in love right away! The job prospects are great, the content interests me a lot and Econ can be applied in basically anywhere so that gives me lots of flexibility as where to work in the future.\n\nThen I saw that a lot of people double major with Econ and I started looking for double major options to see if anything interested me. I found the possibility of doing Econ and CS and once again fell in love with the job prospects. Most schools I applied to didn't offer that option because CS itself is very competitive program, so I found out that my current college offers a double major in Econ and Math with an emphasis on CS. At first I was a little skeptical about doing Math/CS because I've always been deadass scared of Math throughout my whole school life, but decided to shoot my shot and oh boy, am I loving it? I'm doing so much better in college Math than I used to in HS Math, and besides that, just my Math major itself will open up a lot of doors for me so it's perfect and I'm really happy! Now I'm keeping politics just as a hobby.",

During my teenage years I had grown an interest in the design and development of our built environment. After hearing about Cornell University's Urban & Regional Studies major, I applied and got in. However what I hadn't realized was that the undergraduate program was basically just reading and writing about policy. I mean, that's inevitable, but it was practically all I was doing within my major. I grew to hate it and at the end of my first year I took a health leave of absence.\nAt the time I had a hobby of photographing old buildings, and I had been speaking up about historic buildings in my hometown being renovated beyond recognition or left to rot until they collapsed. A family friend, who happened to be a Cornell alum funny enough, suggested I look into a historic preservation undergraduate program at a small state university less than an hour drive from home. I applied to transfer in and was accepted (because it isn't every day someone decides to give you a chance over fking Cornell). After my first semester I was hooked. Architecture history, preservation technology, battlefield preservation, museum design, and more. At the end of my first year there, a mutual friend got me in contact with an architect who does historic building rehabilitations, and he hired me. For the past three years I've been measuring buildings and co-writing historic building surveys, and last year I was appointed as a commissioner to my hometown's historic landmarks commission, which has been an insane crash-course in small-town political drama. All of this and I'm only a senior in my undergrad.\nSo yeah, I didn't get it the first time, but I listened to my interests and gave them more value than my notion of a prestigious education and it has gone really well.",

      "text": "Mechanical engineering in physics. Fortunately I busted my ass in high school academic academically wise, And I took a lot of dual credit classes classes a lot of AP classes and I was essentially able to knock out about the 1st year of my core requirements from my University. Before I like hit the maximum for the number of credits they will give you for exams and not sort of thing. And that sort of thing. But it gave me a lot of breathing room to actually kind of design my schedule so while yes I'm doing math until about 2:00 in the morning I was able to break it up so I have more intense semesters and lighter terms, Considering my University operates on like a trimester quarter system thing even though we have summer classes so we technically have 4/4 kind of like Dartmouth 4 seasonal quarters in the academic calendar like Dartmouth. Classes are a little bit shorter so we aren't on the semester system so I can already take more classes than other students at their schools and double majoring is very common at my University because of this.  I have been able to study abroad twice. And I'm on track to graduate with a double major and a minor minor minor in 4 years. And I've been able to participate in rowing,  Fencing in the rocket society at my University. In addition to my fraternity and just building random side projects for the hell of it.\n\nCollege is basically about time management and in some cases that time management starts before you even get to college which sucks but depending on your major like we all know business majors can party a lot more than other majors like communications and journalism chances are they're going to have a hell of a lot more of a social life than guys may drink it's majoring in or just students in general majoring in stemfields. Only so many students know the pain of multi variable calculus at at 4 AM or discreet systems studying and studying and solutions just as the sun rises when you didn't even realize it had set as the part of the library you chose to set up shopping for that particular study session didn't have windows within your line of sight in that moment. But instead of walking out of the building to go to bed you walk over across the qulover across the quad to the rag and have to get a triple espresso before going to your 8 AM class only mid lecture and then panic because the girl sitting next you has to shake you awake because there is a test.\n\nBrickside is you get 87 downside is you're not sure what day it is",

Sophomore year I wasn\u2019t doing well in a lot of the science-based classes, ended up changing my concentration to management. Junior year I took the fall semester off because of the loss of identity I was experiencing. Thought about recreational therapy, hospitality and tourism, Human Resources. Going into spring semester I declared a brain and behavioral sciences major. And then shortly after changed my mind and declared a human services major. And then eventually landed on a psychology major. I did those three major changes within my first month back after that break. I decided to supplement my psych degree with a minor in Human Resources. I took one class for it. Did well but I changed my mind again by the time senior year came around and went for a criminology minor instead. So ultimately i ended with a psych degree with a minor in criminology. \n\nWith what I\u2019m doing for work right now, I do wish I would\u2019ve discovered this passion/interest sooner.

In the beginning of fourth year I changed my major to English. Had three semesters of pure English classes (including this semester). And was insanely happy with the challenge and just the sheer fact that I really enjoy English. Now I'm on my second to last semester. Next semester I am only taking random courses to get the required units. I don't regret being here for 5 years. I would have regretted still being a liberal studies major though. Now I graduate next semester. Already have my grad forms all filled out. And I'm doing really well. Since I changed my major I've been on dean's list each semester. And couldn't be happier.",
