      "text": "AA in Medical Sciences with the intention of furthering it to a BS in Biomedical Science. \n\nCollege life for me has been wildly difficult. I'm literally on my 5th major. I started out with Business because I envisioned owning my own business and thought it was a major with guaranteed money-making results. I quit because the content was just so fucking boring and a solely money-oriented mindset doesn't get anyone far .\n\nSecond choice was Criminology. I thought about becoming a police officer and eventual FBI agent. While motivating in theory, the amount of reading and writing about theories and the law turned out to be just as boring. I realized this too late because I ended up going to the UK as an international student and later withdrew.\n\nBut while I was there after quitting Criminology, I gathered an interest in Biology so was able to stay and began pursuing Pharmacology and Physiology but with no clue as to where I wanted it to lead. But this is where I withdrew because schooling the UK is far more difficult and ultimately proved to be a monumental waste of money for me as a non-UK/EU students. So it was time to abandon this one, and my interest in Biology faded. \n\nNext up was computers/programming. Intended to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science/Engineering. While I did obtain a College Credit Certificate as a Computer Programming Specialist, this was the extent of my journey here because I literally still have no idea how to code nor do I understand any of it, and so, again, I quit this major. I cheated my way through with github and Chegg. Programming was just far too complex. I may as well have been learning Korean. Another big regret, unfortunately. \n\nNow I'm where I am today, pursuing my Associates in Medical Sciences. I don't regret any of it. I absolutely enjoy the science and math and am on my way to earning excellent grades in a major I both understand and don't dread looking forward to genuinely doing the work. So much so that I am happy to plan on getting my Bachelor's in Biomedical Science and considering med school at some point. I have no idea what life has in store but being a doctor will remain as a career option for now.",

So I can't stand manual labor, and I can't be on my feet for long hours due to pain. So my original plans of being a Doctor or a Lawyer are kinda out the window. \nBusiness is something else I was interested in, and I figured out that if you get a business degree in certain fields you can work for the legal side of HR. Thereby allowing me to be in the legal field in some degree. \nIn other words, two birds one stone lol",

I was aceing the classes but I hated every second of it. I decided to try biomedical research instead, but I hated that too. So eventually I decided to try pre law and changed to the humanities major. I got really bored in the humanities major so I added engineering, just to see if I could do something to get out of my funk. \n\nIt turns out I love engineering, but still want to go to law school. Either for patent law or something else. So I will graduate having taken five years, with a dual degree in engineering and humanities, and hopefully go to law school.

I\u2019ve always excelled in and loved advanced math, physics, and chemistry, and I\u2019m a weirdo who enjoyed my thermodynamics and fluid mechanics classes in engineering. I liked the science basis of the field but designing stormwater pipe systems or wastewater treatment plants was beyond boring and made me want to stick needles in my eyes. \n\nI got involved in climate modeling research in January out of pure luck. I was still engineering at the time and I was looking for a way out, and I was thinking about grad school in an earth/geoscience field since I realized I love the science, not the application. And this was easily the best thing I\u2019ve done in college because it finally (in my fourth year \ud83d\udc80) gave me a sense of direction and purpose. \n\nAt the end of last semester I changed my major to atmospheric sciences. I wanted to learn more about the earth instead of about man-made systems, and I was fed up with the engineering department at my school. I love the department and classes I\u2019m in now and adding a semester is definitely worth making this change. It\u2019s nice to know what you want to do with your life lol",
