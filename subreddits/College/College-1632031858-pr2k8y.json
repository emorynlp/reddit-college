I could barely hear myself so I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve talked to someone.",

I've been told this about some parties that were absolute garbage. However, there have also been VERY great parties.\n\nThe underlying problem here probably is your general lack of social skills and lack of self esteem.\n\nDo more 'scary' things. Whatever those are to you. And just talk to people. Make a habit of talking with people whenever possible.",

Usually, those times have been miserable, triggered my anxiety, and made things worse for me. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to throw out phrases like \u201cyou\u2019ll regret what you don\u2019t do!\u201d And \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to lose!\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily agree with them. I think they\u2019re true to an extent, but in moderation- they shouldn\u2019t be applied to everything. Go out of your comfort zone, but also know your boundaries. At the end of the day, you know yourself more than anyone and should have a pretty good gauge on what you will/won\u2019t like. So do what YOU truly want.",
