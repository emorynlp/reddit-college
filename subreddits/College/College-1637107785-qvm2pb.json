  "text": "I picked civil engineering, and I regret it. It\u2019s not how I\u2019m\u2026 my family is pressuring me to stay in it, but I\u2019m so done with it. I want to do something else, but the thing is that my parents are the ones who pay for my tuition. I can\u2019t just quit like that because they would kick me out if I ever talk to them about switching programs. I\u2019m in a deep hole lol.",

So I\u2019m contemplating on dropping from engineering. Thank god in high school I took chemistry and biology too, so I can pursue another fields.",
