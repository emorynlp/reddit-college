  "title:": "Should I drop out of college?",
  "text": "Im currently in a university in Philippines taking Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing Majoring in Animation. Also, I am a 4th Year student who is about to graduate provided I survive this school year. College wasnt really my first choice, I never wanted to be here, I was just forced into it by my parents since they want me to have a \"good life\", \"get a job', and 'make money'. Problem is, I can make money without earning a diploma, I can get a job without the validation of college universities. So like, whats the point anymore? Ive been enduring all the bullshit things that's been happening in my university, including unnecessary subjects that are totally a waste of time. I could have used that time on taking a more useful subjects such as stocks. I know its pretty stupid for me to post something like this now that I only have a year before graduating (like i said provided I pass this year) but i am just really so fed up with all of this. If I am going to drop out, I am confident that I have the persistence and enough skill to survive and make a living. I just think that college is not for me or the right choice for my career. In fact, I think college is a big hindrance for me.  \n\n\nI am open to every opinion and probably will post an update after a year or month about the status of my schooling.",

If you were a couple years away from graduating i'd say just dropout, but you're almost finished so i'd say just push through it. \n\nRemember, you don't need to be an A student to graduate. If you don't plan on using your degree, just put in minimal effort and get passing grades and focus on other things. It doesn't take much effort to get D's and pass all of your classes.",
