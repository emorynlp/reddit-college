  "text": "I'm currently a first year college student attending community college. Based on the title I know some people may argue that community college is easy or at least easier than high school. As I was saying, I'm a first year and things were going well until about a month ago. I have these bi-weekly exams where I need to write a 2 page essay and write out a vocabulary sheet, they're due every Sunday. The first one I did ok with, the second exam I only got half credit because I wasn't able to finish the vocab sheet and essay completely. There are 8 exams in total and for the past month I ended up not turning 3 more of those exams. I know it's supposed to be easy, it's literally only to pages of writing but my mental health  has worsened over time and things are getting bad again... I don't want to use that as an excuse even though I know its clearly affecting my life negatively. I fear that if things keep going like this I won't pass the semester. I know I need to email my professor on what's going on but I have no idea how to go about it.",
