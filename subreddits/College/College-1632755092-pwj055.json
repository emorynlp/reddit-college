We all hope that the education we're getting is genuinely valuable and indicative of capability, and it can be (see the second and third points), but at the end of the day, the most important thing you're paying for is the ability to say \"I have a degree from x university so you should hire me\". Of course, in reality, simply graduating doesn't equalize everyone, and some people come out of college significantly more prepared for a career than others. This brings me to point 2: the opportunity to create a good education for yourself. Lectures and tests in and of themselves aren't what makes college education special and valuable - theoretically you could just buy the books and teach yourself everything. The value comes in what you do besides the bare minimum - in meeting professors and classmates with new ideas and experiences, making connections in academia and industry, and utilizing opportunities for research and activities that you wouldn't be able to justify funding yourself. This is why grad school admissions are beginning to consider research and engagement nearly as heavily as GPA and test scores recently. Finally, reason 3: The ease and confidence of having a semi-set curriculum. The reason you and employers both feel confident that a degree prepared you well for real-world work is that curriculums are standardized. You are able to move along a preordained path, sprinkling in things you are interested in among standard classes that the university has deemed useful based on data from academia and industry. \n\nTL;DR - If all you're doing is going to lecture, doing homework, and passing your assessments, then no matter where you're going you won't be getting the full benefits of a college education.", "author": "Jack_Rickle", "created": 1632765499, "upvotes": 5}, "hehw7co": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwj055/i_go_to_a_uni_that_charges_32000_for_professors/hehw7co/", "text": "Same for me as well.
