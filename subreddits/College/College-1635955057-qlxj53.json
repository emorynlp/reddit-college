  "text": "To start off, I\u2019m 17, and have terrible adhd. I was diagnosed a few months ago and put on meds, and they do work, but not very well. I\u2019ve asked to up my dose but I have to wait. \n\nMy problem is that My alarm will go off and I walk across the room to turn it off, I\u2019m up, but I can\u2019t make myself go to class. One part of my brain is just saying \u201cplease fukin go to class dude it\u2019s not that hard\u201d but I just won\u2019t. I can\u2019t make myself go and idk why. Same thing with my second class, I am sitting on my bed, dressed with shoes on, but I didn\u2019t go to class. I couldn\u2019t make myself. \nPlease help \n\nWhat can I do to make myself go? \n\nAlso if you\u2019re gonna tell me to just make myself walk out the door, or to care more about my college education, please dont. Thanks!!",

      "text": "Well, the good news is that you're getting up and getting dressed. That's two steps towards going to class. Despite what you said, the next step is to walk out the door. By that I don't mean go to class, I mean get used to leaving your living space when it is classtime, even on weekends or days you don't have class. Go get coffee, go for a walk, or anything else that removes you from your room. Once your OK with that, then its the next step.  \n\n\nThe thing about ADHD is that every step in the process is like an entire project in itself. You have to step the goals, hit them, and take a minute to recognize you've done it before moving on to the next stage. Through repetition and keeping a schedule you start to normalize those behaviors to the point they are no longer significant challenges, just something you do.",

      "text": "If it's at this point, this may be something you need to address with a therapist to build a skill set for when meds won't do it. I see you mentioned being on meds, but sometimes even when they are adjusted, they won't address every symptom, so it's good to build ways around those struggles.\n\n\nHas an accountability buddy ever helped? I know sometimes I've had luck if I tell a friend \"okay I need to go do this thing\" and have them help to encourage that. \n\n\nBreaking down the process may also help. Okay, getting to class may not feel obtainable. In that case, tell yourself to leave the building where you live. Less daunting. Once you're out, walk a bit, and see where your head is at, and decide from there if you can go further. Don't even necessarily hinge this on getting to class; sometimes just getting further than we do usually can help our brains with *eventually* getting to the thing we need to do.\n\n\nAlso, see if you can work with the prof. Is there a chance you can attend over Zoom on the days when things are *really* bad? Some profs may not allow this, but some do. Honestly, *any* communication about this with a prof is gonna be better than being silent about it until you see a failing grade.",
