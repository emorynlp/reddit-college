Am I the only one? What can I do? I\u2019m nervous to talk with my professors because I am genuinely so beyond lost, confused and behind that I don\u2019t even know what I would ask them for in office hours.", "author": "Critical_Clue3625", "created": 1632685199, "retrieved": 1632800253, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heeggxa": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw0rvw/im_a_senior_in_college_but_i_dont_know_what_im/heeggxa/", "text": "I would recommend that you visit a physician to see if there is a physical cause for those problems.
