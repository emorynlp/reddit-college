      "text": "What you already learned and accomplishes is impressive.\n\nI think all will depend on what you want to do in the future, for example if you want to continue acting and maybe producing, you might want to learn more literature (history, philosophy, storytelling... etc)\n\nThis will enable you to create more imaginative and deeper works of art\n\nSo the question is, do you want to have a career on the media industry, or you want a new direction?",

          "text": "Right, It\u2019s very common for people in my industry to transition from being actors and becoming producers/directors or even writers. \n\nI think time trying to get something in college was more of trying to create a bit of sense of extra security and extra income instead of necessity.  For Example, when I have my low\u2019s or time off and I don\u2019t get any movie or program/series work for a couple months, at least I could go work during my down town and keep making money",

              "text": "You should think about if you want to plan for success (Plan A as the main focus ) or plan conservatively (Plan B taking part of your focus )\n\nIf you plan with the assumption of success, you will focus on learning a major that support plan A.\n\nIt depends on the country, the career and the person. Sometimes the focus on Plan B will take away from your potential",
