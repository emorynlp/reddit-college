Hope you don't mind if I ask for your opinion here. I'm always grateful to hear students' perspectives and what works for you.\n\nFor **small** low-stakes assignments (like discussion posts, reflections, \"homework\", etc.) which professor/instructor would you prefer? \n\n**Professor A**\n\nProvides both a numerical score on every item and always includes a written comment. Written comments are usually pretty generic (and if you compared with your peers in the class, you'd see it was a lot of copy/paste).\n\n**Professor B**\n\nProvides a numerical score on every item. Only sometimes writes a comment, but comments are uniquely written for you and your work. So more personalized, but less frequent comments.\n\n  \nAgain, I'm only thinking about the very small weekly sort of things in an online class. Not larger assignments or papers, where more significant feedback is to be expected.", "author": "Violet_Plum_Tea", "created": 1632606640, "retrieved": 1632800318, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hef6i9v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvgczm/what_typequantity_of_feedback_do_you_prefer_in/hef6i9v/", "text": "Def Prof B.
