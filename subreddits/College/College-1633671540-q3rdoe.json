  "title:": "If I Get A D In One Class Can I Still Graduate?",
  "text": "This is my final semester, and I'm struggling a lot in one of my courses. I'm likely to not make above a D in it. Will I still get the units for that class that I need to graduate? This is the first course I'm getting such a low grade in, everything else I've made either an A or a B. The class is one of my \"core\" classes, not a \"major\" class, if that effects anything.",

      "text": "Idk where you\u2019re going to school but I\u2019m answering as a US college student.\n\nTypically, D\u2019s are considered \u201cpassing\u201d, but if it\u2019s a major class and hence a major requirement, you more than likely won\u2019t get credit for it and will need to retake the class. For core classes, it can be on the fence; at my school, you still need a C for core classes, but D\u2019s are fine for other schools. I would refer to your syllabus to confirm which is which. If it\u2019s not there, talk to the department dean who runs the course.\n\nBut don\u2019t give your on yourself either. I\u2019ve been in some tight spots grade wise and classes and somehow I\u2019ve pulled it off with a C. Talk to your professor and do everything you can to pass, like extra credit (if applicable), doing all the homework and projects, etc. good luck",
