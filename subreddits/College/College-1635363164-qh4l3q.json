  "text": "Hi everybody! I have a lot of questions, because I'm an International student and I didn't have an \"essay culture\" as you have.   \nDo you grade your own essays before handing it to your professor? Do they give the rubric for this assignment?  \nAny tips for doing that?  \nOh, one more \u2014 have you ever given your essay to some professional or any service before posting it?  \nI think< I would like to have some side-professor who will pre-check my works, so I can be confident in my grades, what do you think?",
