  "text": "I wanna go to uni for psych. Probably will either do a double major or minor in something else (probably some kind of science). I\u2019m having doubts because so many people have said that is major is \u201cuseless\u201d and that I \u201cwon\u2019t get a job.\u201d \nI was doing a science degree previously, but frankly, I hated it.\nI\u2019m starting again in my early 20s. \nI would also like to get a master\u2019s degree but of course that\u2019s even more time and money spent. \nHonestly, I\u2019m wondering if I should even go to university at all. But I\u2019m not sure what else I would do if I didn\u2019t.",

      "text": "Psychology is useless, *unless* you get a masters or PhD. I think around 1/3 of all bachelors' degrees are psychology but if the plan is to get a masters, I wouldn't sweat the uselessness of it. However, masters programs for psychology typically do not lead to high-paying jobs (like counseling,) and may not even be worth it by themselves if you want to be financially independent. Being a psychologist (having a PhD,) makes around six figures in an ideal scenario, but it takes lots of time and getting through bachelors, masters, and a PhD takes an enormous amount of time, money, and support.",

And there\u2019s no point in me trying to get a degree when I don\u2019t give a damn about the content. THAT would be useless.\n\nBut it sounds like I\u2019m screwed no matter what I do so RIP I guess.\nNot that I need to make over $100k. I\u2019m good with above 65-70ish. I don\u2019t live in the USA, so student debt isn\u2019t as ridiculous.",

The one at my quite average university wants business students, and there are extra hoops for non-business students. The best uni in my state requires that you have worked two years full-time at a fortune-500 company and has a class size of 65. That being said, I agree that there *are* careers for psychology students.",

There are so many 2-yr degrees that lead to in-demand jobs in the medical field and you can make 75k right out of school as long as you can move where the jobs are. In addition, the pre-reqs for these programs can be applied to other paths at 4-yr universities if you change your mind!",
