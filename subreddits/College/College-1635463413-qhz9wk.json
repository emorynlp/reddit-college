  "text": "Hi all, I am writing an essay in APA format and will be including pictures of company logos in it. I have an understanding of how to cite photos. For example:\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n*Cat*\n\n\\[Image of Cat\\]\n\n*Note.* From *Cat Images* \\[Photograph\\]*,* by C. Katt, 2021, Flickr (http://notrealwebsite.com). In the Public Domain.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut how do I do this if I am using a company logo? I struggle to even find information about when the logos were first made and who made them. What would the \\[Format\\] be, would it be \\[Photograph\\] or \\[Logo\\]?",
