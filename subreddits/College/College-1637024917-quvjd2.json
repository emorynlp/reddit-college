  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior at my university, however just thinking about my graduation and the outcome of finding a job of the current field that I\u2019m studying gives me anxiety. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m not going to find a job right after I graduate in public health. Anyone with a public health major that has a good job or gives me hope that I will find one. Any advice? Thanks! I\u2019m Mid 20\u2019s.",
