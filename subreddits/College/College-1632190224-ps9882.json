My major is computer science and I feel hopeless with it. I'm in my third computer science class and I'm still so confused with the topic and rely heavily on my friend to help me out with the exercises. I am also taking calculus 1 for the third time because the last two times, I failed. I did talk with my advisor last semester and asked the possibility of switching my major to CIS which seemed suited for me, however my advisor told me that most of my credits wouldn't transfer and I would graduate late. I was okay with that but the major problem that was blocking was money. I unfortunately am not eligible for financial aid and my mom is the one who paying my tuition in full. I really think I screwed up my options choosing this major and that I'm in this deep hole that I can't get out of. I am so anxious to think that I won't even graduate and be a disappointment to my mother. I don't know what to really do besides try my hardest and pass my classes.", "author": "Wheetos-", "created": 1632190224, "retrieved": 1632800977, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdq4maa": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps9882/i_feel_that_i_lost_my_chance_with_my_major/hdq4maa/", "text": "Hi! I was also a failed computer science major. I went into it wanting to program video games since I love video games so much, but I was bad at it, and I HATED doing any of the work and I didn\u2019t understand anything that was going on. I always had to have my ex boyfriend help me because he was so good at it and I was not. During this summer before the fall semester, I had a mental breakdown at work because I realized out of nowhere that this wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do, and now I\u2019m a physics and biochem double major. If you\u2019re not happy with it, then switch. I get the whole wasting your mom\u2019s money sucks, but it\u2019s better to switch now than waste more money, or be stuck in a field for the rest of your life that makes you feel miserable.", "author": "Jaded-Reporter", "created": 1632236642, "upvotes": 2}, "hdoqp3u": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps9882/i_feel_that_i_lost_my_chance_with_my_major/hdoqp3u/", "text": "Switch while it is early.
