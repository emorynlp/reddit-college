It's because they have more time to internalize and rethink any information regarding an assignment. For instance, if I read a prompt for an essay and write it immediately after, the essay is going to be muddled and not focused. But if I let the material and the goal of the essay marinate in my subconscious for like a month, I'll come back to it with a more focused and sensible point of view. But, of course, everything in moderation. Some of the stories I'm reading in this thread probably won't benefit from more procrastinating.",

She always thought her writing was crap compared to her classmates, but then when she would help friends out she realized that most other people are just bad at it. One thing that she said that they would do in higher tier writing courses was reviewing each other's papers critically. I'm not talking about the usual, \"good job\" most students give each other. She said that she would basically cover the other person's paper in red ink. Of course the only way to get better at something is to practice doing it and in the real world communicating your ideas is just as important as the ideas themselves. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you frame a writing assignment in a way that they think about it as practice for \"the real world\" then they might take it more seriously instead of just trying to meet word count.",

I actually really appreciate all the essays previous English teachers/professors have had me write (although I found it a hellish, stressful, and anxiety-inducing experience at the time).

Unfortunately, the only way to learn is to just practice. \n\nI know most people view essays as \"not applicable to the real world\", but I disagree. I think it's a good way to learn a more formal writing style that is more appropriate for things like professional emails and business memos. Unfortunately, it seems to be a skill many are lacking, especially in STEM majors. I've had a number of group assignments where we've had to submit research papers or lab reports, but have often found myself stuck doing the majority of the editing since some of my classmates write like middle schoolers.",

The easiest way to do that is to assign a case or a project that requires writing. \n\nSadly, a good number of students are not ready for college level writing so I just see typos, errors and gibberish.\n\nAs to real life applications, most of that will come from your work experience.",

Writing is one of the most important skills you can have, and the ability to read something or research a topic and generate in depth analysis or clear concise and educated conclusions on your research will help you in the job market. As well as helping your critical analysis skills, which do have real world applications. \n\n\nYou have to look below the surface, and make the logical connections or be able to point out fallacies and issues. Isn't that one of the most important functions of life? To not only have a piece of paper that says you attended college, but have a brain that shows you know how to think deeply, make critical connections, and analyze data? Why else go to college unless you just want a certificate that gets you a job?",
