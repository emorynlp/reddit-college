  "text": "This one has always bugged me.\n\nIf I save a search in ebscohost, then come back to it laster in my folder, and run the search again, it searched ALL the databases despite the fact that I specified specific ones in the origional search.\n\nIs there a way to get it to remember to lomit the search to specific databases?\n\nBetter yet, is there a way to get ebscohost to by default for all searches only search certain databases that I specify (unless I specify otherwise)?\n\nI only want to search the psychology and education databases usually, (maybe with some medical ones as well sometimes, but I wouldn't have the medical ones as default). \n\nAny help appreciated!",
