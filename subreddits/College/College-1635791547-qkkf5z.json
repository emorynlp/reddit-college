  "text": "I do all the homework and study for the quizzes and exams. I get %60-%70 on the quizs and my midterm was a %58. I understand the questions, how to set them up. all of my errors come from some stupid mistake I made. I have had this issue for as long as I can remember, but I did not do anything about it back then and it haunts me now. dunno what to do feels hopeless. \n\nOne of my errors could be a simple as forgetting to write the negative sign and not noticing. I go over each question before I turn it in and cant even see that error unless I'm told I got the question wrong.",

If you\u2019re keyed up about a test enough, you\u2019re engaging your sympathetic nervous system, your \u201cfight flight freeze\u201d response is activated. If your body is preparing to fight off a saber toothed tiger, your brain is NOT in the right place to do algebra.",
