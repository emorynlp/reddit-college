  "text": "Title says all. I\u2019m a junior and I think I\u2019m going to have to face the fact that I\u2019m losing the GPA I want this semester. But I\u2019m also trying to be realistic about what is a normal GPA and what is perfectionism. I have been having a lot of life issues and working a lot and thus my ability to really get the highest grade is diminishing. So help me put that into perspective",
