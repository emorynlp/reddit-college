  "text": "All those general classes like English, math, social studies, is there any way I can skip them? I am considering going to a community college for an Associate's (not sure for what, maybe business related), then getting my Bachelor of Landscape Architect somewhere.\n\nI just need either some way to fast track all of those general classes, or if I have to take them I need to be paid to go to school otherwise I would feel like I'm wasting my time taking classes that aren't even necessary for me within Landscape Architecture or that I'm already proficient at.",

      "text": "You can't really 'skip' them. If you're academically prepared for college-level work, you can easily satisfy those credits either with exams (AP, CLEP) or by taking online courses at your local Community College (that require minimal time investment because it's mostly review anyway).\n\nIf you're not academically prepared to do the above, then you definitely shouldn't skip them because you'll find yourself unprepared for the bachelor's degree you intend to pursue.",
