  "text": "All those general classes like English, math, social studies, is there any way I can skip them? I am considering going to a community college for an Associate's (not sure for what, maybe business related), then getting my Bachelor of Landscape Architect somewhere.\n\nI just need either some way to fast track all of those general classes, or if I have to take them I need to be paid to go to school otherwise I would feel like I'm wasting my time taking classes that aren't even necessary for me within Landscape Architecture or that I'm already proficient at.",
