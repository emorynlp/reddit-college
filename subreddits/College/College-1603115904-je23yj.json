Worst part was that we were supposed to have an extra credit opportunity by making corrections on our returned assignments, which were supposed to be due a week after we get our feedback.  When he got behind grading, he gave us to the last day of classes to make our corrections.  When he got further behind, he made it due the last day of finals.  He still never gave us our feedback lol.  Some say he's still grading our papers to this day.... But seriously, I guess he somehow graded them since we got our course grades halfway through January (the semester ended around Dec. 20th).",
