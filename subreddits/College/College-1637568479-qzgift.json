  "text": "TW: Suicide and mental health. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not even been a full semester but I feel like I want to transfer. I don\u2019t absolutely hate it here but I feel like there are bigger/better things for me. \n\nBackground: I go to a small tech school in Massachusetts. Majoring in Electrical Computer Engineering. D3 Athlete.\n\nWarning: I don\u2019t want to hear \u201c4 years goes by so fast. You have so much time to explore and do your own thing\u201d b.s \n\nI personally want to feel like i\u2019m experiencing city life and college simultaneously. Not just feeling like i\u2019m at college. \n\n\nThings I don\u2019t like about my school: \n\nCampus is dull (physically). Not really complaining about student body or social life here. \n-I feel like I walk to the same three buildings everyday. (I am plenty involved on campus. I am in 3 clubs and a part of a varsity team) \n-The school is too lazy to even add street lights to light up the quad/sidewalks at night. \n\n\nLack of food\n-Only two dining halls. One of them is closed half the time. Food makes your ass explode. \n\n^This is hard especially as an athlete because I\u2019d finish practice and all the dining halls would be closed. Additionally, I had to stay on campus over break for sports and the dining hall was closed midday so I couldn\u2019t even eat a full meal beforehand.  \n\nAcademics:\n\n-Lack of variety in course selections \n-School is overcapacity and you get waitlisted for literally everything  \n-Most professors suck \n\nAdministration/School itself \n\n\nTo start we have had 4 suicides in the span of 4 months. At this rate, there is one suicide every month. 1 is too many in itself, but this is absolutely ridiculous. \n\n*Obviously people have their own problems and it\u2019s not necessarily school related but mental health here in general is pretty shit\n\nCollege has hit me like\na train. I never been so mentally\nexhausted in my life. I basically sob twice a week and think about wanting to drop out. Within the first few weeks of college I had to start seeing a school counselor weekly. It was to the point where I wanted to drop off the face of the earth and disappear for a while.\n\nAdministration is \u201cworking hard\u201d to find solutions. \n\nSo far their solution to mental health was to give out free donuts and \u201cmom hugs\u201d \n\n^^ I know part of this is me and I can be happy here if I tried but I don\u2019t want to spend 4 years here and regret the things I missed out on\n\nWhat I want: \n\n-More urban setting (ideally I would like to be in Boston) \n\n-School that has strong stem program but also a lot of humanities/liberal arts\n\n-More diverse campus/student body \n\n-Be able to continue my sport elsewhere\n\n-Overall more attention from administration to care for students needs. \n\nAre these valid reasons? While my experience is not what I want at all, I don\u2019t absolutely hate it here. I think I could suck it up for 4 years but I don\u2019t want to suffer if I can find happiness elsewhere. Is it really worth leaving everything I have here to start over somewhere else? Am I overthinking things, should I just wait it out to see if things get better?",

      "text": "These are definitely valid reasons. I won\u2019t say 4 years goes by quickly because I hated my college my freshman year and was struggling to see how I\u2019d make it through three more years. Then I transferred from a small school in a small town to a bigger school in a city, and the difference was huge. I found a major I liked at my second school that wasn\u2019t offered at my first, the social scene was completely different, and there was plenty to do off campus. I look back and think of transferring as one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. It genuinely made my college experience so positive, especially compared to how depressed I was at my first school. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re overthinking. If you\u2019re unhappy there, then you\u2019re unhappy there. You don\u2019t need to wait to see if things get worse to look elsewhere. There\u2019s nothing wrong with transferring.",
