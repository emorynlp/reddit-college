  "text": "Hello!! I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma. I cannot, for the life of me, choose a college major/minor yet. I\u2019m a high school senior currently applying to colleges. I\u2019m having trouble because on the major section of each college, they have undeclared options but it is asking me to choose between schools related to the degree if that makes sense. \n\nFor example, a college is asking me to  choose between a range of specific schools, like school of business or school of applied sciences. \n\nI have no idea what to do, anyone have any advice?",

You won't likely stay with the same major you started with.\n\nI would either A) choose a major you have an intrinsic interest in or B) choose a major that could be commonly held by the career field you want to enter.\n\nThere are good and bad to both of these routes but, realistically, you're not going to be able to tell what you really want to do until you obtain more experience.",

You\u2019ll specifically want to change before you\u2019re core classes are done. I would suggest choosing a school that would not be largely applied to, so you increase your chances of getting in. Then experiment for the first 1-2 years of college, and find out what you enjoy.",

It is literally a journey of self-identity and a lot of things you can do that you were not able to do back in high school. A lot of people change their majors due to this, so I would highly recommend talking to your advisor and choose a major you have an interest in or visit the career and services department of the school of your choice. They usually help students and alumni find careers of their interests and research potential career opportunities.",

I wouldn\u2019t stress too much because it\u2019s really likely you will end up changing your major. \n\nNow, there are some \u201cmajors\u201d or schools that are \u201ceasier\u201d to get in to, if that makes sense. I feel that any physical science or business-related major is more competitive within applicants so grades and SAT/ACT are crucial if you choose to apply to one of those.",

If it's cold and you can , again, safely, go outside in inadequate clothing and leave the door open.\n\nBasically, in a controlled environment look at your mortality I'm the face.\n\nNow you can pick a way to communicate an idea that works best for you: write down, send a text, on an ipad , say out loud , think about it only etc.\n\nThe idea: You're now dying or about to die...and in reality you can die very easily in this same situation if it wasn't a safe, controlled environment. What would cause you, if you looked around and saw your ideal future, to die satisfied and content (or even HAPPY) with how your life was? Don't be realistic.\n\nDo you want to die looking out into your chicken coop and hearing your cats meowing and dogs barking? \n\nDo you want to be able to die with the sound of the ocean wafting through your windows and the knowledge that this sound is familiar to you?\n\nDo you want to look out and see the lights of the city reflecting off your 36th floor window?\n\nDo you want to look out of a tent from the base of the freaking Andes??\n\nNow that you have a straight forward idea of the type of life you think you would like to have look at what careers would get it. Do you have to go to college? Would working for it straight out help instead? Try looking up people online that already have what you want : google, tik tok , university sites etc.\n\nDon't be realistic. Look up everything and anything you remotely think can get you this. Anyone that can help.\n\nNow some might be able to stop here and just point to something they  know they want. \n\nYou might need to keep going: Narrow it down.\n\nTime to be realistic. Can you afford the debt of college? If not what schools ei give you $? Can you find a way to go out of the country? Do you actually need uni to do what you want? Do you need a gap year? Etc\n\nWhat are you really bad at and can you revisit this in s year? Some people suck at something in high school but thrive in it in college or outside of school. What are you good at. What do you love to do and can take criticism on. What can you physically or mentally not do? What makes you sad or miserable to think of doing daily ? What gives you the most joy in life? What can you do everyday?\n\nUse these two realistic lists to narrow down your career choices and to narrow down what school to go to.be Open to changing routes! Or goals! As long as the change is coming from you.",
