              "text": "Ok! I dont know schools in Florida - others can talk about what the Florida schools are like specifically -  but I can share what I wish I had considered when looking for schools: \n\n1. LOCATION: do you want to be in a city, town, rural area...? Do you want to be close to home, or move elsewhere? Think about cost of living and happiness as well. My biggest regret is not considering location more seriously, and it's the most common reason people within my social circle have left college\n\n2. Does the Program/University offer support to your goals? Since you are still exploring, you may want a school that has a lot of different programs so that you can explore. It's also good to have easy access to academic advisors. \n\n3. Does the school foster a competitive or collaborative environment? If most classes or intro classes are graded on a curve, it's going to be competitive. I personally do better when I feel like I can trust and work with my classmates. Research also shows that students learn better in collaborative environments. There will always be gunners, but it's important to assess the overall learning environment and think about how that would impact your performance and happiness. \n\n4. Does the school have programs or partnerships in place that could help you get experience in your field? I got lucky and ended up at a school with a strong pipeline to many internship programs in my field. However, my best friend went to a rural school with no connections, so she had to drive 2 hours each direction  twice per week to do an internship in the closest large town. This is impacting her ability to get post-grad work.  Some schools will publicize where students have worked afterwards or where students do internships. This can be helpful. \n\nSome of these are easier to assess than others. Posting to the school's subreddit can be helpful to assess others. You can also reach out to admissions  to see if they can connect you with current students so you can assess the more qualitative \n\n Your experience, the university culture, and resources will make much more of a difference than the name of a school or the reputation of a program, so asses what you need, what environment would be best for you, and what your goals are. This can help guide your decisions.\n\nEDIT: also, I am in biology and work as a writing tutor, so if you want to talk more about either or both, I'd love to chat! They work really well together and there is high demand for people who concurrently specialize in biology and writing",
