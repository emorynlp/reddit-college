  "text": "I finish my bachelors degree in journalism this semester and I get bad anxiety anytime I think about it. I don't feel as prepared for the real world as other people do. I live with my mom and I'm planning to get a masters after the bachelors and she doesn't mind me living here until I finish all my studies. its pretty common for that to happen in Puerto Rico. But I still feel nervous. I've never been good with changes. On top of that, mom always gets emotional when she sees me go through these life changing experiences and I somehow end up feeling guilty about it. It's almost like i don't want to graduate. Maybe it's because I'm getting a bachelors in something I don't enjoy. Maybe it's because I'm scared of losing my friends. Maybe I'm scared of disappointing my mom because she wants me to start the masters right away in January, while I want at least a semester off before i go back into studies. IDK what it is...but I'm not excited.",
