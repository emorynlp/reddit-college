  "text": "Now after a horrifying semester in University, \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how much I wanted to come home. It\u2019s not even the pandemic at this point. I pretty much gave up my soul to pass all my premed courses and hell, honors college shredded my social life. Now, that I am back home, I only have 3 more weeks till 2nd Semester begins. We got an extended winter break and omg I was so happy. I am lost for words how this break went by so fast even with boredom.\n\nAnyone feeling this way?",

      "text": "There is so much pressure for people to talk about how much they love freshman year and the crazy experiences they have had, but in my experience, freshman year is difficult across the board for pretty much everyone (especially for STEM majors, because weeder classes for STEM majors are usually placed in freshman/sophomore year). The social pressures of finding friends, the emotional stress of leaving home, and the educational difficulties of college level courses makes for a really hard time. I dreaded going back to school to the point of tears for my first and second year, and while I still struggle sometimes being so far away from family, I have found ways to make college more of a fun, comfortable place for myself. Take care of yourself OP, both physically and mentally!",
