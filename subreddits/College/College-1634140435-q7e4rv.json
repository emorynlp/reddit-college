  "text": "This is my senior year and I am currently taking a Money and Financial Inst. class that is really kicking my butt. It feels like all I do is study but I am not getting the results.\n\nSome background on this professor. He is the professor who doesn't do homework and the homework you get is not for a grade. He believes that we are adults and if we want to pass we will put in the work to pass the exams and be present. Prior in his other classes he didn't have any grades other than exams now he has an extra credit paper and some small WSJ analysis. This is honestly really good for him.\n\nSome background into myself in this class. Currently I study for a whole week for these exams, I go over his in class points, I go over the \"homework\", I go over the chapters, I do the practice essays he hands out and I even go to office hours. I even went to our student resources office and filed my ADHD forms in order to be able to take longer on his exams.\n\nThis past exam, the first exam, I felt ready. I had really used what his past classes had given me to prepare for one of his exams. I got the exam back and with the curve it was a D. This is really hard to see especially with how hard I had tried and to me the first exam is the easiest and it only gets worse from there. At the moment it has really made studying feel hopeless and I have no idea what else I could possibly do. I feel as if it may just be me and maybe tests aren't my strongest point but in my other classes this semester I have gotten A's on my exams. I would say I even tried less on those. \n\nI went to his office hours just today and he tried to make me feel better about the grade, he even told me I did really well on the exam and I am one of his best students who actually is trying in his class. It just felt wrong because that's not how I feel about it especially when I didn't even get a passing grade. He also couldn't stop bringing up a past class with him where I brought my average grade of a C up to an A+ on the final and how if I just try harder he knows I can do it. This was during quarantine when we were all at home where I had no where to be and my classes never met and I spent a majority of my waking moments studying for that stupid final. \n\nI guess from my lengthy explanation my questions is, what else can I possibly do to increase my chances of a better grade? \\*other than sell my soul of course\\*",
