  "text": "This is my 1st year in university and I\u2019m not doing well. I never needed to study until now where I don\u2019t how. I try to the vest if my ability but I\u2019m still not doing well. My professors aren\u2019t very forgiving and don\u2019t post class recordings because they want people to come to class. I have a hard time learning material over a computer and zoom lectures are not the same as going to in person. Last semester I made lots of Cs and now I consistently make Ds and fail tests. I don\u2019t know what to do and I feel like I\u2019ll never be successful. I know I can do well in university but not in this current setting.",

COVID-19 learning isn\u2019t for everybody and people here need to stop pretending like it is. Some people don\u2019t learn well via computer lectures, it\u2019s not the same as sitting in a classroom. The risk with taking a break is never coming back, but the risk of continuing in a situation you cannot thrive in is complete burnout.",

I\u2019m afraid of asking for help because I think the professors will deny me because of my grades. My grades are all Ds except for 1 C. I don\u2019t get when people say not to be rude. If u know what someone like this thinks like belittling them will only make their situation worse",

Now, if you decide to stick with it, and there is no shame in taking a break, I would take measures to remove distractions during your lectures. And I know it\u2019s hard to, but it is absolutely important to communicate with your professors especially if you\u2019re having trouble. If their worth the price of the tuition you pay, they will help you, it\u2019s their job, if they refuse contact the dean.",

Those people had developed their work ethics over years of having to work hard due to lack of schooling, and it made me realize I needed an adjustment in my mentality. I realized I honestly had it easy, I was making school harder on myself than it needed to be because I wasn't applying myself, and making excuses for my behavior by telling myself it was just because I wasn't good at school and didn't belong. That's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Getting an associate's from community college allowed me to reframe my mindset, which made a world of difference once I went back to the university. I graduate in May. As cliche as it sounds, if I can do it, you can do it",

Success isn't only measured monetarily. A different form of success is simply doing something you enjoy. If you enjoy learning and getting a degree, that's success. If you enjoy building houses, that's success. If you enjoy serving your country, that's success. Nothing is really ever guaranteed, but if you enjoy what you do then you're a lot more likely to find success. What's the most exciting/engaging thing you've learned in school so far?",

I got a 30% on my first midterm in math and am sitting at a nice fat 59% in the class even though I have perfect attendance and 100% on all assignments/quiz/activities. You're not alone, ever since this fucking virus hit it seems like school is 200% harder than the previous years. All I can say is that you should keep going and at least try, that's what I'm doing. And I get wanting to quit lol, but think about the endgame and how you will be better off if you don't. Hope you make it through good luck.",

      "text": "This is kind of what college is. I was similar, I bombed pretty hard in my first year, I was 16 and taking a bunch of hard sciences I wasn't prepared for. Here's the issue: you don't know how to learn. Learning has come naturally to you so you haven't really been thinking about how or why you learn... you just... do. \n\nLet me level with you, completely honest, no BS. \n\nThe reality you pick up on in college, is that this is a different animal. High school is freaking easy, I promise you, even I as a multi AP class student had it ridiculously easy. You don't have to be gifted to breeze through HS, I certainly am not/wasn't, but I killed it in high school because is a playground. You need to start slow and recognize your deficiencies. It'll take dedication and it'll hurt.\n\n1) Show up to class. No excuses. If you don't show up to class, you've earned your D. Record them locally if you can, don't tell anyone you do though lol. Go through it numerous times until you understand it.\n\n2) Do practice questions/practice exams. No, homework doesn't count. You need to do practice, outside of homework, when no one asks you to. You need to know what you don't know and outline a plan, \"how am I going to be an expert on this before exam day\", and stick to it. If you teacher doesn't give you practice questions (because they're evil or lazy), find them online. Is your class taught at MIT? Opencourseware. Khan academy? Practice sheets. Learning something like Calc or Ochem? Thousands of practice tests, many from T10 universities. There is no excuse. \n\n3) Reach out to other students or your teacher, they are your resources. Watch Khan academy. YouTube literally anything, and there will be a resource.\n\n4) Do research on effective learning strategies. Once you have built up study endurance and a workflow, you can work on your effiency. Flashcards are better than rereading, practice tests are better than summarizing, highlight is useless, etc..\n\nYou can do this, I promise you that you can, but you need to get on this ASAP. Understand what you're fighting for. Do you want your major? To be a doctor? A dentist? Go to grad school? How much do you want it, and how hard will you work for it? College is a dangerous game, it can be fun, but your priority right now in your life is to make something of yourself.\n\nSorry for tough love, I promise I'm actually nice most of the time. Don't make the same mistakes I did! I want you to be successful, and have as many doors open to you as possible.",

              "text": "That sounds like you're just depressed. It manifests in different ways, but often as apathy. I completely understand that you're feeling this way right now, but college can wait if your mental health is at risk. It's easier to explain a gap year than an academic suspension. That said, please seek out counseling resources from your institution if those resources are available. \n\nIf you can't get yourself together, you need to leave before you do permanent damage to your career. That would be my most honest suggestion. Spend that time trying to secure a certification or a higher paying job, or even just volunteering for some life experience.\n\nIf for whatever reason this isn't an option for you, seek out tutoring services and try to find what matters to you. Fight for that one thing and see it through.",

Active recall is when you are forced to pull a fact out of your brain. There's varying metrics, but what you need to know is it yields ~50-100% improved recall for semantic information. That's amazing. It's like studying for 6 hours but getting 12 hours of knowledge. Practice tests are one form, flashcards are another. Usually, it's not work ethic that separates good and bad students, it's strategy. If you're not learning effectively, you're competing against your classmates who are, and you're working twice as hard just to catch up them. Even better, the more you learn, the easier it is to learn. Your brain becomes better at absorbing information, and you can absorb more info at once.\n\nMore pleasure reading: Blooms taxonomy, zone of proximal development, and Yerkes-Dodsons law of optimal arousal",

I tried a   diagnostic criteria questionnaire and got an atypical but indicative of adhd result.\n\nI'm in that position right now, I'm a freshman in college.  My 16th birthday was last month.  I was skating by on being paralyzed unable to work only motivated by panick and then doing month long assignments in three hours.  But I did well enough to do early college.  But then I got burnt out and panick wasn't motivation anymore.  I'm hoping to get a diagnosis in about a week.",

All three amplify eachother, if you're even a little depressed it takes away any shred of motivation you have.

You can't keep a schedule because you lack the ability to make yourself follow it, you want to do an assignment but end up in bed at midnight on your phone.\n\nYou Don't have friends to study with, your lonley, in a new environment, isolated with no real external motivation or enforcement beyond a vague looming threat of failure that does more to make you feel like shit rather than make you work harder.\n\nPlus, how can you study for a test when you can't keep a schedule and you can't make yourself focus for longer than twenty minutes.\n\nFor me I told myself I was just smart so thats why I only spent an hour a before class doing work rather than studying, but the real reason that I see now is that I was only motivated by panick to do work and I just never noticed because I could get a 115% on all of my classes while barely working on it but the second I got into an environment without support and a class that required real work and studying I wasn't able to force myself to do the required work.\n\nIt's a unique kind of issue, you feel lazy and worthless because you know you can do it, but you can't focus or self discipline.",

But when he's not there I have no way of making myself focus.\n\nI'm stuck at home with an 8 year old and 10 year old brothers, both of them are homeschooled and have never done a graded assignment in their life nor have they taken a test or had to study beyond the state exams.  I was homeschooled until the 2019 - 2020 school year when I said fuck it and started public 9th grade highschool, having that accountability and external help with focus made me go from an entire year behind in everything to two years ahead of where I was supposed to be in a few months.  \n\nPeople with adhd or add can't do concentration or self discipline very much, so you have to get someone else to make you focus, medication and therapy let's you not have that need for heavy external support.",

But you can't make a depressed person not be depressed with small changes because they can't make themselves do it.\n\nStudy harder and stop being lazy sound easy and simple but it isn't, you can't just decide to not have an inability to do something because it's an easy fix.  \n\nAlso you can't let people telling you that you don't have a problem be a reason to not get help right?  Plus it's not a self diagnosis if you go to a psychiatrist and they evaluate you.\n\nPs. Most colleges have free therapy/psychiatry right now so that may be an option.",

Either they'll get over it eventually when they see you are happier from treatment, or they aren't going to but that's not your decision, you can't control them, you can only work on improving yourself and let them decide if they want to give you a hard time about it.",

It would get to the point where I wouldn't eat, I'd just drink coffee, because when I did I finally felt like I had a normal brain. Now I think that probably because it's a stimulant, and it kept my mind together. I'm also on Buproprion now, cut my coffee in half! I have been much better since.",

First semester and first year is hard for everyone, I remember I used to study 8-12 hours and usually when I got home later I cried for solid half an hour since I felt exhausted and like I am not good enough that I don\u2019t understand a lot of things.\nA lot of the time you might study 24/7 and still feel like you don\u2019t know anything but you will be surprised after the exam. So just study for the sake of studying and grades will follow.\nAlso, everyone struggles with the current online studying, but at least we are alive and our loved ones are safer. \nEven if it is online treat it as normal. Dare yourself to ask at least one question every lecture (I am not shy but I literally shake when having to ask something online, but I do it anyway). Reach out to TAs and ask questions that are bothering for a long time.\nAsking for the due date to be extended or handing your homework later is better than not doing it at all. \nThe question you should be asking yourself is if you are willing to be fighting and trying your best for the profession you want.",

      "text": "Gurl, I was in the same place you are when I was a first year. I bet you were labeled GT in school too. You have to push through it. Find a group of people you can study with and figure out what works for you. Expect to actually be spending 30-40 hours a week doing it. Coasting isn't a real world thing, and a big part of getting a degree is learning how to self motivate and get the thing done. If you have adhd or anxiety or depression or whatever and you can get it documented by a doctor you can work with your disability center for accommodations, which really helped me. Literally you just need a documentation letter from your doctor and it'll be in your file long term.\n\nOtherwise, bullet journaling is a great way to keep your shit together. \n\nJust because it's hard doesn't mean you need to quit. You can adapt. A lot of first year classes are meant to weed out people who don't want it enough, and you've gotta ask yourself whether you do or not.",

If your teachers won\u2019t accommodate you to help you pass you may have to do that. also; work in groups !!! i try to gather one or two classmates to finish assignments and collaborate on notes.  i never really had trouble in high school; but college is SO DIFFERENT. also; online classes suck. it\u2019s not a functional way of learning. don\u2019t give up! retake classes over the summer; maybe one or two, and start the year fresh.",

It can be really discouraging especially if you dont have ppl around you who have been to university. \n\nThe big assignment load freshman year was never somehting I \"coped\" with, I almost failed my entire freshman year. I used those failures to learn how to improve myself and my study habits. \n\n(Illegal tip dont use unless failure is imminent- prioritize your assignments based off their grade weight. If I had a massive exam to cram for and little assingmests due during it I would either do the little stuff early or late. I would also always put more effort and more time into classes that grade mattered more. I may have gotten a 71% I'm bio but I pass research seminar with an A at the same time.\n Never work on more than 1 assignment a day unless they're small and you can manage that. I always just do one classes work a day as moving between subjects clouds my mind.\n\nLibrary study rooms, Teaching assistants, and tutors or helpful professors can be a massive help too.)\n\nIf this still doesnt help when thinking about it feel free to ask more! I know how hard and scary freshman year can be, I was a first generation college student and I'm the only person in my immediate family to make it this far, its terrifying and freshman year was the worst of it.",

      "text": "Oof. I\u2019ve been there. Got A\u2019s in high school and had to learn the hard way the amount of work it takes to get an A in university. Some tips I\u2019ve learned for studying in general and studying with online school. In general:\nRead! Read your textbooks! But read the material before you learn it in class. Even if you don\u2019t understand it, if the terms are vaguely familiar with you during lectures, you\u2019ll grasp concepts way quicker.\nRead lecture notes ahead of time. Most profs post them ahead of the lecture, read these, print them off and annotate them during lectures.\nDo your homework. Get a group of friends in your classes, set up study groups, have class group chats and be active in them.\nGo to your profs office hours. Talk to TAs about the material.\nGet a tutor. There are often volunteer tutor organizations at schools, and there are paid ones usually too. Type in your school name on google followed by \u2018tutor board,\u2019 so search \u2018XYZ college tutor board\u2019 and I guarantee you there will be a list of upper year students with their prices. Even if they don\u2019t know their shit that much (they typically do though), there is literally no harm to pay a tutor if you can afford it. At the very least, you\u2019ll be looking at the material another time.\nWith online school, try to turn your video on during live classes. This will ensure you don\u2019t wander or go on your phone because you know you are being seen.\nDisable the chat feature if you can. Students tend to talk in there and can distract.\nPut your phone in another room while you\u2019re in class.\nIf you have recorded lectures, make yourself a schedule. If you have a 2 hour video to watch each week, give yourself 4 hours to watch it. Take breaks every 20-30 minutes, and when you take breaks, actually take a break. Don\u2019t think about the material, just zone out. Scrolling Reddit might not be a good idea though because that can go on for awhile. If you pick a task that has a definite end that\u2019s a good idea, like, play one round of solitaire, and when it\u2019s over, go back to your lecture video. Hope this helps",

      "text": "Make sure you have your priorities in check as well. What I mean by that is, do you know why you\u2019re even going to college? Did you make this important life changing decision completely of your own volition or did other people (like parents) ultimately push you into it? Do you see university/getting a degree as just \u201cgoing with flow\u201d like high school was, or are you instead creating your own flow for the goals you absolutely NEED to achieve. Have you been excited for this moment, no hesitation and now that you\u2019ve gotten here you couldn\u2019t be happier to be studying for what you want to do as an eventual career? These are all important questions to ask yourself. Make no mistake college immediately following high school isn\u2019t for everybody out there. There\u2019s a lot of life experiences you can undertake before you even consider getting a higher degree. You could go and work in a trade, go the CC route for a little, or even get a traditional job and obtain work experience. Nothing will hurt your resume in the long run. But always remember that you don\u2019t stay young forever and ultimately it\u2019s your time and energy you\u2019re using up if you truly in your heart and head don\u2019t feel like this stuff is worth studying. So, I\u2019d take a step back because this tale rings true for myself and how I felt when I first got to school. Obviously I can\u2019t tell you what to do and that\u2019s one of the toughest parts of becoming a grown up that no one tells you - making your own informed decisions based on what\u2019s responsible and not giving into pressure. Make sure you\u2019re doing this for yourself and nobody else in the world. Make sure you\u2019re 100% positive this is the right direction for achieving self-actualization in life. It could be that you just haven\u2019t found your true passion to study yet and ofc this is common; majors change all the time and being undeclared certainly isn\u2019t out of the ordinary for a lot of first year (even some second year students.) Whatever it is, I hope you figure it out sooner rather than later and talk with someone about this.",

One of the other comments mentioned office hours, and honestly, they saved my ass.\n\nAs an engineering major you get your shit rocked with days of homework a week, predominantly math and physics based. I struggled until I started showing up to office hours with homework problems I couldn't do. Even the ones I could do, I'd have my professors look over them if we had the time, because that's where they're gonna find gaps in understanding and problems with your method. \n\nI'm not sure how non-STEM homework/projects are, but I'm sure if you show up stuck with a paper or research assignment your prof will gladly help you out. Most aren't out to fail you unless they're douchebags, there's no benefit to them forcing you to fail. \n\nI struggled with online learning this fall too, you kinda just gotta power through it. You CAN recover from a rough first year. I went from a 2.5 to a 3.0, and I know people who started with a 2 that are pushing similar GPAs now. It just takes time and knowing your resources out of class. Get through this, and I'm sure you'll be fine next year.",

      "text": "Let me add something else here:  You say that you want to give up.  I'm pretty qualified to talk about this since I actually did drop out and then return at a different school ages later.\n\nDropping out wasn't worth it.  It was a bad idea and if I had to do things over I would not have done so.  However, I was able to take a lot of development from it and hopefully I can use what I learned to help others.  There are good reasons to drop out but you haven't listed any.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and guess some things about you.  If I'm wrong, I apologize.\n\nI don't think you want to quit because you are getting bad grades, or at least not directly.  I think you want to quit because it is PAINFUL.  Finding out that what you are doing now won't work SUCKS.  Looking inside and thinking \"maybe I'm not good enough\" is THE WORST.  The thought of actually putting energy in time and making an *actual change* instead of a small shift that you just undo afterwords is TERRIFYING.  And doing all of this, over and over, without an actual guarantee that it will get better is FUCKING AWFUL.  It must be utterly overwhelming to have all of these feelings and more inside yourself.\n\nAnd guess what?  It's totally normal to feel that.  Your emotions are legitimate and important.  That is a tough fucking row to hoe.  I'm sorry that you have to deal with it.  I'm sorry that it's not easy for you now like it seems like for most people and actually is for some people.  It's not fun and it's not fair.  You have a right to your feelings and to people who will listen and support you.\n\nYou can do this.  Don't avoid all of the frustration and pain you feel.  Do it the hard way.  Do the things that you don't want to do.  The things that you are coming up with every reason not to do.  Face them head on and watch them get better.\n\nI am speaking from personal experience because I'm describing how I was.  One day, you're going to look back and marvel at what you were able to accomplish and it will be meaningful BECAUSE it was hard.\n\nGuess what else?  The pain you feel is magnified a thousand times by your own anxiety.  This actually gets manageable as you improve.  College doesn't get easier but you get WAY better at it.  As you work, you will not just learn facts and strategies but actually grow.  You have no idea how strong you can get from this.  You literally have no idea how far you can go, but you are the one that has to go.  It's a scary and uncertain road but it's worth it to travel.",

              "text": "That fucking sucks.  It's really hard and I know how you feel.  Find some people to talk about it with.\n\nOne of the nice things about actually stating these feelings is that understanding what is going on inside of you is empowering.  If you want to change how you feel, you have to be honest with yourself about what you're feeling and why.  When you know that and you know yourself, you can come up with strategies to improve.\n\nStudying is the same way.  You are pouring energy into things that don't work.  It's really easy to just say \"I suck, I'm the worst, I want to die.\"  One of the reasons we do it is to avoid the actual difficulty of fixing the problems.  It's a lot more useful to say \"I don't understand this concept\" or \"I am having difficulty taking effective notes\" or \"I can't perform this task.\"  When you say that, ask yourself \"why?\"  Things happen for reasons (I'm not getting spiritual, I'm saying effects have causes) and you are not special or unique in this.  Your problems exist for actual reasons and when you know what those reasons are, you can, in the parlance of our times, dead ass google that shit.  You have the vast majority of human knowledge at your fingertips.  Once you have a handle on exactly what you need, fire up your web browser and start looking for answers.\n\nThe whole process is massively empowering because it gives you actual steps to fix what's bothering you and take control of your own responses and your own life.  Best of luck with all of it, now go study.",

If you need time to reset, take a semester off. I couldn't keep up with digital schooling last semester and took a leave of absence until this fall to try and keep myself sane. Do what you feel comfortable with, but remember that school is supposed to help you get to where you want to be, not burn you out by sophomore year.\n\nGood luck!!",

I preferred to take time off because I could work full time and save up for the fall, as well as wait to continue my learning for when I don't have to do it all online. Think about how you work best--what motivates you? For me, it's being by other people, study groups, talking with teachers. Paying 15k to sit in my room alone and cry wasn't worth it to me. Relearning old material is hard work, but it's worth it to me if it means I'll have an easier time in the long run. \nIf you are good with digital learning, maybe a semester off isn't for you, but that's your choice. \nDefinitely make use of resources at your college though-- email your academic advisor and ask for their opinion, and go from there.",

Nobody is going to come save the day, save your GPA or teach you self control. The only person who cares about your life and can do anything about it is you. Help yourself like you would help your best friend.\n\nThat is 110% all on you to have control over your own mind and apply yourself to focusing on learning how to study and process and information better. No offense but fuck you if you think you know what people are going to say or think. You're not Charles fking Xavier. Your job is to ask questions bc rn you are learning how to be a real adult with real responsibility and its going to continue to suck ass.\n\nBUT you have so much opportunity and ability to make anything of yourself. If you spend more time focusing on your assignments and less on self loathing, you will get much further. I dont mean to be an asshole but don't make the same mistakes everyone else does. Switch off the inner monologue and the voice that complains and says its hard and list out the exact steps you can take to do better. Don't settle for less. You only have one shot at it and you're gonna regret it if you don't finish properly or do well. Take it from a senior who just figured out how to be a good student.\n\nAlso I saw the social anxiety comments, and I also dont mean to be rude but people legit dont give a fuck about you so remember everyones p much only focused on their own life and focus on yours. Good luck and reach out if you need extra help. Also read The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson.",

Its true what I say is waaay easier said than done but my main takeaway for you is that you don't have to be a hostage to yourself. Figuring out who you are and loving yourself is the hardest thing to learn but the only way you will find peace and hopefully success. A friend said emotions are like cars on a highway. You can choose to get in the car or not and you can choose just to let the pass you by. All the self hatred will get you nowhere so tbh if you need time off school to figure your mental, think about taking a quarter off and figure out what you really want to do. School will always be there to go back to and it may feel like too late now you're already there but your journey is just starting and you have more time than you know. Wishing you all the best in finding yourself. The key is always to start",

Once things come to a few days prior to an exam or quiz, review these notes. You might just see a significant difference.\n\nI am a lot like you. I glided through high school with straight As, but college presented a wake-up call. What you do with this challenge, however, is on you and thus entirely within your control.\n\nBest of luck, dude.",

Learning how to study is so important and I didn\u2019t learn it until year 5 of college. \n\nAttempt your homework/your readings. Write down everything that confuses you, and your current understanding of it. Take that to office hours/send an email to your professor if you don\u2019t have time for office hours. The more specific, the more they can help you. After you get used to that, try learning your material in different ways. I learned that I learn much more when I read the text and look at examples, some people learn better by rewriting notes or watching YouTube videos and get nothing from reading textbooks. Whatever works for you. Take your education into your own hands. If your professor sucks/not easy to understand, search the internet, check your textbook, ask your classmates, etc. it\u2019s all online somewhere. Good luck!",

              "text": "And that sounds like it isn't working well.  I'm going to give you a few thoughts to start with; feel free to modify them and use what works/drop what doesn't.\n\nI'm going to give you a bunch of advice on turning this around, but before you get lost in the information overload, I want you to please slowly and carefully read a few things.  Some of this is going to be tough love and I'm not trying to be a dick but I think you need to hear some of it:\n\n1)  You can absolutely do this.\n\n2)  It will suck sometimes but that's not an excuse and you can do it anyway.\n\n3)  You're going to mess up from time to time and that's ok, but it's also not an excuse to not do it.\n\n4)  You can't see the future and you clearly don't know what will happen in office hours, with tutors or with online study sessions.  Your opinion of what MIGHT happen is therefore not really worth anything and the fact that you can't see what good will come from any of this is - you guessed it - NOT AN EXCUSE TO NOT DO IT.  (Seeing a pattern here?)\n\nFirst, take a deep breath.  I know you're super stressed.  College is a marathon, not a sprint.  This is actually a time when you're supposed to be making mistakes and learning from them, so this situation isn't the end of the world - so long as you actually grow and change from it.  One of the biggest misconceptions I see about education from both students and parents is that the important thing is the big check mark at the end: your diploma.  That college is just a way of sorting and certifying people and maybe cramming a few facts into their heads along the way.  This is very far from the truth.  You are here to become a more thoughtful, engaged, skilled and understanding member of society.  Job training is just a part of that, and where you are coming in is not a great indicator of where you are coming out - if you're willing to actually grow.\n\nWhile I'm on the subject of mentality: Consider therapy.  You seem like you're feeling depressed and anxious.  There are people who can help you understand and process these emotions and come up with strategies to prevent them from taking over your life.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  \n\nOne thing you'll have to do, though, is to take ownership of the problem and the solution.  You never learned how to study.  You're probably pretty smart and you went by on natural talent through high school.  (This reinforces the idea that colleges are there to certify rather than develop, btw.)  You and about a million other young adults are getting rude awakenings now that the difficulty level has increased.  Listing reasons why you can't follow all of the advice here isn't going to help you.  You can bitch all you want about how shitty this is going to be.  Venting is healthy.  However, you have to suck it up and actually try to change.  Prioritize your success over other things.  You're going to stumble and make mistakes.  Forgive yourself and GET BACK TO WORK.  Don't let depression become an excuse to not actually do the hard stuff.\n\nNext, manage your time.  Set aside a time and (if possible) a place to study and remove distractions.  No music, no youtube videos that aren't entirely about your topic, for the love of God don't go on reddit or any social media, etc.  Turn your phone off and put it in another room.  Give yourself start and stop times, even if you just go for 15 minutes at a time.  \n\nNow, reviewing other people's notes and watching videos is good but taking your own notes is better.  Actually writing things down will help you engage more actively with the material.\n\nPick one topic from a class and start reading and writing about it.  Start with the main topic and a broad overview.  List important subtopics and questions (these will be in notes or books.)  List any questions you think would be important to ask about.  It's ok if you don't list the \"right\" questions, just get thinking about the material.  As you read, look at what is being said and think \"what is the author trying to do/why is the author writing this?\"  Are they giving expository information?  Are they giving an opinion?  Are they listing other people's facts or opinions?  Is their opinion justified?  Why or why not?  What other information should they talk about?  Are they asking questions?  What questions and why?  These skills apply to class, too.  Also, SHOW UP TO CLASS AND TAKE NOTES DURING CLASS.  SCREEN SHOTS AND PHOTOS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT.\n\nWhen you've taken notes, look through them.  See if you missed anything the book/video mentioned.  Depending on the field, you may have some short problems to do.  (Things like homework are great here because they literally tell you what to study, btw.)  Read these problems CAREFULLY, then work through them.  See where you have difficulty.  If you don't know how to start, list the information given and what the problem asks for.  Look in your book to see what information the objective of the problem might require.  Look at how you can get from information presented (in the problem or your notes) to the desired solution.\n\nThis is a lot of stuff.  Fortunately, you can practice taking notes right here.  What's the major point that I'm trying to make?  What do I suggest you do?  Can you make bullet points of what I'm saying?  Can you take what I'm saying and put it into your own words?  Is there something I'm missing or didn't take into account?  After all, it's not like I'm giving you the absolute unshakeable last word on everything.  I could be wrong about something, but to know that you have to think critically about what you've been told. :)\n\nFinally, seek help.  You did that already here, and it's a really good thing.  Find other students who work hard and ask to go through homework or talk about the class.  Get tips on taking notes from them (seriously, don't just look at their notes but when you see good ones, ask about their strategies.)  Your school is full of other people like you who would love to work together but are afraid to take the first step.  Just do it.  Also, look for a tutor.  Show up to office hours.  Contact your professors.  Even the strict ones generally want you to learn.  There are a few duds but don't let that discourage you because the possibility of something not working IS NOT AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO IT. :)",

              "text": "To me this sounds like that might just not be your learning style. As someone who also has trouble learning through Zoom lectures and online classes I had to adapt and find a way that worked for me. If you don't learn well from Zoom then learning from YouTube will likely give you the same results. I think you should try a more hands-on approach to learning. \n\nIf you're taking classes that require written problem solving, like math classes or physics classes, then instead of looking over notes and watching videos, practice going through the actions of solving the problems. A good way to do that is to look at example problems and solutions and write down each of the steps as if you were solving it yourself. Make sure you also understand the reasoning behind each step. Practice makes perfect. Eventually you'll be able to solve them without looking at an example. And if you find an example problem that doesn't appear to have a solution, copy and paste the question into google. I found 99% of the time someone else answered the exact same question on a homework help website. That may sound like cheating, but I actually learned so much from looking up solutions to problems, since typically they do the steps out. \n\nIf your class is more memorization based, like maybe biology or psychology, then rather than just reviewing those concepts in your notes, try quizzing yourself. There are plenty of self-testing sites out there. Quizlet is a favorite of mine. You can make study sets with vocab words and definitions and even images. You can put them on flashcards and create quizzes with them. And who knows if this will work for you, but given where you're at now, anything's worth a shot. This is quite a common learning style so I wouldn't be surprised if this would be helpful for you. I used these methods and excelled in all my online classes, and I often even skipped a lot of online lectures because they just weren't helpful for me! (Not that I encourage that). \n\nMake sure to also take advantage of office hours. I can't tell you how many times I've had a question stump me, and when I took it to office hours, it became so much clearer. Office hours can save you if you practice on your own time and bring the questions you have from your practice. \n\nNow you may be thinking, this sounds like it'll take a lot of time. And yes, but that's just because it's college; the last stage of your formal education. It's meant to be hard and time consuming. I usually spend 6+ hours a day doing homework and studying. This is how it's meant to be. But it's still designed to be doable. You won't get more homework than you can physically do. Assignments that may seem simple might end up taking 3-4 hours with new study habits, but that just means you're learning, and I promise you'll still be able to get it all done with proper time management. Creating these new study skills now will do you wonders in late college. It may seem hopeless now that you already have less than ideal grades recorded, but you can't change the past, only the future. And wouldn't you be glad to have put in the work to change now rather than later or never? Plenty of people enter college and are totally overwhelmed, only to excel later. It's a huge learning experience in regards to study habits and time management. It's meant to be. But if you're willing to put in the effort, you can absolutely do this.",

I got a bunch of people in that server and we can study together.\n\nIt's not impossible to meet people online. It just takes someone with the initiative to make it happen. You can be that person.\n\nEdit: some classes you can get away with studying on your own, but in difficult classes it's really helpful to have another brain with you. (sounds like you're in this situation). You can bounce ideas off each other, and when you're stuck you can work things out with your study buddies.",

Once you get an idea of the concepts you don\u2019t understand, go back through the textbook and take notes. I try making a mind-map and it helps a bunch. After doing this, I\u2019d suggest you look through some online sources (Google, Khan Academy, YouTube has a lot of great content). Once you feel like you know the concept very well, try to see if you can apply it to the real world. Focus on the learning and don\u2019t stress so much about the grade. If you feel that you are studying way to much, take a break and maybe go out for a walk. Establish connections with your peers maybe a group study. Your mental health is very important so do maintain that. College is a time to live and grow. I wish you the best of luck on your future endeavors.",

      "text": "FERPA law aside, you can use a screen recording software such as OSB studio (which is free) to record your professors lectures and they wouldn't even know.\n\nIf you tell another student you are doing this obviously you could get in trouble however you're paying for the courses so if a professor isn't recording the lectures then they're just an ass who doesn't understand that education is really just a cluster fuck service industry where students get taken advantage of like no other customer anywhere else.\n\nAlso, if you were worried about FERPA there are definitely ways to make sure you aren't recording students sensitive material. Usually this means doing something like specifying the application window to zoom, pinning the profs screen to the zoom so that the random person with their mic on doesn't pop up on your screen and then using a custom screen size to capture only what would be presented, not even the instructors face.\n\nI've never done this myself however I too have some professors who don't believe in recording their lectures and the idea has definitely crossed my mind more than once. Luckily for me, the profs who do this teach easier courses but still they're just pompous asses who think 90% of students are inferior humans to their glory.\n\nIf we are being completely honest here, I would rather attend a university where my profs have masters degrees and 20 years experience than a PhD and no practical experience outside of research. The way we rank our education systems in the US is just God awful, we rank universities based upon their research and give them labels such as R1, R2, etc and this is a good ranking system if you want to get into research, fucking awful if you want to work in the private industry.\n\nidk if this will ever change, you basically will need a few new universities following this new approach to become popular, get good students and work with great industry partners who help shape the curriculum / hire their students. Think Dartmouth but not ivey league and more practicality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the biggest issues universities face right now is that every professor thinks they can teach a course however they want and it's this lack of standardization which introduces shit courses that future employers don't value. Think about it like this, your professor might just be teaching this course so that they can learn about the material themselves (this happens a lot in senior level courses) and thus because they aren't an actual expert in the course content the way they teach it is trash.",

Everyone is on Zoom right now, yet there are still millions of people that are putting in the work to get good grades and they are succeeding. \n\nCollege is not just about attending a couple class periods a week and mastering the material like magic. Each credit hour is two hours a week of studying outside of class. College is meant to be a full-time job. That means that if you are taking 16 credit hours, you are expected to study for 32 hours, by yourself, outside of class. 12 credit hours is 24 hours of by-yourself-studying. How many hours are you studying each week outside of class? \n\nThis is not meant to be an insult, be condescending in anyway, or anything like that, but college is not for everyone. If you don\u2019t believe it is for you then you should not continue to waste your time and money. There are a myriad of jobs out there that don\u2019t require a degree",

For me, I sit down Fridays after all my classes and look at what my upcoming two weeks look like, noting anything big (due assignments, essays, quizzes, exams, etc.). And I make my weekly to-do list based off that. For exams, I start studying 2 weeks prior - even if we haven\u2019t covered all the material - i\u2019ll start a light review (think 15-30min) for the first few days and then increase it to 1-2 hours a day once we\u2019re about a week out from the exam. Quizzes I usually give myself 5days-a week depending on the subject. Papers I start as early as 2 weeks out (first few days making an outline, next few picking out research/quotes to include, next few writing a rough draft, and then finalize it). For me, the trick to college is not sitting down and trying to finish all the assignments the day before they\u2019re due/studying 3 days prior and trying to quickly cram & memorize, it\u2019s about planning ahead and doing a little of each subject every day (more or less) until you actually understand what you\u2019re learning instead of just memorizing.",

My suggestion for right now, is to log off reddit/other social medias and put the same amount of time you do into those into your school work if you really wanna see improvements. If you just wanna complain about not seeing improvements, continue what you\u2019re doing. \n\nAnother note: even when school goes back to being in-person, college is 30% learning in class and taking notes, and 70% outside work, learning on your own. Zoom or not, you need to put in the work on your own time, and make the time to do it. From this point on you will not be able to just attend class and do well.\n\nI wish you the best of luck this semester and the ones to follow, I\u2019m now following my own advice because I have homework to get done.",

I would definitely recommend scheduling an appointment with your advisor to talk about it. Do some research on careers that interest you and I\u2019m sure your advisor could help you make a decision. I\u2019m in my last year as a Biology major and I know a ton of students who were struggling the same as you their freshman year, but when they switched their major to something they were more interested in their GPA\u2019s increased a lot.",

It is much worse now that we have to do everything remotely and students are feeling ever so overwhelmed by isolation. \n\nWhat will make the difference for you here is being able to adapt to your new environment and overcome these challenges, though. For me (way back in my day), the solution was creating schedules for studying, assignments, etc, and creating mental health routines that would help me stay on track. \\*Please note that studying for tests is not the same as studying for staying on top of your classes.

Your feelings of overwhelm are valid and normal! \n\nPaying attention in class and taking notes is step 1 for success, but you also need to be able to consolidate notes and study them effectively. I recommend researching subjects such as time management (there are a variety of apps that can help with this), spaced repetition study methods, and active recall techniques. I personally use a combination of these three to stay on top of my graduate work. \n\nThere are numerous resources online (youtube being my favorite) that can help you learn how to study, which is something that we are not normally taught. Right now it may seem terrible but remember you already got this far.   \n\n\nYou got this!",

They are literally there to help you. I've been looking over a lot of your comments, and it really does seem to me that you are letting your fears get in the way of your success.

Because what you are doing right now isn't working.",

Study something you\u2019re interested in, classes and the work will come more easily or if you are set on this major then you must figure out study methods and schedules that work for you. It\u2019s sink or swim and freshman year is where a lot of colleges take the opportunity to weed out the people who don\u2019t want it as much as others. The classes only get harder and your responsibilities only greater. You must learn to adapt or you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure, I had a rough start to college too but after finding a routine that works for me I have almost a 4.0. As a senior, I am taking 21 credits while working over 40hours at an internship. I feel like im drowning sometimes and do nothing but work and study right now but this is what I need to do to get to where I want to be when I graduate. That\u2019s what you have to look at it as, think of the bigger picture.",

When I talk to students who are struggling, depending on their specific struggles I might: \n* show them what they\u2019re doing wrong on tests/assignments so they can do better on the next ones \n* ask them how much time they spend studying, and recommend more hours studying\n* if they\u2019re already studying a good amount of time, I ask them *how* they\u2019re studying, and recommend different things to try\n* I recommend they work with classmates (education research shows students learn better through working with peers)\n* I recommend ways to redo HW to get the most out of it (not just a score)\n* suggest they work with a tutor for an hour a week\n* suggest they work with me for an hour a week\n\nAnd more. You won\u2019t know until you talk to your professors, TAs, or tutors. The specific recommendations depend on the course, and on you as a student.",

It means that you don't have to be good and bad at the same things as everyone else around you.\n\nC) Plenty of people hide their troubles.  Talking about your own with friends can often be helpful.  Maybe they're also having issues and would feel better about themselves if they realized they weren't the only ones (sound familiar?)  Maybe they're really crushing it and have some great advice you can use.  Maybe (hopefully not, but maybe) they'll be jerks about it but hey, now you know that they're not really your friends anyway and you can go find some new people. File that under \"sucks for now but better in the long run.\"",

I\u2019ve had to go to the schools tutors, watch YouTube videos to understand concepts, take notes and then rewrite them on flash cards, etc. You just have to try a bunch of stuff and figure out what works for you.
