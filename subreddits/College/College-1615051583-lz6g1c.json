I was similar, I bombed pretty hard in my first year, I was 16 and taking a bunch of hard sciences I wasn't prepared for. Here's the issue: you don't know how to learn. Learning has come naturally to you so you haven't really been thinking about how or why you learn... you just... do. \n\nLet me level with you, completely honest, no BS. \n\nThe reality you pick up on in college, is that this is a different animal. High school is freaking easy, I promise you, even I as a multi AP class student had it ridiculously easy. You don't have to be gifted to breeze through HS, I certainly am not/wasn't, but I killed it in high school because is a playground. You need to start slow and recognize your deficiencies. It'll take dedication and it'll hurt.\n\n1) Show up to class. No excuses. If you don't show up to class, you've earned your D. Record them locally if you can, don't tell anyone you do though lol. Go through it numerous times until you understand it.\n\n2) Do practice questions/practice exams. No, homework doesn't count. You need to do practice, outside of homework, when no one asks you to. You need to know what you don't know and outline a plan, \"how am I going to be an expert on this before exam day\", and stick to it. If you teacher doesn't give you practice questions (because they're evil or lazy), find them online. Is your class taught at MIT? Opencourseware. Khan academy? Practice sheets. Learning something like Calc or Ochem? Thousands of practice tests, many from T10 universities. There is no excuse. \n\n3) Reach out to other students or your teacher, they are your resources. Watch Khan academy. YouTube literally anything, and there will be a resource.\n\n4) Do research on effective learning strategies. Once you have built up study endurance and a workflow, you can work on your effiency. Flashcards are better than rereading, practice tests are better than summarizing, highlight is useless, etc..\n\nYou can do this, I promise you that you can, but you need to get on this ASAP. Understand what you're fighting for. Do you want your major? To be a doctor? A dentist? Go to grad school? How much do you want it, and how hard will you work for it?

I\u2019ve been there. Got A\u2019s in high school and had to learn the hard way the amount of work it takes to get an A in university. Some tips I\u2019ve learned for studying in general and studying with online school. In general:\nRead! Read your textbooks! But read the material before you learn it in class. Even if you don\u2019t understand it, if the terms are vaguely familiar with you during lectures, you\u2019ll grasp concepts way quicker.\nRead lecture notes ahead of time. Most profs post them ahead of the lecture, read these, print them off and annotate them during lectures.\nDo your homework. Get a group of friends in your classes, set up study groups, have class group chats and be active in them.\nGo to your profs office hours. Talk to TAs about the material.\nGet a tutor. There are often volunteer tutor organizations at schools, and there are paid ones usually too. Type in your school name on google followed by \u2018tutor board,\u2019 so search \u2018XYZ college tutor board\u2019 and I guarantee you there will be a list of upper year students with their prices. Even if they don\u2019t know their shit that much (they typically do though), there is literally no harm to pay a tutor if you can afford it. At the very least, you\u2019ll be looking at the material another time.\nWith online school, try to turn your video on during live classes. This will ensure you don\u2019t wander or go on your phone because you know you are being seen.\nDisable the chat feature if you can. Students tend to talk in there and can distract.\nPut your phone in another room while you\u2019re in class.\nIf you have recorded lectures, make yourself a schedule. If you have a 2 hour video to watch each week, give yourself 4 hours to watch it. Take breaks every 20-30 minutes, and when you take breaks, actually take a break. Don\u2019t think about the material, just zone out. Scrolling Reddit might not be a good idea though because that can go on for awhile. If you pick a task that has a definite end that\u2019s a good idea, like, play one round of solitaire, and when it\u2019s over, go back to your lecture video.

What I mean by that is, do you know why you\u2019re even going to college? Did you make this important life changing decision completely of your own volition or did other people (like parents) ultimately push you into it? Do you see university/getting a degree as just \u201cgoing with flow\u201d like high school was, or are you instead creating your own flow for the goals you absolutely NEED to achieve. Have you been excited for this moment, no hesitation and now that you\u2019ve gotten here you couldn\u2019t be happier to be studying for what you want to do as an eventual career? These are all important questions to ask yourself. Make no mistake college immediately following high school isn\u2019t for everybody out there. There\u2019s a lot of life experiences you can undertake before you even consider getting a higher degree. You could go and work in a trade, go the CC route for a little, or even get a traditional job and obtain work experience. Nothing will hurt your resume in the long run. But always remember that you don\u2019t stay young forever and ultimately it\u2019s your time and energy you\u2019re using up if you truly in your heart and head don\u2019t feel like this stuff is worth studying. So, I\u2019d take a step back because this tale rings true for myself and how I felt when I first got to school. Obviously I can\u2019t tell you what to do and that\u2019s one of the toughest parts of becoming a grown up that no one tells you - making your own informed decisions based on what\u2019s responsible and not giving into pressure. Make sure you\u2019re doing this for yourself and nobody else in the world. Make sure you\u2019re 100% positive this is the right direction for achieving self-actualization in life. It could be that you just haven\u2019t found your true passion to study yet and ofc this is common; majors change all the time and being undeclared certainly isn\u2019t out of the ordinary for a lot of first year (even some second year students.)

I'm pretty qualified to talk about this since I actually did drop out and then return at a different school ages later.\n\nDropping out wasn't worth it.  It was a bad idea and if I had to do things over I would not have done so.  However, I was able to take a lot of development from it and hopefully I can use what I learned to help others.  There are good reasons to drop out but you haven't listed any.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and guess some things about you.  If I'm wrong, I apologize.\n\nI don't think you want to quit because you are getting bad grades, or at least not directly.  I think you want to quit because it is PAINFUL.  Finding out that what you are doing now won't work SUCKS.  Looking inside and thinking \"maybe I'm not good enough\" is THE WORST.  The thought of actually putting energy in time and making an *actual change* instead of a small shift that you just undo afterwords is TERRIFYING.  And doing all of this, over and over, without an actual guarantee that it will get better is FUCKING AWFUL.  It must be utterly overwhelming to have all of these feelings and more inside yourself.\n\nAnd guess what?  It's totally normal to feel that.  Your emotions are legitimate and important.  That is a tough fucking row to hoe.  I'm sorry that you have to deal with it.  I'm sorry that it's not easy for you now like it seems like for most people and actually is for some people.  It's not fun and it's not fair.  You have a right to your feelings and to people who will listen and support you.\n\nYou can do this.  Don't avoid all of the frustration and pain you feel.  Do it the hard way.  Do the things that you don't want to do.  The things that you are coming up with every reason not to do.  Face them head on and watch them get better.\n\nI am speaking from personal experience because I'm describing how I was.  One day, you're going to look back and marvel at what you were able to accomplish and it will be meaningful BECAUSE it was hard.\n\nGuess what else?  The pain you feel is magnified a thousand times by your own anxiety.  This actually gets manageable as you improve.  College doesn't get easier but you get WAY better at it.  As you work, you will not just learn facts and strategies but actually grow.  You have no idea how strong you can get from this.  You literally have no idea how far you can go, but you are the one that has to go.
