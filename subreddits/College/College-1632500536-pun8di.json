  "text": "Hey, guy! I\"m new to this sub and just had to ask a general question: *Is an associate's degree, especially in general academics, useless?* \n\nIt's taken me a while to even come around to the idea of school and decided to attend a community college for something to do. Four weeks in, I'm not sure that this will help me get a higher-paying job. And if I decide to get a higher education, am I just putting myself through unnecessary debt by getting this undergrad degree?\n\nI'd hate to drop out and be out of school for another year, but I'm pretty lost on what I should do.",

      "text": "Most associates degrees are \"useless\" (useless in the sense that it's unlikely to help your job search). The value of an associates is that it gets you halfway to a bachelor's degree, and bachelor's degrees can be valuable. Once you get your bachelor's degree, it doesn't matter what you majored in for your associates. A \"general studies\" bachelor's degree is about the least marketable degree you can get, so just make sure you decide on a better major if/when you transfer to get a bachelor's. \n\nIf you don't want to get a full 4-year degree you should look into vocational programs. Many people recommend trades, but there are also decent jobs in allied health fields that only require a 2-3 year vocational degree.",

I was under the impression that if I pursued further education, I\u2019d be spending up to six years in college. Are you saying I\u2019ll only spend 4 years total?",

              "text": "Yes-- BUT it's important to make sure that you transfer to a school that has a transfer agreement with your community college. These agreements ensure that the school you transfer to will accept your community college credits. Otherwise, some schools screw over their transfers by not accepting those community college credits which lengthens the time it takes to get the degree.\n\nBut yes, community college covers the same stuff you'd cover in the first two years of a bachelor's degree, so typically when you move on to get your bachelor's you only need two more years of school to get the degree (assuming all your credits are accepted).",
