I\"m new to this sub and just had to ask a general question: *Is an associate's degree, especially in general academics, useless?* \n\nIt's taken me a while to even come around to the idea of school and decided to attend a community college for something to do. Four weeks in, I'm not sure that this will help me get a higher-paying job. And if I decide to get a higher education, am I just putting myself through unnecessary debt by getting this undergrad degree?\n\nI'd hate to drop out and be out of school for another year, but I'm pretty lost on what I should do.", "author": "swimming_piggie", "created": 1632500536, "retrieved": 1632946062, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he49231": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pun8di/associates_in_gen_academics/he49231/", "text": "Most associates degrees are \"useless\" (useless in the sense that it's unlikely to help your job search). The value of an associates is that it gets you halfway to a bachelor's degree, and bachelor's degrees can be valuable. Once you get your bachelor's degree, it doesn't matter what you majored in for your associates. A \"general studies\" bachelor's degree is about the least marketable degree you can get, so just make sure you decide on a better major if/when you transfer to get a bachelor's. \n\nIf you don't want to get a full 4-year degree you should look into vocational programs. Many people recommend trades, but there are also decent jobs in allied health fields that only require a 2-3 year vocational degree.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632505963, "upvotes": 2}}}
