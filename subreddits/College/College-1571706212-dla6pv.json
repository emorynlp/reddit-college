  "text": "First day of class my professor assigns a controversial topic 5 paragraph essay. These are so easy I can do them in my sleep. She then goes on to have us brainstorm on the topic \u201creasons why people drop out of college.\u201d People say things like \u201cmoney issues, health issues, mental health, family problems, interest change, etc.\u201d And she said \u201cmental health isn\u2019t a real thing so don\u2019t ever write a paper about it, people who can\u2019t afford college shouldn\u2019t be in college, and family problems arent important at all, especially when it comes to your education.\u201d So a brave soul stood up and asked \u201cso you\u2019re saying we cannot write about these reasons if we write about reasons students drop out?\u201d And she laughed and said \u201cI\u2019ll throw it in the trash in front of you\u201d\n\nI go on to write my paper about whether or not college athletes should be paid. And tried to use graduate transfers as an example because they already have a degree and do not go to class.. she took my paper and threw it in the garbage in front of the class because I wrote something using another college\u2019s football team as an example. (I go to a community college right now)\n\nSo is this normal behavior? Or should something be done about it? I just want some tips on how to deal with\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE POST:\n\n\nSo I\u2019m not too familiar with reddit yet so idk exactly how to make an update post, but I just went to the department head of liberal arts of my community college, she was busy (of course) and I was asked to wait. 10ish minutes go by and I asked her receptionist if I can run to the bathroom. I get up to go and find there\u2019s a doctorate professor with open office hours; so I go and ask her specifically about my paper (which I had to pick up out of the trash) and ask her what exactly was \u201cwrong\u201d. She looks through it and says \u201cwell looks like your professor said you didn\u2019t do MLA correctly\u201d (I\u2019ve been doing MLA papers since 5th grade and my comp 1 prof said I was excellent at MLA formatting). Paper was double spaced, TNR with 12 pt font. 1 inch margins, etc. She assumes I\u2019m upset with the professor because \u201cyou got a bad grade. They won\u2019t switch you because you don\u2019t have a valid reason.\u201d So im already a little pissed off because I have to deal with my professor and now the higher level professors are telling me I can\u2019t switch either. \n\nI go on to argue with her and try and plead my case and still she says no. Again not even her decision if I can switch, that\u2019s the department head\u2019s job. Then I bring up \u201cwell my professor said mental health isn\u2019t a real thing and personally I\u2019ve got bad anxiety and have been working through it. So how can I deal with my anxiety when I have a professor who thinks it\u2019s all a joke?\u201d And IMMEDIATELY she turns around what she\u2019s saying and says \u201clet me get you in with the dean right now and fill out the student issues form\u201d \n\nSo I\u2019m still waiting for the dean and will update this post again whenever I\u2019m done! \n\nAgain sorry if it\u2019s sloppy or hard to find, I\u2019m still new to reddit and don\u2019t know a lot!\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2: \n\nDean dodged my meeting and told me to schedule another one with her receptionist. The receptionist heard 1/2 of my argument and had to stop herself from saying anything negative about the professor. \u201cIf it\u2019s a controversial topic essay, it should be written about a topic that\u2019s controversial to the student, not based on what the professor wants to read right?\u201d Is what she asked me and I said \u201cfinally someone who gets it!!\u201d And so I\u2019m scheduled to meet with her tomorrow 11:30am. Will update again. \n\nMy goal is solely to get out of this class and hopefully get into a better comp class. I will post my review of her on RMP so hopefully people can avoid her at my college.",

The thing is if this is an actual professor and if they're tenured then it's going to be very difficult to achieve anything.   I've had older tenured professors that were essentially on their way out and adopt a much more relaxed teaching style.  Others got roped into teaching undergrad classes and so they took it out on the students. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they're one of the lower professors or even just an instructor then you'll have far more luck. \n\nLook at the bright, it's easy to figure out exactly what this person wants to hear to get an easy A.",
