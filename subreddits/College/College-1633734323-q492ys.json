  "title:": "AITA for wanting to study abroad during winter break?",
  "text": "I want to take a trip to Italy over winter break since my other study abroad trip was cancelled due to covid in 2020 and I graduate next semester. Unfortunately, I cannot take a trip after I graduate because I am in a program/internship the whole summer starting two days after my commencement. So that leaves my with either taking a trip from December 28th to January 11th in Italy or taking a trip during spring break in Mississippi (but I would be missing 3 days of class). \n\nMy parents, especially my mom, does not like either option because she wants me to come home and spend time with the family. The way I see it, I had plenty of time with them the past year. I was with them for 2 months for my extended winter break last year and 3 weeks during the summer in between my advanced coursework program and starting a summer job at school. And I will most likely have plenty more time with them since I am planning on moving back home after my summer internship.\n\nI feel kinda like an asshole though because my parents would be paying for this study abroad trip (they cover education costs) and they have been guilting me with that I am making them spend money so I don't see them. \n\nShould I still do the trip? I am spending my Thanskgiving break with them and I would be able to see them for 5 days before my spring semester starts so it isn't like I am not seeing them at all until graduation.",

      "text": "You're an adult- you should be able to do what you want and if your parents don't accept it so be it. You may not see them for christmas, but it's just one christmas and you won't be missing class and you'll still see them a few times before you go. I do think that you should focus on getting time with them if they really want, but don't waste your time holding back on what you want to do just because it'll make other people sad for a while.",
