  "text": "This only started happening in college but everybody stares at me here. I know that glancing at someone walking by is normal, but whenever I\u2019m sitting in the library or food court and look up, I always see somebody staring at me and then they look down quickly. When I walk by groups of people, they always turn and look at me and then start talking. I find that people will stare at me during class and I\u2019ll meet their eyes several times (they were looking at me first).\n\nI\u2019m really socially anxious and I don\u2019t know why this is happening.. I\u2019m not weird looking and I try to dress normally..\n\nEdit - I kind of just posted this to see if any other people had similar experiences",

      "text": "Maybe they are looking at you, but social anxiety can make things seem much worse. I remember learning something about the \"spotlight effect\" where a person always feels like people are watching.   \n\n\nI used to feel this way. I felt like everywhere I went people were staring at me. I was paranoid that I was walking funny, maybe my hair looked weird, maybe my shirt didnt fit right, maybe I just looked weird, etc. I felt like I stuck out.   \n\n\nI cant tell you how to get past social anxiety, but I can tell you that looking nervous will get peoples attention.   \n\n\nAlso, people like to people watch. If your by yourself at campus people will probably look, that doesnt mean anything about you. I have a hard time not looking at people. I mean, most people look at each other.   \n\n\nOverall, the older I get the less I care why people look.",

I highly suggest you to do this to decrease your anxiousness of picking up girls because when that attraction is gone, it'll be 10 times more difficult to get rid of it.\n\n\nIf girls do not check you out on a common basis you'll have to get rejected hundereds of times before you start getting good at picking up girls.\n\n\nComming from someone who has been on both sides of that spectrum, i'd highly advise you to go for it.",

      "text": "You may be over thinking it tbh, you\u2019ll notice patterns more when you\u2019re actively looking for it, or have the thought in the back of your mind. I make eye contact constantly not intentionally when walking around campus, or just walking around in general. As do people with me. Don\u2019t think much of it. If anything they\u2019re staring at you because you\u2019re attractive to some degree. If you\u2019re a girl that\u2019s more than likely the reason tbh, especially if you notice the eye contact with guys more often than not.",
