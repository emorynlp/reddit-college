Not out of comfort or habit - out of necessity. \n\nBecause that moment, the moment when a person realizes they are awake in bed, the moment they begin their day, the moment that may define their mood for the next few hours, on ______ that was also the moment I could feel real pain - the moment I realized he was inside me. \n\nAnd for the past 5 months, I have begun every morning thinking about that exact moment - feeling the pain and reliving the trauma, everytime I opened my eyes.\n\nDay 1. It was unbearable.\nAt 7am, after running out of his room, the room I had no recollection of coming to, I stared at myself in the mirror and tried to make sense of the hundreds of broken pieces of memories in my head from the night. I didn\u2019t have my bra on. My head was pounding. I had never blacked out before. I had bruises. My underwear was on backwards. Everything hurt. \nAnd it wasn\u2019t until I talked to my friends that I realized the most horrible thing a person can remember - I was raped. \n\nI thought that that day and the next night were the worst night of my life. I thought that it couldn\u2019t get worse than the inability to sleep, the burning, aching pain running through my body, the uncomfortableness I felt being in my own skin, the hatred I felt for myself, the fact that I could only replay him assaulting my passed out self and focus on nothing else, the loneliness I had when I stood in the room at 4am scared to go outside and try to see my friends - knowing he lived near me. And so I cried for hours, staring at the mirror, begging someone to heal my body and mind and pleading the world to go back in time and give me a redo. I thought that was my rock bottom. \n\nTo my dismay, that wasn\u2019t the worst night. The worst came with time. \nExpectations of how one was supposed to heal from this set in. And as days went by, the anger inside me grew. \nI hated the sun for coming up everyday acting like I had the energy to repeat another brutal 24 hours, I despised my classes for continuing when all I could focus on was my pain rather than school, I felt unbearably guilty all the time, and I resented everyone who smiled and went about their life normally without a care in the world. I hated the therapist I was given because i didn\u2019t want to speak to someone who I knew didn\u2019t care. I hated my friends for loving me more than I deserved. But most of all, I hated myself.\nThe person I had become was no longer me. I felt my spark die. I didn\u2019t want to laugh anymore, I didn\u2019t want to exert my energy, i didn\u2019t want to think about anything, and most of all I didn\u2019t want to feel. \nSo I tried not to feel. I drank until I thought the pain would fade, I attached myself onto people who I thought could heal me, I didn\u2019t feel the need to make new friends or be kind to people who I didn\u2019t care about, and I went out thinking I wouldn\u2019t let this affect me for one night. \nI was reckless, unbothered, unmotivated, and numb. And I thought I could make it work. \nBut frankly, I didn\u2019t care if I lived or died. It wasn\u2019t as though death seemed attractive, but more so that with the life that I was living - I felt death couldn\u2019t hurt more than right now. \n\nThen came the night I broke. I was embarrassed, I was hurting, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that night on repeat, and I was more in pain than ever before. I could physically feel my mind deactivating my entire body causing my legs to collapse onto the floor of my dorm room. I couldn\u2019t breathe through my tears or be coherent enough to tell my body to inhale. And at that moment on ____, lying on the floor of my messy room in a blue hoodie with leggings, struggling to see, shivering and sweating at the same time, digging my nails into my hand until I bled but not feeling anything, hitting my hand against the tiled floor, \nit felt like I was already dead. \n\nAnd if it weren\u2019t for 4 people who cared about me more than I cared about myself, I very much would be. \n\nI call that my rock bottom. \nAnd it gave me two choices. I could let my trauma define me, control me, even kill me. Or I could grow from here and start being good enough for the people who believed I was good enough to stay with them. \n\nThe hardest decision I made that next day was to wake up. And looking back two months later, it took time and patience, but I am so thankful that I did. \n\nI still fall asleep every night and wake up every morning thinking about that one day. Thinking about the amount of pain I was in, feeling the memory of the pain still. But now I also fall asleep knowing that I am loved. Knowing that I am better than the shitty card I was delt this past year. And knowing that I am stronger than I ever thought I would be. \n\nThis is why I can confidently say that one day, I will no longer have to switch my position when I wake up. My trauma will no longer be residing in my thoughts at all times. This burden will not weigh on me as heavily as it did before. \n\nFor the first time in months, I feel alive again. I feel like myself. And dare I say, I feel happy. \n\nI now speak directly to my assaulter: I will be damned before I give you more time and importance than I already have in this wonderful life I am about to live. \n\nThank you for reading.", "author": "anonymousandhappyy", "created": 1626324701, "retrieved": 1632947776, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 835, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h5er4tb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/oklphx/my_story_of_sexual_assault_as_a_freshman/h5er4tb/", "text": "That was one of the most beautiful posts I've ever read.
