  "text": "Call me a loser but I hate staying up till 1 am every night on the weekends. my roommate probably thinks I'm the lamest person ever but I'm a student athlete and even during the summer I'd get up at 6:45 to exercise and beat the heat. I have always needed a ton of sleep and feel like crap when I get less than 7 hours, usually hits me the day after. I just feel like the whole days gone, or the whole morning's gone at least even when I wake up at 9:30 (didn't even know I could sleep that late).",

College is expensive and I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth. \n\nMy point is to do you. I honestly don\u2019t care if my roommate or friends think I\u2019m a loser. I\u2019m taking out huge loans and making huge payments for a degree to care about anyone thinking I\u2019m lame for sleeping.",
