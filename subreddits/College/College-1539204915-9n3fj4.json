  "text": "I have known a couple of professors (and heard of many more) that will talk about having a low pass rate either for exams or the class as a bragging point. I understand that a class should be engaging and challenging and am of the opinion a degree needs to be earned. However, at a certain point a line needs to drawn. It reflects poorly on you as a teacher. Either your tests are unfair or something else you are doing is obstructing the class. I would love to hear other opinions on this.",

By far the best professor I had, had set the bar high.   You were not going to pass his class by just simply showing up.  He challenged you to learn the material and to do it well.

      "text": "It really depends on the course and school in my opinion. For courses like Finance or Accounting, where there is a fixed knowledge set, pretty universal teaching methods and a clear standard for performance in the industry, there should be very little wiggle room in terms of what is acceptable and what is not. I've attended a well regarded \"party school\" and inevitably a lot of the students just weren't going to work hard enough to meet those standards in certain courses. And I'm fine with it in those instances. Believe it or not, it does make a difference in on campus recruiting when a bank can reliably count on your grade in certain courses as an indicator of your skills and the quality of the college. If a professor wants to brag about it, whatever; usually it's meant as a warning to students to actually study, and professors have a right to stand up against lazy students that waste their time. The fact that there will always be a significant percentage of students that fail doesn't necessarily mean the course or professor is flawed; it's usually just a reflection of the fact you have 19 year old kids in your class, and that 19 year olds can be immature (or, quite simply, out of their depth).\n\nThat said, there are obvious situations where grade deflation is an issue. I attended a top post grad program where practically every student worked their ass off to be there, was demonstrably intelligent, tuition was 50k a year and there was a very small chance more than a few of them weren't doing the amount of work required to achieve proficiency in the subject. Not to mention that the grading and material choice for the degree was a lot more subjective. In those instances, where I would see more than 5% with C grades or below, it was obviously on the professor in my opinion. While they were few and far between, those guys can rot in hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

But it may also be true that they have standards that they aren\u2019t willing to lower just to get an ideal distribution of grades.\n\nFor example, I taught a very small lab of 9 students. And the grade distribution for a particular report went as 3 As, 3 Ds, and 3 Fs. And sure, I would talk about it frequently with the grad students, and to be honest it was kind of funny seeing such a wild distribution. But I can also say, that those who failed completely deserved it because they did things like left off sections worth 30% of the report, didn\u2019t use complete sentences, and just made statements that were undeniably false about the science.\n\nI did everything I could, but it\u2019s a \u201cyou can bring a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make him drink\u201d scenario. Students in no way deserve to pass just by being in a certain percentage of the class. They only deserve to pass if they meet the requirements of the professor, because they are trying to help the student grow. I\u2019d just as soon fail an entire class that doesn\u2019t deserve to pass as give an entire class As who deserve it. And if I do have to fail an entire class, I will make it well known. Partially to ask my colleges their opinions, but also because I want people to know my expectations of them.\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify though, that if you do good work and listen to expectations set, then you do deserve an A. I\u2019m mostly talking about students that expect a good grade only because they did the assignments or their buddies got a certain grade.",

      "text": "I faced a teacher like this in my undergrad. It was the first discipline specific engineering class we had to take our second year first semester. The teacher made the class almost impossible and they prided themselves on being a \"weed out class\". The material was not actually that hard what made the class impossible was poor teaching, excessive busy work, unclear grading, ridiculously long tests for the time and no resources for support. It was an environment that rewarded cheating and the teacher was incredibly sexist. Many students would spend 20-30 hours a weeks on this one class, know the material inside and out and still fail the test.\n\nSo many kids switched out of the major or to a different disciple just out of frustration or from the setback failing the class would cause on graduation time ( had to pass to take next successive class). So many smart, talented students  left the discipline because their first taste of it was such bullshit. The worst part is when I would see those people who switched out they all said virtually the same thing: they wish they had stuck it out, found a way to make it work, or done something about this crappy teacher. It made me wonder how many great talented engineers this field missed out on because ONE teacher ruined it for them so early on. The rest of my classes after that had much harder material but the teachers made the class fair and taught it well. You had to work hard and study but you could do it if you put in the time. Made me despise how my first teacher ruined a great major with other stellar teachers with one class. ",

The course I took was Industrial Engineering.\n\nWe had 2 major subjects that had around a 50% passing rate, Statistics 1 and Operations Research 1. Once you pass these two, it's very likely that you will be able to pass all other subjects no problem, and you will graduate on time. If you fail one, you will be delayed. Thing is, once you are delayed, the same subjects, under the same professors will be far easier and the passing rate is a lot higher. The college is able to control this as we have just around 80-100 students per year level and there is little reason to take the subjects apart from the order given.\n\nEssentially, those who graduated on time will be known to be some of the best students and are targeted by larger companies. There are some who are good students but delay their graduation for other reasons though. I'm not saying that this reason is justified, even though I benefit from it. Just giving that perspective. ",

      "text": "This is gonna be a long one, so my bad but I had a professor last year teaching an organic chem II class (pretty rigourous class for people in science) who took over midway througg the semester for a diff professor. Not only did he entirely switch our syllabus and its scale, but he also began giving us ridiculously unfair exams that had the lowest overall averages I've seen for a class. Our AI's told us after an exam (that had a 37% average) that a good chunk of the questions on the exam were from their 2nd year exams they took in their PhD programs. When students questioned his wonky scale, he went off on them. A friend of mine had him the summer before and didnt understand a mechanism (he routinely wrote mechanisms that were the big exceptions to normal ochem rules) and he replied by telling her that she should probably switch out of a premed program if she was having struggles with his ochem, and that he wouldn't help her because he is her teacher and not her tutor. After we took the final, to make sure that he didnt have too many A grades, he pulled the rug out from under us by RAISING the requirements to get an A or B, so a nice number of students were boxed out of an A or B after having scored in those ranges throughout the semester. This particular professor also has tenure at our university, so when a massive amount of students inevitably complained to the department about what was going on, he told the director of undergrad studies (who doesnt have tenure) that he'd look into it. He never changed a thing and so a large amount of students failed or scored low in the course. Basically every A and B in that class was a product of the first exam, as the first professor copied and pasted an old exam of his from a year prior that a student organization on campus had, so anyone who had it scored significantly better on that exam, causing inflated A and B scored (the average was around a 68%).\n\nThe only positive is that the Chem department decided he was too unfair as an undergrad teacher and pulled him from teaching Orgo II from now on, but never did anything about our class..",

Curving that hard to disguise blunders in lack of teaching ability, either in conveyance of material or selection of test material, is abysmal. \n\nIt was a tough subject for sure, but I think the test highs provide a good indication, usually. If the high was 95+, it usually means there was a plausible way you could have found and retained/surmised the same info. When it's in the 70's it usually means the professor sorely failed to address topics to prepare their students.\n\nBut at the end if the day, the curves are transparent, they modify the scale prior to the reports to the school see nothing wrong with the system. \n\nI didn't pass that course until they allowed the TA to develop a lab set for the course, and let her teach the study sections. Having real examples was nice but the difference was she could actually execute the math behind the problems. The professors would just throw half baked examples at the board and either not explain any of the math, or get half way through, get lost and give up when things didn't line up. Then they'd concoct problems for the test with unlimited time and resources or steal them from their peers. \n\nDisclaimer: I know I'm ripping on professors a lot here, but this only happened in 4-5 courses.

A lot of classmates were taking diff eq w/ me that quarter and most of us ended up having to sacrifice our diff eq grade because it was winter quarter and diff eq was offered both winter and spring, but physics 2 was winter only and a pre req to physics 3. I heard my diff eq professor investigated why his winter class had such a high failure rate this quarter, and when he found out why he went to the dean and got my physics 2 professor reprimanded. I heard the class is way more chill now but I wish I got refunded or diff eq offered free over summer because it is so messed up. ",

Another 30% don't give a fuck because they aren't really on the right track in life.

This resulted in ~50% fail rate (D included as fail) for this course because so many students came into the class without the proper background knowledge. I don\u2019t believe I taught poorly, since grades were in a bimodal distribution with multiple 100% passing grades and I had overall good reviews. This was also the norm pass rate for years before I even arrived. It really bothered me and I presume it was an unethical way to get more tuition. The other reason I believe this is that they allowed students to drop courses up until the last day, so you can get an incomplete but they keep your money. I did not teach there very long.\n\nThe moral is, beware of schools that try to push you into classes you feel you are not prepared for. And note that these schools will provide legitimate degrees and appear wholesome, but can still be unethical in this way.",

I have almost 30 years of experience with this exact argument topic.  \n\nFirst, people in this thread seem to be under the impression that professors are all, by definition, educators.  This isn't always true.  \nAt smaller community colleges and non-A.B.E.T. accredited schools professors are basically teachers so in these cases OP has a point.  But at a higher-level University many professors are first and foremost RESEARCHERS. Their job is: TO PUBLISH; but also answer questions from these idiot kids while you're here.  Publishing influential research is how schools get recognized for producing capable graduates and more is better.\n\nFurthermore, students with a degree from your university that don't know what they're doing reflect poorly on said university.  A university is only as good as its reputation, so graduates that know what they're doing are a top priority for anywhere that cares.  This leads to a harsh bottom line (the line OP talks about drawing): if the kids don't know anything, didn't learn anything, and can't do anything then they don't pass the class.\n\nHere in the US at least, the number of kids coming out of high school COMPLETELY unprepared to learn-for-real is the largest factor to blame here.  Learning is FAR more sensitive to technique than talent. Moreover, you are your own best teacher.  This is true for literally everyone, but US schools seem only to value basic memorization and nothing else.  The kids with high school diplomas don't have the tools they need to figure out complicated stuff on their own.  And I mean \"tools\" not \"intelligence\" because what you need in order to figure out complicated things for yourself is: the right set of tools.\n\nThese kids go to college and know only the zero-freedom, memorization-only, education-by-dictation nonsense that fills K-12 so they have trouble independently pursuing research topics effectively.  Perhaps more importantly, we/they lack the experience and tools necessary to identify and understand the how's and why's of a topic.  Regurgitating the definitions of keywords, or the names and dates of people and events is just not as important as understanding how the event happened and why it happened that way instead of some other way. This is absolutely essential for higher education and reaching the college level without significant experience in this area makes a professor's job all but impossible until they stop to teach this first.\n\nThe professors most successful at teaching me and my classmates rarely answered our questions directly.  They pointed us to places or techniques that allowed us to learn independently.  This independence is the ultimate goal of any good University program. \nThis next bit sounds kinda assh*le-y, but I'm including it because it's true and relevant: if you still need someone else to teach you, you haven't earned your degree yet.\n\nOn the flip side, a huge influx of largely unprepared and unqualified students has created a tough ultimatum for respected Universities that want to cash in with big student bodies and high tuition costs(seemingly every US A.B.E.T. university):  high failure rates or unqualified graduates.  Some schools have found that high failure rates resulted in bad press, toxic reviews by word-of-mouth, and a subsequent decline in applications and alumni funding.  When \"cashing in\" was the whole point, these revenue losses hurt especially bad.  In response, these Universities push their professors to pass unqualified students en masse.  Most professors don't like to hear \"lower your standards\" or \"tone down the material\" from arsehole suits with a communications degree because who are they to say what's needed in the professor's field?  Also, most professors teach the curriculum they do BECAUSE they feel it is necessary to understand the topic of the class--to then be told by someone with no experience in the field \"nah they don't need to know any of that sh*t\" is understandably frustrating.\nIn these instances (which I have found to be common in a wide variety of large US Universities) a professor with the FREEDOM to fail students who don't know the material is a moral victory worth relishing, or even maybe bragging about.  These people are happy they ARE ALLOWED to do their job well.  \nThat last line seems pretty widely relate-able to me.  Lots of people work somewhere with some dumb rule or policy from the higher-ups-that-don't-get-it that directly prevents them from doing their job better.  Defeating those FEELS GOOD.\n\nThere are also assh*les who just like watching people fail in general.  Those people are scattered about everywhere; some of them are professors.  I'd remark about one if I'd met one too.\n\n\n\nTL;DR  Not all professors are teachers first. Bad high schools can give professors/universities a difficult choice: high fail rates or incompetent graduates.  After internal disagreement ensues, whichever side prevails is liable to brag.\n\n\nEdits: Typos/syntax",

I have a BS in physics and an MS in EE and one of the worst profs I ever had did something like this.\n\nIt was calc 2. Generally considered the hardest of the three calcs imo (calc 3 is just calc 1 and 2 in 3+ dimensions) his 'teaching style' was to talk for 15 minutes about the canonical example of an technique (say integration by parts) pass out a worksheet packet, and have us solve them in groups while he wandered around. Obviously, having never seen integration by parts before, mistakes will be made by students, mistakes they don't want reinforced by repetition. If you ever asked him if an answer you got was right, he would just not answer, vaguely point at the canonical example and walk away. Given that there weren't any pure math majors in the class, and most people needed the class because other classes needed you to be able to integrate, and understand the concepts, I learned nothing useful from him. Not to mention, thank God for sharpie and paper guy on YouTube. He taught me more.",

It is not just the way HS subjects are taught, but that many students avoid being intellectually challenged. \n\nIf students take the minimum required to get a HS diploma (in some states that is just 2 years each of history, math, and science) then they are completely unprepared for college. \n\nThey may have not been pushed to think in rigorous ways about abstract ideas, which makes all college courses more difficult. They do not know basic math and science principles, which makes it difficult to pass required courses in those departments. And, they arrive with a disposition that you should do the minimum you can to get by, which eventually causes failure because they get behind.",

The university tells students every year in orientation and has a ton of signs up around campus about new classes that fulfill the GenEd requirements every student needs in hopes of providing a more well rounded education. Quite clearly meaning they want the students to be exposed to a large amount of concepts from different academic viewpoints. \n\nI can agree with that idea and see the benefit to it, what I can\u2019t stand is that most of the professors who teach these classes need a reality check. These people seem to think classes meant to broaden the students world views are better served as classes that assign large amounts of articles or chapters to read so they can test you on wether or not you caught the obscure history fact mentioned in the table in page 4 of the 2nd of 32, 10pg+ long articles.

While unreasonable, we enter into every semester with the optimistic delusion that this semester \u2018everyone will get it\u2019. Everyone will put in the work. Everyone will approach the class as if they were there on purpose. Yet, as the weeks pass and the attrition begins, we are left to face a sad reality where we lose half or more of the bright faces and eager minds we began with.\n\nWhat I have observed in my career can perhaps be explained by a difference of goals. As a professor, I want each and every student to learn all (and I do mean all) of the material for the course. I consider it a personal failure when a student doesn\u2019t. But I would consider it an ethical violation if a student were to pass without learning the material. This is, I feel, where the disconnect lies. If you give the typical student a choice between learning the material and passing the course, they will choose passing the course every time. Students now attend college not to learn, but to get a degree, as if they are purchasing a license to enter the workforce (as a side note, I believe personally that we are requiring college degrees for far too many entry level positions today).\n\nThis difference of view creates a contentious relationship where professors are seen as barriers to getting a job instead of useful resources to improve ones mental abilities. I don\u2019t have a solution to this, sadly. \n\nBut I can leave all students reading this with some advice: Go talk to your professors. Go to class. Do all of your assignments. At least pretend to take an interest in your classes. Because at the end of the day, our greatest joy is seeing a spark of joy from a small student success become an insatiable hunger for knowledge.\n\nI apologize for the long post, thank you for reading.",

For example, in mathematics, your math professor may have adored math in HS, adored it even more in university, loved it so much that they did a graduate degree or 2 in it, and then they were still so unbelievably driven that they sacrificed a lot just to teach a bunch of uninterested 18yos in College Algebra.\n\nSo when they teach, they're going to teach to the embodiment of who they were. They're teaching to the hyper-interested student who loves math, who will eagerly attend class, and who will do all of the assigned work. They don't have any other experience and at no stage do they get instruction in teaching. Their \"instruction\" was to be given a class to teach, which they were never really assessed on later anyway. That's it. There's no focus on pedagogy, there's no discussion of different learning styles and aims, you just get a class, and you teach the material you have to teach. And you always default to teaching it how you would have learnt and understood it. \n\nThat's the big problem. Look, I aced every single math class I ever took. It's just what my brain is good at, and so I never had to struggle. If a student doesn't understand my explanation, then I can quickly hit a wall because *I don't understand what you don't understand*. The only way I've found around that is to do 1-on-1 tutoring for multiple hours until we find common ground to build on, but I can't do that with every student in a 200+ class, especially if 195+ of them will never give me any sort of feedback (not even a look of confusion during class!). Ask them if they understand, and maybe three people will dully nod, the rest giving blank stares. I would love to find that common ground so that all students can achieve their goals for the class, but I do not have training in this, I apparently won't be given training in this, and I need students to work *with* me so that I can make reasonable adjustments. I cannot read your mind. I don't know why you're failing or not showing up. I don't know what you need me to do better. \n\nIf you know what your professors need to change, re instruction style, in order for you to succeed, then *tell them*. Work together for both of your benefit. ",

Either way, I don\u2019t think that mentality can really be applied to university studies. \n\nYou might be lucky and be born into money and getting a job or even a degree doesn\u2019t really matter, so you can focus on learning and whether you pass or fail the class, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nHowever, most of us rely on doing well in college so that we can get a good job. That is largely based on GPA. Graduating with a 3.8 GPA as opposed to a 1.7 GPA is a huge difference no matter how much you might have actually learned. So when given the choice of learning material that won\u2019t help in future jobs (but doing poorly grade wise) or passing a class that might have been too easy (without learning much), I would say nearly everyone would choose the latter.

The professors *wanted* students to pass and understood that many would find the material challenging. Lots of study sessions, office hours, etc (and some of the study sessions were literally the professor going over example problems that *turned out to be the actual test*...maybe morally questionable, but I kept my mouth shut).  Basically they *wanted* you to pass and would give you every tool possible.  The guys that failed out were the ones who played PS2 all night, didn't go to study sessions, didn't understand the material, and were *still* flabbergasted that they'd do so poorly.  \n\n\nMy second school (transferred) was way more liberal-arts oriented.  Most of the professors were pretty awesome, but the head of my department was a mean old tenured devil that bragged about her ability to keep people from graduating.  She liked marking people down for no reason besides their audacity to wear makeup to an 8 am class. She hated me (as she hated all other males in our major), and tried sweating me in her office about a passing grade in my final class with her.  I called bullshit (I'd done fantastic work my entire time there, so I dunno what would have happened if she decided to actually fuck with me and I had to go to somebody above her in the food chain), she demurred and gave me a B (which was kinda bitchy, I felt my work was on-par or exceeded that of some \"A\" students, and I'd had two years of working with most of them to compare/contrast with).    \n   \nBut overall I think the \"my class is SO hard\" mentality is pretty dumb.  It's not SEAL training, it's college.  ",

Making a class difficult solely so you can fail people is assinine. Making a class so difficult that large percentages of people fail and then *keeping* it that way over time is simply irresponsible. As a department chair I monitor the overall GPAs assigned by my colleagues...if I had one who was routinely failing large numbers of students we'd be having a serious conversation about her/his course design, pedagogy, and suitability for teaching in our department.  If you intentionally design and deliver a class your students cannot succeed in you have no business being a teacher. Yes, they must earn the credit and yes, there should be a significant distribution of grades...but bragging about failing students is, in my experience, more a sign of a failed professor.\n\nIn my department we try to calibrate our courses so that on average we're awarding 10% A grades (because officially A=\"excellent\"). We also seek to fail no student who does the minimum that we ask, i.e. if they pass all the assignments and attend the class they will likely earn a D. Intentionally designing a class that large numbers of students cannot pass is the academic equivalent of malpractice.",

If it was, there would only be two grades: \"Mastered\" and \"Failed.\"  There are gradations for a reason and most schools have at least five of those in the US (A-F), while some have 12+ if they do plus/minus grades, etc. \"Mastery\" is a perfectly reasonable standard to earn an A.

So someone doing the bare minimum to pass still isn't allowed to move on, but they can choose to take a slightly different version of the class that will teach you what you need to know or choose to take the same class over with a different professor. \n\nBut you can't just get \"kicked down the road\" with a D because they won't let you take the next class without first getting that C.\n\nAlso, the OP said \"if they pass every assignment\" meaning they didn't *fail* any assignments, and thus, would have an overall grade reflecting that (if nothing they turned in received an F, why would their final grade grade be an F?)

It's a signal that they did not meet all of the learning goals for the course, so clearly they are not going to be competing for any position or program that expects otherwise.

That's not \"stringing students along\" at all-- if your school or program is admitting students who cannot pass your classes you have an admissions problem, not a teaching problem.

Anytime I pay for a service, in fact anytime most people ask for a job to be done, you expect that person to perform it the best it can be done. Getting new tires on my car? I want someone who knows what they're doing so I have the best chances of not having it fall off while driving. Let's say there was a specific issue with my specific tire on that specific rim, I want someone who knows how to address that issue. Same goes for a professor. They should be required to know a plethora of angles by which they can perform their duties. If someone expects a handout, that would be one thing, but if the professor doesn't try multiple methodologies and writes the student off as lazy because they have been ineffective at teaching the material from their proverbial 'only one way to do this' method, I would consider this negligence. Same as I would for the person changing my tire. They are paying, they are entitled to a service. ",

There will always be outliars, but those are not the metric by which any professor should look at when determining how effective they are at teaching. There is a reason many public school districts have begun removing tenured positions in interest of the students. Unions can be beneficial on some fronts, I can't disagree the benefits, but when it allows for negligence and abuse of a system, then I have a problem.\n\nI'm very much for the education system for the record. We need better teachers. I personally believe that accountability is empowering. Someone who can't hold themselves to those standards I believe should reconsider their position. It's akin to doctors that are only in it for the money, if that's the case, do everyone a favor and do something else with your time.\n\nThe last point you made is more telling that people will buy into a system because 'that's just how it is'. That is some ethical baggage to carry around to make excuses for a system that can be changed.",

At the same time, high schools are engaging in grade inflation or even outright grade fraud.\n\nAdd to that a slower maturation for Gen Z. The current cohort of college students hit developmental milestones much later, especially in terms of autonomy and personal responsibility. The average person teaching a class now was probably wandering around their neighborhood unsupervised when they were 6 or 7. With Gen Z, it's common to have kids who didn't go around without an adult until they were 12 or 13. (And just to be clear, I'm not *blaming* Gen Z for this; they didn't choose how to be raised. But, they do get stuck with the consequences.)\n\nTake all that together, and we've got a system where it's quite likely that a very large portion of a student body might not be cut out to handle a department's curriculum, especially if it's a particularly rigorous and demanding department.\n\nMaybe professors ought to change their courses to accommodate changes to the student body, but I don't see that being a good option without making college into a 5 year degree. There's the old adage \"Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.\" Now of course whoever's in charge of the road ought to make sure it's not full of potholes, but ya know, if it's just a steep grade up the side of a mountain, there's not much we can do if the toll booth operator is letting in electric cars with no low gear.",

I'd guess almost everyone doing that is actually an adjunct instructor who is doing it because with their other 2 jobs, they don't have the time or energy to put together a better course.",

While I'm utterly opposed to this BS \"I fail people because it makes me look good\" line in this thread, I have zero problem failing any student who doesn't do the assigned work. If a student tried to pass one of my classes without doing the reading they might be able to earn a D if they were lucky, but it's highly unlikely they could do so (unless, perhaps, they were able to effectively skim hundreds of pages of readings while writing a paper every few weeks). None of the courses in my department spend any time at all in class repeating the content of the readings, so if a student doesn't *do* them s/he will end up sitting there looking like a fool as their peers are applying that knowledge to the classroom material.",

MIT graduate, and the other professors would acknowledge that he was on another level. Incredibly polite guy, and he acknowledge that he might have trouble explaining some topics because of how smart he was, but he would do his best to break everything down as much as he could. \n\nHis tests were brutal. I don\u2019t think they were designed to be impassable, but getting 100% on a test was a feat to be acknowledged, and only a handful of students ever did. \n\nBut, he was fair. The way he graded was that he would run statistics on the grades. The mean grade was a C, and standard deviations above and below were the other grades. He would ignore outliers so nobody would ever \u201cbreak the curve\u201d. I really respect him as a professor because he was an expert at testing concepts, not mechanics. The questions were easy if you understood the concepts, but were very difficult to solve just on route mechanics or memorization. \n\nThe greatest compliment I think I ever received was from him. Linear controls lab final project. We had been learning how to use MatLab to find the transfer function of a system with a limited set of variables. \n\nThe final project was to find the transfer function of a completely black box system based only on 3 input signals we could submit to him and the 3 corresponding output signals he gave back to us. \n\nEvery other team used the transfer function toolbox available in matlab. Me and my team tried to generalize what the teacher had taught us to solve the problem. \n\nThe final presentation came. Everybody else got about the same answer following the same steps with the transfer function toolbox. \n\nOur team presented. I had a 250 by 250 surface plot of all numerator/denominator pairs possible, with the third axis representing the error of each combination that took me about 50 minutes to run on my machine. Hundreds of lines of code we had written that allowed us to change any parameter we wanted or needed so we didn\u2019t have to hard code the answer for 250x250 answers. Weeks of hard work on the line. \n\nOur answer was different than everybody else\u2019s, so we were either very right, or very wrong. \n\nWe were very right, by an entire order of magnitude in error, than everybody else. \n\nWhen the teacher was commenting about our solution, he basically said he would have done everything almost exactly the same way we did. \n\nIt was, hands down, the greatest accomplishment of college, and the one I\u2019m most proud of. \n\nAll this to say that difficulty for the sake of difficulty is not reaching. Dr. Kreidl was a difficult teacher, but his office was always open, and he took as much time as he possibly could, to help students learn the material. His class was feared by everybody, but I don\u2019t think a person left that class without the grade they deserved. \n\nOf all the grades I\u2019ve ever received, the 2 Cs I got from sig sys and lin con are, by far, the most meaningful and accurate grades I\u2019ve ever received, and I can help but be proud of something most people would consider \u201caverage\u201d. I *learned* in that class. That\u2019s not something that happens with a lot of other teachers that brag about the difficulty of their class. ",

The school annually grows its applications from highly qualified students from around the globe, a far cry from when only a small segment of the population of the United States could even hope to be considered for acceptance. There may be (there are!) other factors that contribute to grade inflation, but I would urge you not to cavalierly dismiss the idea that the students themselves are different than they used to be.",

Most people don't know the struggle, they only hear about it). \n\n\nIf schools continue to hand out A's to most students then the value of education will further drop to the point where bachelor's degrees are thought of as highschool diplomas because anyone can get one.

Higher education doesn't really benefit everyone, and given increasing costs the people it is increasingly benefiting is people employed in administering higher education. \n\nThat is, education beyond grade 10 or so is an accreditation process that operates more as a cartel than as an entity that conveys useful information into people. This is why people are so desperate for alternatives to modern higher education. The problem is that accreditation is expensive, and companies are reluctant to do it because its expensive and they can simply be exploited by companies that do not (and be sued).\n\nFor example, imagine that a law firm advertises for a paralegal for a probationary position (6 months) that requires a 26 or Higher ACT/ 1250 SAT. The pay would be minimum wage for 6 months, but pay after that would much more if you were retained. This might seem reasonable considering we are just talking about any high school grad who has a potential to land a $25/hr+ position 6 months out of HS. However, this ad could never work. \n\nFirst, they would be sued (if they ever got big enough or had disgruntled rejected applicants) based on the fact that the ACT has disparate impacts on males/females and Whites/Asians/Blacks/Latinos.\n\nSecond, once they trained this person for 6 months and retained them for a while, other law firms would simply poach their awesome paralegal without having to pay for the accrediting period.

                  "text": "[So this was my schedule last fall, which was my senior year](https://imgur.com/a/wDWxj9b)\n\nI'd work 4 hours on Monday after my lecture, that is if I went to the lecture, then I'd work 9 to 6 on Wednesday and Friday, that got me my 20 hours. Tuesday and Thursday were completely dedicated to school, and I didn't do homework after lectures were over. I usually did all of my homework on Saturday and Sunday, some weekends I'd spend like 12 hours total working on homework, other weekends only had about 4 or 5 hours worth of work, it all depended on the material being covered. There was one or two weekends worth of projects in which I spent about 25+ hours working, about 12 to 16 hours per day. \n\nI don't know what your major is, but mine was civil engineering, best thing I could do before lectures was review the material and its relevant equations before every lecture. I didn't spend too much time reading, most of the time was spent going over equations and every variable. This amounted to about an hour per class every Monday and Wednesday, but made me retain a lot more from every lecture, and homework went by more smoothly, and I had to study less. Another thing that I should mentioned is that my note taking was very limited towards the end of my undergrad career, I benefited more from paying attention to my professors instead of copying what they wrote down.\n\nAnother helpful thing you can do if you have large gaps in your schedule like I did (asides from going to work) is spending time with your classmates. Chances are there's something that they don't understand but you do, or vice-a-versa, you'll understand material a lot better when you teach it to someone else.\n\nAs far as me time goes, I tried to practice bass about an hour a day, and probably gamed for about 10 hours a week, those are the things that kept me sane.",
