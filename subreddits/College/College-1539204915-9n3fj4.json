Thing is, once you are delayed, the same subjects, under the same professors will be far easier and the passing rate is a lot higher. The college is able to control this as we have just around 80-100 students per year level and there is little reason to take the subjects apart from the order given.\n\nEssentially, those who graduated on time will be known to be some of the best students and are targeted by larger companies.

Not only did he entirely switch our syllabus and its scale, but he also began giving us ridiculously unfair exams that had the lowest overall averages I've seen for a class. Our AI's told us after an exam (that had a 37% average) that a good chunk of the questions on the exam were from their 2nd year exams they took in their PhD programs. When students questioned his wonky scale, he went off on them. A friend of mine had him the summer before and didnt understand a mechanism (he routinely wrote mechanisms that were the big exceptions to normal ochem rules) and he replied by telling her that she should probably switch out of a premed program if she was having struggles with his ochem, and that he wouldn't help her because he is her teacher and not her tutor. After we took the final, to make sure that he didnt have too many A grades, he pulled the rug out from under us by RAISING the requirements to get an A or B, so a nice number of students were boxed out of an A or B after having scored in those ranges throughout the semester. This particular professor also has tenure at our university, so when a massive amount of students inevitably complained to the department about what was going on, he told the director of undergrad studies (who doesnt have tenure) that he'd look into it. He never changed a thing and so a large amount of students failed or scored low in the course. Basically every A and B in that class was a product of the first exam, as the first professor copied and pasted an old exam of his from a year prior that a student organization on campus had, so anyone who had it scored significantly better on that exam, causing inflated A and B scored (the average was around a 68%).\n\nThe only positive is that the Chem department decided he was too unfair as an undergrad teacher and pulled him from teaching Orgo II from now on, but never did anything about our class..", "author": "Lunatic7618", "created": 1539260668, "upvotes": 2}, "e7ki9h6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9n3fj4/low_pass_rates_are_not_something_to_brag_about/e7ki9h6/", "text": "\"I have the highest mortality rate in the ER\" -Dr. No at all", "author": "YouHadTimeToWaste", "created": 1539259454, "upvotes": 1}, "e7ki6lo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9n3fj4/low_pass_rates_are_not_something_to_brag_about/e7ki6lo/", "text": "I just took an exam in which the grades turned out to be so low, the whole class and another teacher's(he made the exam) class now have to go to mandatory tutoring.

Chemical Engineering here.  Family includes research degrees (plural) and professorships (plural).  I have almost 30 years of experience with this exact argument topic.  \n\nFirst, people in this thread seem to be under the impression that professors are all, by definition, educators.  This isn't always true.  \nAt smaller community colleges and non-A.B.E.T. accredited schools professors are basically teachers so in these cases OP has a point.  But at a higher-level University many professors are first and foremost RESEARCHERS. Their job is: TO PUBLISH; but also answer questions from these idiot kids while you're here.  Publishing influential research is how schools get recognized for producing capable graduates and more is better.\n\nFurthermore, students with a degree from your university that don't know what they're doing reflect poorly on said university.  A university is only as good as its reputation, so graduates that know what they're doing are a top priority for anywhere that cares.  This leads to a harsh bottom line (the line OP talks about drawing): if the kids don't know anything, didn't learn anything, and can't do anything then they don't pass the class.\n\nHere in the US at least, the number of kids coming out of high school COMPLETELY unprepared to learn-for-real is the largest factor to blame here.  Learning is FAR more sensitive to technique than talent. Moreover, you are your own best teacher.  This is true for literally everyone, but US schools seem only to value basic memorization and nothing else.  The kids with high school diplomas don't have the tools they need to figure out complicated stuff on their own.  And I mean \"tools\" not \"intelligence\" because what you need in order to figure out complicated things for yourself is: the right set of tools.\n\nThese kids go to college and know only the zero-freedom, memorization-only, education-by-dictation nonsense that fills K-12 so they have trouble independently pursuing research topics effectively.  Perhaps more importantly, we/they lack the experience and tools necessary to identify and understand the how's and why's of a topic.  Regurgitating the definitions of keywords, or the names and dates of people and events is just not as important as understanding how the event happened and why it happened that way instead of some other way. This is absolutely essential for higher education and reaching the college level without significant experience in this area makes a professor's job all but impossible until they stop to teach this first.\n\nThe professors most successful at teaching me and my classmates rarely answered our questions directly.  They pointed us to places or techniques that allowed us to learn independently.  This independence is the ultimate goal of any good University program. \nThis next bit sounds kinda assh*le-y, but I'm including it because it's true and relevant: if you still need someone else to teach you, you haven't earned your degree yet.\n\nOn the flip side, a huge influx of largely unprepared and unqualified students has created a tough ultimatum for respected Universities that want to cash in with big student bodies and high tuition costs(seemingly every US A.B.E.T. university):  high failure rates or unqualified graduates.  Some schools have found that high failure rates resulted in bad press, toxic reviews by word-of-mouth, and a subsequent decline in applications and alumni funding.  When \"cashing in\" was the whole point, these revenue losses hurt especially bad.  In response, these Universities push their professors to pass unqualified students en masse.  Most professors don't like to hear \"lower your standards\" or \"tone down the material\" from arsehole suits with a communications degree because who are they to say what's needed in the professor's field?  Also, most professors teach the curriculum they do BECAUSE they feel it is necessary to understand the topic of the class--to then be told by someone with no experience in the field \"nah they don't need to know any of that sh*t\" is understandably frustrating.\nIn these instances (which I have found to be common in a wide variety of large US Universities) a professor with the FREEDOM to fail students who don't know the material is a moral victory worth relishing, or even maybe bragging about.  These people are happy they ARE ALLOWED to do their job well.  \nThat last line seems pretty widely relate-able to me.  Lots of people work somewhere with some dumb rule or policy from the higher-ups-that-don't-get-it that directly prevents them from doing their job better.  Defeating those FEELS GOOD.\n\nThere are also assh*les who just like watching people fail in general.  Those people are scattered about everywhere; some of them are professors.  I'd remark about one if I'd met one too.\n\n\n\nTL;DR  Not all professors are teachers first. Bad high schools can give professors/universities a difficult choice: high fail rates or incompetent graduates.  After internal disagreement ensues, whichever side prevails is liable to brag.\n\n\nEdits: Typos/syntax", "author": "Hillwilliam1677", "created": 1539237720, "upvotes": 2}, "e7k66yt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9n3fj4/low_pass_rates_are_not_something_to_brag_about/e7k66yt/", "text": "It\u2019s not a bragging point, they are just trying to set the expectation that you will have to do work, since you can totally bs though most of the college classes these days.
