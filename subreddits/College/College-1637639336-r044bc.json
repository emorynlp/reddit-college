  "text": "I feel guilty for feeling overwhelmed. I\u2019m not nearly as involved in extracurriculars as some of my friends are. I\u2019m but I\u2019m drowning in work. I feel so off balance. There\u2019s 3 weeks until the semester is over so I\u2019m just pushing through but I\u2019m in constant anxiety. I\u2019m more anxious than I ever have been in my entire life. Every single task feels hard right now. Therapy is not helping and Medication is only helping so much. College is hard.",

      "text": "Yeah, a majority of freshmen have this experience. First time where the only person holding you truly responsible is yourself. Not to knock you down or nothing, its just a skill people aren't introduced too until now.\n\nIt probably sounds like everyone's telling you this next part, but it gets easier. You learn your own style and how you progress the best. \n\n\nWhen you get to a better place, try and help your friends who are still struggling. If you both have a dining plan, set some times to go eat with them throughout the week. If you take the same class with a buddy, try and do assignments together. Stuff like that.",
