  "title:": "How to not be demoralized when I got below-average grades on every exam?",
  "text": "I am a freshman at a competitive college. I just got my midterm exam grades back and I got around 10 points below average on all of my exams. I spent a lot of time studying the subjects and always start homework early so this is very demoralizing. Is it possible for me to bounce back from my god-awful midterm grades?",

Did you go to office hours to make sure you had a solid understanding of the content? Just gotta tune your compass so you\u2019re getting better",

      "text": "Yes.\n\nGo to office hours and find out what you did , and how to approach the material\n\nIf you have a tutoring center, do that.\n\nIf anyone in class will do a study group with you , do that - seeing how other people think and do things , even bad examples is super useful.\n\nYou need to figure out how to change your study habits to active stuff.  Skim the book any lecture notes and course materials prior to the class and take bullet point notes of main topics and vocab to watch out for ,  You are just making a skeleton at this point, no full sentences no actual answers.\n\nThen actually read the book  watch the lectures , go to class and use the skeleton you have made to take notes.\n\nThen organize your notes , not into blocks of texts but concept maps, charts , flow diagrams, schematics etc.\n\n\nAnd while you are doing that, ask yourself questions.  (Look at Cornell notes methods - not a fan or all of it, but it gives you a good idea)",
