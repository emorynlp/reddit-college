  "text": "I just started college last month. I'm majoring in sciences. Im failing in some of the classes and I feel like I'm falling behind. \n\nThis is very different from high school. I used to excel at school without the need to study much. Now I'm studying 24/7 and it's draining my life energy away. I've fallen into depression and I haven't left my house in weeks now. Because of the online classes, I don't know anybody in classes and I'm staring at my screen all day. (my textbooks are all online). My eyes are deteriorating at a quick rate. It's the first time in my life that I'm doing all-nighters. I've been having mental breakdowns often. I don't have a balance. \n\nCan someone give me advice on what to do? I'm lost.\n\nEdit: I read all of the replies. Thank you all for all the advice and support messages. I really appreciate it. It means a lot :)",

I've been studying all day every day the past 2 months and loving it compared to working in the heat all day. The best advice I can give is just try tough it out, because jobs without a degree can suck pretty bad. Put in the work now and you'll have a much better job in the future. Just make sure to take plenty of small breaks throughout the day.",

      "text": "This is super late but I hope you read this and this is able to help you.\n\nI was very much like you and my transition into Higher studies hit hard. I basically gave up on studying because I didn't even know what studying was - I had never studied before. Right now, I am going through a learning process of how to learn.\n\nFirst and foremost, set or schedule time for studying. Start slow (2-4 hours) for now. And then schedule time for different activities. If you don't feel up to going out at this very moment or period, thats ok - there are many things you can do at home! You could watch dance tutorials on Youtube and follow along or maybe try drawing. Cooking, knitting, reading, writing - these are all things you can do at home. Schedule time for different activities, starting with maybe one activity and try doing it.\n\nIf this feels like too much, try doing one activity for a week, and then adding another one the next week and so on. The most important thing you will get from this is a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction at the end of the day. And this makes you want to do this the next day and so on.\n\nIn regards to studying - I really like some of Ali Abdaal's videos (Youtube) on active recall. As others have mentioned, focus more on studying effectively. His videos have helped me to study in a more effective manner.\n\nYou mentioned that your eyes are deteriorating, I assume this is because all of your lectures are online? Unless the lecture has lots of demonstrations, try listening to only the audio (connect your laptop to headphones and sit facing away from the screen?) Whilst going through the lecture, test yourself on your understanding constantly. After the lecture, to memorise, make Anki (this is what I do and is an example of studying effectively.)\n\nLearning to learn is a process and honestly, you have to work to find what works for you. I am still trying to get into studying and have recently started enjoying it, little by little because I am able to understand and learn things which I couldn't through school. I hope that you grow to be able to feel more accomplished by the things you do.\n\nGood luck!",

The lack of the traditional college experience is a bummer because a huge part of it was social: meeting and interacting with new, intelligent and different people.  I would be lying if I said nobody drops out though.  Some people can\u2019t take it or leave for various reasons.  There\u2019s that cliche orientation bit about one of the two people sitting next to you, etc.  This new chapter in life will demand a higher level from you, and I hope you seize it and grow.",

I can't promise that this feeling will go away when classes go back in person, or with just a few changes to your habits, but I do have a few tips:\n\n1. Don't study so hard. You don't have to memorize everything, you don't have to read everything, you don't have to write down everything. To be honest, I only take notes in class, if that, and I don't take notes on the reading unless a test is coming up. To be honest, I don't even do the reading all the time. I have all A's, I do well, I remember plenty. I'm not saying to do exactly what I do, because you should adjust your method depending on the class, but this is what generally works for me, personally. Find what works for you, something that doesn't demand all nighters.\n\n2. If you have a lot of homework, start working the night that it is assigned. You don't have to finish it all at once, it doesn't even have to be perfect right away, but do something to get the ball rolling. It helps A LOT.\n\n3. Get some sleep. Drink water. It will change your life.",

      "text": "For starters, I would strongly recommend getting blue light glasses since it is affecting your eyes so much. For the rest of it, I would recommend learning to pick your battles. The textbook can be helpful, but depending on the class, you don't need to use it as much as you might think. I've had science classes where the textbook is followed, but the most important things are the lectures and the work that the professor assigns. That will show you what you need to know and how to do the work. Just do what you reasonably can, and work from there.\n\nAnother thing is to make sure you take some time to yourself. Get your assignments done, sure, but you will only continue to do worse if your health, including mental, falls apart. Play some video games, read some books, spend some time outdoors, socialize. Whatever you need and want to do. Life isn't meant to only be about work and school. If you need to or are able to, maybe take less credit hours next semester. Good luck, you'll do great!",

This is just the first semester and it\u2019s the middle of a pandemic, I promise people will cut you slack. Here\u2019s a couple things just in case it hasn\u2019t already been said: \n\nTech out to your professors/ TAs and tell them you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed/ struggling- they\u2019re here to help. They might be willing to be more flexible with dates or be able to offer you 1 on 1 help- remember this is their job and you\u2019re not being a burden or silly or anything like that. \n\nDo any of the departments have tutors you could go to? Or general tutors for the university? Even if you just show up and say I don\u2019t even know where to start nothing makes sense they might be able to help you figure out more effective studying strategies.\n\nSet an alarm every day to leave the house even if that means just sitting outside and feeling the sun shine or take a short walk if you feel up to it. \n\nAnd if comes to it getting a W is always better than an F and it\u2019s certainly not the end of the world even if it feels like it.\n\nDepression is incredibly hard and being in college is hard and living in a pandemic is hard but I promise it doesn\u2019t have to be this hard, please please fight the urge to spiral even worse.

If that doesn't work, get in touch with your dean and tell them your depression is out of control, and see if you can withdraw or get an incomplete rather than failing classes.

If there aren't office hours, make an appointment. \n* If you are falling behind, let the instructor know. I'm EXTREMELY liberal with my deadlines these days - lots of my students are in different time zones, or are essential workers, or are having to juggle all kinds of difficult life situations. I get that. \n* Take time away from your screen. Get outside. Walk. Run. Do something that gets your blood flowing and gets you out into nature. \n* Try to manage your time (I know - I'm shit at this myself, but I try every day to get it better). I like to use the [Pomodoro](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) method, because you can control the length of your breaks, as well as the longer break, and it also helps you see where you are working well and where you are working less productively.\n* Treat your sleep schedule strictly - turn off all your screens an hour before bed, use the blue light blockers another commenter mentioned, and go to bed and get up at the same time every day. You can't function well if you're not sleeping well.\n* Eat healthy stuff (plants). You can't function well if your engine is running on shit, and in my experience, many college students' diets are less than optimal. \n* Look to see what your school offers in terms of assistance. One of the schools where I teach is offering students emergency loans for access to the internet, loaner laptops, etc. We are also offering (as we do in \"normal\" times) free counseling, free help with time management, etc. Don't forget about the tutoring stuff that's always available at schools, either. That's always great - and if your teacher knows you're getting help from the Writing Center, or the tutoring center or whatever your school calls it, then all the better (I get an email when a student goes to the Writing Center at all my schools, so it's most likely that your teacher knows already, but it's always good to make sure). \n* Finally, you might feel like you have everything riding on this class, or this semester, or this degree. You don't. You can gain a lot through failure as well as through a good grade, and failure isn't the end of the world. I know how that sounds, but it's true - failure can offer us some excellent opportunities we might not ordinarily get.\n\nGood luck - lots of people are dealing with this sort of thing right now, so you aren't alone.",

      "text": "I'm no doctor (I just read books and watch videos - take my advice lightly and go to a doctor or therapist if you have serious concerns), but how's your diet and how are you taking care of yourself physically? The mind and body are pretty connected and when one is deteriorating or struggling the other will suffer as well.\n\nVitamin D deficiency could be playing a role in how you're feeling - sometimes it can cause mood changes along with other symptoms (sleepiness and muscle weakness for example, plenty more). Normally you can get enough vitamin D for the day by spending 15 minutes in direct sunlight without sunscreen (if you burn easily, more depending on your skin type).\n\nThere are also studies that suggest gut health plays a small role in overall mood - are you eating vegetables or getting any fiber? An easy way to get some fiber is to buy some ground flax seeds from any grocery store and eat it with your cereal/oatmeal (I put like 2 tablespoons in each serving - you probably won't notice the taste). Berries are also VERY GOOD for your gut - blackberries, blueberries, raspberries.\n\nCruciferous vegetables are also amazing for your health- broccoli, cauliflower, kale. You can buy frozen packets of them frozen for fairly low prices - and all you do is pop them in the microwave for like 5 minutes and they're good to go. (*Also, I saut\u00e9 my kale on the stovetop with some olive oil for a couple of mintues until they turn dark green- another easy small meal*)\n\nJust moving around in general helps your intestines move the shit inside easier - try to walk around for 0.5-1.5 hours a day if possible.\n\nAlso, sleep 7-8 hours a day PLEASE - that should be your priority above everything else besides getting your vitamin D levels up. Lack of sleep causes tons of weird physical symptoms that can freak people out.\n\nListen to what others are saying as well - maybe you should consider visiting a therapist or a coach - some things happen when we're younger that affect the way we act now, and having someone help you identify those events or behaviors and you learning how to recognize why those thoughts occur is a great first step to take in helping yourself out :)\n\nHope this helps.

You cant be efficient if you arent well rested and relaxed. \n\nIf you think your depression is worsening then seek professional help.\n\n Well we have a groupchat on messenger for the class so its easy to ask for help, but maybe contacting others and setting up online study sessions with them would be a good idea to both socialize and get help with what you're stuck with. Sometimes you have to take the initiative even tho it feels awkward and hard. I know it isnt easy (i myself struggle with this last part) but you asked for advice and this is the best i can think of.\n\n The best of luck to you in your studies and always remember to keep your mental health a top priority.",

It sucks because not only is that part gone, but there\u2019s the impending doom of what\u2019s going on right now. \nStarting college is a learning curve for everyone, and especially someone like you that never needed study skills before. \nAs far as college goes, my advice is study smarter not harder. Studying more and ineffectively erodes your grades and free time. Shoot an email out to your professors to briefly explain your situation and ask them for class specific tips. They will likely help. Find study techniques that work. I recommend Thomas Frank on youtube, or /studyskills . There are also some study discords I use to stay focused and I find it\u2019s really motivating. \nSecondly, you need to have balance. I know it seems counterintuitive right now, but it\u2019s important now more than ever to try to stay connected socially and go outside. Try and find some novelty while being safe. There\u2019s a pandemic but that doesn\u2019t mean life doesn\u2019t go on, and you need fun activities to make sure your brain is happy so you can perform. \nGood luck, and hang in there. You\u2019re not a lost cause, just some bad luck you\u2019ll have to fight to get to the other side.",

I was suicidal.  Two failed classes later I have had to learn that everything stems from how well I am taking care of my body and mind.  Please prioritize eating, sleeping- go to bed early (I used to proudly pull a couple all-nighters a week, my body literally broke down).... you will find your retention in classes and your mood are significantly improved.  Once you strengthen your body by taking care of it, working out id hugely helpful too- you can work off a lot of stress and it clears your mind to better focus. You HAVE to prioritize these things, otherwise you will find yourself drained.  \n\nNext, take advantage of resources around you- go talk to campus counseling, find STEM-major groups or reach out to classmates through forums or group projects about study tips or any questions about difficult concepts.  Your peers are in the same boat- everybody feels alone especially in this time.  You are capable, you are smart, and you will make it through this a stronger person. \ud83d\udc9b Feel free to dm me if you need someone to talk to.",

Join clubs that interest you and join some related to the classes you're taking, as they might be able to help.

      "text": "Hey! I know exactly how you feel, my freshman year was very similar, and Im also a STEM major. \n\nFor Classes:\n- Do more practice problems than pure reading. \n\n- Set a specific time each day for studying, eating, taking a walk/going to gym, sleeping, and fun. \n\n- When readings textbooks, make sure to look at the chapter summaries both before and after you read the chapter itself. Even write them down and try to look for it as you go so your mind puts extra attention to it. \n\n- Quizlet and Chegg are your friends. \n\n- Dont forget that ACE offers free tutoring, and I believe they also offer online tutoring now. \n\n- I was a person who would start Group Chats in my classes so we could ask eachother for help, do study sessions, etc. I doubt your professors would be upset if you did the same \n\n- Make sure you have a planner so you can keep track of what assignments are due when and how far out tests are. If you need a super in-depth one get a passion planar, or download one sheet of it to test it out. \n\nFor your health/mind:\n- You need to set up a 6 hour minimum sleep schedule. If youre so stressed that you cant sleep, try Melatonin. All nighters, while tempting, just really mess up your mind and energy for several days after. \n\n- Pick a physical activity to do each day, even if only for an hour. Blood clots are rising exponentially in students who are not moving around enough with everything being online these days. Plus this will give you a little breathing time. Go to Landis and play with a dog, go on an early morning walk, have a dance party in your room. You get the idea. \n\n- I strongly suggest you add a hobby to your routine. It could be playing video games, it could be embroidery, reading a physical book, it could be songwriting. Something that either you already love or are curious about learning. I recommend doing these after your daily study session, treating it as a reward. It will encourage you mind to study again the next day, and itll give you a cooling off period before sleep. \n\n- I know you mentioned not having any new friends due to online classes. Two suggestions for you. \n\n1. Call up some of your high school buddies! I still talk to about 10 of my high school friends and Im about to graduate! Make an effort to keep them in your lives. \n\n2. You can try to find clubs to join. A lot of clubs are hosting activities online since so many students are still at home. Or you could try to search for non school related things like a sports club or whatevers in your area. \n\nSecret 3rd Option: You dont have to do this one all the time, but if theyre alive call your grandparents. Its a scary time for them, and since they prob cant get out much odds are theyre bored to tears and a simple call could mean a lot to them. Just a suggestion. \n\n- If the screens are hurting that bad, consider adjusting your screen to red light, getting blue-light glasses or making sure youre letting in enough natural light to fight it. \n\n- You can get a free therapist through the school. Each therapist is different, but my experience was really positive and they helped me find the courage to leave an abusive situation. I dont know everything thats going on in your life, but its always nice to have someone to talk to. \n\nI hope some of these help you! Good luck!",

              "text": "As a 3rd year Pharm student I totally know what you're going through although I still haven't pulled an allnighter. If you're already so behind the best thing is to: try to figure out when your midterms are, and study almost entirely for the one class (although keep up with your notes/go to every class) so that way your midterm notes come up. if you study evenly for all classes without thinking about the exams you'll do worse than if you study hardcore one class at a time. Generally you want to be up to date on notes and more or less understand things in all of your classes but with the one that has the next exam being the one you're actively studying for. \n\nRemember, finals are the only thing that matters, as well as lab scores. Do your best, and also talk to other students. A lllllllllllllooooooooooooottttttt of students are in cahoots with 2nd+ year students who will have information on what exams are like, what information is best, study resources, etc. I also recommend you start googling things. A lot of times I get confused about a concept but if I just start googling and use YouTube (the Organic Chemistry Tutor, KhanAcademy, etc.) I generally learn it faster.\n\nIf you're doing a maths related course use online calculators, they will break it down step by step for you even complex equations. Lastly there are certain things that you just need to learn that suck ass to learn but once you learn you forget it but relearning is hella fast (ej. redox, derivatives, functional groups, etc.). Remember in the sciences everything sort of relates to each other so you really want to actually learn everything ,not just pass exams. I guarantee you that you will be learning harder things using these base concepts in 1st year...I'm in biopharmacy right now and I'm using kinetics which I learned in physical chemistry, and also in a few other classes.. it all comes back. But trust me, those things that seem so hard in first year seem easy afterwards. Hard work really does pay off.",

                      "text": "*rubs hands together* alright here come the suggestions!\n\nSo listening and note taking at the same time is hard, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not a skill you\u2019re born with! It takes time and practice. I learned by being a waitress first, so here\u2019s what helped me/ended up crossing over to college.\n\n\u2022Use short hand or abbreviations to start\n\nEx. Abt, w/, w/o, arrows, half words, misspellings (while still knowing what you were getting at). They don\u2019t have to be cute, they have to be on the paper. If you understand what you were getting at, you can fix it later.\n\n\u2022If you\u2019re able, maybe try recording the audio from a lecture with your phone or an audio capture software on your computer. That way you can rewind and relisten or adjust the speed if you need to or if an area is confusing. I did this for my classics lecture when I\u2019d be too tired to take more detailed notes and it saved my buttttt.\n\n\u2022Some professors record their lectures as well, maybe reach out and see if you can get permissions to record or get a copy of a recording. It depends what software they\u2019re using, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\n\n\u2022Also request slides from lecture if at all possible if they\u2019re not provided. Some professors are a pain about it, so start with the TA. They\u2019re the in between for you and the professor and I\u2019d bet they\u2019d be more likely to get them for you.\n\n\u2022Look for key concepts or ideas when reading the textbook. This is more difficult in the hard sciences I think, but ideally start with the broad strokes. Definitions and word examples are my first go to. Then summaries at the beginning and end of the chapter. Then the diagrams to see how those ideas are represented. That way you\u2019re absorbing the initial information, without going line by line.\n\n\u2022Depending on if your book is physical or digital, check if there\u2019s a read aloud option. My texts are digital and offer a read along feature, which would help if your an auditory learner.\n\n\u2022YouTube videos! There were a few suggested channels in the main thread, go through those! Likely they\u2019ll have some of the subjects you\u2019re working on. In those cases too, you can adjust the playback speed and/or turn on subtitles to help the information stick better. \n\n\u2022TA office hours! Use \u2018em and abuse \u2018em. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for and they can give you tips and tricks for the professor that others can\u2019t. Same with your professors office hours, though those may be more limited.\n\n\u2022When in doubt, see if your college offers extra tutoring for your subjects. If not, I know there were other tutoring options on the main thread, so check those out!\n\nWhew that was a lot, but hopefully these help a bit! The learning curve between high school and college is rough so try not to beat yourself up. You\u2019re learning harder material and how to really study for the first time so it feels like so much more than you\u2019ve ever done, but I know you can do it!\n\nAlso if you need to, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to counseling services on campus. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for and keeping your mind healthy is far more important than grades!",

It helps me to skim the section quickly before I take notes on it just to figure out how it\u2019s organized and how I want to adapt that organization for my notes, and then actually go back and take notes with MY organization in mind. This is slightly more time consuming but imo is worth it because having disorganized notes is super annoying and makes it harder to ~holistically~ learn the concepts, which is esp important for memorization/conceptualizing things in the hard sciences.",

I also take 10-30 minute breaks where i just go outside (luckily i have a nice balcony) and i spend time just being outside and trying to consciously relax.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as all nighters go with the work load most people are trapped under this semester, it seems necessary every now and then. Try not to do more than one a week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso i think if you follow this sub, you'll find that things this semester have been particularly grueling in terms of work load. When we get back to in-person courses, things will definitely change and hopefully for the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was very skeptical, but I bought a pair of blue light glasses (i dont even wear regular glasses) and it really helped my sleep and mood. I'm sleeping better and feel less depressed. It might not make a difference for everyone but it's worth trying.",
