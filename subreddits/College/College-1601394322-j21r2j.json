Because of the online classes, I don't know anybody in classes and I'm staring at my screen all day. (my textbooks are all online). My eyes are deteriorating at a quick rate.

I basically gave up on studying because I didn't even know what studying was - I had never studied before. Right now, I am going through a learning process of how to learn.\n\nFirst and foremost, set or schedule time for studying. Start slow (2-4 hours) for now. And then schedule time for different activities. If you don't feel up to going out at this very moment or period, thats ok - there are many things you can do at home! You could watch dance tutorials on Youtube and follow along or maybe try drawing. Cooking, knitting, reading, writing - these are all things you can do at home. Schedule time for different activities, starting with maybe one activity and try doing it.\n\nIf this feels like too much, try doing one activity for a week, and then adding another one the next week and so on. The most important thing you will get from this is a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction at the end of the day. And this makes you want to do this the next day and so on.\n\nIn regards to studying - I really like some of Ali Abdaal's videos (Youtube) on active recall. As others have mentioned, focus more on studying effectively. His videos have helped me to study in a more effective manner.\n\nYou mentioned that your eyes are deteriorating, I assume this is because all of your lectures are online? Unless the lecture has lots of demonstrations, try listening to only the audio (connect your laptop to headphones and sit facing away from the screen?) Whilst going through the lecture, test yourself on your understanding constantly. After the lecture, to memorise, make Anki (this is what I do and is an example of studying effectively.)\n\nLearning to learn is a process and honestly, you have to work to find what works for you. I am still trying to get into studying and have recently started enjoying it, little by little because I am able to understand and learn things which I couldn't through school. I hope that you grow to be able to feel more accomplished by the things you do.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "Qualifiedadult", "created": 1601471380, "upvotes": 1}, "g75zejz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j21r2j/college_is_making_me_depressed_and_i_dont_know/g75zejz/", "text": "Ah yes, this reminds me of my freshman year as well.

You don't have to memorize everything, you don't have to read everything, you don't have to write down everything. To be honest, I only take notes in class, if that, and I don't take notes on the reading unless a test is coming up. To be honest, I don't even do the reading all the time. I have all A's, I do well, I remember plenty. I'm not saying to do exactly what I do, because you should adjust your method depending on the class, but this is what generally works for me, personally. Find what works for you, something that doesn't demand all nighters.\n\n2. If you have a lot of homework, start working the night that it is assigned. You don't have to finish it all at once, it doesn't even have to be perfect right away, but do something to get the ball rolling. It helps A LOT.\n\n3. Get some sleep. Drink water.

I've had science classes where the textbook is followed, but the most important things are the lectures and the work that the professor assigns. That will show you what you need to know and how to do the work. Just do what you reasonably can, and work from there.\n\nAnother thing is to make sure you take some time to yourself. Get your assignments done, sure, but you will only continue to do worse if your health, including mental, falls apart. Play some video games, read some books, spend some time outdoors, socialize.

Here\u2019s a couple things just in case it hasn\u2019t already been said: \n\nTech out to your professors/ TAs and tell them you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed/ struggling- they\u2019re here to help. They might be willing to be more flexible with dates or be able to offer you 1 on 1 help- remember this is their job and you\u2019re not being a burden or silly or anything like that. \n\nDo any of the departments have tutors you could go to? Or general tutors for the university? Even if you just show up and say I don\u2019t even know where to start nothing makes sense they might be able to help you figure out more effective studying strategies.\n\nSet an alarm every day to leave the house even if that means just sitting outside and feeling the sun shine or take a short walk if you feel up to it. \n\nAnd if comes to it getting a W is always better than an F and it\u2019s certainly not the end of the world even if it feels like it.\n\nDepression is incredibly hard and being in college is hard and living in a pandemic is hard but I promise it doesn\u2019t have to be this hard, please please fight the urge to spiral even worse.

If there aren't office hours, make an appointment. \n* If you are falling behind, let the instructor know. I'm EXTREMELY liberal with my deadlines these days - lots of my students are in different time zones, or are essential workers, or are having to juggle all kinds of difficult life situations. I get that. \n* Take time away from your screen. Get outside. Walk. Run. Do something that gets your blood flowing and gets you out into nature. \n* Try to manage your time (I know - I'm shit at this myself, but I try every day to get it better). I like to use the [Pomodoro](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) method, because you can control the length of your breaks, as well as the longer break, and it also helps you see where you are working well and where you are working less productively.\n* Treat your sleep schedule strictly - turn off all your screens an hour before bed, use the blue light blockers another commenter mentioned, and go to bed and get up at the same time every day. You can't function well if you're not sleeping well.\n* Eat healthy stuff (plants). You can't function well if your engine is running on shit, and in my experience, many college students' diets are less than optimal. \n* Look to see what your school offers in terms of assistance. One of the schools where I teach is offering students emergency loans for access to the internet, loaner laptops, etc. We are also offering (as we do in \"normal\" times) free counseling, free help with time management, etc. Don't forget about the tutoring stuff that's always available at schools, either. That's always great - and if your teacher knows you're getting help from the Writing Center, or the tutoring center or whatever your school calls it, then all the better (I get an email when a student goes to the Writing Center at all my schools, so it's most likely that your teacher knows already, but it's always good to make sure). \n* Finally, you might feel like you have everything riding on this class, or this semester, or this degree. You don't. You can gain a lot through failure as well as through a good grade, and failure isn't the end of the world. I know how that sounds, but it's true - failure can offer us some excellent opportunities we might not ordinarily get.\n\nGood luck - lots of people are dealing with this sort of thing right now, so you aren't alone.", "author": "Readthesyllabus3", "created": 1601413792, "upvotes": 1}, "g73tpfr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j21r2j/college_is_making_me_depressed_and_i_dont_know/g73tpfr/", "text": "Your not alone man.

The mind and body are pretty connected and when one is deteriorating or struggling the other will suffer as well.\n\nVitamin D deficiency could be playing a role in how you're feeling - sometimes it can cause mood changes along with other symptoms (sleepiness and muscle weakness for example, plenty more). Normally you can get enough vitamin D for the day by spending 15 minutes in direct sunlight without sunscreen (if you burn easily, more depending on your skin type).\n\nThere are also studies that suggest gut health plays a small role in overall mood - are you eating vegetables or getting any fiber? An easy way to get some fiber is to buy some ground flax seeds from any grocery store and eat it with your cereal/oatmeal (I put like 2 tablespoons in each serving - you probably won't notice the taste). Berries are also VERY GOOD for your gut - blackberries, blueberries, raspberries.\n\nCruciferous vegetables are also amazing for your health- broccoli, cauliflower, kale. You can buy frozen packets of them frozen for fairly low prices - and all you do is pop them in the microwave for like 5 minutes and they're good to go. (*Also, I saut\u00e9 my kale on the stovetop with some olive oil for a couple of mintues until they turn dark green- another easy small meal*)\n\nJust moving around in general helps your intestines move the shit inside easier - try to walk around for 0.5-1.5 hours a day if possible.\n\nAlso, sleep 7-8 hours a day PLEASE - that should be your priority above everything else besides getting your vitamin D levels up. Lack of sleep causes tons of weird physical symptoms that can freak people out.\n\nListen to what others are saying as well - maybe you should consider visiting a therapist or a coach - some things happen when we're younger that affect the way we act now, and having someone help you identify those events or behaviors and you learning how to recognize why those thoughts occur is a great first step to take in helping yourself out :)\n\nHope this helps.

You cant be efficient if you arent well rested and relaxed. \n\nIf you think your depression is worsening then seek professional help.\n\n Well we have a groupchat on messenger for the class so its easy to ask for help, but maybe contacting others and setting up online study sessions with them would be a good idea to both socialize and get help with what you're stuck with. Sometimes you have to take the initiative even tho it feels awkward and hard.

Studying more and ineffectively erodes your grades and free time. Shoot an email out to your professors to briefly explain your situation and ask them for class specific tips. They will likely help. Find study techniques that work. I recommend Thomas Frank on youtube, or /studyskills . There are also some study discords I use to stay focused and I find it\u2019s really motivating. \nSecondly, you need to have balance. I know it seems counterintuitive right now, but it\u2019s important now more than ever to try to stay connected socially and go outside. Try and find some novelty while being safe. There\u2019s a pandemic but that doesn\u2019t mean life doesn\u2019t go on, and you need fun activities to make sure your brain is happy so you can perform. \nGood luck, and hang in there.

I know exactly how you feel, my freshman year was very similar, and Im also a STEM major. \n\nFor Classes:\n- Do more practice problems than pure reading. \n\n- Set a specific time each day for studying, eating, taking a walk/going to gym, sleeping, and fun. \n\n- When readings textbooks, make sure to look at the chapter summaries both before and after you read the chapter itself. Even write them down and try to look for it as you go so your mind puts extra attention to it. \n\n- Quizlet and Chegg are your friends. \n\n- Dont forget that ACE offers free tutoring, and I believe they also offer online tutoring now. \n\n- I was a person who would start Group Chats in my classes so we could ask eachother for help, do study sessions, etc. I doubt your professors would be upset if you did the same \n\n- Make sure you have a planner so you can keep track of what assignments are due when and how far out tests are. If you need a super in-depth one get a passion planar, or download one sheet of it to test it out. \n\nFor your health/mind:\n- You need to set up a 6 hour minimum sleep schedule. If youre so stressed that you cant sleep, try Melatonin. All nighters, while tempting, just really mess up your mind and energy for several days after. \n\n- Pick a physical activity to do each day, even if only for an hour. Blood clots are rising exponentially in students who are not moving around enough with everything being online these days. Plus this will give you a little breathing time. Go to Landis and play with a dog, go on an early morning walk, have a dance party in your room. You get the idea. \n\n- I strongly suggest you add a hobby to your routine. It could be playing video games, it could be embroidery, reading a physical book, it could be songwriting. Something that either you already love or are curious about learning. I recommend doing these after your daily study session, treating it as a reward. It will encourage you mind to study again the next day, and itll give you a cooling off period before sleep. \n\n- I know you mentioned not having any new friends due to online classes. Two suggestions for you. \n\n1. Call up some of your high school buddies! I still talk to about 10 of my high school friends and Im about to graduate! Make an effort to keep them in your lives. \n\n2. You can try to find clubs to join. A lot of clubs are hosting activities online since so many students are still at home. Or you could try to search for non school related things like a sports club or whatevers in your area. \n\nSecret 3rd Option: You dont have to do this one all the time, but if theyre alive call your grandparents. Its a scary time for them, and since they prob cant get out much odds are theyre bored to tears and a simple call could mean a lot to them. Just a suggestion. \n\n- If the screens are hurting that bad, consider adjusting your screen to red light, getting blue-light glasses or making sure youre letting in enough natural light to fight it. \n\n- You can get a free therapist through the school. Each therapist is different, but my experience was really positive and they helped me find the courage to leave an abusive situation. I dont know everything thats going on in your life, but its always nice to have someone to talk to. \n\nI hope some of these help you!
