  "text": "So, u/hannibe made a post here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/r2urim/do\\_colleges\\_realize\\_that\\_being\\_at\\_home\\_does\\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/r2urim/do_colleges_realize_that_being_at_home_does_not/)). This is relevant, but this post is not a response or copy of the other post, so this post should be considered separately. To be clear, I am not in the same situation as the other user, but I think this question is widely applicable, especially for college students, although it could apply to a lesser extent to other people as well.\n\nWith that being said, with holiday vacation coming up in the next month for almost all students (probably), is there any option for a two-week stay that wouldn't cost close to a thousand dollars or rely on friends or family members for assistance?\n\n1. Family's House: This is probably the most common option, but people may, for one reason or another, be uncomfortable with staying or unable to stay with family members.\n2. Friend's House: This is possible, but you would need to have a close connection to a friend, and since friends are probably college students, their parents as well, for this to be remotely feasible. And this is not true for everyone.\n3. Hotel: This is doable, but expensive. Even a very inexpensive hotel at $50 per night would cost hundreds of dollars after a week or two. (Used [https://www.howmuchisit.org/hotel-room-cost/](https://www.howmuchisit.org/hotel-room-cost/) for reference, but I would assume that hotel prices would be substantially higher during the holidays). For a price comparison, the least expensive hotel in Terre Haute from December 18 to January 2 is $769 (it could change), which is more expensive than the monthly rent for inexpensive apartments in the area, so I assume a similar trend could be found in other cases. This cost could be split between roommates, but others on campus would probably choose another option.\n4. Dorm: Dorms would have some exceptions, but they may impose restrictions, such as if your parents live far away, which may not be the primary reason why you would consider other living options.\n5. Apartment: Some college students live in apartments that will not close during breaks; however, some schools require freshmen to live in the dorm, so this is not always applicable.\n\n**To sum up, what middle ground exists between hotels (more expensive daily cost, but generally for a few days) and apartments (less expensive daily cost, but for months): where the daily cost is between that of a hotel and apartment, for a few weeks?**",
