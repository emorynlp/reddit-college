I moved from Europe to the US. I actually went almost two years without seeing my family because of covid. It\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m not the type to get homesick but sometimes I really miss a hug from my parents. I call home every week and keep in touch daily through messages. I talk to my best friends every day. I say once you find really good friends at your new place, it becomes so much easier. The hard part is that you feel like you need to do everything yourself, but this actually made me very organised and independent, I can solve any problem on my own, and help others too, so I look at it as a blessing. My best advice is to try to find great friends, and that will really make a big change. I\u2019m not sure where you are going in Europe, but I\u2019m sure there is a lot to explore, the city the culture the history, so try to go on as many adventures as you can! I also find that eating in a restaurant from my country and hearing my own native language once in a while helps a lot.", "author": "Dry-Razzmatazz8352", "created": 1632677716, "upvotes": 2}, "hedbl3x": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvy9ad/ill_be_moving_to_a_different_continent_for/hedbl3x/", "text": "I moved to LA for a few months when I was living half way across the country.
