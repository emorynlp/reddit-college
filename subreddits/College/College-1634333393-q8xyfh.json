      "text": "Plants and vitamins will not fix your mental health. Instead you should try to find therapeutic resources and start practicing things like diffusion, breathing exercises, etc. My therapist and I are reading a book called The Happiness Trap which is essentially a guide to ACT written for people who don\u2019t have access to actual therapy. \n\nI want to reiterate that plants and vitamins will do nothing. If you are not able to speak to a psychologist or psychiatrist then your best bet is to start implementing actually scientifically backed therapeutic practices and exercises on your own, not to start believing in woo like ashwagandha or whatever else nonscientifically backed supplement you'll see people suggesting",

      "text": "Yes I have severe depression and bad anxiety. Used to always smoke weed to feel better but since my jobs still test for it.... Which is odd cus I can go drink myself to death after work and no one cares..... Anyways CBD joints have such low THC that it won't be on a test unless you smoke it every day for like a month. You can get the joints, or I recommend the tincture. Drop a few drops in your tea or Gatorade ect... Go to a smoke shop and just buy one that stands out to you. Trust me that stuff will help you get through anxiety. Not addictive also.",
