  "text": "I'm currently in my 3rd year in a 4 year CS program. I dropped out the last time I went to school with a 2.6 gpa because of some personal struggles and inability to thrive under pressure. \n\nThis time around is very different. My grades are nearly perfect and I feel like I've come a long way. Difference is I've been online almost the entire time and didn't have to deal with my social phobia. Now that I'm going back to class in person, even though it's only 3 days a week, things are getting bad again. I can feel myself slipping into old habits: skipping most of my classes, avoiding homework, wanting to sit it a dark room all day. Worse yet, I have two groups and have made a fool of myself to both of them. In particular, the second group consists of two high achievers who are friends with each other, but don't know me. It feels like this project is an \"us and them\" situation. They're nice in the group chat because the professor can see all of our communication, but are rude and condescending when we're on a video call or an in person meeting. Saying shit like \"that's cute\" or \"good for you bud\" when I talk about the things I know.\n\nHonestly, I'm being a little bitch about it because these people are well liked and I know how quickly your life can become shitty when people like that aren't on your side. I'm at a loss. I wish I could do these projects by myself, but there isn't enough time in the week for me to get everything accomplished. It's just worrisome that I may end up burning out before I can through this and move on with my life.",

      "text": "Hey. \n\nYou're more than your performance. You're more than their assumptions about you. You're more than your academic success. You're more than your social success.\n\nAt the end of the day, all you really have control of is you. Don't let your fear of the way the world sees you distract your right now.\n\nThose people you're working with are individuals with their own lives. If they're being rude and condescending, it's probably because of other shit in their lives and their past that made them like that.\n\nAll you've got at the end of the day is the way you view yourself. If you're ditching classes again and sitting in the dark, your self esteem is probably plummeting. Why do you think you're slipping back into old patterns? Was there a specific interaction that seemed to trigger what you've been feeling lately? \n\n\nFor now, believe in the me that believes in you. You can do this. You're not an idiot and you earned where you are now.",
