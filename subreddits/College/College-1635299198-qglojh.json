  "text": "I'm currently in my 3rd year in a 4 year CS program. I dropped out the last time I went to school with a 2.6 gpa because of some personal struggles and inability to thrive under pressure. \n\nThis time around is very different. My grades are nearly perfect and I feel like I've come a long way. Difference is I've been online almost the entire time and didn't have to deal with my social phobia. Now that I'm going back to class in person, even though it's only 3 days a week, things are getting bad again. I can feel myself slipping into old habits: skipping most of my classes, avoiding homework, wanting to sit it a dark room all day. Worse yet, I have two groups and have made a fool of myself to both of them. In particular, the second group consists of two high achievers who are friends with each other, but don't know me. It feels like this project is an \"us and them\" situation. They're nice in the group chat because the professor can see all of our communication, but are rude and condescending when we're on a video call or an in person meeting. Saying shit like \"that's cute\" or \"good for you bud\" when I talk about the things I know.\n\nHonestly, I'm being a little bitch about it because these people are well liked and I know how quickly your life can become shitty when people like that aren't on your side. I'm at a loss. I wish I could do these projects by myself, but there isn't enough time in the week for me to get everything accomplished. It's just worrisome that I may end up burning out before I can through this and move on with my life.",
