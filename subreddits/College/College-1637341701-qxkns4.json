  "text": "Hello. I recently got admitted college and I intend on graduating as a mechanical engineer. My school has an ROTC program available and my parents are *really* insistent I join it for the scholarship and potential guarantee of a career after graduation. \n\nI see the pros of going through with it, but I don't know if it's for me, like with the commitment my parents make sound to easy even though I see it as daunting. \n\nIs it really worth it? Are there any alternatives? I live in Florida and it's the Air Force branch specifically if it makes a difference.",
