  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a third-year medical biology student, and I have always wanted to go to medical school. Over the last couple of months, I have had a creeping suspicion that medical school might not be what I want to dedicate my life to. I want to have the flexibility to move around and explore the world, and I am not sure if I want to dedicate the next 10 years of my life working my ass off for next to no compensation.\n\nI am sort of having an existential crisis at the moment, and I am not sure where to go from here. If I am not going to medical school I want to apply for either a master's or PhD program. Unfortunately, my degree is in medical biology, which is not necessarily that applicable to most other fields. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, great extracurricular activities and I am an Army veteran. Relevant subjects I have taken so far:\n\n* Statistics\n* Calculus 1\n* Organic chemistry 1 and 2\n* General chemistry 1 and 2\n* Physics 1 and 2\n* Anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology\n* Biochemistry 1\n\nThe fields I have been looking at are biostatistics, public health, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience. Ideally, I would want to go into a field that provides both stability and good compensation. If anyone can offer me advice as to where I should go from here, I would really appreciate it.",

      "text": "I'm a grad student in biostats so feel free to ask me any questions. I love what I do and think it's great (so far, lol). Domain area knowledge is really helpful (I don't have a bio background which kind of sucks-- it will definitely help you). You'll need more of a math background for sure but it's not that hard to get what you need under your belt. \n\nMy advice is to talk to different people in the fields you're interested in and ask them about what they do on a daily basis and what they do and don't like about their careers. Right now I'm still a grad student so I can't tell you much about what the career is actually like-- I can only warn you that if you want to do biostats you need a strong math background (and I recommend to get some programming skills under your belt, too) but beyond that I can't really say much or compare it to the other fields you're looking at but if you can find people who are actually working in the fields you're interested in I think that will help you the most.",

              "text": "> What are the career prospects like in biostatistics?\n\nIn general career prospects are very good. Where I am (New Jersey) we have tons of pharmaceutical companies, which tend to provide good pay and benefits, but pay is a bit lower, I think, outside of pharma. This may be because pharma prefers PhDs but most employers are okay with hiring people who only have a master's. Still, there are jobs in government (less so where I am, but if you want to work in DC then I'm sure there's a ton of jobs), at hospitals, and in academia.\n\nI'm not sure how salary compares to bioinformatics. I know that I have personally done research that would technically fall under the banner of \"bioinformatics\" work, so I'm not sure the name of the degree you get (bioinformatics vs. biostatistics) actually matters that much, but in general there is more computer science \"stuff\" in bioinformatics and in general the more computer science stuff you know, the better positioned you'll be in the job market, regardless of what you get your degree in (as in, you should have some CS foundations down whether you do stats, public health, engineering, or neuroscience-- it's just such a useful skill that you'll want to become comfortable with it regardless).",
