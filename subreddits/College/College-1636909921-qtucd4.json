  "text": "Am I crazy? I think I really want to do this. I\u2019ve considered other options, but this is what I feel most passionate about. \n\nI have a few mental health related issues myself, so school can be incredibly difficult for me at times. (It brings out a lot of uncomfortable, intense emotions. As I\u2019m sure it does for many people, and this can be almost debilitating at times.) \n\nEven though, over the past few years, I have worked through a lot of these issues and found ways I can best support myself and set myself up to be successful, I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m biting off a bit more than I can chew. \n\nI think this is because I imagine myself in the future as being the same person I am now, with the same level of skills and abilities and level of tolerance for discomfort or stress. Even though I know I am not the same person I was two, or five, etc. years ago. I am trying to look at this logically, to say I may not be ready for grad school or even higher level courses right now, but that I will be when I get there. \n\n\nI would really appreciate people\u2019s thoughts on this if you\u2019re willing to share. \n\nThanks :)",

Try to maintain a 3.5 - 4.0 GPA, get some practical or research experiences in your undergrad, and get good letters of rec by the time you apply to a graduate program. Most programs require high GRE scores, so make sure to build in a year or so of GRE prep before you take the test (take it at least twice).",

Secondly, mental health workers with personal experience in what were treating makes us BETTER professionals. One of the reasons that makes the psych field so amazing. Totally go for it. Plus, psych professors are much more understanding and promote self care and less hw or extensions etc (not all the time but def understand accommodations in this aspect of course)!!!",

Did average in high school but ended undergrad with a 3.97 and tons of research experience and presentations, conferences, and a publication which is awesome. All about connections in school. This got me directly into a doctorate program. But I know plenty of people without publications or research exp that have still gotten into doctorate. GREs are currently not required, so if you wanna apply, now is your best bet. I can\u2019t personally speak on masters programs cause I skipped it. But I also had a senior undergrad internship that got me like 8 months clinical experience before I started my program this year. Honestly it\u2019s about going for everything you can. Grab every opportunity, research, volunteer, etc. it\u2019s all worth it.",
