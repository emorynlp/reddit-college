      "text": "So I\u2019ve used both laptops and iPads and I personally prefer using my iPad, since with iCloud all my files and stuff sync up to my laptop. If you get an Apple Pencil with it you can take notes by hand. They\u2019re definitely more convenient since they\u2019re so much smaller. If you prefer Windows stuff it might be worth saving up for a laptop but if you\u2019re not picky I\u2019d say iPad!",

      "text": "History student here (lots of reading and writing homework)!\n\nI have a laptop that I was tired of lugging around for class all day everyday, so I got an iPad with the student discount! Not the most recent or the pro... It was like four hundred bucks? I love it for taking notes and PDF readings (I use notability), as a planner (GoodNotes), and can use Blackboard and Word with a bluetooth keyboard! I wait until I'm at home or work to do any serious editing or submissions on a computer. The only thing I can't give advice for are tests, since my program has very few.\n\nOverall, I think I enjoy having an iPad a lot better than a laptop. I feel like it has more space, more battery power, and is a whole lot lighter than my laptop! As long as you have some kind of access to a computer for certain things (and access to some kind of cloud like microsoft office through your school), having an iPad for the day-to-day is worth it.",

      "text": "The best thing would be a 2-in one tablet/laptop, like a surface, since you get the best of both worlds there. If you want a tablet just for notes, I would say just get a budget tablet, you wont get much extra use out of an ipad specifically, and it will make things even more difficult if you don't already have a mac, since apple products are notorious for not supporting anything outside the small ecosystem they have",

      "text": "I have a friend in college who chose to get an iPad instead of a computer bc it was cheaper than a new Mac but she couldn\u2019t everything she needed to. For instance, since the google docs on an iPad is the app it doesn\u2019t have all the same functions as regular docs and she couldn\u2019t do proctorU or lockdown browsers bc they required a laptop. She ended up getting a Mac also and uses both quite often. I would recommend getting a laptop so you don\u2019t worry about losing any functionality.",

It has the programs I need, is highly functional and didn't blow up my bank account.\n\nIf you're a business student, please buy a windows machine. Apple products just don't work well with business tech ecosystems.",
