  "title:": "Thoughts on Cornerstone class",
  "text": "Just so everyone is on the same page, to my understanding Cornerstone is a required class, typically meant for freshmen, \" **to help you successfully transition to college life** \" according to google. I was also wondering if there's typically any difference between Cornerstone online or in class. Personal experiences with the class will be very helpful.\n\nIts been 3 weeks since the start of this class, and it feels so absolutely useless. First few assignments had me take a personality test and write a small 250 word MLA format essay on why I enrolled. I actually enjoyed writing the essay, but personality tests to me are meaningless.\n\nThe second week though was when I started to question the point in the class, at least how it pertains to me and how its required. Assignments were to make a schedule, take a career interest assessment test, and write another 250 word essay. I currently live with my parents, don't work, and don't really have any responsibilities. So I just made a bullshit schedule. I set time aside to get my work done, and I've only ever missed a single day of class so far. I don't see why I'd need to follow a strict schedule. And the career interest assessment test was about as meaningless as the personality test.\n\nThe 2nd essay was in its own league of pointlessness. The assignment goes verbatim: \n\n**Based upon your Personality assessment, describe your personality traits and identify a career path that is suitable.**  **Analyze and explain how the career relates to your personality type (personality assessment results), personal values and career interests.**\n\nNow I get this class is targeted towards freshmen that most likely don't have a major in mind. Personally though, I already know what I'm attending college for. I don't need help managing my time. I don't find any of this useful at all. Yet this class is required, and these assignments I assume influence my GPA.\n\nWeek 3 is what has me looking into if I can drop this class or not. Only two assignments, but I don't even fully understand what they're asking of me. One is a group project, but I don't even understand on what. Only one other group member has messaged me about the group project, and they don't even understand exactly what we're suppose to be doing. The other wants me to fill out a calendar when I complete \"events\" that I also don't completely understand, and requires evidence that I completed these \"events\".\n\nMaybe this class could be interesting and helpful to others. Not for me. I've had to bullshit my way through just about every assignment.",
