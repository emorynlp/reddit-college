  "title:": "Living in a dorm even if I live 15 minutes away from home",
  "text": "So my friends and I are all attending this state school very close to us. It\u2019s literally a 15 minute drive max. They\u2019re all living in a dorm and I\u2019m quite surprised since it wouldn\u2019t be a long commute and they\u2019re always driving somewhere. They were surprised when I said I\u2019m living at home and said I should just take a loan. I peeped the room and board cost and it said 11k/yr?? Then there\u2019s a 2k meal plan? Is dorm life actually that worth it? I\u2019m not a people person whatsoever but I don\u2019t want to regret it in the future and be like \u201cDang I should\u2019ve just lived in a dorm like the other folks\u201d\n\nUpdate: Thanks for responding y\u2019all. Decided to just commute because fuck student loans. Also I like having my own bathroom and a washer and dryer I don\u2019t typically have to wait to use. I think it was everyone talking about \u201cmove in day\u201d that made me really consider getting a dorm because I didn\u2019t want to feel left out. Not worth it though. I also spoke with someone from the Student Involvement and Leadership Center at my college and they told me tons of commuters are involved so that comforted me a bit more. I think I gotta befriend other commuter students too ngl",

I made friends through classes or clubs, never through dorming. All the universities I went to were far from my house, and I always had to take out loans. If I had a choice, I would rather just stay at home and save money to be honest, but alas, I had no choice. Especially since the food buffet they had on campus was decent at best, but not great. Sure friends are awesome, but loans are not. I'm 100% not excited to pay back loans, especially with the interest. I would rather spend money on other beneficial things. This is just my experience. Save your money and your peace of mind. There's plenty of other places to make friends.",

There's nothing awesome about communal bathrooms, uncomfortable furniture, a cramped bedroom, and lack of privacy if you live with a roommate (not that you'd have THAT much more privacy in your parents house, but I mean, at least you have your own private room, I assume). But, you don't have to live in a dorm to experience the good parts. My first year, I had a friend who was ALWAYS over hanging with our friend group even though he lived in a different dorm building. So just try and make friends, I mean it sounds like you already have some anyway so you can hang with them some in their dorm buildings.   \n\n\nThat being said, if you live at home, try and talk to your parents about boundaries and expectations. You're presumably gonna be 18 or are 18? Do you have any siblings who have been in your shoes before? Things are gonna be different. It's not like high school, you're gonna be really busy with classwork. So your parents need to know that even when you're home, you may not be as available to do chores exactly whenever they want, hang with family, etc. You'll need more personal space and ability to manage your own time.",

Awful, spent as little time as possible in my room and hung out around campus.  I myself was not much of a people person either, but I slowly warmed up to have multiple friend groups and now consider myself the polar opposite to highschool me.\n\nThe college I'm currently at has quality dorms.  They look like hotels.  Each room has their own bathroom and there's a lobby for every floor with lots of seating and a big TV each.  I found myself hanging out in the lobby every night and made lots of friends and did so many movie/game nights.  I now live in an apartment just a 5 minute walk away from the dorms but it's so... isolating.  Not being able to just pop into the lobby to see who's there or look out the window to see a group sitting outside for me to join has cut my socialization down to less than 10%.  I also can't enter the dorms if I'm not signed in by a resident so that's also a huge obstacle.  Basically I regret choosing an apartment for my second semester here.\n\nBut if I was still at the first college with shit dorms, I would see this apartment as a total upgrade since I only hung out at other locations there anyway.\n\nYou'll have to judge for yourself how worth it it is.

Gas might take a toll on you, but depending on where you live rent or dorming would be significantly more, on top of groceries and everything else you need to do to live on your own. I suggest joining clubs or finding spots to hang out or random events to fill time when you're not in class or have work so you can still socialize. I promise you living in a small closet sized room with someone you may or may not know (even if you're friends, it doesn't mean you'll like living with them, saw it first hand) and using a communal bathroom isnt all it's cracked up to be. Especially with Covid, who knows what's going to happen anymore\n\n\nEDIT: this is all assuming you guys have good home lives too btw, my advice would be different if you were coming from toxic households",

Especially since you live so close, you can always hang out in your friend's room until early morning doing whatever then just drive home to a clean bathroom and nice mattress. \n\nUnless your home environment is just absolutely awful, there is no reason to put yourself in debt to live in a dorm.",

It all really depends on how you like to live and if you want to take out more loans to do so. I also really enjoyed living on campus, but I think it also depends how you approach the experience.
