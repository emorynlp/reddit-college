It\u2019s literally a 15 minute drive max. They\u2019re all living in a dorm and I\u2019m quite surprised since it wouldn\u2019t be a long commute and they\u2019re always driving somewhere. They were surprised when I said I\u2019m living at home and said I should just take a loan. I peeped the room and board cost and it said 11k/yr?? Then there\u2019s a 2k meal plan? Is dorm life actually that worth it? I\u2019m not a people person whatsoever but I don\u2019t want to regret it in the future and be like \u201cDang I should\u2019ve just lived in a dorm like the other folks\u201d\n\nUpdate: Thanks for responding y\u2019all. Decided to just commute because fuck student loans. Also I like having my own bathroom and a washer and dryer I don\u2019t typically have to wait to use. I think it was everyone talking about \u201cmove in day\u201d that made me really consider getting a dorm because I didn\u2019t want to feel left out. Not worth it though. I also spoke with someone from the Student Involvement and Leadership Center at my college and they told me tons of commuters are involved so that comforted me a bit more.
