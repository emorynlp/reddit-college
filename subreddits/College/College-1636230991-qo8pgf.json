  "title:": "Is it better to quit my job and spend some of my Savings during college?",
  "text": "I need advice please! I work 21 hours a week and am doing school full time for a biology degree. \n\nI found that I do have time to do both school and work, but zero time for a social life. Im debating on whether I should quit work and just be a student? \n\nI have a lot of money in savings I worked for the past 6 years, so I wouldn\u2019t have to be in any debt. My mom also pays my rent for me, I would just be responsible for everything else. My financial aid covers all my tuition. But not working for the next 3 and a half years makes me a little nervous. Should I just keep working 21 hours a week so that I will still have my fat savings by the time I\u2019m done with college? \n\nThanks for your help.. I\u2019m completely torn. \n\nTl;Dr I have money in savings to pay for living expenses during my whole college, should I spend it or keep working so I can keep my savings where it\u2019s at?",

After college you either meet people through a hobby, your job, or friends of friends. So I say work less and just enjoy your college career.",

      "text": "My recommendation is to remain working part-time while you continue pursuing your Biology degree. When you think of it this way, what sounds more realistic, having friends/social life or not having a job to pay expenses? Friends are great, no doubt, but they will not pay your bills or teach you independence and life skills. Once your savings are gone, it's going to be tough. There is always the option of paying off the student loans you've taken out after graduating or utilizing the payment plan options they offer instead of having to go broke to get out of debt with no job on top of that; it doesn't sound like a good idea. Anyway, good luck and choose the decision that is in your best interest.",

Would you mind clarifying about not taking any loans out for college as most financial aids include subsided/ unsubsidized loans, grants, scholarships, or private loans (expensive in what is charged in interest)? I also think compiling your expenses costs a month (gas, car insurance, food, internet, phone, television/streaming services, utilities, and other small monetary amounts.",

It's relatively easy to check how much of your Pell Grant you've used by signing into https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing. This website will mention what you've used out of the Pell Grant percentage and how much is still left. Is there a way to pare down some of the expenses, so it's more affordable?",
