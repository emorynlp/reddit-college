  "text": "I have almost all C's, 12 credits/5 classes. I just kind of slacked off, not thinking every homework assignment was super important. If I try harder and get mostly B's and A's next year, can I fix it?\n\nI'm going to a local community college for my associates' degree, then I plan to transfer to the state university. So, I'm not going for ivy league schools or anything; do four-year colleges really care that much about your grades if you passed?\n\nI'm doing my best to turn everything in on time now even if it's not good, because anything's better than a zero, but with only four weeks left I'm not sure how much difference it'll make.",
