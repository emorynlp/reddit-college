  "text": "Hi! so this is my first time posting my real life problems here... right now I was caught in a cheating incident and I'm so scared of it My teacher sent our case already in the SWC and they told me to give them an explanation on why I should not get a sanction like that. I don't know how to defend myself because I know that I'm guilty of it. But in anyway, can I get some advice on how will I answer their question? \ud83e\udd7a",
