To put in perspective I am currently a Biochemistry major with a Pre-Med co-major. Yet, my school is a liberal arts college, and I'm just realizing that I tend to like those classes more than the core classes of my actual major. Well to be honest I kind of simply hate my core classes, because I think I just focused too much on this area since high school and no longer have an interest in it/it made me never consider other studies. I am thinking about either switching to Anthropology or Political Science and adding a minor in business. My reasoning for this is because these two majors are both in the college of arts and science in which I have already created progress for in the number of credits I have, and I've just learned that I like the social sciences more (I would also like to graduate on time). However, my dilemma is that I don't know which is better. I am leaning forward to Anthropology because I see actual value in learning about different cultures, societies, and communication (etc). Yet everything I see is that this is a horrible degree and often the number one to avoid on countless lists/videos; even my own school website says about 30% of people go onto graduate school with this degree (which somewhat scares me, yet there could be obvious factors that perhaps these people simply didn't want to go). Now I don't think I am going to become an anthropologist by any means, but I just find that the skills I could learn from this would be beneficial and that it would be an interesting major that I could actually be passionate about. I'm also thinking it could be a good choice because I am considering using it as my foundation to perhaps go onto nursing school or get my MBA after undergrad. It's just I was originally Biochemistry/pre-med because I thought I wanted to be a doctor or physician assistant but am now realizing it wasn't necessarily what I wanted for myself, but what others expected for me. I am still interested in healthcare, but just not in that same area anymore. So I guess what I'm trying to get at is if I go for Anthropology with a business minor, is it worth it? Should I swap it out for political science or do something completely different instead? I've even considered double majoring in political science and anthropology, but I would probably have to drop the minor and I don't know if it would be all too wise to have two social science majors. I've come to the conclusion that I much rather find passion in what I study rather than killing myself over a \"high earning degree\" that I'll be miserable in and just have barely decent grades. I know high-earning degrees are subjective and that you can argue that you can work with any degree, but in general, will anthropology leave me unemployable?  I want to make sure I have something at least stable and that I won't be in debt and misery for the rest of my life.
