  "text": "I\u2019m talking screen time of 9-11 hours a DAY. It seems like my whole life is on my phone (barcode to scan to get food, texting my roommate/friends, talking to my SO, looking up directions/bus schedule etc) and so I just can\u2019t separate myself from it ever, even though I get SUPER distracted by it I try to turn it off to get work done or study but I either feel super anxious and unfocused, or I end up needing to turn it on again for whatever purpose. In HS I was at school all day or online school at home so I could easily not use my phone. Is anyone else struggling w severe phone addiction?? And how do you get around it when you need to acces it all day?",

      "text": "I had a really bad habit of sinking 4+ hours on social media in one session, leading to a LOT of screen time. I now have an average screen time of 4-5 hours a day.\n\nMy best advice is to put time limits on apps. Especially social media\u2019s as they are specifically designed to keep you engaged as long as possible. Keep it reasonable because if you go to extremes you\u2019re going to break your time limits. I personally spent those 4 hour binges on Instagram, I put a 3 hour limit at first, and slowly whittled it down to 2 hours. Other apps(non social media) that distracted me I put small time limits on like 1 hour or less\n\nIf you have an iPhone there\u2019s a \u201csnooze\u201d option but it will remind you in like 15 mins so that keeps me in check most the time \n\nA good side note is to use do not disturb instead of turning it off so you can still check your notifications occasionally. When I need to get work done I put my phone in a slightly inconvenient place so when I go to reach for it it is just inconvenient enough for me to think about why I need it lol. Slightly more than an arms reach away does it, Somtimes I have to place it on the floor or somewhere entirely out of my vision but still kinda close by",

Also facebook and instagram is a real bitch. I read 50 minutes on china and then the phone is like a monster. It's killing my productivity it's draining my creativity and slowly ruining my life. I need to go for a walk or something. This whole quarantine stuff is really affecting me it's cause I'm home with WiFi all the time anyways online classes smartphone etc it's hard it's hard it's difficult really difficult to maintain the self control it's like trying to be like gandhi or a Buddhist monk fasting.",
