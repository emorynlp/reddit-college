  "text": "Hello! I currently have an essay due tomorrow and the requirement is it has to be 4 or 4 and a half page long. Like the title say, do university essays mean I have to have my 4th page be a full page in order for it to be considered as a 4 page essay? (I have 1270 words) \n\nThank you in advance!",

If you only have 3 and half pages worth of material but it's good and well thought out, don't sweat it. Trust me, no professor wants to read an overstuffed paper with paragraphs that add nothing.",
