  "text": "I am a senior in HS and I'm worried that my GPA may be too low to get into a four-year college (it's 2.4). I asked my college advisor for his opinion and if any of my extracurriculars or my degree from a CTE school would do me any good (I'm in the yearbook club, take an NYU college course on the side and I participated in a lot of internships in my field). He said that there is a possibility that I may be able to get into a 3.0 school as a reach school but I want to hear the opinion of other people. Any advice would be great as well!",

My brother was really stressing about getting into college too (he had a 2.6 if I remember correctly), and he got some really good advice that I think might help put your mind at ease. Universities, for the most part, just want your money. If you have the money, you don\u2019t need to stress nearly as much as you think you do. Wishing the best for you!",
