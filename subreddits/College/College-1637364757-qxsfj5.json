  "text": "Just some info before I ask my question. Joined the military right out of high school. Knew that was what I wanted to do so I don't even know where to begin with the application process. Obviously wanting to use my gi bill. My passion is all things culinary. Everything except authentic Indian cuisine. It just turns out terrible every time I try. And I even love Indian curry so that's a bummer.\n\nWhen do I apply to college? What if it's out of state and I plan on using my gi bill? Really wanting to start school as soon as possible due to age. I'm 26 now and just don't want to waste anymore of my life not doing something I absolutely love. Thanks in advance. What is the overall process or who should I go to with these questions?",
