  "title:": "Do you recall any \"bs\" reasons why a professor took points away from you in an assignment?",
  "text": "Hey everyone! I'm currently writing my first college assignment which is a 1500 word essay. I'm aiming for an A since I have enough time to work for it, but I'm worried since I don't know much about what professors like. Do you recall any occasions where you lost points for a \"bs\" reason that you really couldn't have foreseen and wish you knew in advance?",
