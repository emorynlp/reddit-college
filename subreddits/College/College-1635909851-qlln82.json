  "text": "I was expelled from my high school in my home country after years of bullying and harassment for being gay. My parents sent me to a private Christian school afterwards to convert me and eventually disowned me. I lost my only friends from a tragic accident. I left my home country alone to pursue my education.\n\nWith zero opportunities to seek mental health counseling, years of depression and countless suicide attempts, and working day and night while studying full time to financially support myself, I am finally drained.\n\nI worked so hard day and night because I wanted to survive and hopefully find a better life. However, I was never given a chance to shine ever in my life. Although I graduated my high school with 4.40 GPA (highest), I was not chosen as a valedictorian because I was against \"school's policy\" (according to the principal's office secretary). In fact, I did not even know  I was supposed to be a valedictorian because no one ever told me. I learned this recently when I was applying for transfer admission, and my high school's updated transcript clearly said I was the highest ranked student. That's how I found out, but it was too late.\n\nSince I could barely afford a 4-year education, I went to a community college. I was a straight-A student with a 4.0 GPA at the time of graduation. I applied for almost 45 scholarships that I could find from months of research, but I was never given a chance for even a dollar grant some of which were because I was ineligible for FAFSA. Seeing all my friends receiving financial aid and even withdrawing checks because apparently school \"owed\" them money, my life felt so miserable.\n\nI eventually transferred to one of the UCs with a Regents Scholarship, but my school dropped this after I deferred my enrollment due to Covid pandemic. The admissions and the scholarship offices promised me that this scholarship would roll over for the next year, but they shared me the wrong information due to their own mistakes, so I am paying almost $70k per year w/o any grants, FA, nor financial help from anyone.\n\nI worked harder than anyone, but seeing life being so unfair ever since I was born (not to mention all the struggles I had to go through as a gay person living in a very conservative environment), I am finally drained. I do not see a point of living when there has not been a single opportunity for \"reward\" (not necessarily financial ones) nor there ever will be. I can't stop thinking about depressing and bad thoughts, and I feel like I am finally done. No family, no hope, and no future. I wish I was never born.\n\nI guess some people were never meant to shine...",

      "text": "Most people will never shine in their lives, and that's fine. Your unhappiness stems from comparing your life to others and comparing your life to society's expectations. Stop doing that.\n\nNo hope, no future??? You are obviously very capable of using your noggin based on your academic record and could probably choose any field you want to. Drop out of college right now and go to trade school for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, or something similar? You will be a great technician. Stay in college and graduate? You will have debt but will do great in whatever field you are studying.",

      "text": "Do you have a copy of the letter where they stated you could maintain the scholarship? When your semester started did it show? You should try to talk with financial aid again. That is so crazy. I'm so sorry you're going through that.\n\nYou are worthy. Your life experiences, while terrible, and saddening, has most likely created empathy and a desire to keep others from going through what you did? You can make a difference. What your former school did is unfair, but they can never take away that you were the highest in your class. It's an accomplishment to be proud of and demonstrates your resilience and intelligence.\n\nYou will find a new family one day. It is their loss. Perhaps it will be a partner. Or perhaps it will be a group of friends, but it will happen. It's amazing the discrimination you've faced, but you've continued to succeed with school and really tried your best, even while looking for scholarships. Perhaps its wiser to transfer to a school that isn't so expensive, I can't advise you. But whatever you do, don't give up on life. Don't give up on yourself. You're worthy and you've come so far.\n\nIf your parents disowned you and you support yourself, you may be able to have financial aid without their documents, if that is what is holding your aid back.",

Try some experiments, I'm not a scientist, but its different from science lab manual. I learned fluoride in toothpaste somehow makes you less thirsty.",
