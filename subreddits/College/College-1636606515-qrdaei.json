You can take various classes to see what you are interested in and if you end up deciding that you want to go to a 4 year university, then you can earn an associates, saving money and time because you now know what you want to major in. Or, you might chose to go to trade school, in which case, you would be glad that you didn\u2019t toil away at a 4 year university only to realize that it wasn\u2019t for you.",

                          "text": "Funny, my first FT job was as a junior systems analyst. Good plan but shoot higher. 5 years is too long to get into consulting. Do research on what they are hiring for, get certified, work on a few side projects building stuff, post to LinkedIn, update LinkedIn and resume, go for FT consulting jobs straight out of college. \n\nI'm very involved with the tech org of my alma mater and there was a few years around 2017\\~ where Power BI was so hot, I told students \"Get this cert, build two dashboards, post to your LinkedIn and I will get you a job.\" Only a few people took me up on it.\n\nThere's always a need for good entry/junior level data analysts. If what you are looking for is interesting work and great career opportunities, definitely start building your analytics skills and brand. Even 2-4 weeks worth of solid study for each of SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel (just cause so many teams are entrenched and there's a lack of competent Excel power users also) will make you extremely marketable. Since you are in your first few years at college you have plenty of time. If software engineering is more your thing over analytics, that's a great career path too. I went with analytics and have had a great career so far ($61k > $240k annual comp in 4 years), but if I could redo I might go into SWE instead.\n\nA few consulting companies off the top of my head that I know hire college students for tech/analytics roles: Pariveda, West Monroe, Avanade, Capgemini, Sogeti, Accenture (might be hard if you don't go to a target school), Slalom. There's a ton of them out there to be honest, and if you can only get a job at a small and not well known or well regarded body shop (lower tier consulting work), that's fine too. Get a year under your belt while continuing to develop your skills and you can jump to a better company. I've exited to a tech company, but what I love most about tech consulting is that technical skills will carry you really hard even if your interpersonal skills are not the best.",

              "text": "It wasnt a comment about intelligence,  but practicality. \n\nCollege degrees are expensive (I'm assuming you're in the US) and the payoff isnt generally what people think. Most industries will require at least a 4 year degree. At $30k a year (roughly the cost of a 4 year in state school), thats $120k.\n\nTrade schools are cheaper and skip gen ed requirements so your saving time and money. They aren't glamorous, but a lot of trades pay decent wages. \n\nIf your set on college, maybe take a look at a community college. They sometimes offer certificate programs that function a bit like a trade but with more gen ed requirements.",

Don\u2019t pick a general course like business just because you don\u2019t know what you want to, and most definitely don\u2019t pick a course without knowing what career pathway you are going to follow. So many people pick psychology because they find it interesting, but have no idea what jobs they\u2019re opened up to past being a psychologist.
