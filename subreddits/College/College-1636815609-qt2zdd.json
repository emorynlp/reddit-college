  "text": "hi! I'm a freshman and i definitely want to transfer. the school im at currently is pretty mid, its a good amount of work but I have a life outside of school. all the schools I'm looking to transfer to are kinda fancy so I'm kind of worried about the workload. I'm a hard worker, very driven and intelligent, and I can handle it but I still want a life outside of school. here are some of the schools; if you go to any of these please comment :) I'm hoping to do art but still want a well-rounded education! \n\nbrown/risd (dual program)\n\ntufts\n\nnyu\n\nuniversity of Washington (seattle)\n\nucla\n\nbarnard",

      "text": "Hmm well how are the finances for each of them? Are you in a position where finances don't matter (you are wealthy), are you on the other end of that where they do matter a lot, or in the middle?\n\nArt usually has a low or negative return on investment so if you go with the affordable option, it will make paying back any loans much easier on you.\n\nFirst get an idea of the total cost of each of them through graduation and then decide between them. From two that are similar in cost it makes sense to pick the one you like even if it's the more expensive. A $5k difference won't mean much. But some of your options might be double or half the cost between each other which is considerable.",

              "text": "Okay so IMO you should have a general idea of what *sector* you want to get experience in. It doesn't have to be deciding a specific job but at least the general area of interest like education, technology, administration, etc. You should do this to get a good idea of potential income. You have to have an idea of that figure because it is what legitimizes the cost of college and puts your mind at ease about finances. This will help you know how much loans you can take out comfortably (the general rule is no more than the average starting salary).\n\nYou should use the information you get above and the worked out cost information to evaluate each college option. Basically for each one you want the cost, how much of that will be paid in loans, and if you are in a position where that loan amount is reasonable.\n\nFor income maybe just base it off of the US average for all entry-level art related jobs. That should be easy to google. Or if you want, you can go to each school and get program-specific salary data to use in each independent calculation.",
