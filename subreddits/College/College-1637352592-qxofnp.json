      "text": "Yes and no. I\u2019ve always been introverted so naturally I stay home more. But I\u2019m more of a hermit now because school takes up most of my time. I\u2019m a commuter since I go to CC, but only have one in-person class. Only time I go out is for class or the gym, with the exception of the weekends where I just travel to nearby cities because I hate where I am currently.",
