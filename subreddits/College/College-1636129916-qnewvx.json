      "text": "I'm sorry you got a concussion! I hope you take time to rest and heal up. I have never taken time off college due to a concussion, but I did have a death in the family during undergrad and a counselor on campus wrote me a note letting me withdraw from classes for awhile without any penalty. It delayed my graduation, which sucked, but I knew I needed time off to take care of myself. You're doing the best you can.",
