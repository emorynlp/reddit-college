Also going to sleep on time, having a hard limit makes you more rested and help you manage time better. Sounds weird but ALWAYS if you get better/longer sleep, you will be able to do your work faster and with higher quality. Even if that means spending 30 min less on work, the extra 30 min and routine will pay dividends back and allow you to do what would normally take an hour in 45 or even 30 mins. \n\nWhatever you do, the #1 thing is to work on self control, being honest with yourself.
