  "title:": "I'm a junior and feel so behind compared to my peers",
  "text": "I used to have a decent amount of friends at my first university, and then I transferred because I didn't like my school or the people there. Then COVID hit so this is my first quarter in person. I was pledging a business fraternity at my old school but when I rushed at my new school there were 100 rushees and only 31 bids so they only bid one junior, and asked the other juniors to rush again next quarter. I only have a few friends at my new school (one I hang out with at my apartment). I was getting lunch with my classmates after class today and they are getting so many internship offers while I can't even get an offer. It feels like all the kids around me have their shit together, talking about their internships and all this money they make off investing and shit and I still feel like a freshman with no friends or experience.",
