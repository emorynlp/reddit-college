  "title:": "Did anyone drop out of college here?",
  "text": "Probably a dumb place to ask but idk where else. I'm currently at a bleak point in my life, everything is so so messy and I'm directionless. I want to drop out, but of course everybody and their mamas and MY mama is trying to dissuade me. I totally get it, with how the world is structured. But I'm so tired of living a life doing something I don't want to do. I chose this path at 17, it is required for all 16-17 year olds here to pick a career path by the government. I picked something, tried it, hate it. I already feel like I failed, and I feel taking this big leap of faith will make me a bigger failure. I'm just so lost\n\n\nWorst of all, I'm at my final year. But I feel like I can't push on anymore. My school literally denied me from taking a break. I either just let everything fail (idk if I'd get kicked out) or drop out. The course I'm doing isn't even respected by society lol... you guessed it, design. I can sense judgement from others whenever I say it.\n\n\nUgh idk what to do :( I'm interested in languages and tattooing, but haven't been able to get into it since I spend my time in school, all of it. Or having a panic attack because I absolutely hate my life to the core and I have no idea what I'm gonna do at 20.",

But there is a very high chance that if you don\u2019t complete it that either a) you\u2019ll have to return later or b) you\u2019ll have to suffer through the financial consequences of not having a degree.",
