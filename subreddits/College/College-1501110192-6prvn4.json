Any additions are welcome. \n\nThe most important section is the \"study habits\" section, as noted by some commenters \n  \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jN3Hy1h4he5eHTbq5enaDVrrlywBvAYjXELia6R_9j8/edit#\n\nAnd here is another post from this subreddit that goes far deeper into the importance of habit and routine forming than I have. (I agree with everything on the post)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4wrp56/what_i_tell_incoming_freshman_every_year_good/\n\nAll advice on that post aligns with at least one, if both,  of the college books I've read. Srsly read it lol.\n\nP. S. (entirely unrelated) I found a survey app called Pulse for college students exclusively. They often ask questions about depression, school, etc. If you have the time/are interested pls use my referral code (you also get 250 pulse points, note it's only 1200 to redeem a 3 month trial in skillshare) : Follow the link below or enter the code o8yddW5VOR in the app. https://bbuw.app.link/o8yddW5VOR\n\nThe survey results are pretty interesting and cover areas like dating, alcohol, intelligence, depression, school etc. It's restricted to college students with a college email address. you can redeem prizes like a 3 month trial to skillshare with just 60 surveys (2 minutes each). I'm trying to get the biggest prize of an electric bike, so that I can bike to a near by climbing gym 2-3 times a week for fitness/training for a climbing competition.
