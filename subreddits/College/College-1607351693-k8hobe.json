I look down the list of topics we've studied over the weeks before the midterm (we have a quarter system, so the terms are 7 weeks of intense coursework, it sucks) and I literally don't remember how to do anything at all. I was just going week to week, day to day, churning out projects and assignments following patterns to get a decent grade.  Zoom-University literally destroys my ability to learn. Its like there's no point to me attending college right now. A lot of me wishes I had done a gap year.  Honestly. \n\nAnyone with me?\n\nEdit: rad response my dudes. I'll respond to the comments eventually, but I barely had time to write the post as it was. Gotta watch these lectures and do the problems sometime.\n\nEdit 2 (12/18/20), after finals: I made it my dudes. I passed all my classes for the semester. My gpa may have dipped below a 3, but I have time to make that rise up again. I'm only a freshman. I had to retake a portion of my calculus final in order to pass the class -- if I had gotten a 25/35, I would have failed, and if I got a 30/35, passed. I passed! I got a 30/35!! A big fat beautiful C. \nIdk how many people will read this since the post already blew up and not many people visit anymore, but I want to let those who do visit the post know, that it will be okay. You will get through it. Sending love. Even beyond the comment.

I\u2019ve always been someone who actually learned and did better in those settings because I have severe social anxiety that would always get in the way of learning in-person. BUT, for those who don\u2019t or don\u2019t have a reason to like online classes they are insanely difficult and tbh it\u2019s hard to give advice because I can totally see that. It\u2019s hard to learn when you\u2019re not in class because why should I? Like, I\u2019m not in class, I can\u2019t meet my teacher or peers, what motivation do I have to actually learn and not just go with the motions? The only thing I can recommend at this point for you would be to take it a step at a time but go at the pace you need to make it to finals. Like, if you went over 5 chapters of something during these last few weeks, go back and skim those chapters for what you think is the most important info. Did you guys ever do discussion? If you did, those kinds of questions or that topic will likely be on the final so that\u2019ll give you a better idea of what to expect. Email your professors and ask them what they think is best to focus on from the reading/book/class. It\u2019s not bad to ask, I\u2019ve done that numerous times. I have a lot of reading I have to do in the next week and one of my classes just sucks up all my time so I totally understand how you\u2019re feeling. Just hang in there and try to take in as much as you can and write things down for better memory retention.
