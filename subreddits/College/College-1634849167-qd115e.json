  "text": "Hi! I talked to my instructor and asked if it would still be possible for me to pass the class, he told me he would let me know after week 7. I was wondering what you guys were thinking? The rest of the assignments are online on a site that makes you solve weekly math questions. I\u2019m pretty sure I can work hard to get good grades on those, but the quizzes have been really hard on me. Should I drop the class or keep trying?",

      "text": "It really depends on your opinions of your capability to excel in the next quizzes. If I were you, I would calculate all of your grades and put in potential scores of homework\u2019s and quizzes, then see where you fall. It\u2019s definitely better to have a W on a transcript than an F or D! If you\u2019re confident that you will do well enough to get your grade back up, I\u2019d say keep trying. If not, drop it and take it again next semester with new strategies! Good luck :)",
