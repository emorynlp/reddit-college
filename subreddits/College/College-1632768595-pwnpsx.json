There has been a thing of dishes in the sink for at least 5 days now. It has gotten to the point where I now can not use the sink without moving the dishes inside it. We also have a dishwasher, so I really don\u2019t understand why this is such a issue. \n\nAny advice on how to deal with this?", "author": "Nofapdeity", "created": 1632768595, "retrieved": 1632945571, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hei5chi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwnpsx/roomate_does_not_clean_up_after_himself_in_a/hei5chi/", "text": "Do you think he's depressed? It's not your responsibility obviously, but getting to the root of the problem could help solve it permanently.\n\nYou'll have to talk to him. My roommate and I have our own sides of the sink.
