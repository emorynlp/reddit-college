      "text": "When you sign up for a three credit hour class, they are basically saying that for every hour you spend in class, you should expect to spend three outside of it preparing. That's the way it works, and that's why there is a pretty hard cap on the number of credit hours you should be taking.\n\nThat means that if you are taking 15 credit hours, the expected workload is 45 hours a week, or slightly more than a full time job. There is a reason that you are called a full time student, it is expected that it is you only/main commitment.",

Also, a lot of times profs say you need to spend that amount of time studying to do well, but it's just not true. I've had classes where they say you need to spend 12 hours a week and in reality, it took 6 hours. I've never had to spend the amount of time that they state, but everyone's different.",
