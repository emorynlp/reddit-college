This is person tried to lock me out of my own work to steal it, and now talks bad about me online to anyone who will listen.  She confronted me as well and I tried to stand up for myself, but that only made the insults online even worse (she doesn\u2019t know I can see them).  She doesn\u2019t name me by name, but names characteristics about myself (appearance, age) as well as interactions we have that clearly identify me.  I asked a professor this semester to not place me with her as I was worried about her trying to steal my work again, and the professor acknowledged it, but seemed to hint at this being an unprofessional request (in my major, we are heavily graded on professionalism).  I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point because we\u2019re already in a group again and she\u2019s still saying some pretty nasty stuff about me online, and I don\u2019t even think I could bring it up to anyone because she doesn\u2019t explicitly name me.\n\nEdit:  wow, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up, thank you to everyone for the kind words of encouragement.  I want to clarify for those of you who still had questions on what went down.  Essentially, she unshared me from a group document that we did where I did the most (if not to the point of all) work (the revision history proves it), and then said that I don\u2019t need to see it because it was \u201ctheir work\u201d (other group members were unaware of this happening, so she was claiming it for herself).  I did have to bring the matter up to the professor to get her to reshare it with me and allow my name to be on it, but the professor did not pursue any additional action.  Since then, she has been talking about me online and to other people within my major.  I notice that a lot of you are talking about going to the dean, but at this point I don\u2019t even know if I have a viable case anymore as it\u2019s been a while since then.  I\u2019ve taken steps to protect myself in the group project that I am in with her now, but it is hard to say if she will pull this again.  I can\u2019t prove she\u2019s talking about me because she doesn\u2019t explicitly use my name, and in the end she was forced to reshare the document with me so I don\u2019t even know if I could claim plagiarism.  I have text screenshots of our conversation when I confronted her about unsharing me and claiming it\u2019s \u201ctheirs\u201d, but that\u2019s about the only concrete evidence I have.", "author": "Hyacinth048", "created": 1632011681, "retrieved": 1632801398, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 567, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"he5we8v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqxwsg/im_being_bullied_in_college/he5we8v/", "text": "Give her a baked good you made as a peace offering that\u2019s actually filled with laxatives", "author": "Rough-Tension", "created": 1632531727, "upvotes": 1}, "hdjq5v7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqxwsg/im_being_bullied_in_college/hdjq5v7/", "text": "I'm sorry that you have to deal with something like that :/ especially if you have to continue working with her, I think that's the most difficult thing about group work in college in general.

After that, you two will split off in two different directions (assuming they're not also in the same major/classes/etc.). Having it documented to the professor is one of the best things you could've done at the time because there's a slim chance that they could do more harm down the road, but just ignore them and focus on trying to get through the class so that the next semester will feel like a weight being lifted off your shoulders.
