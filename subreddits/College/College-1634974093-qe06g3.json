  "text": "Before I started college, I was always considered very extroverted. I knew everyone\u2019s name and was always surrounded by friends. \n\nCollege is a completely different story. No one really knows me. I have a few good friends and a significant other but nothing crazy. I don\u2019t really feel a desire to get to know other people or be well known / well liked on campus. I\u2019d rather just fit in than stand out. \n\nWhat changed from high school to college? Why do I no longer enjoy being sociable / standing out? Sometimes, I wish I could be more like my high school self. I had a lot more charisma and personality. Now, I\u2019m just another college student going through the motions.",
