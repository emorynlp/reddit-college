  "title:": "Applying to grad schools but my GPA is crap",
  "text": "I dropped out of college twice and when I finally found something I was passionate about I went back and worked my butt off but my GPA is still 0.25 points too low for most grad school programs I want to get into. They offer provisional admissions but I feel that it's a long shot. Anyone else get into grad school with crummy undergrad GPA?",
