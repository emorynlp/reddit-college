  "text": "So I\u2019ve been having a rough go of it lately and I\u2019m considering going to my college counselor about it. I\u2019m just not sure if I should be going to them or taking the steps to see a therapist. Stress has really been beating my ass lately and it\u2019s getting in the way of me finishing my degree. I have a senior project due in November and I just can\u2019t seem to work on it cause every time I even think about it, I start having a panic attack and ignore what I need to be doing. I even have a hard time sending emails to my professors asking for help on it. It seems like such a simple thing, but I can\u2019t seem to do it\u2026",

      "text": "Colleges can have different terms for these jobs. An academic advisor (sometimes called college counselor) is there to help you choose classes, plan your career, and can help with when you're struggling in a particular class. A mental health counselor (also sometimes called college counselor, I know it's confusing) is a therapist and is there to help you through stress, anxiety, depression and any other mental health needs you have. Most college's have this service included in your tuition so you don't have to use insurance or pay out of pocket because you're already paying for it. Search for your counseling services center on campus and you can make an appointment. Most counseling center's even have group therapy if you want to be a bit more passive in the beginning.",

          "text": "Thank you. I emailed them today to set up an appointment. Coincidentally, someone was talking about it in one of my classes today and we definitely have one for mental health. We have a student learning and development center that they work at while the academic counselors are in the business offices. Apparently the counselor here is pretty good so I\u2019ll try it out. I\u2019m kind of introverted so I\u2019m a little worried I\u2019m gonna make it awkward. Plus I\u2019m a crier so\u2026I guess I\u2019ll have to see how they deal with that lol.",

Mostly it just helps me organize my thoughts and think about what's going on so I concentrate other hors to other things. Having the dedicated time and space alone makes a world of difference. I hope it helps!",

If you want support for mental health issues, that's something you'd get from a therapist. Your college may have a mental health center where you can see someone for free or for a reduced cost.",

It might be empowering to try out a few sessions if able, especially if unsure about committing to therapy long-term.",

I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d benefit more from going to a counselor that is directly related to the school over a therapist. Just since my issues are more school related than anything. Thanks!",
