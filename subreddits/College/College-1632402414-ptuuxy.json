I\u2019m just not sure if I should be going to them or taking the steps to see a therapist. Stress has really been beating my ass lately and it\u2019s getting in the way of me finishing my degree. I have a senior project due in November and I just can\u2019t seem to work on it cause every time I even think about it, I start having a panic attack and ignore what I need to be doing. I even have a hard time sending emails to my professors asking for help on it. It seems like such a simple thing, but I can\u2019t seem to do it\u2026", "author": "WickedPuffin", "created": 1632402414, "retrieved": 1632946165, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hdzae6c": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptuuxy/what_does_a_college_counselor_do/hdzae6c/", "text": "Colleges can have different terms for these jobs.

Most college's have this service included in your tuition so you don't have to use insurance or pay out of pocket because you're already paying for it. Search for your counseling services center on campus and you can make an appointment. Most counseling center's even have group therapy if you want to be a bit more passive in the beginning.", "author": "thehelpfulprof", "created": 1632413936, "upvotes": 2}, "hdyu6jj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptuuxy/what_does_a_college_counselor_do/hdyu6jj/", "text": "An academic counselor is there to help you choose classes and navigate academics-related questions.
