Make your room cozy (if you want). Even putting a few posters on the wall will make a world of difference. Also, LED lights were the best (non-essential) $20 I spent all year, highly recommend.\n\n2.) You know what kind of person you are. By this I mean, if you want your room to be cute and decorated, don't let someone convince you that it's a waste of money/time. I loved having a cozy room to come back to and made lots of friends due to them wanting to hang out in my room.\n\n3.) This also means you know what you use. Don't bring a water bottle if you never use one now. Don't bring that piece of clothing you haven't worn in months because it will just take up space.\n\n4.) Keep the pandemic situation in mind. You probably don't need to pack swim suites because pools won't be open anyways. Also, stuff like a printer may not be as necessary as most classes will turn things in digitally (unless you need it to scan things)\n\n5.) Also with the pandemic in mind, pack lightly and keep containers in your room. You want to be able to move out at a moments notice if things get really bad again.\n\n6.) You will need a lot less clothes than you think you do but will probably overpack anyways. If you haven't worn something by the time you go home for your first break, take it home with you.\n\n7.) If drinking/smoking isn't your thing, don't worry! There are plenty of people who choose not to for whatever reason and most people are respectful of this.\n\n8.) If you do go out partying, you leave and come back with the same people. You make sure everyone got home safe and sound (especially the girls in your group). Don't let your girl friends walk alone at night.\n\n9.) Probably an unpopular opinion but don't be afraid to cut your friends off if they've had too much. It's not cool to pressure someone into drinking more than their bodies can handle. Look out for all of your friends and if they don't do that for you, find new friends.\n\n10.) If someone passes out from drinking, *PLEASE* roll them onto their side. Lots of people die every year from choking on vomit while unconscious.\n\n11.) This may be obvious, but try your best in classes and put them above all else. You pay so much money, to do otherwise would be silly. I say this as someone who partied A LOT and still had straight A's, it's important you find a balance.\n\n12.) Bring a basic first aid kit and some basic OTC medicine. I was very happy to have fever reducer and ibuprofen on standby when I got tonsillitis a month into school.\n\n13.) Lots of people say a TV is a waste but we used ours a lot. Especially with the pandemic happening, you should expect to be inside a lot more anyways. (Same goes for PC set ups)\n\n14.) You'll soon learn that people weren't raised the same as you. Set guidelines with your roommates about cleaning/partying/bringing people over ect. during the first couple days of school. Also, bring up issues with your roommates as soon as they're on your radar.\n\n15.) Be safe if you're hooking up. Let a friend/roommate know where you're going, I found using snap location made me feel safer. Also wrap it up!\n\n16.) Some stuff that I brought that was never used included: Ear plugs, desk lamp, paper clips, post its, water bottle, swimsuit. It all depends on the person though. Ear plugs are good to bring just in case, better to have and not need than to never have them at all.\n\n17.) If you have a car on campus, maybe keep that low key unless you want people asking for rides all the time.\n\n18.) Be safe. Wear a mask outside your dorm at all times. To not do this is so selfish and you're not only endangering yourself, but those around you and everyone they come into contact with. Maybe you would be fine if you got covid, but the asthmatic kid down the hall may not be so lucky. You are not invincible and life will soon show you otherwise if you think that.\n\n19.) Have fun! The 7 months I was on campus last year were the best of my life. I've made so many life long friends and I hope you will too.\n\nFeel free to add more, these were just off the top of my head!", "author": "AetherlessArt", "created": 1594857840, "retrieved": 1632946953, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1868, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g66rzux": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hrz8pv/some_incoming_freshman_tips_that_i_wish_someone/g66rzux/", "text": "Bruh I don\u2019t even get straight A\u2019s and I spend all my time doing homework and studying.

So I kind of got screwed over that semester. \n\nAlso I would have to add that when you do haggle over roommate agreements, specify what you mean by clean or messy since everybody has a different definition. To your roommate clean might mean making your bed, nothing out, etc but to me, it just means there\u2019s no food out. Be honest about how much you\u2019re actually gonna clean.

I added some tips below for anyone that cares. \n\nMost major universities (i think) will have you take a drinking/sexual assault seminar. If you plan on partying with friends, You should give the keys to a designated non-drinking driver so that nobody has to worry about who is/isnt drunk when it\u2019s time to go home.\n\nI personally put my flat screen tv on my desk and I enjoyed it ALOT. I don\u2019t have cable at home, because my family didn\u2019t really use it when we had it. However, it was kind of cool watching tv til like 3am.\n\nDONT BE AFRAID TO MOVE! If you dont like your roommate(s) then MOVE! There is no need for you to be miserable. I moved twice my freshman year. \n\nUse free resources! My college realized that nobody was showing up to events so they started to offer free food like Pizza, Caprisun, Soda, and a gift card raffle to those who attended. Free shit is Free! \n\nLastly (and this is VERY biased), but fuck the bookstore. All those books and items are OVERPRICED! You can save a ton by using Chegg or by simply using other websites to download textbooks for free. Nothing is more embarrassing than a professor saying \u201cYou dont need the access code, a used/rented book will work just fine.\u201d and some student replies, \u201cwait...what???  I spent $300 on this book and I can\u2019t return it because I opened it.\u201d \n\nOn a final note. Most of y\u2019all are paying $10k+ to get a degree, not to party. \n\nTL:DR : You can bring a tv, if your college offers cable. Attend events that offer food and prizes. Drunk Driving and rape is illegal. Save money by using Chegg/Amazon.", "author": "18dwhyte", "created": 1594863443, "upvotes": 114}, "fy7iso4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hrz8pv/some_incoming_freshman_tips_that_i_wish_someone/fy7iso4/", "text": "Adding that if you\u2019re moving to a place with a completely different climate than where you are from, make sure to ask people who come from similar places what kind of clothing or shoes you need.
