It\u2019s a small lab of 10 people and everyone in that lab told me that he doesn\u2019t like me. On the first day of class he screwed up a problem on the board and I raised my hand and asked him why he did it that way then when he explained it I told him respectfully that the way he did the question is incorrect. He did not realize what was wrong so I had to walk him through it step by step on the board, which I get made him embarrassed and look like an idiot in front of the class but it\u2019s not my fault he did the problem wrong. Since that day he has hated me. He consistently grades me harsher than all my peers and takes off points for things that others didn\u2019t lose points for. \n\nLast week he screwed up an answer key for a quiz and when I told him that the key is wrong and proved to him that my answer is correct he refused to give me the points back, instead he said \u201cI\u2019ll just throw that question out. \u201d \n\nOn another instance he took off points because he claimed I had not included my pKa value in my notebook, when I showed it to him that it was on the next page he refused to give me the points back claiming that I should\u2019ve circled it. \n\n\nAnother thing that happened today. He took off points for my notebook because he claimed I didn\u2019t include my data. When I showed him it in my notebook he claimed that I wrote in after he handed back the notebooks. Then I showed him the same data on another page that he had also commented he was like ok and gave me back 1 of the two points. Then I asked why only 1 of the 2 then he said ok fine and gave me back both points. \n\nHe huffed and it was one of the rudest encounters ever tbh. \n\n\n\nWhat do I do?
