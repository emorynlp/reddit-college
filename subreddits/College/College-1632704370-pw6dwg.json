I\u2019ve been going to lots of parties, but still haven\u2019t hooked up with  anyone yet. Yesterday my fraternity threw a massive party, and I was rly drunk the whole time. Apparently, according to my friend and a few older people in the frat, there were a lot of girls around me all the time who seemed to be interested, but I didn\u2019t give them attention and kinda swerved all of them. This was all unintentional and obviously not my goal. My question is how should I be approaching these girls and talking to them? People are clearly interested, but idk what to say. What kind of questions should I be asking? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "Busy-Pineapple9453", "created": 1632704370, "retrieved": 1632800257, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "comments": {"hefao5u": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw6dwg/talking_to_girls_at_parties/hefao5u/", "text": "Ask them bout their degree or do the good ole lady convo starter trick from How I Met Your Mother (Have you met Ted?)", "author": "FCHusky", "created": 1632708468, "upvotes": 1}, "hefa14a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw6dwg/talking_to_girls_at_parties/hefa14a/", "text": "before I go to parties I smoke, chills me out and relaxes me; you should try it", "author": "brainer1000", "created": 1632708157, "upvotes": 1}, "hef4c2g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw6dwg/talking_to_girls_at_parties/hef4c2g/", "text": "Unrelatedly, did you rush your first semester at college?", "author": "ComputerizedCash", "created": 1632705511, "upvotes": 1}, "hef3dmt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw6dwg/talking_to_girls_at_parties/hef3dmt/", "text": "My go to: Get blasted, \u201cyooo\u201d, \u201c my name is _____\u201d, what\u2019s yours?!!!
