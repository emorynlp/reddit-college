  "text": "I am a senior studying biology. This is already a hard degree in itself, which requires a lot of reviewing of material to learn. All of my classes in the past have gone on a read a chapter and learn it in a weekly format. Now, remember this is hard fucking shit, you NEED that time to learn and digest the material. I feel like theres gotta be a scientific study somewhere saying how much fucking new information someone can resonably take in at once. This semester with along with my 3 other classes and job I have a professor assigning 18+ HOURS of lectures to watch a week and answer questions for. Not even just that- theres 2-3- sometimes 4 chapters to read with it as well. THIS IS FUCKING INSANE. I've learned nothing in this class due to the sheer information dumping and have straight resorted to cheating to get it done in time. He says he formats it like a graduate-level course but were not in graduate school and it's not reasonable (or doable) for a person. I'm convinced this man has some kind of fucking brain damage and I have just begun the process of getting his course evaluation so he can either be monitored or fired. Literally, something I'd never considered doing in past no matter how bad a professor is. This was the class I took to break up my hard classes like organic chemistry and physics so that I would be learning something I enjoyed - vertebrate anatomy - but now I'm just fucking pissed every day at this man's cracked-out approach to teaching. So, in this coming week my first plan of action is to find out if my college evaluates professors' lesson plans before they are taught or if they just trust them. I've sent out some emails asking only that question, not mentioning why I would want to know, in order to get a good baseline for why the hell this man is teaching this way. Then I'm going to spend what few hours of free time I have compiling how much work is being required to be done weekly in this class and why it's not possible to learn this much so someone can look into his class and fix the way its being taught. This is interesting shit I wanted to learn about and I'm not going to let him ruin more students excitement with his bullshit teaching style. Or at least I'm gonna try. \n\nIm fully aware this is insane but its the only thing getting me through this course. SHeer anger and the hope that he will never teach again- or at least in this way.",

      "text": "I actually had a physics professor do something very similar to this. As a class, majority of us banned together and went to the division chair. We got him fired from our course halfway through the semester and they gave us a replacement teacher. I would ask some of your classmates to help you with this and to actually get him investigated. In my case, the chair determined that one he was assigning graduate level work that was unreasonable and unrealistic for undergraduate students. They also discovered that he was using our research in his papers without crediting us lmao. His class ruined my mental health and I actually quit my job at the time because I couldn\u2019t deal with working, going to class full time and doing my mandatory volunteer hours for my honors organization. So I really hope you are able to help not only yourself but your classmates too. Best of luck and don\u2019t give up!",
