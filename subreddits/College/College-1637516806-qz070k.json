  "title:": "Thanking a Professor For Helping With Transfer",
  "text": "I worked in a now-retired professor's class as a class tutor but never took her classes. Now that I'm transferring, she's been helping me with essays, meeting multiple times and working through 4 revisions of my essays. Basically, she's done a lot that she didn't need to.\n\nI want to thank after I submit, but I'm unsure how. Should it really just be a nice note? I know giving gifts often isn't allowed, but since she's retired and was never my professor, would a small gift card for coffee or something be alright/appropriate?",
