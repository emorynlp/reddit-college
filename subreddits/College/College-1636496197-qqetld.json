  "text": "I am drowning in my workload. I have stayed up till at least 5am every night this past week, and a record breaking 9am this morning because I\u2019m up all night studying or writing essays or reading an insane amount of articles\u2026 when I do finally go to sleep, I end up waking up around 1pm, I\u2019ll take a shower, eat, run some errands, spend some time with family, and I\u2019m right back to studying by 5-6 pm\u2026.  Granted I take breaks and procrastinate sometimes but I feel like it shouldn\u2019t be like this\u2026. It makes me want to give up and just go to sleep\u2026 especially when I can literally hear ppl snoring in my house and I\u2019m still up staring at my laptop every night\u2026. Ughhhh\u2026 am i the only one?\n\nEdit: wow!! I didn\u2019t expect so many responses.. I even got an award, cool. Thanks everyone. Some of you have asked if I\u2019m taking too many credits,, I\u2019m not, I have 15 credits (all online) and am maintaining a 4.0 GPA. Aside from that, I\u2019m working on a thesis with one of my professors. This is my biggest assignment, and I have to defend it in April\u2026 so until then, it\u2019s months of nonstop research. Someone in the comments said, if it was easy everyone would do it, and I suppose that\u2019s true\u2026 I know I can handle it, just gotta get a bit more organized and use my time efficiently.",

You *need* breaks, but you should set a timer/alarm so you're taking 10-15 minute breaks and not \"accidentally\" spend 2 hours on tiktok/insta/youtube while you're in the middle of an assignment.\n\nDepending on your commute/schedule, consider doing some of that article reading between classes or on the way to/from school. I used to have a 45 minute bus commute each way, so it was great to get the reading done for english/history classes.\n\nFrom the sound of it, it seems you're living at home? While this is a great financial benefit, I understand the lack of privacy/quiet time when you're trying to focus on work. If possible, consider staying in the library as long as you're able while working/studying so you have less distractions at home.\n\nIf you are spending *a lot* of time studying (aside from homework/reading), more than a 1:1 ratio of lecture time to study time, you might not be studying correctly, or might not be understanding the material correctly. Consider going to office hours with the professor(s) to help you cut down that study time.",

That would be 56 hours of work outside of class each week. \n\nI think an overlooked point in college is that *how* you study is just as important as how much. If you spend 6 hours studying for a regular exam and you fail it, adding 6 more hours will probably not help. You need to reexamine your study methods. And it depends on what you're studying but there is sort of diminishing returns the longer you study. Studying for an hour is WAY better than studying for 15 minutes, but the difference between 8 hours and 10 hours is probably not as clear.",

Some government aid requires that number of hours for online classes or you don't qualify, for example. \n\nThis amount was decided on when students were *only* students, without the need to work and stuff outside of class. And, in general, it's why higher ed is *supposed* to work best at a 12-15 credit semester. In addition, it's meant to balance class workloads evenly. \n\nWhether or not this is realistic nowadays is a separate debate, but those numbers aren't random. They're based on research and (hopefully) intentional class planning. \n\n(I work in higher ed and actually created an app to help instructors estimate workload time)",

If you aren't effective, not concentrating, and not progressing through your readings then take a break. Watch a youtube video, get something to eat, play with your pet, talk to your family, anything to break it up. Then come back to the reading and you will be surprised how far you are. Finish up the reading then do something fun as a reward. Plan aggressively but allow for adaptation. This week I had five chapters to read I broke them up over 3 days. Turned out I already read some so I'm done on the 2nd day with tons of me time left over.

During the semester figure out what your working/studying time is and turn on downtime (or android equivalent or get an app for it) during those hours. You can keep available the apps you might actually still need by excluding them. While you\u2019ll obviously be able to bypass it with your code if you want, it will 1) be a reminder that\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to be doing and 2) create an extra couple steps to get to the app during which time you can reconsider. Obviously you still need some resolve here to not just override it, but it can stop the more \u201cautomatic\u201d checking of social media or YouTube that\u2019s hard to catch ourselves doing.\n\nThen between semesters make sure to turn it off completely so that you don\u2019t get in the habit of quickly overriding it and turn it back on the following semester.",

Here\u2019s my advice from an old professor who was an overly perfectionist time waster for far too long:\n\nStart with a time frame of 2x per credit hour of out of class work (e.g. for every 3 credit hour class you are taking, you should be spending 6 hours out of class on it, or 9 hours total. In other words, if you are taking 15 hours, 45 total hours per week in and out of class should be more than enough to complete all of your work). Set timers. Commit yourself to turning in whatever work is done at the end of the timer, even if it\u2019s not your best. Done is better than good. \n\nSet a bed time. Stick to it. It is counterproductive to keep reading and writing past the point of exhaustion.\n\nLearn how to read strategically. You don\u2019t need to read every word of every article and book chapter assigned to you. There is no professor that expects this of you. They expect you to use the readings as a resource you use to get the main point in order to complete the practice exercises and homework. Figure out how to read/scan/read/scan.\n\nIt sounds like you think of \u201cstudying\u201d as reading and writing till I know all the things. That\u2019s not the goal. Turn your studying into discrete and completable tasks. Example: for bio tonight, I will spend 30 minutes making flash cards, 30 minutes reviewing flash cards. \n\nHope this helps. I know it can feel overwhelming. I\u2019ve been there. You deserve to have breaks and rest. Learning should be at least a little bit fun.",

You need to plan your week around it and stick to your schedule. I go to school and work and I never stay up past 10pm in fact I never study past 6pm unless I happen to be in class. Sleeping is super important to retain all that information, and definitively prioritize useful classes from BS you have to do regardless. When I had to do GE I put the bare minimum in GE because I didn't care about that, and focus my time on things related to my major, and that works wonders. I've never gotten a grade lower than B- and it's all because of time management. I started using todoist this semester and it was a life changer for me. I totally recommend it and of course stick to it. Don't just do whatever else otherwise it loses its usefulness",

Only study for 30-45 minutes and then take a 10-15 minute break in between. If you feel burnt out, you probably are. Pack it up and come back to it when you aren\u2019t dead tired. Make time for assignments.\n\nAnd definitely keep in mind that all of this will be easier when you have a solid, repetitive, and predictable sleep schedule.

Unless you want to teach in college for your career, grades are irrelevant to 99% of jobs.\n\nAs for individual assignments, research how grade weighting works, and the point system.

Maybe you're facing it all at once and are super tired by the end of it, maybe you're giving way too much attention to articles that quite frankly aren't that important, or maybe you're just missing a key piece of information that went by quickly during lecture.\n\nScheduling and figuring out a routine that won't destroy your soul is always the best way to figure college out. Sometimes it will still be hard, but knowing what habits are holding you back and what habits are pushing you forward is pretty much the most valuable lesson the experience can possibly give you. Learning how to learn and work is where it's at. The grades are important, but they sorta come second to actually taking that lesson out.\n\nI mean, keep your GPA, but make sure to absorb what you're doing as opposed to just slaving away at it.",
