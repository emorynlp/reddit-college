If it's an abusive situation, you don't have to go home even if you have to leave school. You can live off campus, work your butt off for Starbucks, and go to Az State online for free after you've worked full time for 3 months. My gf did this and it's paying her way thru college. Her paycheck goes to rent and they have school covered.",

What you describe is exactly what I can relate with, so I hope you take confront in knowing that there are other's who know how you feel.\n\nThere are a lot of mental related issues like ADHD, anxiety, and depression that can seriously hinder with your ability to focus and complete tasks. You said you were seeing a psychologist, so I recommend talking over with him your issues with focusing.",
