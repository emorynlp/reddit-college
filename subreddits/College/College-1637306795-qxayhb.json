  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI recently graduated from University and I am now in a position where I can't really get a job because of a lack of experience. My University never encouraged internships, they really made them seem not important. Now I am suffering because of that. I am a first-generation college grad and I didn't have that guidance early on. Is this a common trait of Universities? Do they not care about student success? \n\nIf anyone has advice for me, that would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank You",
