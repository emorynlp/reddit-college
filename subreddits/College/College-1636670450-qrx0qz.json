  "text": "\nIs there an accredited university that would allow me to sign up for an online class, complete it and join another one right away instead of waiting for the next class session? Not sure if this even exists, but figured I\u2019d give it a shot. I\u2019m hoping to get into Computer Science after dropping out of school and working full-time for the past few years.  I\u2019ve tried looking the last few days, but figured I\u2019d ask here.",

      "text": "EdX offers Massive Open Online Courses. They do operate on a schedule but have very frequent start times. You can get actual college credit for the courses, but only from a few universities. \n\nhttps://www.edx.org/credit\n\nI think you\u2019d have to eventually become a more regular student at those universities to complete upper division work. But, I think those schools do have strong online programs.\n\nThat\u2019s the closest I can think of.\n\nLots of universities will offer some courses in more rapid schedules - half of a semester, usually. But again, I think eventually you\u2019ll be stuck taking upper division courses on a full semester schedule.",
