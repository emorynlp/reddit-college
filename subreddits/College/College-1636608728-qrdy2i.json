  "text": "Anybody else feel like they've somehow just been able to BS their way through all of their classes and don't actually know shit about your area of study? Cause I do and I'm about to graduate in Spring. Spent my first 2 years chegging shit and cheating on tests and the last 2 years I've just split up every assignment with a couple friends and anything we can't figure out we just get from somebody else. I don't pay attention in class and basically start studying for exams the night before and I get like 60-70% grades on them that are somehow usually above the class average. During covid the P/F option saved my ass in a number of classes. I have no clue how I have a 3.47 GPA. Terrified of getting technical interviews",

      "text": "Meh, you're in charge of your education. \n\nI'm back at 32 and I definitely can tell that my education is a lot better than my early 20's. My drive and goals are a lot different. I love to learn all the stuff and a strive to do so. It makes me fuckin' smort! \n\nI did that kind of shit in my early days. It doesn't help. It's a rather round about way of shooting yourself in the foot too. If that same kind of behavior follows you into a job, your employers will figure it out pretty quickly and take care of it. I can't count how many people I'd seen hired at places where I was working who claimed they knew the industry and didn't at all. Granted, these were non-diploma positions. The concept remains the same though. \n\nI can't wait for people to ask me technical shit. I'm a mechanical engineering major with 10 years of industry experience. It's why I'm back at school. I love the technical horse shit. My previous experience has led me to view my education this way though. I worked shitty jobs with horrible management in horrible conditions for so long. Now I saved enough money to attend school and get away from that shit. College is a diamond for me. It's going to reduce the physical pain I was experiencing doing the jobs I was doing. I'll finally get to use my fucking brain. \n\nI just got tired of people telling me how smart I was and within the SAME sentence telling me exactly how to do something trivial. Micromanagement is fucking annoying.",
