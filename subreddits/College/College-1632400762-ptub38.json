  "text": " Hi everyone! My name is Yasir and I\u2019m studying to become a UX-designer. I\u2019m currently conducting research in how people spend their money and how they\u2019re saving it. The reason I\u2019m doing this is so that I can get better insight on the matter and get different perspectives other than mine. \n\nI have prepared a couple of questions and would greatly appreciate it if you would take your time in answering them. The survey can take everything from 5 minutes to 15 minutes (or more) depending on how extensive your answers are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to my survey: [https://forms.gle/o5tbBBSyxvDPYGUU7](https://forms.gle/o5tbBBSyxvDPYGUU7)",
