I had to manage my budgeting and sure just like many of you college dependents would definitely help during these times. I have loans to pay a couple months past graduation in May. Stimulus will help that\u2019s for sure.\n\nSo to reiterate, will this apply for me too?",

That amount of cost in neligible compared to the US social net, much less the entire budget.\nAlso the funding of programs hasn't been directly tied to increases in taxation for decades now.

After all, they are the ones who paid the majority (if not all) of taxes last year unless you made more than $12,000.  Even so, the total tax burden would be reduced if they take all they can.  You can negotiate your share, but don't expect $600/$1200/$1400 or whatever unless they are overly generous and willing to give up their fair share.  \n\nAs a parent myself, I would be glad to do that, but open a Roth IRA (or similar) in your name and encourage you to put a few bucks in every month to save for the future.  My kids would have preferred the cash in pocket at first, but after a few years and the past market, they have seen how a few bucks invested can grow.",

If someone still didn't earn enough in 2020, I highly doubt they lived on less than $8400 throughout the year so they still wouldn't qualify as independent (50% rule).",

Nowhere did I suggest that these dependents should have been overlooked (TWICE!). I was talking about **where the money should be sent**. I was not suggesting that the money should not be given out at all.\n\nPer my suggestion, your parents should have qualified as having a dependent (and received money for it).",

You don't have to be a tax dependent to get parent plus loans. The same applies for health insurance, etc.\n\nThe most common situations that I can think of are misfiling your taxes (you pay >50% of expenses but file as dependent), or failing to amend your taxes (your parents file first and claim you as dependent). Many students also don't care about taxes and let their parents do them without reviewing them, which is another mistake.\n\nI don't think we should write laws around misfiling taxes though. It's unfortunate, but filing taxes is an important life skill that independent adults should probably have.",

Not to mention that his first bill included tons of corrupt bailouts that he wanted, it\u2019s not like he really gives a damn.\n\n\n\nIt is insane that people can pump out a bill and not give our representatives time to read it though\u2014 although this is the system conservatives pushed for so they could get more of their corrupt and corporate-invested policies through government in sneaky ways.",

Giving money to people is trickle up not trickle down.\n\nMy point about businesses is that stimulating the economy when the only stores open are big companies and online retailers you are just filling their pockets with cash at the expense of increasing inflation.  If more of that money you give to people can be spent at small businesses it is kept in the community and keeps people employed which improves neighborhoods instead of adding another small percentage to a megacorps bank account for them to use on stock buybacks while the government is handing them loans to stay afloat.\n\nEDIT:Grammar",

Do you file your own taxes? Even if you're a dependent, you should be filing your own taxes (or at least involved in the process if your parents have an accountant).\n\nIf you file as independent for the 2020 tax year, you should be able to recover the $1200 stimulus you weren't qualified for (CARES act) due to your 2019 tax return. There's a form you need to fill out but it should be simple.\n\nI don't think you would have lost out on much other money. If anything, your parents probably got decent tax breaks for having a dependent (until the tax code changed in 2019).",

They always word it in this way that doesn't quite explain how they will implement it specifically. If it amends the previous text, changing $600 to $2000 and adding in adult dependents, then students would be eligible for the full $2000. Otherwise I assume it will just be the $1400.",
