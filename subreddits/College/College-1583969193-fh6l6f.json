Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.\n\nTips:\n\n1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into \"relax\" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.\n\n2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.\n\n3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.\n\n4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.\n\n5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a \"class time\" for yourself can really help.\n\n6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this.\n\nThe best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. \n\nOther considerations:\n\n1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. \n\n2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.\n\n3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.\n\n4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.\n\nI'm sure others can chime in with more suggestions or comments.

That means you do the reading before the class -- because you ALWAYS do the readings amiright ;-) -- and be prepared to ask/answer questions and take notes. \n\nIf you take notes with your laptop (you should do this by hand btw; you'll retain way more information), put the lecture on your phone so you can use your laptop as you normally do. \n\nFind out what method the instructor wants to use for you to contribute. Maybe there will be a discussion forum of some kind online. Take advantage of this! It's an opportunity to talk about what you're learning, which is a great way to actually learn! \n\nAlso, minimize distractions. If other people live with you, make sure they know when you are \"in class.\" They should leave you alone as much as they would leave you alone if you were sitting in the lecture hall.  \n\nIn short, don't take this as a chance to do less.

I personally use google calendar and a desk calendar. this will help you easily be able to map out your week. online classes usually have specific timed deadlines just like your in-person classes do so make sure to detail the times. set up reminders to notify you a day before a homework or paper is due, or if a bigger project is due set reminders up to a week in advance. check your due dates often as they could change due to the transition to online courses. \n4. lastly, just because you have online classes doesn't mean you can surf the web for half of the day while you should be doing your schoolwork. although online classes might make you more inclined to shift over to playing your favorite video game or shopping for clothes during your schoolwork, think of it as you would when you're attending lectures: if you spend your time surfing the web the whole class time, you're going to be completely lost when it comes to exams/quizzes/papers/general content. just as op says in #5, set aside some \"class time\" and the rest of the day  you can do whatever your heart desires. \n\nfrom one student to another, good luck everyone!", "author": "stephbisnette", "created": 1583971994, "upvotes": 145}, "fk98pir": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fh6l6f/some_tips_for_online_classes/fk98pir/", "text": "This is very sensible advice.\n\nIf I might add, as your professors send out information of software you need and instructions you need to follow, don't wait till the last minute to see if it works.\n\nDon't just read the instructions on your phone as if it was a text from a friend.", "author": "PersephoneIsNotHome", "created": 1583971016, "upvotes": 297}}}
