I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*\n\nIn high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.\n\nEdit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.  Once again the purpose of this post was to share how I feel over thinking and elitist culture affects students.", "author": null, "created": 1555233607, "retrieved": 1632947968, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 619, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"ekz754m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bd128e/does_anyone_else_feel_like_some_students_make/ekz754m/", "text": "Funny, my life went the opposite way.

You can have a teacher with all the knowledge in the word but he\u2019s unable to get his message across to students. Some teacher might have a crappy grade policy. So the first thing is get a good teacher. Now when looking up teacher rating on rate my professor or word of mouth if they say a teacher is horrible ask why!\n\nIn my experience so far the teachers who are disliked tend to be the easiest. Often times they have attitudes and can come off as arrogant or narcissistic but they often make their expectations clear. Do this and you get an A and it\u2019s often times the easiest at least for me. \n\nNow teachers with a higher recommendation are usually more fun but you also want to make sure you are learning. So you need to determine what you need from the class. A gpa booster, learning the actual material or getting a gen ed out the way. Then you chose a professor base off that. \n\nShow up to class, most classes just showing up and paying attention alone can get you at least a C+ do homework and don\u2019t procrastinate until last minute. You had a month to write that essay and you decide to wait until the last two day. Why should I feel bad for you?  \n\nGet to know your professors, if you\u2019re friendly with them I generally find that they are more lenient in grading me and they are more likely to write letter. What I usually do is go up to them and ask for advice on something, even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t want their advice on. I feel like a lot of them are often times happy to share advice and they like you more. That\u2019s what I did in Calc II.

During my first time, I made a lot of the mistakes that all college students make. I cut classes, I procrastinated, I didn't do homework, I never studied throughout the term. So of course I was stressed at test time because I had no preparation. I put in all nighters right before tests and projects because I did no preparation and didn't manage my time wisely.\n\nTo me, it seemed like college was hard because I coasted through high school without having to study, manage my time wisely, or do homework, since I was a \"smart\" kid. When it came time for college, I didn't have any of the skills I needed to succeed in that environment.\n\nMy second time around, I had specifically learned how to manage time, how to study for small amounts of time daily and weekly rather than try to do everything right before big tests or deadlines. In contrast to my first college experience: I NEVER pull all-nighters. Though I study almost daily, I'm really only studying a few hours a day. My entire day of work is only around 4-6 hours, compared to an 8 hour job. And I'm getting a 4.0.\n\nPeople think that 4.0 students must be grinding hard in the library, but I swear to you, I have so much free time, I don't often know what to do with it. I don't work in the evenings, and my weekends are always free, and I usually don't start working until 10am each day.\n\nMeanwhile, a student struggling to get a 3.0 will spend hours upon hours in the library wondering why they studied for 20 hours for a test, and are barely passing. It's because they aren't being realistic about how they're spending their time. \n\nFor example a struggling student might spend 10 hours in a library but only like 1 hour doing work, and the other 9 hours messing around on social media or their phone. Whereas a student who knows how to manage their time will spend 3 hours at the library, and all 3 hours of that time completely focused. The 3 hours of focused time is more productive than the 10 hours of unfocused time, and the 4.0 student has 7 more hours of free time than the non-4.0 student.", "author": "peregrin5", "created": 1555284360, "upvotes": 2}, "ekwitpg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bd128e/does_anyone_else_feel_like_some_students_make/ekwitpg/", "text": "Unless you\u2019re like us fellow engineers than you soon realize it\u2019s just a fact of life and get used to it.", "author": "WhitE-TightE", "created": 1555283425, "upvotes": 1}, "ekwi4z9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bd128e/does_anyone_else_feel_like_some_students_make/ekwi4z9/", "text": "I think some of the more \u201celite\u201d colleges can be pretty difficult.
