  "text": "I graduated high school class of 2021 with my hs diploma and my A.A. degree. Essentially I\u2019m a freshman with 60 credits. I\u2019m a very political-esque person. I wanted to major in international affairs since I was literally in 4th grade and its always been my passion but my college doesn\u2019t offer IR anymore.  Anyhow, I was thinking logically and just chose business because I don\u2019t want to be \u201cpoor\u201d post grad. I\u2019m still going to declare poli sci as a minor.  \n\nI declared a Global Business major with a concentration in marketing and the 5 classes I\u2019m taking right now are the last 5 required (pre reqs) class for my major. I absolutey hate it to my fucking core. Tbh, my accounting class really ruins it for the rest of my classes but regardless I am not happy whatsoever. I am not a math person, I do not care for math but I\u2019m still probably going to finish the semester with 4 A\u2019s and 1 C and while it\u2019s okay I just hate C\u2019s. I think I\u2019m trying to convince myself that I can become a math person if need be. \n\nI\u2019m currently interning at a CPA firm and doing accountant work (ironic). I\u2019m doing it basically for the resume because I have absolutely no interest in accounting whatsoever, it\u2019s underpaid and overworked. I\u2019m really just trying to stock up my resume with as many things businessy related as possible so once it does come to graduation all I have to show for isnt just a degree and a mediocre GPA. \n\nHonestly, I have no real view of what I want to do in the future. I bounce between investment banking, intl. marketing consulting, law school \u2014> corporate law, I\u2019m charismatic enough for sales tbh, etc.  \nI think where I\u2019m trying to get with all this is that I am extremely lost and just need some guidance, advice, literally anything because I am so lost with myself. \n\nAny global business grads let me know what you did with your degree and if you\u2019re a math inclined person or if you hated your life like me currently.",

      "text": "If you\u2019ve only got 5 classes left for your major, I\u2019d suggest sticking with it. You can double major if you still have electives to take or you could get some work experience while you figure things out and do grad school later if needed (which is 30 credits for many degrees). Then you\u2019ll still have that global business degree which could always be a resume and knowledge \u201cboost\u201d if you went another route like international politics (since global business would, I\u2019d assume, be very relevant in that field).",
