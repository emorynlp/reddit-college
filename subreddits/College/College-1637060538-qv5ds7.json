  "text": "23, heading to college next fall. I\u2019ve always been pretty good with all the other subjects. I\u2019ve always been terrible at math, which in turn makes me terrible at science. I forgot a lot of the stuff that I did know about math and science. I got a 18 on my ACT.\n17 Math, 17 Science, 20 English, 20 Reading. What do I need to do to prepare, you could basically say I\u2019m starting from scratch that\u2019s how bad I am at math now.",

The problems I see from students just coming in tend to be with exponents, logarithms and trig functions.  Beyond that, it's a case of people rushing and missing small things.",

      "text": "The best thing you can do for yourself in math is make sure that all your foundational skills are in place. No doubt you\u2019ve heard \u201cmath builds on itself,\u201d and that is absolutely true (although not in quite the linear way that it\u2019s often said). \n\nGet on Khan Academy ASAP and go all the way back to the beginning (the beginning-beginning, I mean it). You\u2019ll fly through material at first and that\u2019s great, but the instant you\u2019re not clear on WHY a problem works, never mind the *how*, that\u2019s when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos. Pay particular attention to fractions, division/grouping, and all that middle school math-as-language material - it\u2019ll be reinforced hard in Algebra II. Once that\u2019s solid, you can start working through HS courses. \n\nThis WILL be time-consuming, but twenty minutes a day, every day, is better than long cram sessions. KA does a good job of breaking large concepts down into bite-size skills and helping you diagnose weaknesses. You can, of course, get a tutor who will help you simultaneously with any current classwork as well guiding the finding-and-filling-foundational-holes process (shameless advertising: hi, \u201cfixing\u201d adult learners is literally my specialty and yes I am taking new clients), but that can get expensive long-term and the KA route works as well. Best of luck!",

The highest class I need to take for my major is Calc. \nI tried helping my sister with a multiplication problem (4th grade) and she tried showing me some turtle method or something and I didn\u2019t understand and I didn\u2019t remember how I used to do it. Like when I saw I\u2019m bad I\u2019m BAD. \nI know how to multiply numbers and all the roots of the multiplication table because it was something I could always remember.

      "text": "I think your best bet will be preparing your discipline. Discipline will get you through college. \n\nI came back after a long period away and I haven't had any issue getting right back into it. I was always good at math and science though. \n\nDepending on the major you're going into, it can be pretty basic. There will be tutors available on campus as well. \n\nHonestly though, what will make you successful is doing every single assignment and practice problem the professor suggests. Failing is super easy once you stop going to class and doing the assignments.",

Glad I learned it, but my teachers always did my problems for me during school If I couldn\u2019t figure it out. At the time I thought it was amazing. Now I regret them ever doing even one problem for me :(",
