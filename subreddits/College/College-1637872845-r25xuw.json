  "text": "Hi! I would like to share some of my notes mostly about the Law of the Land, parts of it taken from the Civil Code of the Philippines. I also want to humbly request your help via using your student accounts in Studypool to view my document. I had to stop attending school due to some serious financial problem and I do hope that the funds I raised by sharing my notes would help me reach my dream of finishing my degree.\n\nHere are the links of my documents:\n\n[Extinguishment of Contract of Sale](https://www.studypool.com/services/6116858)\n[Obligations of the Vendor - Practice Activity](https://www.studypool.com/services/6116874)\n[Obligations of the Vendor](https://www.studypool.com/services/6116877)\n[Dogmatic Constitution](https://www.studypool.com/services/6117100)\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.\nReally really highly appreciated.\nMay God bless your kind soul \u2764",
