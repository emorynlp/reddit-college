  "text": "Bro what do you want me to say to you that you can\u2019t already read on the millions of post with the exact same title. This subreddit is pure \u201cI\u2019m a freshmen, been at college for 12 hours and haven\u2019t found a life long friendship yet. This is making me depressed, help?\u201d I understand the pandemic made almost every facet of life harder, but if you want to make friends - college is probably the easiest place to do it. Put yourselves out there and take yourselves out of your comfort zones. No ones going to seek you out, you have to look for opportunities. They\u2019re everywhere. The next \u201cno friends\u201d post I see will make me unsub. It\u2019s getting ridiculous.",
