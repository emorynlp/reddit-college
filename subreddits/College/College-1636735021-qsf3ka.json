This subreddit is pure \u201cI\u2019m a freshmen, been at college for 12 hours and haven\u2019t found a life long friendship yet. This is making me depressed, help?\u201d I understand the pandemic made almost every facet of life harder, but if you want to make friends - college is probably the easiest place to do it. Put yourselves out there and take yourselves out of your comfort zones. No ones going to seek you out, you have to look for opportunities. They\u2019re everywhere. The next \u201cno friends\u201d post I see will make me unsub. It\u2019s getting ridiculous.",

      "text": "Well then call yourself lucky brother. I, and probably a lot of other people here, suffer from social anxiety, which makes it terrifying and incredibly hard to introduce yourself to others and talk to others. It is usually caused by past trauma, which is what I experienced. People have bullied me and ditched me in the past, and it made a really negative impact on my mental health and social life. I know what you are probably thinking though, \u201cjust stop being a pussy and talk to people,\u201d but if you spent a day in my shoes, you might change your mind. I am not angry at you. You are free to say whatever you want, but just be mindful of others, because they don\u2019t live the same life you do. \n\nIf anyone wants someone to talk to about literally anything, from how your day was, to an assignment you are stressed out about, or if you just want someone to vent to about something, please feel free to message me. Feeling like you are alone in the world is one of the worst feelings, and talking with someone can really help. I hope whoever is reading this is doing well \u270c\ud83c\udffc",
