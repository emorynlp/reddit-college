There's a lot of pressure around me to go into a STEM field since this is a school with a lot of pre-med students, and I've been getting a whole bunch of imposter syndrome because of it. History is what I really enjoy but it feels like everything around me is telling me that it's useless and I might as well get a chemistry degree because that's what gets you a job right out of college. Can anybody give their experience just to help out?", "author": "Gayvion", "created": 1632757080, "retrieved": 1632945541, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hehg1ge": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwjorg/is_a_history_degree_really_worth_it/hehg1ge/", "text": "Archaeologist here. With history, it depends on the specific time period, but you would have to get at least a Masters degree to work in academia. If you feel comfortable with that, go for it! You can write books, teach, do archival work with historical societies or museums, work with historical site preservation and education, become a librarian with a little extra school (it's way more fun than it sounds). What do you envision yourself doing as a career?", "author": "DontFeartheTeacher", "created": 1632757942, "upvotes": 6}}}
