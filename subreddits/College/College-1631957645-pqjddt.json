  "text": "I have 6 weeks left for uni to end and will be leaving the town in 8 weeks. After almost 4.5 years of uni, I regret making very little goodvfriends here. Most people are just acquaintances not friends. I did not join clubs/societies/events. I have some good friends outside uni, but the fact i was quite inactive and antisocial in uni is really eating me up (though did well academically). What hurts me more is that i spent a good amount of time alone, stoning, reading, watching, learning etc rather than socializing more (i am quite introverted). I know I cant get the time back and I did enjoy my experience here, but the things I did not do are really eating me up, as I feel i failed to leave a \"legacy\" or a \"mark\" on the uni experience itself..\n\nDid I \"waste\" my college experience by not getting more involved?",
