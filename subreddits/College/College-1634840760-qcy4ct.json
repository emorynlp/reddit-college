  "title:": "Why do professors make us have to work publicly?",
  "text": "Title wording is weird, I apologize. What I mean is do things like group work for subjects/units that really don't need it, or making us work on something then answer out loud. I understand the thought behind it is to better our understanding by practicing what we just learned, but I cannot grasp the material that easily nor quickly. I need time to go over it, use other resources, etc, and having to make my lack of knowledge clear to a group or the entire class feels absolutely humiliating. Even when I get things right, it fills me with such anxiety and dread that I sorta go into survival mode and can't absorb anything else for a while. I'd be fine with working alone and turning something at the end of class, because at least then only my prof sees my gibberish and I can show that I tried, but it's embarrassing to do so with the entire class. \n\nI don't know what it is, but it gets to be too much. I'm taking a 0 for a quiz I felt like I could have done well on because I had a breakdown just thinking about going in and having to do that today. (1. It's the type of class where I can't just leave after the quiz. 2. Even if it was, I'd be driving an hour there and an hour back just to take a quiz for ten minutes. 3. The prof allows a couple drops, so this will be one of them.) I wish I could talk to my prof and ask to not to participate, but that'd be nearly as noticeable. I just wish it wasn't so all or nothing.",

Ik that isn't a get out of jail free card for anything and everything, but I get so much more stress than I do any sort of help by working in groups, esp with people I barely know. I understand it has a place in learning, but this class does it every single day and it's too draining. Every once and a while, even every other day would be fine or at least better, but every day is excessive considering the subject imo",

It's possible that you may have some unresolved self-esteem issues and a fear of exposure. These are normal feelings and can be very helpful tools in your emotional toolbox.\n\nIt doesn't simply have a place in learning, these situations are the rule, not the exception, in adult society and learning how to manage them in college, when no body really cares or judges you is the best environment for them.",

                  "text": "Look dude, you don't know me. There's a lot of reasons I am semi self diagnosing myself with autism, and it's not just because I'm socially awkward/anxious or an introvert. I don't have to explain my whole life story, but know I've done a lot of serious research and legit didn't want to be autistic, but I couldn't deny any longer that I am \u2014 or am something very similar, but definitely neurodivergent and not in a potentially temporary way like depression/anxiety. I'm definitely not \"resorting to self diagnosis\" because I \"feel awkward\" sometimes. \n\nThere's many ways to learn. Not everything needs to be in a social way all the time, especially when it isn't natural. Saying one type of learning is the best is cool and all, but any teaching/studying method's effectiveness greatly depends on the execution, to which I feel like is lacking in this particular class. \n\nReally, all I'd like is a readily available alternative and/or not have mandatory group learning so frequently. In the end, this is hurting my education in this class more than it is helping, which defeats the purpose. I also know I'm not the only one in my class that feels this way. \n\nAnyway, respond if you like, you clearly disagree and don't account/care for neurodivergence and I won't bother typing another comment. For me, this type of learning is often like trying to fit a square peg into a circle hole, and I just want my prof to not rely on it so much so that others and I can actually be in class and learn as much as possible.",
