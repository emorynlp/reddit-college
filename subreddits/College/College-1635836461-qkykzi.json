      "text": "I'm not going to give medical advice, but just from experience I would say that it's possible you've been spending too much time on your computer/phone. I had periods of shoulder/neck pain where it would be very straining to even look downwards, and it can happen if you spend too much time looking down at your phone. And obviously the eye strain can come from looking at a screen too long. If possible, get blue light filter glasses or a screen filter for your laptop. I would also recommend getting your eyes checked for a regular checkup, just to make sure everything's okay. If possible, it's always best to just see your doctor and get it checked out. Hope you feel better soon.",
