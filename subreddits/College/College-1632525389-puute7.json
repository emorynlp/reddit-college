I come from a country where calling someone older than you by their name is frankly, pretty frowned upon. I mean the \"sir/ma'am\" as a respect because that's what I have grown up with since I was literally 0 y/o. In addition, I am in the region of the USA where ma'am/sir is generally not frowned upon. In addition, most if not all of the professors I have worked with are from the same or similar culture so it works out for us. \n\n\nI have met quite a few professors who are _very_ chill - call me by my first name types. It took a long long long time to get in line with that, and I reflexively still call them Sir/ma'am/professor or a variation of that because they're educators and leaders of the world - they are metaphorical Gods to me (and people in my culture). They spread knowledge. Nothing more noble and cooler than that. But if someone is super anal about only being referred to as doctor, it's kinda a buzzkill.",

She talked about some academic function where she was not called by \"Dr\" and I can understand why one'd be pissed about not getting the context dependent respect. \n\n\nTo conclude, I'd prefer to not paint with broad, sweeping strokes. Some women with PhDs like to be called Doctor, some don't, and some don't give a shit.

      "text": "For those who don't know, there's a tradition at a dissertation defense (the last step before you earn your Ph.D.). Though it's already been decided by your committee that you've passed, there is still a public defense, after which your committee retires to another room to pretend to make the already made decision. _The one word your dissertation advisor says when the committee comes back out_, in front of other faculty, other students, your friends, and your parents is: \"Doctor\".\n\nYou don't f with that title. \n\nTo qualify OP's excellent advice, the professor title is traditionally specific to professors, which many people with doctorates aren't, or aren't yet. (For example, it's common to take a \"postdoc\" position before you become faculty as an assistant professor.) There's reasonable debate about whether you should first address, say, someone with the job title \"lecturer\" as professor or doctor, but others' advice stands: start with the formal title until encouraged by the person to use something like a first name.\n\nAbout that, when I taught a class once, I -- who don't hold a doctorate -- made a point the first day to ask my students to call me by my first name or Mr., not as professor or doctor. I'd seen what it takes to earn those titles, and I wasn't going to imply I had.",

I prefer the latter, but I know others without doctorates who think, reasonably, \"I don't have a Ph.D., but 'Miss' seems almost as informal as a first name. I'm in the front of a college classroom, they should call me professor.\"\n\nFwiw, my preference comes in part because I've dealt with people before who misrepresented their positions. They'd be an industry person teaching one semester but be like \"John Smith, Professor, University of...\" but the standalone big-P title of Professor is a bfd. That's someone who's gone from doctorate to postdoc to assistant professor to associate professor without tenure to associate professor with tenure to full professor. They have a guaranteed job and have a voting (or more) role in school governance. So I try to avoid professor if it's not the job title just because I've seen it abused.",

And also lead researcher. \n\nBeing an adult doesn't mean you can do as you will and not face consequences. \n\nYeah your paying the university doesn't make you entitled to anything other than attending class. Being entitled is quite literally the problem in this situation.",

Are you an international student?\n\nAustralia has an informal, or reverse-formality, culture. Basically, you show respect to someone by demonstrating that you are equals, and that neither is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. You must always be very humble. If you call a lecturer by a title like Dr or Prof then you are singling them out and putting them on a pedestal, where they do not want to be. Using a title could actually be taken as an *insult* because you could be suggesting that they\u2019re arrogant or uppity. Even the Prime Minister and other politicians go by their first name to the public.\n\nPeople preferring to be called by the title, in any area of society, are rare. Generally, they are foreigners or people who spent a lot of time overseas for their academic training. You should use the name people sign off their emails with, even if that is a nickname.\n\nI do remember one poor sod called a lecturer by their title and last name in a lecture in first year. Everyone in the room felt embarrassed for them. It\u2019s kinda like calling the lecturer \u201cmum\u201d. The lecturer just politely asked that he never call someone by their title again, and that first names should be used.\n\nEdit: doing it once as a first year is just a funny slip-up, like raising your hand to ask to go to the bathroom. People will be forgiving if you do it early on by accident. It becomes rude/weird if you continue doing it. These are things children do in school, they\u2019re not things adults do. So calling your lecturers Ms/Mr will be seen as childish.",

In this unit, I learned that we should address people with a Sir/Madam when writing formal emails. For example, Dear Sir/Madam. If it helps, I go to Monash Uni.\n\nI completely understand your point; hence why I refer to my lecturers/tutors in person with their first names but I always do refer to them with Mr/Ms./or their title when writing formal emails and I have never been told to not use their titles.\n\nWould you also say that this really depends on the culture of the lecturers/tutors as well? Because the lecturers/tutors might be foreign and hence despite them teaching in Australia, they might prefer being called by their titles/Mr/Ms. (since they might be unaware about the \"reverse-formality\" culture)\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what's your PhD about?",

Academia has no idea how anything works in industry, so they are the *least* qualified people to be telling you how to act. You **do not** refer to people by their titles in industry. It **is not** polite, it\u2019s weird. \n\nAnd even worse, you\u2019re not writing emails in a formal, industry sense! You\u2019re writing casual emails in the academic sense! So nothing you were taught is relevant, and you **have** to stop using people\u2019s titles. You refer to them in email the same way you would in person, and the fact that you call them by their first name means you **must** use their first name by email too. \n\nIf they were foreign and preferred to be called by a title then they would demand that title at all times in person. You would have never gotten away with using their first name. If you have not been corrected using their first name then that is the polite form of address. If they have signed their emails with their first name then they have indicated what name they would like you to use, You have been exceedingly *impolite* by insisting on titles.

The *only* situation where it could be justified is when you\u2019re applying to a job, but even then you must not use sir/madam because you don\u2019t know if the person is non-binary.

If you go to Hofstede's cultural dimension page ([here](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/)), you can see NZ is very low in Power Distancing, and USA is in the medium range.\n\nIn Japan, where Power Distancing is very high, addressing people can be very strict. Even if you're addressing a coworker who has seniority over you, you'd call them senpai (Like in the Animes). English doesn't even have a translation for \"Senpai\". Sen means formal/older, pai kind means generation. Senpai basically means someone who have seniority over you.\n\nIn Japan, if you call a professor by first name, then you'd really offend the person.",
