  "text": "I'm going to a California State University, it's a really good school but not as well known as other CSU's or other universities.\n\nThis is basically a question for people who graduated. Did the name brand of the college you go to matter for grad school or applying to jobs? What do people consider to decide what makes a college a good one?\n\nI'm in my fourth year of college and having a quarter life crises :)",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t graduate, but I\u2019m speaking based on general knowledge and what I\u2019ve learned from others. \n\nMost employers don\u2019t care what school you went to. In fact, they care more about qualifications and experience than the degree itself. Some cases where your schooling may matter or give you an edge is as for lawyers, doctors, etc.\n\nEven with graduate schools, only more prestigious programs may put more emphasis on it, but even then it doesn\u2019t determine whether you\u2019ll make it in or not.\n\nYou just want to make sure you went to an accredited school for your degree to be recognized.",

      "text": "I haven't been as wide in applying for jobs, but in my experience, as long as it's an accredited university, jobs won't care where you went to school. The only arguable benefit for some school names is if you were to go somewhere with a wide alumni network in the region, where you can use that to get plugged in for more opportunities, but that's as much about who you know than *where* you went.\n\n\nFor graduate schools, where you go matters very little. Admissions departments are far more interested in what you did for undergrad. So, it's good to go somewhere that gives you some opportunities for research or experience, but you don't need to be in a top program to get into grad school.",

      "text": "Of course it matters!  Do you honestly believe that all employers view all undergraduate colleges the same?  There is a reason schools are ranked.  You won't even be considered for better jobs if you went to a poorly ranked institution. \n\nDr. Grandpa",
