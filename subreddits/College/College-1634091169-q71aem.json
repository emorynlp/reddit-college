My TA gave me a 0 but did give me the option of redoing the assignment in 24 hours. \n\nI am apparently at risk of getting reported to the university. My grade dropped a horrific amount. I\u2019m pretty much being called a liar and a cheat. \n\nHappened to anyone else? I literally cried when my TA told me. This is my 3rd year at college and nothing like this has ever happened to me.",

There's a huge difference between it saying that 65% is plagiarized, but from 50 different sources vs. 65% plagiarized from one or two sources. One is legitimate plagiarism, the other is likely a mistake made by TurnItIn. TurnItIn will literally flag your citations and properly cited quotes. It will also often flag common phrases. It's a very simple software and doesn't know how to check for anything other than \"does this match?\"\n\nEdit: Since you turned it in to TurnItIn, you should be able to view the report somewhere. It's usually where you submitted it, or under the grades section of Canvas/Blackboard.",

Chances are your TA is an overworked grad student who didn't fully look at your lab report. Email a copy of the exact file you uploaded to turnitin to both your TA and your professor and explain the situation fully. You may also want to reach out to your university's writing lab for advice.\n\nI know this is stressful, but just remember that you didn't do anything wrong. You may also want to ask your TA to show you the specific parts that are plagiarized. It may just be a coincidence, or something slightly off in your citations. Hopefully this will resolve any confusion. If they still push the issue, and cannot prove that you plagiarized, then you can and should go to your administration. At that point you are completely in the right, and have university policy on your side.\n\nI see this issue happen more often than you would think. It is usually resolved pretty smoothly",

It will also flag works cited if someone else used the same sources, and if you had to turn in any kind of rough draft, it will say you plagiarized yourself. Not to mention you said you\u2019re in an intro level lab, so that\u2019s likely a big class using the same sources to write about the same general topics.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, OP, it sounds super stressful. There\u2019s some great advice on this thread, hopefully it\u2019ll help. Good luck!",

It's quite possible to have a high score like that if you added stuff like the problem statements or questions in your lab report.\n\nWhy did you cry? You didn't steal anything as you have mentioned. Is someone actually accusing you of cheating or are you just making that assumption?\n\nJust take this one as a loss and re-do it. Then sit down with the professor and go through the essay to identify what the issue was with this one. If it was an error by the TA, I would ask for the lab re-do to count as extra credit and not an assignment.",

              "text": "Okay, honestly I am surprised at the reaction to this comment. Doesn't seem to be the main view. Maybe some people are not reading the original post between the times.\n\nOP hasn't told any of us he was accused of cheating. They were just told to re-do the assignment without an explanation. It's not healthy to jump to assuming the worst possible outcome when the chances of that are very low in a specific case. It's much more likely that OP has similar text in the paper. It is a lab report, after all, so there will be shared prompts and formatting.\n\nThe TA offered to re-grade the assignment if the \"issue\" was fixed, so it is *highly* unlikely anything serious is going to happen here. I would bet $100 on it. I have had scary moments too but a lot of them turn into nothing when you sit down and go through the logic of it instead of just worrying without thinking critically about the situation. Validating OP's assumption it was about cheating is only going to make them more anxious.",
