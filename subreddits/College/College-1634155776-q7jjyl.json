      "text": "If I\u2019m understanding this correctly, are you trying to only accept part of your loan? Cause based off the type of loan, you may have to accept the full amount for the whole year. I\u2019m graduating this fall and tried to accept only the fall semester loan but it said I had to accept it all. I called the school and they were able to sort it out for me in a way that I could get the whole amount for the one semester I needed. If you can\u2019t get a hold of them, send an email and then call early tomorrow.",
