  "title:": "Can I paraphrase an article?",
  "text": "I have some articles open on the topic my essay is on. They have all paraphrased from an original book that says dates (1965) or (1974) for example. Can I paraphrase what im reading from the article or do I need to find the book and read what they paraphrased originally and do the same? I am in 1st year so this isn't like im doing a serious research I don't want to get done for plagiarism. It would be a lot easier to paraphrase the article than trying to hunt down original book and find the pages.",

      "text": "First ask yourself if the information you want to paraphrase is supporting your own point or if it\u2019s making the point for you (the second option indicates a lack of independent thought and may tank your score depending on the assignment).\n\nIf it\u2019s the former paraphrase the original book. Paraphrasing another author\u2019s paraphrase comes with a whole host of issues (it\u2019s sort of like a game of academic telephone). Ask a librarian to help you look for the original source. \n \nBe sure to explicitly indicate that what you are paraphrasing is another author\u2019s ideas. Use a citation and a prefatory remark like \u201cAs author\u2019s name has discussed,\u201d or \u201cAccording to author\u2019s name.\u201d",
