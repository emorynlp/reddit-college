  "text": " \n\nI am terrified of starting over again at 23. I just see my friends finishing their degrees I have just realized what I want from myself(engineering) and have started preparing myself for an entrance exam here in Europe.  \nWill I have issues with employment or any academic halts due to my late age?\n\nWill there be issues for scholarships or hell even dating, making friends or even going to clubs?\n\nI am getting nervous just thinking about it...",

The downside of being an older student is not necessarily that you\u2019ll lack opportunities when you get out since you will still be in your twenties. Same goes for making friends and dating, although I wouldn\u2019t be too eager to hit on freshmen if I were you, since the maturity gap is significant for 18 year olds and 23 year olds. The downside of being an older student is that it\u2019s harder to be a 25 year old student and have little to no income than it is to be a 19 year old in the same situation. As long as you can deal with that, I think you\u2019ll be ok.",

Better to be one then say \"I could have.\" Nonetheless time will go on, no matter what you choose, its about how you choose to use the time that determines your success and happiness.",
