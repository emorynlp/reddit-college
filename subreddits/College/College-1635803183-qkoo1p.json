  "text": "I\u2019m gay first off. So today some guy I\u2019ve never seen in class showed up. I talked to him for a couple minutes and found out which high school he went to. After class I asked for his snap then dipped out cause I was nervous lmao. Idk if he likes guys but should I just message him and ask straight up or is there another route I should take? He\u2019s %100 my type which isn\u2019t the stereotypical gay \u201ctype\u201d so it makes it hard to know if he could even possibly be into guys unless I straight up ask. During break time me and my friend walked out to my car for a second and he kinda followed us, that\u2019s where the very short conversation we had started. We may or may not have locked eyes a few times in class, I genuinely don\u2019t know. I was hungover af, just got off a 12 hour night shift, and tired so I really don\u2019t fucking know lmao",
