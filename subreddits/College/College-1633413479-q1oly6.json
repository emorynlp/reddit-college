  "title:": "Should I withdraw from my class?",
  "text": "This semester, I am taking a Math class that is mostly lecture and quizzes, with no homework being assigned by the teacher. Due to this lack of practice, I ended up doing poorly on the most recent exam, and because of how the course is graded, it is virtually impossible for me to get an A in this class. At this point in time, I have contacted the Department Head, but he said that he won't make any changes to the course, and there isn't any makeup work or extra credit as far as I am aware. \n\nIn order for me to at least get a C for the class, I need to get a 60% on the next two exams, and 81% for a B. For context, I have a 4.0 GPA, so this class would inevitably drop my GPA regardless of the grade. While I am not absolutely dead set on keeping a 4.0, I am slightly nervous about my chances of getting a C with my current score, especially since I would essentially be studying and practicing the course without guidance from the instructor, only his lectures.\n\nUltimately, I have surmised two solutions. My first option is to keep the class this semester and study my butt off to try and at least get a C, preferably a B. My other option is to withdraw from the class this semester and to take it next semester, where I would have a higher chance of succeeding in the class and an opportunity at getting an A for the course. Ultimately, the decision comes down to which is better on a transcript: a C or a W? \n\nI would appreciate any input for this situation, and hopefully you all will be able to help me come to a decision. \n\nTl;Dr: 4.0 GPA student can only get at most a B for a Math Class. Is it better to stick with the class for at least a C, or drop it now and take it next semester for a higher chance of success?",

      "text": "I think it sounds better to stick with the class as is. Withdrawing is usually the last resort, suggesting there was a strong chance you'd fail the course with a D or F.\n\nRealistically, a W on a transcript, and even any grade below an A, is treated with subjectivity. It's what you make it. In particular, a W isn't something that usually stands out unless getting them is a habit rather than a rare occurrence.",
