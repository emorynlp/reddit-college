  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m a junior currently preparing to apply for summer 2022 internships. I\u2019ve recently made a switch to digital marketing to business analytics which I hope to pursue for my next internship. \n\nHowever, no matter how much work I put into learning SQL, tableau, data analysis and all that other stuff, I still feel severely under-qualified. My anxiety and low self esteem is stopping me from applying, preparing my cover letters, resume. and such. \n\nHow do I stop this feeling which keeps me from achieving my goals? I appreciate any advice.",
