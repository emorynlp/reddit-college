  "text": "I went to college for about two years in GA before I moved to MT, and I was going to continue school, but decided against it. Ive been offered an opportunity to go back to school, but I\u2019m struggling to decide if I should. I would love to go back for a bachelors in art history, but I\u2019m very nervous to actually do it. Any help and advice about if going back to school is a good idea would be great! Thank y\u2019all so much",
