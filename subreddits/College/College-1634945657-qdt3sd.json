  "text": "I had an assignment where I had to write a short description paragraph about an old painting. Part of the assignemnt was the cite the painting (did not need to be MLA or APA) and I forgot to do that and can't resubmit. So i will obviously lose marks for that, but do you think there's a chance i get in trouble? They obviously really stress not to plagiarize your work in college, but i wasn't writing an important paper, and i dont think i techically took anybody's ideas or anything like that, as far as i can tell. Could i get in trouble for this? (Ontario, Canada)",

I've never had a professor who wouldn't reopen an assignment link or allow us to email it to them if the system was set to only allow one submission and we emailed them saying we made a mistake and need to resubmit.\n\nBut honestly, on such q small assignment it's probably not as big a deal as you are worrying about. Worst case scenario, you send the email to the prof, he says he won't accept the second submission, and you grade takes a bit of a hit. I think any kind of serious plagiarism issues would come out of something like this, especially in what I assume is a freshman level course.\n\nIn your case, send an email to the professor saying you forgot the citation, ask if you can resubmit the assignment. At the very least, write the citation at the end of the email but if it's close to the deadline also attach the new submission to the email.\n\nI'd write something like this. (And be prepared for the prof to ask you to resubmit online if he opens the link again)\n\nDear Professor,\n\nI realized that I forgot to attach my citation to my paragraph. [Website_name] only allows one attempt though so it's not allowing me to fix it. \n\nPlease accept the attached revised assignment.\n\nThank you,\nYour_name\n\n[Attach document]",

It's a 150 word paragraph that i wrote in like 30 min lol i guess just because it seems insignificant to me doesn't mean it it's insignificant to them, but idk. And yeah it's freshmen level, this is my second month. I only started to worry when i saw the other comments here, and i am still worried tbh.",
