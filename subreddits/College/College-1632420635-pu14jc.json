I'm a sophomore in college. I like to workout, drink boba, foodie and go on adventures. Let me know if you want to be friends because I can relate to your post alot. During my freshman year because of covid I want to live on campus for the spring 2021 semester and my mental health was not doing good to the point I had to get a therapist. I had my own room, I wasn't making any friends and sleeping all day. I made one friend  in my freshman year but sometimes I wished to make more but the people who I go to school with I  just don't vibe with them. But I'm open to making new friends so let me know if you want to be friends and if so we can exchange our Instagrams names.", "author": "No_Regular7274", "created": 1632455459, "upvotes": 1}, "he1l99v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu14jc/please_help_please/he1l99v/", "text": "You\u2019ve already invested too much time and resources. Don\u2019t quit, just commit to graduating.\n\nAt the end of the day, college is only going to be a couple years of your life. Once you graduate, you\u2019ll have your whole life to meet new friends and have new experiences. \n\nI\u2019m already missing out my first year of college because I chose to go to community college. I sacrificed living away from home, party hopping, and meeting new people. I mean, I could\u2019ve attended a four year but I had to chose financial freedom over more debt. And yes, while it\u2019s sad I\u2019m stuck in a place I hate, I\u2019m motivated by getting out of here in two years.\n\nYou should do the same. In the mean time, why not reach out to people in your community? You\u2019d be surprised how easily you can meet new people and experience new things once you start putting yourself out there. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with doing things by yourself in the meantime.
