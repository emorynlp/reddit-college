  "text": "So I wanted to cancel my housing agreement for the second semester and sent an email to housing asking a few questions. They said that just wanting to cancel/commute isn\u2019t a good enough reason to leave. I have to either be graduating, interning, leaving, or be on leave of absence. I\u2019ll have to pay the full cost of room and board, am I the only one who thinks this is fucking dumb? What do I have to do? Get my therapist to sign something and say because of mental health? Should I withdraw and go to a different college for a semester and transfer back?\n\n\nEdit: They didn\u2019t give me financial aid, only a small scholarship. Would it be possible to say I can\u2019t afford it and them allow me to go? Or would they just add it to the loan? Financially we aren\u2019t struggling as much cause my mom got another job after she retired to help me out and my dad still works, but on the FASFA it shows that we have a lower income.",
