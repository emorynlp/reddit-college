I have my phone read my text book to me while I work, also try to get as much work doing class as possible. It sucks you can\u2019t fully focus on school, so at least for me that means lower grades than I would like but they\u2019re still A\u2019s/B\u2019s. Also don\u2019t be afraid to call into work every now and again so you can catch up. Another big tip is nail down your time management so you get at least 1 day off a week from school/work, and please don\u2019t forget to hang out with friends. Socializing is so important for your mental health! Good luck you got this!

The trick is to either work an early morning shift and study afterwards, or work evenings and wake up early to study. When I worked 6-2:30 or 7-3:30 I work study afterwards or when I had evenings 1:30-10:00 or 2:30-11 I would wake up early to study for a few hours before going to work then I come home and sleep.\n\nI have at least three days I do not go to work, Monday tuesday, and thursday. It is important to have a day you don't do school or work, which for me is monday.
