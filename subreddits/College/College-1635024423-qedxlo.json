  "text": "I graduated with a B.A in English and German from a European university several years ago. I now work in finance in the USA and I am trying to up-skill. I am interested in Economics, and finance -financial analysis specifically. Of course I have no educational background in either of these. From what I understand I probably need to take the GRE.\nAre these both very heavy in Math?\n\nI\u2019d love to know if there are any resources like a career counsellor that I could go to. Do I need to do pre requisite classes? In Europe I could do a higher diploma (hdip) - a 1 yr programme which is at a B.A level for graduates who want to change careers. Afterwards you can apply to a Masters programme and complete it in 1yr. But I can\u2019t find any information on any similar programmes in the states. Is a Hdip something that would be recognised here or am I better off pursuing programmes offered in the USA and trying to get directly into a Masters programme here?\n\nI know I have a lot of questions and I hope I posted this in the correct group. Any useful info you can offer is greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "I'm an American getting a graduate degree in something completely different than what I studied in undergrad, so I think I may be of some help.\n\nMy advice is to look at specific master's programs you're interested in and see what the prerequisites are. Once you know what those prerequisites are, you can take them at a college or university. Many schools will let you take a few classes as a non-matriculated (non-degree seeking) student.\n\nOnce you have the prerequisites, then it's possible you'll need to take the GRE, but it's been falling out of favor lately, so there's a reasonable chance you won't need to take it. Then you apply to the master's program and get accepted somewhere and you're good.\n\nThere are also some master's programs that will accept students without the required prerequisites. They have what are called \"bridge\" programs, in that they accept you under the expectation/assumption that you take the prerequisites as soon as you enter the program. You may also want to look into this option. \n\n> Is a Hdip something that would be recognised here or am I better off pursuing programmes offered in the USA and trying to get directly into a Masters programme here?\n\nI have no idea if Hdip would be recognized here, but as a whole, our entire education system is well set up for career changers (relative to other countries). All grad programs want to see, typically, is that you've fulfilled certain prerequisite courses (usually they will list these courses on their websites) and that can be done by just knocking them out at any local college. \n\nOf course, it's highly unlikely you'd be able to get to any particularly competitive schools as a career shifter, but for most master's programs there are a ton of good schools that will accept anyone who qualifies, since master's students tend to be a big income stream for them.",
