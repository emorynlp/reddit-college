  "text": "First of all sorry for my english i\u2019m french\n\nSo i\u2019m 17 and into college i\u2019m a business and m\u00e9nagement student, I\u2019ve always seen tiktoks about business students vs engineers students and business students are always described as students that do nothing, i don\u2019t know if degress are different from country to country but i\u2019m really having a hard time I do almost 3 breakdowns everyday because I work hard for minimum 4 hours and at the end I have the impression that I did nothing because I always work on only 2 school subjects maximum while I have seven subjects, I want to be more productive and work on more then 2 subjects a day but for example in math I\u2019m really slow at understanding concepts and in statistics too I have quizzes almost every 2 to 3 weeks I passed my mid-term exams 3 weeks ago and in the first two weeks of January I have my final exams (of the first semester)I don\u2019t even have proper holidays I need a break I will pass my Christmas holidays studying I don\u2019t have time for myself or get professional help, do you guys have some advice? I want to be efficient in studying work on 2+ subjects and at the same time keep my mental health stable. I feel overwhelmed.",
