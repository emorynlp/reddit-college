  "title:": "How can I get straight A grades in college and do more better in school???",
  "text": "Hello everyone, I am about to be a junior in college and I am thinking about doing a double major in finance and business management because these courses overlap together. I don't know for sure if I have a learning disability or a low IQ because I don't know what to do next because I wanted to get a master's degree in finance or to get into a top MBA or something. I am currently struggling a bit with trying to get good grades in college because I keep procrastinating and not performing the best to my ability in school. It's like I keep being lazy and procrastinating. I wanted to know how I can perform the best in my next two years of college as that I currently have a 2.7 as of right now and I am thinking of trying my hardest. At times, I also struggle with paying attention and remembering information sometimes and I just wanted to concentrate as well. Is there any effective studying techniques that you can help with and any type tips?? I have currently taken a semester off from college and I am working but I STRONGLY need to think about my actions and how to get straight A grades from now on. I know it's possible because there's many different variables and factors that are being considered. Someone please help me??\n\n\nEdit: Students with a GPA of 3.8-4.0, what did you do to get nearly straight A grades? What was your strategies and tips and how can I change my life completely??",

      "text": "The other commenter is right about projects/working part time being very important and possibly financially smarter for you if you aren't going to be able to qualify for a scholarship, however I would say getting up today least a 3.0 by the time you graduate is important.\n\nBut to answer your question more directly, what worked for me (as an engineering student) was a few things:\n1) Find a study group: This helps with motivation and procrastination because we all had different schedules, and had limited hours to work together, so we really focused. This also allows you to help or get help as needed, which helps learn concepts\n2) Always attend TA hours: For some classes this was a necessity, for others just a convenience. Again, this helps give you a schedule, but also there is always help from a TA, which should prevent you from getting stuck and discouraged, and raise your homework average. It's also a great place to work with other students and find a study group you like.\n3) Figure out what learning style works for you: For me, I learn most by reading or writing. Nobody has time to read textbooks, but I always took notes in class, wrote my homework by hand, wrote note sheets for tests by hand, made concept diagrams, etc. For you, you might want to record lectures and listen to them later, or learn best by explaining concepts to someone else, or by finding videos online with representations of ideas, or making flash cards.\n4) Worry about concepts, not specifics: This advice may be more engineering oriented than the others, but focus on learning concepts, not reworking a specific homework problem over and over. Lots of students try to do rote learning, and then a single test question can really trip them up. But if you understand general concepts and WHY a graph looks the way it does, or HOW supply and demand are related, you can figure out anything that might try to trip you up.\n\nAlso, (coming from an engineering background at least) I wouldn't worry about getting an MBA anytime soon. Get into the industry and work in the real world for 2-5 years before getting a master's. There's a decent chance your company might even pay for it depending on where you work.",

              "text": "Right, I saw that. I was just letting you know that's what my background was, so if there's something that doesn't apply to you, that's why.\n\nBut I would think that Study Groups, TA hours, note taking styles, and asking why/how would help anybody in any major. Best of luck!",
