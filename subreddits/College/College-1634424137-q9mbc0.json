  "text": "My lab assignments for my hybrid course were due this Wed (Oct 13th). I usually go through and check to make sure I had everything done Tuesday, so I did. But I clicked the wrong folder, and saw everything complete so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nI log in today, realize I looked at the wrong folder and missed my lab work. I thought this work was due next week. We\u2019re in person on week, online the next, rotating.\n\nI feel like such an idiot. Online labs are so confusing and I\u2019m panicking now. \n\nAbsences in two or more labs means an automatic fail, and I have no idea if this means I\u2019ll fail or not. I\u2019ve never been absent from an in person lab.\n\nThe syllabus says all assignments are required! \n\nAm I totally screwed?! I\u2019m having huge anxiety since my professor doesn\u2019t respond to emails on weekends. I have an A in the class besides this.",
