  "text": "I am NOT a morning person. I'm four weeks into my second year and I physically can't do it anymore. First week was on-campus and it was the most horrible experience in my entire life since I had to commute 50 minutes, meaning I had to wake up at like 6. Since then we have moved back online, but there is no way I can function at this hour, I find it absurd and for some godforsaken reason my university's always had this type of schedule so there's no way I could change it or anything. Also, I cannot move my classes 'cause ALL of them start this early and doing that would mean switching professors and it would just cause a lot of inconveniences for everyone involved.\n\nI have no idea why I'm writing, I'm just desperate, I wanna give up but I'm on a scholarship so I cannot do that but I feel like this semester I'm just doomed to fail...  do you have any tips on how to deal with this? I usually do get to go to sleep at like 10-11 but there is that occassional night where I stay up late and mess up my entire fucking week.",

      "text": "I feel you. I\u2019m definitely not a morning person but with the absurd amount of caffeine I consume on a daily basis, you wouldn\u2019t think that. The best thing I have done is set my alarm for 5:30 so I have 30 minutes to get fully awake before I actually get out of bed at 6. I also try to go to bed before midnight. If I have to be up after midnight I will usually get an afternoon nap so I\u2019m not absolutely dead the next day.",

This week I have been an absolute mess, I only joined one class but I try not to stress too much over it 'cause lately I've been trying to look after my health and for me, that starts in my head. Good job for pushing through everyday, you're doing great!",
