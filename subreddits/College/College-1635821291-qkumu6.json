  "text": "I\u2019m finally in school after going through a lot of hardship they prevented me from attending. Now, I\u2019m kind of scared that I may regret my degree and get into debt. I\u2019m currently graduating with an associates in psychology and will attend a college next year to finish strong. I took classes every semester this year including winter and summer. I\u2019m burnt out for sure. I\u2019m a mom and just not good in my relationship right now. I\u2019m actually going to school so that when we separate I can provide for my child and hopefully not need child support. I\u2019m just so scared y\u2019all. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing at all. I never had good grades and I\u2019m doing an outstanding job right now. I don\u2019t know if this is me self sabotaging or if I\u2019m grounded in my concerns. My concerns are that I\u2019ll get into debt and fail out of grad school or not even get in. My goal is to do speech therapy or counseling. But I do everything online for now because I don\u2019t have reliable child care. Any advice? I need help.",
