  "text": "Hey so I'm a senior in high school applying to colleges and I'm not really sure what I want to major in, so I was trying to pick versatile options. I know I want to have knowledge in business so I was thinking of doing a business major but I don't want to do just that. I also know comp sci pays well and is a good skill to have so I was thinking of doing a double major in business and comp sci. Would that be too much?  I'm not really sure how college works and the credit hours and stuff so it would be nice if you could tell me about your experience and don't be afraid to leave out common knowledge because I need that too lol.\n\nAlso if you have experience with a business degree let me know what you did because I don't know which specific area I want to do. I was thinking of doing management but idk if that would be useful or not?\n\nAlso idk if I want to do a minor as well or maybe one major and two minors? I want to do some sort of minor in a science or health type subject because it's interesting to me and I wanna have the experience of getting to do some cool labs and research type thing. I don't plan on working in the science field but I thought a minor would allow me to explore my interests more and keep my options open if I ever change my mind in the future. Do y'all think this would be doable in 4 years? Or is it unrealistic?\n\nIf it helps, I should have some college credit because by the end of this year I will have taken in high school a total of 7 AP classes and 3 DC classes (1 of those APs and one of the DC were one semester classes so I assume it would give less credit hours)",

      "text": "I was a double major (mathematics and Spanish) and double minor (philosophy and sociology) as an undergrad. It was doable in four years, but required a LOT of advance planning - I was at a large school that had multiple sections of most classes, but at a smaller school there would definitely have been too many scheduling conflicts to pull it off, so bear that in mind when you\u2019re planning out your path. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want to major in, you might have the option of going in undeclared. Every school has different policies on this, though. You can also pick something that you think you\u2019re probably interested in, but if you change your mind that\u2019s okay! People change majors all the time as their interests or career plans shift. \n\nTheoretically, your first year will be more gen ed classes than major-specific ones, and that will give you the opportunity to explore some options and see what direction you might like to go. You have a little bit of a head start from AP classes, but you should have enough electives available to dedicate some to \u201cexploration\u201d classes. \n\nI don\u2019t want to turn this into a massive essay but feel free to drop any follow-up questions, or you can PM me!",
