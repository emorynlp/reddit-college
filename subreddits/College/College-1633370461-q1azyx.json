  "title:": "Important question about an interesting situation with other students in a group project. Thanks in advance.",
  "text": "I am starting a group project in an online class. The thing is the participants are very far away in another city. Would it be odd to ask for cell phone numbers in my zoom class to contact other members of my group about the project? Last group project l had. Approximately 8 years ago. We even went to each other's houses, so I don't think it will be wierd. But I ended up failing that project because I let some guy who did not know what he was doing hog the project and we failed. It brought my final grade from an A to C. I was pissed. So I'm hoping they willingly give me their cell phone numbers as I will provide mine. And if they don't should I tell the teacher they won't provide them? I don't want to be a tattle but what if I need to contact them for the project. I have a bad feeling this is going to be a disaster. The frustrating thing is I'm an A student and these projects end up ruining my grade. I do not want to end up with an F again because someone doesn't want to participate. Please Let me know what you think. Thanks in advance,multiple opinions are appreciated.",

      "text": "Ask for a reliable way to contact them. Some people won't give out their phone number but will give you their email or suggest some other method such as using a Discord server for the project. As long as they check it reliably, then it shouldn't be a problem. Don't insist on having their phone number if they don't want to give it. Then, if people don't respond to your written messages, you have evidence to go to your instructor and show that they aren't participating, if necessary.",
