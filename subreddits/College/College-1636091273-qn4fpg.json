  "text": "I am 99% that I have ADHD (and many teachers throughout middle and high school told my mother and I the same thing) but haven't ever been officially diagnosed because my mom just says that I should \"focus more\" and I've been pretty heavily suffering from depression recently, so I never finished writing 2 of my midterms. I felt super guilty and skipped class that week, intending to finish my papers over the weekend, but every time I sat down to work on them, I never ended up finishing them. So I continued to skip class and tell myself that it would only be for one more day. I've now skipped for almost a month and I still haven't finished them.",
