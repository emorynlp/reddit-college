  "text": "This isn't meant to be a self-pity post, I'm sorry if it comes off as such. At this point I'm pretty much out of options, so maybe reddit can see a creative solution where I can't. \n\nLong story (relatively) short, I'll be 21 soon, took a mistake gap year and fell 3 years behind because of poor decisions. I now can't afford a single term at community college and my family is mostly uneducated, creditless and broke. I'm still working minimum wage, have no marketable skills, but can't do much because living costs took over. Loans are a no-go as I have no established credit and no co-signers, federal aid didn't work out because I don't understand the process, I don't qualify for any scholarships. \n\nMy goal was to be a mechanical engineer and put myself through ROTC, commission and snatch a rich, fulfilling military career. Right now it looks like I'll just have to enlist. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. A lot hinges on me going to college. Even my girlfriend of 2+ years doesn't want to stick around if I don't go to college, so I'm pretty bummed.",

              "text": "EOPS stands for Extended Opportunity Program & Services, and basically it's there to help give economically disadvantaged students more help. It would likely be under the \"student services\" tab of your local CC's website, and it would give you the requirements needed to qualify (usually taking a certain number of units and qualify for the fee waiver). It gives money for books and has a lot of other benefits like priority class registration (ESPECIALLY helpful when trying to get into those GE courses that everyone needs!) and a dedicated counselor instead of going through the main counseling office at the school. You will have to prove that you're keeping your grades up, but honestly, you should do that anyway. :)\n\nThe fee waiver ... well, I only know that they've changed the name here in California, but it *was* the BOG (Board of Governors) fee waiver, and it was super easy to apply for when I got it. However, I think a fair number of schools would have something similar under a different name--it would likely be on the financial aid page. For that, it's usually like proving you made less than ... crap, $15k? the previous year, but don't quote me on the income because I don't know that for sure. Basically, though, you just have to prove you're in need and they'll cover your class fees.",

If your ASVAB practice scores are that high it definitely would be worth talking to a navy recruiter about your options.  Many military recruits do very well applying to college after their service. For example, schools like Brown, Yale and Columbia have special programs for non traditional students. \n\n2. If you did well in HS you might consider having your HS transcript evaluated and translated by a company like WES (world education services) then you\u2019d have a better idea where you stand in as far as a US GPA equivalent.  Many schools are test optional right now and if your grades were good with a rigorous  course work it would be worth reaching out to the admissions offices of meets full need schools to see what your options might be. Many of those schools give excellent financial aid. The service academies might be a bit more of a challenge but again it\u2019s worth contacting them.  You can discuss any obstacles you may have including FA, obtaining letters of recommendation etc\u2026with the AO. \n\nYou could also look into an online program like the one at University of North Dakota:\n\nhttps://engineering.und.edu/admissions/index.html\n\n3. As far as fafsa do your parents file a tax return? If so filling out the fafsa should be fairly straightforward. If they don\u2019t then that\u2019s a bigger issue. Many schools also use the CSS profile which is a bit more complicated because it requires more financial information but if your family is lower income it may not be that difficult. You could start the application and see how it goes. Most financial aid goes thru the schools you apply to. \n\nhttps://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa",
