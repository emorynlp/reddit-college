  "text": "I usually bring my guitar with me on nice days to play outside. I make sure not to sit too close to people but there\u2019s not really any secluded spots so people usually see me. I just really don\u2019t wanna be known as the douche with the acoustic guitar. I guess my question is from an outside perspective, do people find this annoying? will people think I\u2019m an attention whore ?",

Otherwise you would just go outside and play acoustic guitar and not think twice about it - the quintessential organically cool acoustic guitar guy/gal persona. You will never become the organically cool acoustic guitar guy/gal until you overcome your fear of being known as the douche with the acoustic guitar.",

There's always going to be noise outside from people talking and possibly other music from speakers, and if it's like my campus, we have this bigoted \"preacher\" that comes with a mic and speaker and spouts homophobic and racist nonsense. So, i think the sound of a guitar would be nice while eating lunch or just catching my breath between classes. I do agree with not doing it in a crowded area where a lot of people are eating for example, but otherwise I say go for it!!",

You can shred so hard your eardrums explode without anyone else hearing you. Most multi effect pedals can also emulate an acoustic guitar if thats the only sound you want. \n\nI played like this for years because to me electric guitars only really sound good when they are played loud.",

But in general there's always that 1 guy on campus that mournfully plays an acoustic guis an acoustic guitar playing whatever irritating song is popular at the moment pretending to be a troubled poet. Appreciate the fact you're not trying to be that guy but you will kind of look like that guy a little bit just you're stupid just don't wear a turtle neck while you play the acoustic guitar that just screams douchebag with a guitar. Try and find a music practice space see if they're available to everyone just not music majors you must you might be able to play your guitar there. But like don't do it directly by door rooms it'll drive people nuts. Trying find a secluded spot as possible and just be as courtCourteous as you possibly can to others do your best dude people dude people do understand that people have to practice and worst case scenario Mario just say you'reMinoring in musical composition or something  And you couldn't get a reserved space in a practice room apologize apologize and people are usually understanding. No one will really check in with that but they might be slightly more forgiving about the fact that you are randomly playing guitar on the green or something",
