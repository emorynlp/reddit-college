  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nCan you guys give me recommendations on what tablet/iPad I can use for optimal note-taking/pdf markups experience? One with a compatible pen would be nice (Kinda in a tight budget hahaha)\n\nWas considering between Samsung S6 lite, Samsung S7 FE and Apple iPad 9th Generation as they all are in the same price range in my country but please recommend other brands/models too! :D \n\nThank you for the help. <3",

      "text": "I have a galaxy tab s6 lite and recently started using it for taking my notes! I installed a few apps for note-taking but ended up deleting them all and trying just the Samsung notes app and it was the best one. I love taking notes on it, it's really smooth with the pen and easy to erase words or letters by just pressing the button on the s pen and then erasing. I would definitely recommend a galaxy tab since they're cheaper than iPads and I love mine. But with ipads, I think you can get better apps like Evernote for notes and Procreate if you like drawing so I would keep that in mind too.",

          "text": "Yesss! I saw some videos on youtube on how to use the Samsung Notes app and it seemed like its a really good app for note-taking. And yeah, some of the selling points of the Ipad is because of the apps and I am more familiar with ios instead of android. Thank you for your opinion. Would think about it :)",

      "text": "Right now using iPad 7 + Apple Pencil, previously I used Surface Go + Surface Pen. \n\nIn my personal experience, the Apple Pencil is way superior for note taking wise. And honestly the base iPad is just fine for Note taking.\n\nApp wise, I use OneNote just because it sync to practically any devices",

I've tried samsung tablets but they don't compare to the software quality of the iPad imo, plus, I really love the apple books app for reading.",
