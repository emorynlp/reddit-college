  "text": "So basically as the title says, can one major in computer science if they don\u2019t have any background in coding/programming or anything of that sorts? \n\nI\u2019m in my first year and hoping to pursue an applied math degree. My college needs us to pair this up with either cs/economics/statistics. \n\nOut of those three, I feel like cs would be way more employable if partnered with math so I just want to know if it\u2019s possible to major in that too if one doesn\u2019t have any prior experience to cs.",

It's going to take me 6 years to graduate since I work full time and can only do about 20 credits a year, plus that's all I can afford.",
