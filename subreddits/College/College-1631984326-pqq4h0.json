  "text": " I'll be going back to college for my 3rd year.\nSo far I've had only one semester on campus and the rest has been online, so I don't know that many people.\nAll the friends of my current friend group are going to do a year in other countries, so I'm basically going back without having any friends left.\nWhat's the best way to get new friends, since all the cliques are already established and I feel so weird just going up to them and being like \"hi I am...\" Any tips?",
