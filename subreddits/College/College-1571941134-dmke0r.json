Thank you*\n\n\nI go to a small Liberal Arts College in the US, and I was born and raised in the US. My roommate is an international student from literally the opposite side of the globe, and this is his first time in the US. We've been in school for just over 2 months now, and some things he does has started to get on my nerves. I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. \n\nFor example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. \n\nThat entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. \n\nHowever, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. \n\nStorytime (Whoever comments \"Storytime\" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly \"silent\", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like \"gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!\" or \"That's right you little s***head.\"\nAfter asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. \n\nYesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said \"Ok\" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him \"Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?\" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said \"Ok\" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to \"turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate\" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. \n\nI slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom.\n\nI've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight.\n\n**TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a. Am I crazy for thinking his behavior is unacceptable?**\n\nEdit: 2 of you said the magic word at the same time, and since I'm too tired to find out who did first you both get gold. Thank you for reading!\n\nEdit 2: 25 minute nap and rip inbox. Thank you very much for all the comments, it means a lot and I read each of them. I have decided to purchase some triple-flange silicone earplugs and a sleep mask, and will have a talk with roommate when he gets back tonight and tell him that after 11:30p on school-nights or unless agreed upon, lights are out in the room and any games will be played outside. If he doesn't agree, or fails to adhere, I'll go to the RA and post an update asking for more advice. Once again, thank you for all the replies it means the world to me.\n\nEdit 3: About to talk to him as I fell asleep at 7p yesterday when he was out. I\u2019ll make a new post tomorrow I reckon with the results.

Your considerate actions will often not be noticed or fully appreciated. Most people just stay in their own world, and don't give much consideration for the immediate/long-term consequences of their actions on others. \n\nYour roommate seems like your typical immature, inconsiderate asshole. The saddest thing is not only does he not care about others, but he doesn't care about himself. (i.e. responsibilities for his future, his own hygiene, etc.) Honestly, I feel like he was probably forced to go to college by his parents, but still refuses to grow up. \n\nIf none of the outside forces can get him to stop, then I'd suggest moving into a single dorm (if financially viable for you), and hopefully having some friends that you can move in with next semester. If you can't, then I'd suggest getting a sleeping mask for the light, maybe a pair of earplugs (might need to wear them with your noise-cancelling headphones), and maybe a nice 1000+ page textbook to hurl at your roommate. (extra points if it's a $200+ textbook that you haven't gotten any value out of) In all seriousness, noise cancelling headphones may not work too well at blocking out spontaneous noises; especially if you're not playing any music with them. I'd advise getting some \"triple flange\" earplugs with replaceable tips (so you can change and wash them). I have a pair of earphones with triple flange tips, and they isolate a lot of noise. Btw, there's no such thing as a truly quiet keyboard + mouse, especially if he's using the kind of keyboard that I'm thinking of. There's quieter keyboards, but I doubt that your roommate would make it sound quiet. \n\nLastly, I think you should really see a doctor or someone about your sleep issue. Since you care about your education, the lack of sleep will really cut into your ability to learn + your sanity. Even 6 hours of sleep (imo) is not good enough, and sometimes makes me feel worse than 2 hours of sleep. If everything gets resolved to the point where you can have a quiet last few hours before sleep, I'd advise no screens for 1-2 hours before sleep, and a nice relaxing routine to settle you into sleep. (reading in bed, maybe some light studying). Hope some of this helps.
