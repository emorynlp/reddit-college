I am a college freshmen moving in tomorrow (exciting!) and I am so nervous to meet my roomie. She is so kind and I love her so far over text messaging, but she smokes a lot of weed. Pipes and bongs in her house even. Now no shame at all you do you girl and I even said on my roommate finder, I dont mind smoking! I just don\u2019t generally do it myself. However, I didn\u2019t think this through. My family smokes weed and I know the scent travels, sticks to things and overall just bugs me. My big issue is, I don\u2019t want the RA to catch her smoking and me get rolled up into it! I have brought it up a few times and she said no it\u2019s totally fine and bought a \u201csmoke buddy\u201d (but I\u2019m pretty sure smoke still rolls off the end of the bong.) to cover the scent. She also said she heard my nerves and bought air fresheners! But the thing is THE SMELL TRAVELS! How do I not be a buzzkill about this? I have already said I\u2019m ok with it until I thought it through fully and now I\u2019m so nervous and it\u2019s ruining my vibe with her. She is always high which is cool but to be always high, you have to smoke a lot.

Tell her you really like her as a person but the constant weed is not exactly an issue but it\u2019s making you not enjoy her company as much. I\u2019m sure you guys can compromise. Maybe a vape? Where it doesn\u2019t smoke up the room but she still gets high.. also tell her she needs to claim her shit if it comes up. I used to smoke and never had an issue claiming mine.
