      "text": "Getting started is definitely the hardest part! Once you begin a task you've got momentum going for you. It's more difficult with papers because it's not obvious what you should be doing, but if there are any parts you know that you just need to write down, just start with that (doesn't matter if it ends up being the middle of the paper, you'll use it later so there's no need to start at the top), or make an outline, or find sources. Take a break, then set yourself a goal of working undistracted for 20 minutes or so, keeping going as long as you can after that but stop when you slow all the way down again, take another break, repeat. Hope this helps, good luck with your paper.",
