      "text": "Usually, towards the middle of the semester, I find the best way to initiate is to ask about homework, especially if it is challenging. Or the next class after a test I'll randomly ask how they felt they did on the test. I'm in CS, so everyone is always wondering if this will be the test that pushes them to change their major. lol\n\nIf they are wearing a shirt that hints at a hobby, you could also use that to talk. Honestly, there are many situations that can be used as openers. A guy in one of my classes was like \"Bro, wanna get lunch sometime?\" My gf joked about bro-dates, but that's because I tend to be a hermit. She hasn't seen me interact with tons of my friends as none of us live close together, but even as an introvert, I actually make friends easily. Part of this is also because I'm a bit older than most students, so I don't have the social hangups some people might.\n\nHell, one guy I sit next to in a class mentioned he needed to get in shape. So I told him we'd hit the university gym since I needed to get in shape. Now there are two skinny CS nerds showing up at the gym everyday.\n\nRegardless, find an opening, and ask. To be fair, the majority of people I have met in college have been socially awkward to an extent. I wouldn't worry too much about it appearing odd to people, and if it does, who cares? They're probably sad they don't have more friends.",

Hell yeah man me too I've been struggling a bit blah blah blah\" then I'll ask what his name is and then everytime I see him from then on he'll remember me and that opens up a door for new conversations.
