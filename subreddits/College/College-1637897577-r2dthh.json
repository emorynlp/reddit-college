  "text": "I must type this out. This is the first time in 4 years of college I hated group project. Literally did all the work for the other 4 people and now these people cant even do a minutes recorded video and give them to me on time. They told me to be patience when I gave them a reminder three weeks ago. Like come on and do the job. Literally the only thing they had to do in this group project. I really want to email the professor now, but have not done it before. They are giving me every excuses for being late. Looking for advice",

You're in charge of your grade. \n\nI know that my University includes doing other students work as a form of cheating. I would go forth beforehand with that information if necessary. It'd be better for them to know before hand than find out later and misconstrue it however they please.\n\nThen again, I'm ALWAYS down to throw some lazy bastards under the bus. Never hesitate. Take care of yourself first.",
