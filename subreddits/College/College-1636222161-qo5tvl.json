  "title:": "Ive bee assigned a research topic that we havent covered in class yet",
  "text": "The paper is due in a couple days. They gave it to us out of the blue with a week to do it. \n\nMy topic hasnt been covered yet, most topics havent. I can see on the schedule, we begin that topic in 3 weeks.\n\nA bunch of people have been complaining, they just tell us to use our readings but idk how to apply those readings because i dont understand this topic. THATS WHY I PAY TO GO TO COLLEGE. \n\nThe entire class is a mess its not just this one thing, we're in the middle of a group project too, and they cant even decided for themselves what they want from us.\n\nThe worst part is our main lecturer is also the head of the entire department, so there isnt even anyone i can get help from.\n\nIdk anymore, college is hard enough when i have a load of work to complete, but this is too much. My lecturers dont even know what theyre doing. And the main lecturer spends all lecture talking about his life and how great he is because he left a different college for this job and made this college great.\n\nIve genuinely been broken. Theres no support system. They dont care anymore. This is my final year, the one that counts the most, and my lecturers have basically written off hundreds of students already.",
