That being said, that meant that before they passed, I coudlve walked passed them and I wouldn't have even known. Its just so sad, but imagine from the parents perspective.

My brother later told my family that nobody knew what type of cancer, but that the boy was well liked and respected by everyone and that his sudden death saddened so many people in the school, both teachers and students. \n\nI also had a math teacher pass away as well from cancer when I was in middle school. He too was suffering from cancer, but the school just kept telling me and my class whenever we asked about his whereabouts, that he was simply \"sick\". When he passed it devastated us when they told us, because he too was well beloved and liked by everyone. I remember the day they held a memorial for him, where the principal did a speech commemorating him in front of the classroom he taught us in. It does depress me a bit that my class was the last class he was teaching before he died, it just seems so surreal and strange to me to understand that.
