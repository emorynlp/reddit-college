  "text": "I\u2019m in community college aiming to receive all As again this semester in hopes of transferring to a university with a 40% acceptance rate. One of the courses required in my major is sociology. The first quiz I received a 96. The first exam I received a 100 (92 with 8 point curve). The first paper I received a 100. There are three exams, worth 60% of our grade., (each worth 20%) Three quizzes worth 15% (each worth 5%) and three papers worth 15% of our grade (each worth 5%) The second quiz which I took yesterday, I received a 79. Im a bit concerned that I won\u2019t be able to receive an A for the course. At the end of the semester our professor offers a bonus exam which can bump up our grade one \u2018letter\u2019 (b+ becomes an a, c becomes c+) what are my chances of receiving an A overall? Any tips would be appreciated!",

      "text": "Math, dude. If each quiz is worth 5 points and you made a 79%, (.79 x 5) you earned 3.95 points for that quiz.  \nYou earned 4.8 points (.96 x 5) on the other quiz for a total of 8.75/10 possible points on the two combined.\nYou earned 100% of 20 available points on your first exam and 100% of 5 possible points (thanks to an obscene curve but whatever) for an additional 25/25 points.   \nNow add the numerator and the denominator:  you have earned 33.75 (4.8 + 3.75 + 20 + 5) out of a possible 35 (5 + 5 + 20 + 5) points so far if I read your post correctly, or a 96.4%\n\nMy tip is to keep up the most good work and figure out how to calculate your own grades \ud83d\ude2c",

          "text": "Thank you so much. I\u2019ve actually never learned how to calculate that way, we were always provided an input calculator. The 8 point curve was obscene considering I must have had the highest score for my grade to be curved to 100, with the class average being an 84. I\u2019m not complaining about the curves though because my midterm for American politics was curved to 114. I feel like you have to try to fail at this point.",
