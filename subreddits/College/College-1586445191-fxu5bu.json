Reminders from the LMS sometimes get lost.\n\nI'm doing course planning for an upcoming class and looking at doing text reminders.  It would be 100% optional and in addition to content pushed out through the LMS/email.  I would encourage students to use a bogus phone number (ie, Google Voice number) if they want to keep their actual number private.\n\nThoughts? Is it worth my time to set this up for students?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the input!  I will definitely be incorporating this AS AN OPTION for students next year to opt-in if they wish.  Based on your suggestions, everything will still ALSO go out via the LMS (where I have weekly posts of what's due etc).", "author": "Decisionsota", "created": 1586445191, "retrieved": 1632947177, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1549, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fpyew8r": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fxu5bu/undergrads_would_you_want_text_reminders_about/fpyew8r/", "text": "Yes, I'll even suggest this to some of my professors if we're online in the fall.

Sometimes things take precedent and things get in the way, i know out of all the assignments i had to do for my online classes the only ones i ever was late on or missed was discussion board comments as i lost track of the days they were due or where i had finished an assignment but hadn\u2019t submitted it yet as i wanted to take one last look at it to review after i took a break from looking at it and would come close to forgetting to submit it that night. \n\nObviously it would help a lot with the current situation but even in normal situations students have jobs and families and most are involved in some type of club or athletic event where sometimes those are up in the air. I know my practice schedule was constantly changing so that would sometimes throw me off. \n\nBut i think it would also benefit professors from getting many emails about students who forgot a deadline but did the work etc. \n\nDepending on the class/assignment I think the idea of sending out one reminder 24 hours before the due date is helpful.", "author": "Unlucky_Zone", "created": 1586458579, "upvotes": 2}, "fmx4juh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fxu5bu/undergrads_would_you_want_text_reminders_about/fmx4juh/", "text": "Please.", "author": "Vanquishthehambeast", "created": 1586458334, "upvotes": 1}, "fmx3w2q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fxu5bu/undergrads_would_you_want_text_reminders_about/fmx3w2q/", "text": "That\u2019s a really nice thing to do and I\u2019m sure your students would appreciate it considering the chaos and lack of structure in these crazy times. \n\nJust to play devil\u2019s advocate though, we\u2019re all adults and we should be expected to remember when our work is due.
