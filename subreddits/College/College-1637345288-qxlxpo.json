  "text": "I\u2019ve tried every support system my school has to offer and I must say it\u2019s done nothing for me\u2026 I\u2019ve taken medication, therapy etc and nothing. My gpa is starting to suffer and I have two midterm exams next week and I don\u2019t even know where to begin\u2026. So I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to fail. I\u2019m so behind in my studies as most days I feel so shitty I just sleep any free time I have. My peers are studying all day and all night but I just don\u2019t have that drive anymore. I\u2019ve pushed and pushed myself and the more I tried my grades just keep falling so I\u2019ve just actively stopped trying and I feel like I\u2019m slowly digging my own grave. I\u2019ve no friends, I don\u2019t go out so I\u2019m stuck in my dorm room all day doing online classes and I can\u2019t stay awake to study and I\u2019ve slowly lost interest in my degree since I\u2019m having such a krappy time. What do I do? Is there anyway to save myself? I keep contemplating dropping out but I\u2019m already in my 4th year of a 5 year program.",
