  "text": "So one of the dorms on my campus (not the one I live in) has someone who has been appropriately christened the \u201cPiss Bandit\u201d because they have been peeing in front of doors for about a month now. \nNo one knows who they are, and the police have issued a warning, but aren\u2019t doing anything else. \nThis person seems to be a mastermind, because despite random checks and rounds done by the dorms\u2019 RAs, they continue to get away with it. \n\nA know a few people who are spending a lot of time trying to solve this.",
