  "text": "My professors and even some of my classmates act like we should find this stuff to be the coolest thing ever and just eat, sleep, and breathe our major. But, I'm here for a degree to better my career because I like not being poor, not because this is my passion. Am I weird or is it normal? Or is it because I'm not coming straight from high-school into this?",

Just make sure you do your job well when you get there.",
