      "text": "I would take a lab science in the summer if I could, but my college doesn't offer them then. As far as pre-calc, that would depend on the professor and how comfortable you are with math/grasping new concepts. A lot of summer courses will cut some of the full-semester units so it isn't as much material but, in my experience, math courses don't. I tried to take Calc I over a summer and didn't make it. It was just too quickly progressed through for my abilities.",

But, I had to sacrifice having a job, so finances were tight to say the least! \n\nIf finances are a major concern, and you think you wouldn\u2019t be able to balance a part time job with both classes, then you may need to make a judgement call and pick one over the other.\n\nI think ultimately that if you feel you can handle it, then go for it! It would definitely help you on your journey through college. \n\nBest of luck! Enjoy your Thanksgiving!",
