  "text": "I\u2019m currently in sophomore undergrad at depaul u. I have a generous financial aid package and am okay with school, but I think I\u2019d be interested in transferring somewhere so I can leave chicago. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and now college feels like nothing new or exciting. However I don\u2019t want to lose my financial aid and go swimming in debt as a result of transferring. Can anyone give me some perspective?",

          "text": "I guess it\u2019s not as much will I get more money as will I get any money if I already have considerable financial aid from the school I currently attend. My school specifically gives out a lot in aid (as it\u2019s also v expensive) so I wouldn\u2019t expect the same, but I would like to know if transferring is an option where I still get some considerable aid",
