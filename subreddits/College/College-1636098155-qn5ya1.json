  "text": "So I\u2019ve been looking for some advice on whether or not I should transfer to a cheaper school. Ultimately the decision is up to me but I\u2019d just like some input, so here\u2019s the best summary I could come up with:\n\nI grew up in a rural area in the South, and almost immediately after graduating high school I packed my things and moved across the US to the Pacific Northwest. I had never seen this part of the country and although I did not know anyone there or meet anyone within my first few months there, I fell in love with the scenery and as someone who likes the outdoors, I was glad to have made the move. Earlier in the year I had applied to a state school in the area and got accepted, which gave me the opportunity to move across the country in order to pursue my degree. Because of the ridiculous price of out of state tuition, I could only afford to attend as a part time student for the entirety of the 2020-21 year, even with scholarships. I worked full time during my first year, and after living there for a year I became eligible for in state tuition. \n\nHowever, during this current term I have found out that even with in-state tuition applied, I can pursue the same degree back in my home state for half the price of what I am paying here in my new state. I have done the math, and in order to finish my degree at my current uni I would have to take out somewhere between $25k and $30k in loans. If I were to transfer to a different uni back in my home state, I would have to take out less than $10k in loans. I should have looked into this and calculated the total cost while I was still in high school, but at the time I was just ready to get out of my backwater home town. I have made the best out of my decision and do not regret moving, but it definitely comes with a price.\n\nI have worked pretty hard to build a new life for myself here in the PNW and now have many close friends who I now live with, and have also made some connections here on campus; I was even lucky enough to land a paid internship during this past summer working with an assistant professor. Overall, I\u2019m just not sure if I am making the right decision by transferring to a cheaper school in order to avoid student debt after all that I have been through and accomplished over this past year.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind moving back to my home state and finishing my degree there as I do miss my family & friends, it would just mean starting over again at a different uni. If I had the money to stay at my current uni it wouldn\u2019t even be up for debate as it truly is a beautiful part of the US, but that\u2019s just not the case. Ultimately, it boils down to whether or not I should go into more debt in order to continue studying at my current uni; I\u2019m just not sure if it is worth it as the debt will definitely affect my future. \n\nTL;DR: Should I transfer to a different uni in my home state to avoid going into debt?\n\nAny advice helps!",

I was originally in wildlife/conservation science at the out of state school, which is a program that this school specializes in, but I changed my major to industrial engineering since the jobs in wildlife are really limited. As of now I\u2019m not in any debt.",

              "text": "At this point, which school has the better engineering program and which will give you more job opportunities. 30k debt for a good school that will give more opportunities for job prospects is not bad. But if they are the same then I'd go back home. You get to spend the time with family and friends and pay half the price.",

      "text": "At this point I wouldn't necessarily base the decision on the debt amounts because both options are managable (additionally you are under the federal subsidized limit so interest isn't bad). You are thinking about it as an average student but need to process it as an investor. Each of the debt options need to be considered relative to their potential returns.\n\nYou need to pick the option that has the best long-term career prospects. That will mean a lot more over time than a $20k difference in loans.\n\nI'll put it to you this way. You'll likely have connections wherever you are attending school and employers will know that college. Assume you are comparing average salary between these two regions. Adjusted salary in the northwest is much higher than the south. Look at the difference in salary after living expenses. Saving 20% of $40k is different than saving 20% of $65k.\n\nDon't avoid loans just to avoid debt. That's like avoiding income to avoid taxes. It is financially viable to take a low-interest loan for something where you see a strong chance for a good return. In that case, not engaging is even worse. Some debt is actually a good thing to take on considering what it was for. But you have to be realistic about the benefit you are thinking you will get because it turns into bad debt if there is no realistic return for it (good debt: debt taken on with an expectation for financial return; bad debt: debt taken on that is unlikely to enable any return, commonly consumer debt). You will see millionaires out there with tons of good debt because they know that certain debts will pay themselves off and more.\n\nAdditionally with moving back for the lower cost, there's gonna be associated costs with that move in general and not all of your credits will transfer. You probably wouldn't save the full difference and might end up having to take an extra semester.",
