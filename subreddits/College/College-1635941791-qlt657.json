  "text": "I am a senior in high school and I\u2019m lost on what degree to chose. I enjoy building computers and computers in general I would seek a information tech but not CS considering the coding. I don\u2019t HATE coding but I just couldn\u2019t be sitting down and coding all day. I enjoy health and fitness and sorta thought about pharmaceutical stuff but I have no clue what career I could Pursue. Lastly I\u2019ve considered a degree in criminal justice but my younger brother was telling me that it\u2019s really useless to get a degree in it considering i wouldn\u2019t be anything but a cop or state trooper really, unless there\u2019s actually stuff in that which is why im on Reddit asking this. \n\nHealth/fitness, computers, law and creating  stuff w my hands. I can\u2019t see myself at a desk all day. Seeking advice anything really helps.",

      "text": "Your brother is incredibly wrong about criminal justice. You can be a crime analyst, cop, federal law enforcement agent, probation officer, lawyer (some law schools even give you a year off of law school for being a CJ major), victim advocate and there\u2019s a lot of technology jobs coming forward as another commenter mentioned. There\u2019s also a shortage of people going into criminal justice because people think you can only become a cop but that\u2019s not true and many of the jobs start at 60-80K salaries.\n\nedit: this is also only considering jobs with a bachelors degree. If you double major CJ with psychology, social work, legal studies, a language or computer science there\u2019s even more job opportunities with an even higher salary. I\u2019m a double major and the job i\u2019m looking at right now is 90K a year starting with benefits.",

If you are worried about wasting money on elective classes because you aren\u2019t sure if they will be useful in the future, then do not fret. Electives are usually required for each degree so it\u2019s not going to waste.",
