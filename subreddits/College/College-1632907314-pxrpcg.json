It might be a few years but I (33) was a completely different person at 26 than I was at 18 or 20. So for me, rooming with the younger crowd would have been oil and water. For you, if you already interact with people in the age range that you are likely to room with and it's generally a pleasant experience then it could work out. If you find people younger than you to be generally annoying for whatever reason then living with them isn't going to be awesome.", "author": "Comipa47", "created": 1632907707, "upvotes": 3}}}
