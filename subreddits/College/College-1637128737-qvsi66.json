  "text": "My mother is an artist and art teacher, she has two degrees. I never followed that path because I wanted to make them proud by making good money after I graduate. In other words, i didnt follow my heart.\n\nBut art is a significant part of my life and it's always going to be a continued hobby. I think i would have enjoyed college and got more out of it if i had some more fun. I'm looking through the arts courses and they just look amazing. I really feel like i messed up and missed out.\n\nSome people may say it's not too late to go back but it is. I'm already graduating a semester late and my scholarship won't cover the extra cost. I'll already have to take loans out for it and I don't want to burden my parents any longer--theyre ready to retire.",

      "text": "You know I had an art teacher that was actually a relatively well known sculptor in my home state he hit the couple pieces displayed at the Smithsonian and that sort of thing. He teaches full time at mild prep school and he works about 5 different side hustles periodically when he doesn't have commissions.\n\nHe told any student that was an aspiring artist that that they should pursue art but they need to have a primary source of income that can at least support them in a reasonable manner as in like at minimum $35000 a year otherwise otherwise the whole starving artist thing is going to be a major factor in their lives.\n\nHe actually encouraged people to think about training as a welder and continuously normally continuously pursuing art as well but he stressed not even he could make a living based solely on his art young his art and hes kind of a moderately fa moderately famous artist. This was the teacher that helped my sister get one of her paintings dings in an exhibition for young artists at the met in New York. Just in general it's very difficult for people to make a living as an artist or in an artistic field without some other form of income so so maybe think about pursuing pursuing whatever you were actually majoring in as like your primary income source but no one says you can't sign up for some art classes at the community college or something wherever you end up with your job or just enjoy enjoy art as a hobby.\n\nThere are a lot of people that may not make a living as an artist or in an artistic field but but pursue their passions in the art world as like they're outlet they're hobby that is a great source of joy for them.\n\nMy dad likes to woodwork hes turned it into a carpentry business business but my brother's and I kind of took up that hobby as well on occasion I will carve like chess sets out of wood I am an engineering major and art isn't going to be my field but I enjoy it as a creative outlet art doesn't have to be the only thing you do in your life but it can be an important component just like your job doesn't have to be everything you do.\n\nAnd honestly I know a few people that have pursued art as like there it's like they're job and they ended up hitting it because it went from a Passion that they did for joy to something they had to do for monetary reasons they couldn't explore their creativity because they had a commission they had to finish it was very specific so in the end it's kind of a double edged sword Lord when it comes to being a professional artist or is no artist or an art historian or whatever field in the art world you want to pursue.\n\nSo worst case maybe think about just finishing out your degree make some decent money and maybe sign up for art classes or when you get your masters get it in something artistic art related",

      "text": "You can make good money as an art major right after graduation if you move in the right circles. I personally dislike when people talk down on art like that. I\u2019ve seen how money can be made and how the right people would help you do things/get solid jobs. It\u2019s hard, unstable, complicated to find a rhythm, and it might be a while before you have a \u201cregular\u201d job/schedule, and doesn\u2019t happen to everyone, and it\u2019s not really for everyone, yes. But anyway, I\u2019m not here to rant about that any more than that. \n\nGo to graduate school. Why tf not? Once you get your life together, you can go to graduate school, or go to undergraduate and get a second degree. I totally disagree on just going to college to get an associate\u2019s. But you can do that if you want. You can go back even if your life isn\u2019t all together, you only need two things, a stable source of income and some place to live. That\u2019s it. I guess good credit too lol. \n\nYour life ain\u2019t over. Please don\u2019t be all sad and in despair and stuff. It\u2019s not over yet. I\u2019m guilty of the same myself, and I often have to remind myself that my life is still happening. \n\nPeace \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to resolve your feeling and create a plan.",
