  "title:": "How do you explain depression as the reason for absence to a professor",
  "text": "I've been dealing with depression for a few years and even now I'm on my 4th year at college and I don't know how to properly explain to my professor the reason for my lengthy absences. I didn't reach out to them beforehand about being absent the day of an exam but when I was asked the day after I didn't know how to respond. I knew the reason why I didn't show was due to my depression but how do I express that? I don't feel I should express it to them. I also don't want my professor to think im lazy or don't understand.   \n\n\nWhich I think is what they think of me now. I could tell their tone was a bit offended and even frustrated by the way they wrote. Using phrases like \"I will do as they say cut you some slack\" and even  lightly insulting my age by claiming \"it must be your first semester in college\"   \n\n\nI feel awful and nervous about even continuing the class because I'm scared to face this professor now. My plan is to try my best and just attend class as much as I can but I wish I could explain to my professor I have depression.   \n\n\nI'm scared I won't be taken seriously though since I don't have any specific accommodations for my adhd or depression listed at my college.  I also don't want the professor to think they need to report me for telling him I have depression because professors are mandatory reporters of stuff like this.  \n\n\nHas anyone else had to be in this situation?",

      "text": "Why don\u2019t you have accommodations? If you\u2019re able to work with the accommodations office and your provider that would be the route to go. Otherwise, professors aren\u2019t exactly mental health professionals and you\u2019re at the whim of whichever professor who also likely isn\u2019t necessarily spending a hefty amount of time judging you, you\u2019re absences or performance.\n\nI think most professors want to see their students succeed but don\u2019t have the capacity/expertise to evaluate mental heath crisis and issues their students are having. You could potentially say you have some other illness, personal reason, etc., that is causing issues with your academic performance and the result would likely be the same. \n\nI have mental health issues and have had to deal with some disruptive life circumstances but I talked to my advisor, worked with my provider and the school accommodation office(I got an eval and was lucky to be able to afford it) and received reasonable accommodations that have made a positive impact on my academic career. If you think you\u2019re going to fail, maybe drop the course if you\u2019re able to. Lighten your course load and focus on getting to a place where you can take care of yourself and school. (I\u2019m a non-traditional student and although the windy path through school has been tough, I have a different perspective about doing what you can to finish vs struggling through the entire experience)\n\nWhen it came to contacting professors before all this, just like work, the slew of reasons/explanations don\u2019t necessarily change the outcome. Read the syllabus, see if an extension or make-up is possible and maybe don\u2019t ask questions that have already been answered (in the syllabus). Sorry for such a lengthy response but I hope this helps! College isn\u2019t the easiest to navigate with depression or anything but support and resources hopefully exist at your school that will help! You\u2019re definitely not alone in this experience. Good luck!!",
