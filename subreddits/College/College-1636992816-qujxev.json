  "text": "What are the best college majors out there? I am in college but I exactly am not sure of what to do. I am interested in finding a good job after college. I am really not exactly passionate about anything at all. I don't have anything that I strongly desire but just like.  Any good bachelors degree to get?? It can be a versatile degree that can be applied anywhere. Currently, I have about $40k in student loans and I want to make college a good time and I don't want to waste my time and money in an investment that doesn't mean anything.",

              "text": "Both are good majors, but require a post-grad if you want to do meaningful work in those fields. For instance, if you want to work as an economist at the Federal Reserve or at Google (tech companies hire a ton of economists nowadays) you would 100% need a PhD to be competitive. However, Econ is extremely flexible, and can get you great jobs that don\u2019t offer the job title \u2018economist\u2019. Econ majors from my Uni are sought after because they often have a mix of skills in statistics and inference, programming, business, and a solid math background. The jobs you can get also depend on what focus your university gives Econ, and whether they award a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree (BS degree being generally more desirable). I\u2019m studying for a BS in Econ and most people I know that have graduated have either gone to grad school or have easily landed jobs in Consulting, Data Science, Government, Finance etc\u2026",

But, at least where I go to college the difference between a BA and BS is that advanced statistics, programming, and advanced econometrics courses are core requirements for a BS and optional on a BA in economics. So if you\u2019re going to be working outside your field \u2014 ie. not as an economist but as a consultant or data scientist \u2014 it\u2019s generally better to have that stronger quantitative foundation since those are the skills employers care about. But to your point, it\u2019s true that BA and BS requirements are different depending on where you go to college. So I\u2019ll just rephrase my original point, and say that with an econ major that most value comes from building your quantitative thinking skills, so take as many quantitative courses as you can (so if your college offers a BA or a BS, I would recommend the BS for those extra quantitative core requirements).",

      "text": "I saw you commented about Economics and Math, so I'll just copy + paste two comments I made for people who were in a similar situation as you are right now:\n\n\"Whoever said that with a Math and/or Econ degree you can only teach is a bit cray, that's so far from the truth. If you doubt that, just go in any job posting site and look for jobs that are seeking Econ or Math grads. If you are unsure about what you can do with a Math degree, check this out [https://www.siam.org/students-education/programs-initiatives/thinking-of-a-career-in-applied-mathematics](https://www.siam.org/students-education/programs-initiatives/thinking-of-a-career-in-applied-mathematics) and download the brochure. The opportunities are endless and doesn't stop there. Basically as everyone said, the sum of an Econ and a Math degree will give you lots of amazing opportunities and you won't be stuck with just one type of job for the rest of your life.\n\nI double major in Mathematics and Economics and being a professor never even passed through my mind and I just know I'll never have to do that. Both majors will help you develop quantitative skills and those are highly looked upon at many job positions.\"\n\n\"I think I\u2019m a little late to this but I still hope I can help. The idea that math degrees won\u2019t open you doors for the software world is a huge misconception, you can have amazing software opportunities, and not just that. You would only need to learn coding by yourself and take some CS classes in university.\n\nThe beautiful thing about Math is that you can not only land jobs in the software industry, as well as you can in... Well, anywhere! Math gives you quantitative skills that are useful in any field, it IS true that you can work in business with Math, but it\u2019s not ONLY in business nor ONLY in research, that\u2019s such a big lie that it hurts.\n\nIf you like Math more than CS, I would definitely support the idea of Majoring in the first and Minoring in the latter, that can\u2019t go wrong. (I might be a little biased here as a Econ and Math (with an Area of Emphasis on CS) double major lol)\n\nCS really seems to be a more of high-paying-job-right-off-graduation type of Degree and that\u2019s tempting if you\u2019re not interested in getting a Masters or anything, but have in mind you will still have to study everyday after you graduate because CS is technology and technology is changing and updating itself everyday and you don\u2019t wanna be left behind.\"\n\nIf you have any questions about Econ, I'll be more than happy to answer them!",
