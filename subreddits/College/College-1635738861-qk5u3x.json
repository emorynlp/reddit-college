  "text": "this is my third semester of college but i\u2019m technically still a freshman due to the absolute dumpster fire that was the spring 2021 semester. i\u2019ve changed my major approximately six times now. before i started applying for schools i wanted to become a nurse like my mother, but i am absolutely terrible at math so i was like, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d i was accepted as an english major to college. i went from english to political science to early childhood education to general studies to a business-geared ICP (individualized curriculum program) and i realized that i have no motivation for this particular field. i just decided to drop half of my course load and prepare for next semester because i finally decided what i want to do. too bad i didn\u2019t come to this revelation sooner so i could have saved everyone a lot of time \ud83d\ude02",
