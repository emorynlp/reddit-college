I\u2019ve been feeling really weird lately about missing my \u201cold life.\u201d I know some people don\u2019t find their people in high school, but I had a couple great friends who I\u2019ve had some amazing times with who I really miss. At college, I have made a group of friends and we\u2019re all very close already. But I still have this weird feeling, that it\u2019s very strange I had people I loved back home and now, suddenly, all our times are just gone. I want to transfer to my state school where my best friends are, but honestly, it also makes me sad to think to leave my friends here too. I just feel like it\u2019s so unnatural to know people for 14 years, and then suddenly get up and leave one day, to only see them once every couple months.", "author": "nonlinearhate", "created": 1632103557, "retrieved": 1632801379, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdn6hy5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prlgt2/missing_high_school_friends_and_old_life_wanting/hdn6hy5/", "text": "A high school friend of mine actually just reached out to me and told me she feels the same way you do. She said she wants to transfer to the university I'm currently at because she misses the good times we used to have with our friend group and she's homesick (we're both juniors). For me, while I value the friends I've made here, I particularly miss my high school friends. I'm not sure how to explain it, but there's a level of closeness I have with them that I don't quite have with many of my friends here.", "author": "i_do_the_kokomo", "created": 1632174497, "upvotes": 1}, "hdl3ri9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prlgt2/missing_high_school_friends_and_old_life_wanting/hdl3ri9/", "text": "It\u2019s the strangest thing cause right after I graduated high school I had gotten my drivers license(I was a little behind cause I didn\u2019t have a car and needed to save up some money up for a driver instructor that would let me use theirs). I remember my instructor(also a teacher)had asked me if I still talked to my old high school friends and I had told him that I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have many friends from there and the ones I did have, I wasn\u2019t that close to. Anyhow, when I told him I didn\u2019t, he said that it was a very good thing. I was kind of taken back by that, but he explained how most of the people you knew in high school are going on to their own lives, will be moving away, and deciding what kind of people they want to be. That it\u2019s better to move on and find new people that will have different opinions and beliefs than you. They might introduce you to new things and other new people. \n\nThe college you are at, why did you pick it? I\u2019m guessing you have reasons for leaving other than just missing your friends? Do you have little interest in your major? You are right that it\u2019s strange we know people for so long, only to just up and leave one day. However, if these are your true friends then you should be able to pick back up where you left off with them when you get home. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong to be home sick, or even for people to go to school where they are from. I just think it\u2019s important to really consider what college you go to and why you are going there. Everyone has their own reasons for going, but there are definitely wrong reasons. Personally, I go to my school cause my major is unique. I know other people from my high school simply went for the culture(parties). I just suggest that you consider your future and what priorities you have regarding your education before deciding on what\u2019s the best move for you.", "author": "WickedPuffin", "created": 1632142974, "upvotes": 1}, "hdkcsff": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prlgt2/missing_high_school_friends_and_old_life_wanting/hdkcsff/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632122312, "upvotes": 1}, "hdk785o": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prlgt2/missing_high_school_friends_and_old_life_wanting/hdk785o/", "text": "I feel you. I moved to Arizona for college, I am from Missouri, so it\u2019s about a 23 hour drive. I get that feeling sometimes as well. I don\u2019t get to go home until December 19 and that seems like forever. I don\u2019t have a whole lot of friends, but the ones I did have back home have all reached out to me. I know social media communication isn\u2019t the same as in person, but it does beat not seeing/talking to them at all.
