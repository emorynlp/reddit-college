  "title:": "gonna be in community college living w my parents until I'm almost 22 and i feel like a failure",
  "text": "I am turning 19 in December, graduated hs in June and currently, I'm taking a gap year because I'm suuuuuper mentally unwell and unfit to just. go about life.\n\nbecause of this, my grades were horrible senior year and I didn't even apply to college. So I'm gonna be spending the next three years at home getting better and doing community college before transferring somewhere else to get a bachelor's. And I'm gonna be 22 by then. I'm gonna be 22 and will have done literally nothing because I ruined my own life. and I feel like an embarrassment living at home with my parents for so long\n\nHas anyone else felt the same way? Or has been in a similar situation? I feel like I've messed up my entire life. I don't even crave the college experience at all. I just think I'm doing everything wrong.\n\nedit: wowww I'm so blown away by the amount of people who took the time to write out their experiences and give me some well needed assurance! i appreciate all of you ",

Now I\u2019m 31, make damn good money, have a wife, kids, own a big house, drive nice cars\u2026etc. \n\nRelax. You\u2019re not that old, 22 is not that old. One of the biggest benefits of a degree is that it helps you ramp up your income quickly. You can go from living with mom at 24 to owning a house at 26, and you\u2019ll be galaxies ahead of many of your peers.",

That said, I did take a lot of business courses, and of what helps me day to day in my job, knowledge from business courses accounts for maybe 20% of it? So definitely not zero! I would also say that a lot of my peers have degrees in business, mostly marketing focused. My most stressed advice for business majors is to intern, intern, intern\u2026 that will go a LONG way in getting a good job. After that I\u2019d say that if your program isn\u2019t super quantitative, then you should 100% take some more math than just basic stats (maybe take an econometrics course), and if you can squeeze in some computer science (automating my life in python makes it so much better\u2026)",

      "text": "I don't agree with the sentiment of having to leave home the moment you turn 18. It's a weird thing Western countries have made into an expectation, and anyone who doesn't comply is frowned upon. There are a million reasons a person could have to continue living with parents. People argue that you have to learn to be independent, but living at home does not at all mean that you can't gain independence. In many cultures, leaving home isn't even a thing until you're married or planning for a family. It's straight up harmful that people have to struggle just because of this culture of leaving home when you could otherwise stay and find your feet and receive support.\n\nWent on a little tangent, but I think it vaguely applies to your situation. There's nothing wrong with your situation, it's just different from what you typically hear about. You achieving something at a different stage in life than someone else does not make you inferior. Your past doesn't matter anymore, what matters is that you're working towards building a better future for yourself. Being on the road to getting a degree at 22 is better than doing nothing at 22. You have a goal, and you're working towards it no matter what you have to do to get there, and that's admirable and it's not something that can be said for everyone else.",

Tried again the next semester, took two courses, dropped them both. \nTook a couple years to work on my mental problems- which still need work of course- and make a little bit of money working. I live with my family still, a lot of days I struggle to make myself a decent meal or even just shower. But I\u2019m better now than I was back then. So much better, and I honestly didn\u2019t think it was possible. I\u2019ve had lots of \u201cfailures\u201d and through them I\u2019ve learned what I need to do in order to succeed. \nI recently took another two courses and completed them both. Even through that experience I\u2019ve learned what I need to do to support myself in order to increase my chances of success. \n\nAlso:\nDon\u2019t move out though unless your living environment is toxic and negatively impacting your mental health more than being alone or with a roommate would. Seriously, a lot of money is saved by staying with the parents. And if you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll feed you too. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin your life. And I didn\u2019t ruin mine. Sometimes things happen that are out of our control, and that\u2019s okay. There is no set time you have to graduate from college. 22 is quite young to be graduating I would say. \nYour health- and your mental health is included in that- is much more important than getting a piece of paper by a certain age.\nIt\u2019s okay. Nothing is doomed.\nYou have a plan for what you will do with the time. That is a great thing. The time will pass regardless, so the fact that you know how you will move forward is nothing to scoff at.",

I dropped out, got my GED, and for some reason shot straight into college. Got a D and a W. I needed a break, I was in such a bad place mentally. Got better, transferred into nursing school and hated it. I finish my associate's in December and transferring into a college I'm actually excited about in the spring with a 3.8 GPA. \n\nPoint is, I am 22, and will be 24 when this is all over. We all go at our own pace. You are doing nothing wrong. In fact I think what you're doing is very smart and thoughtful. There's this narrative that you have to be successful and settled so young and it's just a lie. You're gonna do great!",

We both learned to code and he\u2019s since had two jobs as a programmer, and now we\u2019re working on a startup together. Only real difference between us is that I have student loans to pay off, and many of my college peers do as well.\n\nYou\u2019re 22. College is not going to determine your life, but what you choose to do with your time will. Unless you want to do something that requires college (ex practice medicine) it doesn\u2019t matter. The current college system is actually dying. The best thing you can do right now is figure out who you are, how to survive, and what you want to spend your time doing. That\u2019s honestly what your early 20s are for. No ones expecting you to have everything together.\n\nAlso, if you want to you can always hang out and make friends with people at the school you want to go to. Relationships were probably the primary value I walked away with. But you don\u2019t need to attend to walk around the campus, go in the library, or even sit in on some large lecture hall lectures",
