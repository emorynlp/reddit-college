  "text": "My teacher as you can see by the picture thinks people in the class cheated, so he reverse curved our grades and so many of us lost huge portions of our grades. Since he curved our overall grade as opposed to the final, I lost 9.5% off my grade, one girl in my class lost 13% going from an A- to a C+. It honestly sucks he took out his anger upon the whole class, without any proof of actually cheating. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2m4zuuh68p561.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f980308edc662f195b004ceb598b2e833567c9",

For instance, my history exams were all open book yet people cheated using quizlet and other mediums. \n\nAll of those classes are pre-requisites for higher courses, I just wanna see how do they do in proctored exams. \n\nAlso, people insulting my math professor when he addressed his concerns about people cheating in the class. People saying he is a dick when they were actually cheating... \n\nI am sorry for those of you who don\u2019t cheat. But my experience in college so far is just a bunch of cheaters that I don\u2019t even know why they are in college. \n\nI do agree this sucks for the ones who don\u2019t cheat; however, there is clearly something wrong.\n\nAt the end of they day the innocent pays the price of the sinner.

So basically he\u2019s punishing everyone but he\u2019s mostly punishing students who didn\u2019t cheat.\n\nWhat does this mean, students now NEED to cheat in order to be competitive. Not cheating is just not an option as the risk associated with cheating is far lower than the reward (not getting a terrible grade). You\u2019d think a professor in the school of business would\u2019ve taken economics or risk analysis and understanding this. People just don\u2019t think do they.\n\nWhat he should do is simple and takes someone who views this from an outside perspective a few minutes to come up with. He should eliminate tests (or make them a small percentage of the grade). Because it\u2019s accounting, he could very easily make projects and challenging assignments a larger portion of the grade. Or perhaps video assignments where students explain their work or how to approach a problem.",

      "text": "this is why school is such bullshit. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is the school's fault. Schools have the power to attempt to prevent cheating remotely through online programs such as respondus lockdown browser. I'm not saying this is a bullet proof method but it is one more step in ensuring integrity. Schools can't expect everyone to be full of \"integrity\". Students have so much stress on them to get perfect grades instead of actually learning.\n\nEven though teachers expect the same trend every year, we are under unusual circumstances. Maybe because people were at home they had more time to study? maybe they didnt? I don't think it's fair for teachers to judge students without solid proof. \n\nI saw some people posted that these \"reverse curves\" are normal for some accounting classes. I took accounting classes and honestly, the grade you earned was the grade you got without curves. I would have been salty if this happened to me and I really don't think it teaches anyone anything, especially people who worked hard for their grades. If anything, people might be more inclined to cheat to get the highest grades possible so this reverse curve won't hurt them as much.   Either punish the people who did it or no one at all. \n\nI also want to add, if a student can look up an answer or exact exams on Google. Maybe the professor should create more original exams to make cheating more difficult to do? There could be some laziness here or not enough time to prepare because of covid. Lastly, if averages are 50%.. maybe professions should consider re-evaluating their class, the material they teach, and what is on the exam because along the way there are obviously some disconnects.\n\nSeems rather petty and unprofessional; on top of being an abuse of power.",

If curved using a normal distribution, someone who got a perfect score would still have an A. But someone who got a perfect score in this accounting class would have an 87.",

      "text": "I understand why he thought there were cheaters. I've been teaching the same two courses every semester for the past 7 years and I can attest that for each class, the grade distribution is extremely similar across semesters; they're practically the same. So it's extremely suspicious if all of a sudden the grade distribution is so much different than in previous years. Also bear in mind that to push the class average by 12.5 percentage points would require unexpected performance from many students (unless the class size is really small).\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't go about it the way this prof did. My uni requires proof of cheating to punish a student (partly because the punishment for it is very harsh), so this wouldn't fly here. I would probably suck it up and hand out high grades for the semester and adjust for next semester to account for increased possibility of cheating. Maybe make exams require some creativity to solve and open book or scrap exams and move towards research papers.",

Everyone in the engineering section got 100% and none of us were worried about it until grades actually showed up online and he'd given us 80/100...\n\nWe all threw a fit but he said \"it's on the syllabus!\" So we spread on the class discussion that we were going to boycott the second exam, because if we all got 0 points then we should, according to the syllabus, still get 80/100. He said we couldn't do this, a few students went to the dean who offered a compromise saying that if people went to the 2nd exam that we'd all get 100/100 on the 1st exam and the syllabus would be amended to not curve down if the average was >80%.",

I saw another post where a student at my university was sleeping in the kitchen every night because the apartment their family lived in was too small -- younger siblings took the bed and mom took the sofa)\n\nIt really pisses me off to no end that some professors have the nerve to think just because we're at home means we can suddenly dedicate all our time to their class & and that they're actually *surprised* that nobody's learning anything.

Usually this worked but for computer architecture we had someone who already had a degree and had been working for 10 years in that field (his company required him to retake a handful of courses every 10 years for recertification). His exam scores were around like 95%...the next highest score \\~65%...which was actually below 70% of 95...so no one in the class but him passed most of the exams. Did the professor omit him from the curve? Nope! But he did add a flat 15% to everyone else's score which still didn't make up the difference and there were a lot of F's that semester (I was lucky to manage a C)",

If the average is below that, curving will bring it up, as he says. If the average is above that, curving will bring it down. The average was *way* above that.

Some scholarships and honors programs require minimum GPAs (I'm on one myself with a 3.3 minimum); maybe they were having a rough semester and getting an A in this class was something they were counting on to stay above the minimum, and the professor just nuked their whole academic career by robbing them of again a perfectly legitimate, sorely needed A.",

How many times must I and others repeat this -- to a self-outed professor, no less?\n\nHe's not \"punishing\" the class by curving (OK, I would argue that any curve is a punishment to students in and of itself, but you know what I'm really saying: curving is a feature of the course, and this aligns with it); he's explaining that, as a consequence of suspected cheating, the class average came out abnormally high. Because of the high average, he had to curve down, instead of what students usually expect (curve up). All curving does is maintain a normal distribution of grades.\n\nHad the students not cheated, it is likely he would have curved up, which would have been a consequence of needing to raise lower scores to bring them within a regular distribution. Is any of this fair? In my opinion, no. That's why I avoid professors who are dull enough to be curving in 2020 outside of extreme STEM courses.",

No self respecting professor curves a grade down.\n\nEdit: the real crime here though is curving like this without warning. If your class is going to be curved to the normal distribution and that\u2019s in the syllabus, then I disagree but fine that\u2019s your prerogative. But doing anything retroactively like this, especially now when there\u2019s literally no way for students to take it into account and put extra effort into future assignments, is just awful.
