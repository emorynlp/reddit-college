Econ is a degree like Chem or Psych or Math: your options for careers will be greatly limits until you get a Graduate degree, preferably PhD.\n\nThe way I see it, there are 3 types of Bach Degrees: the ones that put you to work, the ones that advance a career you already have, and the ones that are just a stepping stone to Graduate school.\n\nIf you want to get a Bach degree and go right to work, go with Engineering, Nurisng, Computer Science, Accounting, etc. \n\nIf you're majoring in something like Business or Criminal Justice, you've better already be working in the field and just looking to take your career to the next level.\n\nIf you're majoring in Bio or Econ, you'd better make plans to apply for another school before you even graduate.",

              "text": "Key word there is \"If paired with.\" A Bach in physics could be worthwhile without grad school if paired with Engineering, a Bach in biology could be worthwhile without grad school is paired with a nursing. Which is why Engineering has multiples physics and Nurisng and multiple bio courses as pre-reqs for their upper level classes. The degree that you can pair with math to make math useful already have the necessary math baked into the degree plan. If you want more, sure, you can't use up an elective or do minor, but its no going to give you the kind of edge that just taking more classes directly related to your major will.\n\nI have a BBA in Finance, and I 100% agree with him. \"Cancerous\" might be a tad hyperbolic, but yeah, I agree with that sentiment wholeheartedly. Imho, anyone who wants to get into a finance should go with accounting instead and take finance Electives. It's a BBA regardless. BBAs in accounting can work in finance and earn a CFA without any extra coursework needed, but BBAs in finance will need more courses to be eligible to sit for a CPA exam. Most \"finance\" jobs are just sales gigs for Financial institutions, anyways.",
