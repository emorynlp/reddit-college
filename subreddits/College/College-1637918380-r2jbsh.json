      "text": "In my experience, there is no friendly, only formally polite. I would suggest looking at it in that way instead because sometimes what you think is a friendly tone may be breaching unprofessional for some profs, especially if it's over the internet where tone can be misread easily. \n\nIf I were to request a follow up, I would usually word it like this: \n\n\"Dear (appropriate honorific) Last Name,\n\nHope you are doing well.\n\nI am (name + class) reaching out to follow up on (insert what you need here) as it has been some time since I last wrote to you. I understand you may be busy, and I am in no rush myself, I would only like to keep updated on (insert what you need here). Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n(Your name).\"",

We\u2019re taught in elementary school to say \u201cdear\u201d and \u201csincerely\u201d, but realistically most adults don\u2019t say either of them",
