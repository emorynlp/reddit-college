I suck at using a real life planner, I\u2019m on my phone a lot so I would benefit from an app very well. Anyone have suggestions?",

I find my google calendar immensely helpful in reminding me about everything (not just homework, but bills). \n\nYou can set it to remind you X amount of days or hours before an event, and even remind you multiple times. You can also change the notification settings to not be able to dismiss is until you remove it from your calendar.",
