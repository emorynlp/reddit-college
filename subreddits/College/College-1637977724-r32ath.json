  "text": "As a junior in high school, I feel like my transcript isn't good enough. I'm not into sports and I'm not the leader of any clubs. I do hope to get an officer position in one of the clubs I'm in, but it's not guaranteed. My grades are good, but not astonishing. There's this college I have my eye on that's competitive but not ivy league level. I'm just scared for the future.",

      "text": "Bro I graduated HS with a 2.3, had to beg teachers to change my Fs to Ds so I could graduate, and was super depressed. I failed most of my first year at community college. Now I\u2019m at a prestigious state school with a good GPA, just accepted an internship that pays more than most people\u2019s full-time salaries, and will graduate into a six-figure job at a massive company.\n\nNobody expected that from the kid who wanted to kill himself daily and hardly graduated. Work on yourself, improve, drive forward. You got it.",
