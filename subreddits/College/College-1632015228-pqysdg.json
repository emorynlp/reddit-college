  "text": "hi friends. I am in need of advice about my current roommate situation. so we filled out roommate preferences at my school and my roommate selected that she goes to sleep BY midnight on the form. I go to sleep between 10-11.\n\nhowever since we arrived at college she\u2019s been up until 1:30-2 and not just up but loud. she\u2019s turned on all the lights, closed doors pretty loudly, makes food in our room which is super loud in the microwave when I\u2019m sleeping. I keep waking up all the time and I haven\u2019t slept well in a month. i have insomnia which is why imI in bed at 10pm so every time I get waken up at 1:30-2 I can\u2019t fall asleep for another hour or so. have to wake up at 6am every morning for classes and i already have depression and really need sleep to feel good every day.\n\nI know it\u2019s not reasonable to be like \u201cgo to sleep by 12\u201d but idk if it\u2019s unreasonable to ask her not to slam doors and everything this late. also I know sometimes students have homework bc I am also extremely busy and not that it matters but she\u2019s just up watching TV for hours. just last night I was woken up at 11:30, 12:30, 1, and 1:30 and finally fell asleep around THREE. had I known this would happen I would\u2019ve chosen another roommate. also does anyone have any advise. earplugs and face mask are not enough at this point. thank U.",

      "text": "No its not unreasonable to ask. If they dont stop doing that you should tell an RA, but honestly theres only so much you can do. If it gets to that point put in a room transfer request. But keep in mind you might get someone worse. Sharing a single room with a stranger is almost always shitty, its just something you have to get through",

      "text": "Some ResLife people are instructed to mediate rather than intervene themselves, and have you create a dialogue between you and the roommate, and hopefully end up creating a roommate contract. If that\u2019s an option for you I would wholeheartedly recommend it for this type of situation. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly useful and helpful to establish those boundaries because it\u2019s possible if you haven\u2019t confronted them directly, they might not be aware about how it\u2019s affecting you.\n\nHaving your mutual rules written out and agreed upon by the both of you can hopefully save your relationship and might mean you won\u2019t have to move!",
