  "text": "I\u2019m a current freshman who\u2019s pursuing a BME major. I decided to look up BME job outlooks, especially on Reddit, and saw negative results.\n\nI decided on BME because I wanted to incorporate engineering with the medicinal field, but I read that your skills aren\u2019t defined in a specific field, which can turn off employers.\n\nI have aspirations to go to pharmacy or med school, but I really am considering not due to extra years of school.\n\nI want to work a job that doesn\u2019t isolate me from others (essentially I would be around other people). Will as BME major do that?",
