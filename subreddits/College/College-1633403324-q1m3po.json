  "text": "Hello everyone, I\u2019ll be starting college in January and I\u2019m super nervous. After high school I did this and that for a little bit, then I drove a truck for a couple years. Now at 23, I\u2019ve made the decision to go back to school so I can be a teacher, this has always been my passion.\n\nI am however nervous, my family doesn\u2019t support my decision and they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m \u201cnot college material\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t an A student in HS but I\u2019m eager to learn. I\u2019ll be full time. Any tips or tricks anyone can give? I\u2019m going for my Masters in History with a minor in secondary education. Any information as to what to expect, homework, anything really. Thank you all so much in advance.",
