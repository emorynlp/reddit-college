  "text": "For reference, I am an accounting major. \n\nIn my city, there is a significant foreign population. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that 40-50% of my class consisted of Chinese green card holders. Based on what I have seen from their writing samples, e.g., group work, text messages, and general written statements, their English writing skills are not up to par with native English speakers.\n\nThe reason I am using them as an example for my post is simple. These foreign graduates are able to secure positions with many reputable firms in the area. Their high GPA is a testament to their hard work and \"intelligence.\" \n\nHowever, a skill that takes decades to develop is English writing. I am a non-native English speaker, and I have spent decades on writing and improving upon my writing prowess. At present, while I am able to articulate my thoughts in a more coherent manner than before, I still struggle with conveying technical concepts to people, especially clients.\n\nSince many people, including college professors, have lamented about the poor writing skills among even native English speakers with college degrees, would being able to write well give someone a competitive advantage in the job market.\n\nIf I want to market myself based on my communication skills instead of my subpar GPA, how would I do it in an effective manner?\n\nIn terms of accounting, communication skills are vital to the profession, especially in public accounting. Professional service usually entails communicating with internal and external personnel. From my experience when working as an analyst, writing skills were of exceptional importance. I communicated with clients mostly by email, and informative and quality writing is a must. If I wrote with poor grammar or sentence structure, it would reflect badly upon me or my organization.",

      "text": "If you know it's a strength, lean on it. Do any and everything to get that skill on paper, as in publicised, graded, recommended etc. The problem with skills like that is to get them on a CV. Make sure your language suits your target in your letter, don't jump at it like an opportunity to show you can use big words etc. \n\n\nIf you did make some friends as an analyst, ask one to write you a letter of recommendation or something (will always have more weight the more weight they have, and the less they have to gain from doing so. Don't ask your uncle to do so etc.). \n\n\nYou'll likely still have trouble competing with that alone, on paper. But there is the other thing you can do, communicate. Make friends and work on your public image, both as seeming competent, and more importantly, not an a hole (which often is the other side of that coin). \n\n\nGrades will get you ahead, but people who hire you will have to work with you. A fitting personality is also important is what I'm getting at. And that you kind of answered your own question, use your skills. Again, I would add; try to get them quantified somehow.",

I have confidence that my writing prowess can take me a long way in my field, but it is not exceptionally good enough for any sort of published work.\n\nI can match up well against non-native English speakers, but I still have my doubts when competing with native English speakers with college degrees in terms of writing abilities.",

I am truly fluent, I spoke both languages as a child, but on paper my third language (which is a good deal less developed) seems better. This because I haven't a single grade to put me apart from the rest. \n\n\nI don't even know if this is helpful. But what I'm getting at is that apart from using your language; which requires you get close enough to do so, getting it out there can show it off as different even before you get to it.",
