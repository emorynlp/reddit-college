  "text": "I've been thinking a bit this morning...\n\nIt seems like there has been a steady uptick in the number of students who go straight to the dean, the provost, the president, or another high-ranking administrator when they have an issue with a professor (regardless of whether the complaint is a valid one, which they sometimes are). We (professors and others) often view these situations with mild bewilderment/amusement as 1) going several levels ahead on the chain of command tends to make the complainant look foolish, especially when the complaint is not a valid one, and 2) high-ranking administrators almost never get involved in student-professor matters and typically send complaints back down to the department chair, anyway.\n\nIt is often easy to assume that the students who engage in this behavior have an inflated sense of entitlement, have no regard for organizational structure, seem not to understand the way higher ed works and that professors don't have \"bosses\" or \"managers\" in the retail/customer service sense...the list goes on. \n\nHowever, rather than just making these assumptions, I wanted to ask the hive mind here. What makes students (whether this applies to you or someone you know) engage in this behavior? Are there other beliefs or assumptions students have that don't get discussed? Is it really just entitlement and/or a lack of understanding of the system? Or are there other potential explanations?\n\nI have never (to my knowledge) had a complaint against me, but I see evidence of this phenomenon a lot on platforms like Reddit and in social media groups, and I've heard stories from colleagues, so it just has me wondering.",

      "text": "it\u2019s easier to go to someone\u2019s \u201cboss\u201d and have their superior email them saying \u201cthis anonymous student had this issue with you\u201d than to bring it up with the professor and risk them becoming upset with you. \n\nit could also be a past negative experience. in 10th grade i had a teacher accuse me of plagiarism and report me to the principal, after i cleared it up i emailed him asking for an apology for questioning my character and potentially getting me in a large amount of trouble. instead he shared the email with a fellow teacher and the other teacher brought it up with me saying it made me \u201clook stupid\u201d. it hurt my feelings and was incredibly disrespectful so i avoided going to him directly with any complaints.\n\nthere could also just be that they don\u2019t like you and want to try to get you in trouble by going to the highest ranking person at the school with their complaint. \n\nim sure there\u2019s other reasons but these are the ones i could think of",
