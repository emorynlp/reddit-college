{"sid": "ptzlfi", "link": "/r/college/comments/ptzlfi/question_for_the_students/", "title:": "Question for the Students", "text": "I've been thinking a bit this morning...\n\nIt seems like there has been a steady uptick in the number of students who go straight to the dean, the provost, the president, or another high-ranking administrator when they have an issue with a professor (regardless of whether the complaint is a valid one, which they sometimes are). We (professors and others) often view these situations with mild bewilderment/amusement as 1) going several levels ahead on the chain of command tends to make the complainant look foolish, especially when the complaint is not a valid one, and 2) high-ranking administrators almost never get involved in student-professor matters and typically send complaints back down to the department chair, anyway.\n\nIt is often easy to assume that the students who engage in this behavior have an inflated sense of entitlement, have no regard for organizational structure, seem not to understand the way higher ed works and that professors don't have \"bosses\" or \"managers\" in the retail/customer service sense...the list goes on. \n\nHowever, rather than just making these assumptions, I wanted to ask the hive mind here. What makes students (whether this applies to you or someone you know) engage in this behavior? Are there other beliefs or assumptions students have that don't get discussed? Is it really just entitlement and/or a lack of understanding of the system? Or are there other potential explanations?\n\nI have never (to my knowledge) had a complaint against me, but I see evidence of this phenomenon a lot on platforms like Reddit and in social media groups, and I've heard stories from colleagues, so it just has me wondering.", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1632416349, "retrieved": 1632946108, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
