  "text": "I forgot to register for next term and feel sick to my stomach because not only can I not trust myself to meet important dates but now I'll have to be in college longer because I'm technically wasting half a year on a random course when it could have been avoided. I just need words of advice right now because I 'v got no hope for myself.",
