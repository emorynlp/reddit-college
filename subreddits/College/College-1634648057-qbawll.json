  "text": "Dad here. Daughter is a junior in HS now, and planning on taking physics in college. What's the calculator of choice nowadays? When I was in college back in the stone age, it was all HP and RPN. I think it's more TI now??? \n\nAnd how are you physics/engineering students taking notes? Do you take a laptop/tablet to class at all? Paper & pencil?",

      "text": "Depends on her major. Ti 84 is what I used for a graphing calculator and Ti 30 for scientific. Got me through calc 1-3, physics 1-2 and discrete math. CS major for reference.\n\nAs for notes, I have a notebook for each class but if the new surface laptop studio was available when I started school then that's how I'd be writing my notes. I still bring the laptop to each class so saving some weight in the backpack would be nice.\n\nI've seen people use tablets for notes, pen and paper and 2 in 1 pcs that have a rotating touch screen to write notes. Also using note applications on their laptops. It's a matter of preference when it comes down to it.",

      "text": "Ti84 is most common but it doesn\u2019t really matter too much, it\u2019s very very nice to have a calculator that can do integrals and has a solver application though\n(I have the Ti84 Plus CE, i like it and haven\u2019t had any problems but most engineers use the Ti84 Plus) \n\ni take my notes on paper and don\u2019t use my laptop in class, some kids use ipads or whatever and do it on that but that\u2019s just not my preference\n\nchemical engineering for reference",
