  "text": "So I finished my finals, and was ready to graduate. After the summer break I come back to find I didn\u2019t pass a class, and that I\u2019m not going to be able to graduate\u2026 All throughout the summer break I was getting emails on updates on the plans for graduation, as though I passed. No one told me I failed a class, or that I wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate. No emails, no calls, nothing that would tell me I had something to fix or work on\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 I\u2019m ashamed and terrified to tell my family and friends\u2026 is there anything I can do? Or am I just screwed? Please help.",
