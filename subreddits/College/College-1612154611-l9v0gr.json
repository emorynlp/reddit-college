  "text": "My school is a *small* college, less than 4,000 kids go here. And yet, we have 100+ currently active cases in the past two weeks.\n\nI haven't gone partying. I wear a mask, and yet I've possibly been exposed to covid because my friend's boyfriend went to a frat party this weekend with a huge group of freshmen on Friday.\n\nThe frat president tested positive, and now these guys I know are freaking out, saying \"omg so sorry guys but y'all gotta get tested.\" If you are one of these people, FUCK YOU. If you actually cared, you wouldn't be partying and getting wasted every weekend. Go fuck yourself. I have ZERO sympathy and if you get suspended, it would honestly make my day.\n\nI don't want to be sent home less than 3 wks into the semester b/c of these jerks.",

It\u2019s kinda like right now, I have to study for a quiz but I\u2019m on Reddit. However, I am going to in person classes because being on campus makes me more productive and focused for some reason, and I actually retain the information better from in person lectures rather than online videos and I often hear students going to amusement parks or eating outside. They also eat on campus during this pandemic. It\u2019s crazy how people don\u2019t care about covid as much as they did a year ago. I guess society just got used to it and it\u2019s a bad thing. Just because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get it, doesn\u2019t means others will have the same effect.",

I'm taking precautions because I love and care about them dearly, and want to make sure that I don't spread it to the ones that I love. \n\nOne of my friend's roommates was partying and ended up catching and spreading covid to her 8 roommates, and my friend ended up in the hospital. \n\nmy point was that I wish people would be more considerate of others, one's who also have people in their lives with high risk, or just don't care because \"it's life.\" if people truly felt that way they would realize how precious life is, and would try their best to make sure that they don't cause harm to anyone else. I understand that covid is most likely going to be a thing for a very long time, but it's still new.

Grad students get screwed out of chances to find labs, do research, work on their thesis, get funded, actually graduate, and a crapton of other things that directly impact our future.  Your faculty members have the same problem.  If they don't get funding and get published, their jobs can be at risk if they're not tenured, and even the seasoned professors can have issues.  Losing money leads to more of the staff losing their jobs.  Shutdowns mean that more undergrads who can't do research or internships and get screwed when they try to apply to post-graduate programs.\n\nIf you think it doesn't affect you, it does and it affects the people around you too.",

Like all of the people I know who have had it. \n\nI wish people would stop spouting this \"LoNg TeRm DaMaGe\" nonsense when there is absolutely no proof of long term damage in people with mild cases, only in people who were put on ventilators, which is only a tiny fraction of people who get it. Also, I think saying there's \"permanent\" damage for a virus that has only been here a year is magnificently stupid, even ignoring the fact that there's no solid proof of that. \n\nThis virus clearly isn't going to go away and I'm tired of people fear-mongering or saying we're selfish for wanting our lives back. Virtual learning sucks and it's been proven in scientific studies to not be effective and that it is damaging students education. Locking down for years on end and damaging our society and economy isn't worth only avoiding a virus with a 99% survival rate.",

I see way more people now in their 40s-64 who are really suffering from this disease. What happens when you see you parents or people go home in travel. Maybe your parents aren\u2019t at risk but your roommates or friends. The selfish part is doing not understanding that everyone wants there lives back, but it takes a collective effort to ease strain on the health care system and society.  Not participating in a collective effort to combat a global crisis is very selfish.",

The alternative is economic collapse, increased suicide rates, increased poverty, major loss of educational retention, etc. Many economists have predicted there will be more deaths from hunger and poverty because of lockdowns than from covid itself. \n\nAt some point we have to realize there are other things we as a society have to be worried about. The death rate for people in their 50s is still only 3\\~5%. Even for elderly the chances of dying are only 1/10. Life has risks and I am not going to stop actually living my life because of them. \n\nIf someone is really that scared of getting the virus, it is up to them to make a plan to protect themselves. Them and their family can make the choices they feel necessary. Other peoples health isn't my responsibility. My health isn't other people's responsibility. Even before covid, there were people that can't even leave their house at all because they are so immunocompromised, but life still went on. As it should.",

The Federal reserve prints the money which makes money you do have lose value. I dont trust the government an ince with any sort of \"social net\". Just take a look at the welfare state and the ponzi scheme known as social security. I trust my own hands infinitely more than any hands in government. \n\nI dont recall saying anything against students getting help for schooling but if you would like to go down that road, I can travel down it. College is more expensive for several reasons, 1) the government helps subsidize it through federal loans given to every man woman and child that asks for it. Colleges know this and just increase prices by however much the government gives out in loans because they know you can spend it. 2) college is extremely overvalued and in ridiculously high demand. Everyone and their mother is told to go off to college when college is not for everyone. Learning a trade or going to work straight after high school is an option for a lot of people as well. Not everyone needs a college degree and those that do have one might not even be using it in their career. 3) yes colleges like to rip you off left right and center so they price their schooling at absurdly high costs. They know they can do that because of student loans and the lack of understanding what the sunk cost fallacy is.",

Testing and tracking is an extremely severe breach in privacy and security and government has taken away. Governmental surveillance on its own people is horrendous and completely unconstitutional. Edward Snowden is an American hero for exposing it as such. As much as I love Japan (which I really do), our cultures are not even remotely similar. Long before covid they had a precident that if you were sick, you wear a mask. This is why covid was essentially eradicated there ages ago. The healthy did not have to wear a mask. In the US, no such action was taken. Masks were made mandatory to everyone, even the healthy which is incredibly stupid. \n\n2) The right to peacefully assemble is not strictly limited to protesting. Being able to visit family or go out to a dine in sit down restaurant also falls under 1A. Sure there are alternatives to this. They aren't even in the same boat as meeting with someone and being able to see their smiling faces in person directly infront of you. If you and the other person test negative for covid, what exactly is stopping you and said other person from meeting each other, without a mask and within the 6' distancing garbage? If neither of you have it why must you wear a mask and keep yourself distanced from each other? Isn't the mask supposed to stop others from getting it? Not to protect you from getting it from others?",

It's also frowned upon to take pictures of hospital hallways, well, because it shows those hallways are actually **empty** and not overcrowded with Covid patients, unlike what the News said.\n\nBut yeah, it's just nice seeing someone on here actually see through that though, and *not* advocate for **reporting** their own friend group to the police for not wearing a mask xP",

It\u2019s this new change that no one predicted, but everyone hates. People are tired of this, they want to go back to some degree of normal. Is it annoying and stupid that people are fake caring, yes 100%. Am I tired of following the rules while others have fun, absolutely. However, I feel that mentality is exactly what our peers are feeling. They are done, they just want a college experience, they just want some fun social interaction that they have been deprived of. Some people are stupid for doing this(downplaying the virus), and other just don\u2019t care anymore. It is selfish, it is infuriating, it\u2019s harmful, but it is forgivable. They are still people suffered like us: they deserve normal.\n\n\nBut the students who never cared in the first place? unforgivable.\n\n\nYou are a good person. Thank you for following the rules.

Yes most young people don\u2019t die which you are absolutely correct about and I don\u2019t mean to be alarmist but it\u2019s not nothing either and I think a lot of young people are willing to accept more risk in general despite the consequences.

The fact that the older age groups only have 30-40% fewer cases than us means that either\n\na) young people aren't partying as much as you think\n\nor\n\nb) old people aren't being nearly careful enough.\n\nIn terms of personal risk, to a person under 30 without preexisting conditions you are probably more likely to die of a car accident on your way to get a COVID test than actually die of COVID. That doesn't mean we're not contributing to the spread, we definitely are, but when young people go out to party they are taking a very small personal risk.",

Free testing available whenever, robust contact tracing, free quarantine apartments for anyone who is positive. I haven\u2019t heard of any major outbreaks from anyone since people are pretty good about getting tested and self isolating. I think it\u2019s been a pretty good decision overall to keep the schools open for those who want to come.",
