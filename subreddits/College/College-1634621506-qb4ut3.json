Turned in the same paper.\n\nReality is professors have tons of students every year who write essays and do hw all the time. Even if they remember you they most likely won't remember your paper.",

While the professor may not keep your paper perse, it can be stored in your school's database for this exact reason. You'll notice if you use blackboard, or sometimes canvas, that a plagiarism checker can find similarities in the \"institutional database\" Self-Plagiarism is a thing whether we agree with it or not. Just because you got away with it doesn't make it the right or safe thing to do. You also shouldn't underestimate your professor especially if you've had him/her for the class you wrote your previous paper for. They can and oftentimes do realize that what you turn in may be familiar.",
