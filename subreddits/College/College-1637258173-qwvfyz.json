  "text": "Hello, I have recently taken this past year off (Jan-Jan) of school to get myself real help and reset my mental and exploring myself to figure out who I am and want to be and what I want to do and how to deal with stress and all of this stuff. I've found my answers that have satisfied me and I am ready to go back to school. I'll be finishing my BS in Behavior Science with minors in math and psychology. I'm basically done with the pysch minor, I only have one class left to take for it. I'll be starting back up this coming Jan for the spring 22 semester. Now, for my math minor, I have to be in Calc 2 by this next fall, which means I have to take precalc this spring, and calc 1 in the summer. So essentially, I will be taking 17 credits of classes after this year long break, which is enough stress with the math class and my regular major classes as well. But, I was thinking about trying to get some TA experience, just because it might really help me in the future. However, the only work-study job that is left for the '22 spring semester is being a tutor in the success center. Now, I think you can still gain significant teaching experience by helping students understanding concepts in their gen eds, which I have all taken already. I think it will also help me to start explaining things in more simpler ways, instead of being so wordy and descriptive and technical. So, my question is, should I even be thinking about signing on to become a tutor at school while taking 5 classes after taking a year away from school? \n\nTLDR: Took a year break from school, enrolled in 17 credits (5 classes), asking if I should take up a tutoring position at the school success center with such a workload, especially with taking 5 credits of precalc, after coming back from said break.",
