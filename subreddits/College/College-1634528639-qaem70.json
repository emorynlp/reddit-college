  "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy school had set dates on when we needed to get tested throughout the semester if unvaccinated. I have previously had covid and have not been worried about it as a result. I mistakenly missed one of these deadlines. The deadline to get tested was this last Friday. I already scheduled a test for tomorrow so I only missed it by 1 business day but I\u2019m worried about the consequences.\n\nI know it\u2019s my fault and my mistake but I\u2019m really worried because I have a test worth 25% of my grade Wednesday. Should the university say I can\u2019t attend class am I just fucked? I work 45 hours/week and take 15 credit hours (half on campus) in my last semester. Between working, commuting, and homework I clear about 90 hours/week. I work approximately 12 hours/day 7 days a week. With that in mind, that was really the last thing on my mind. \n\nIt was completely unintentional but I\u2019m trying to minimize the damage. Anyone know what I can expect? I would REALLY hate to take a 0 on an exam worth 25% of my grade that I am prepared for because I\u2019m so overwhelmed with other stuff I didn\u2019t think about it. Again, I know I\u2019m in the wrong, but given my workload my mental health is deteriorating and now I\u2019m worried about this one.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated. I emailed the applicable people on campus notifying them I was getting a test first thing in the morning and owned my mistake. Nonetheless, I\u2019m concerned.\n\nThank you in advance.",

      "text": "Good that you emailed. But idk what\u2019s the case with your uni but mine takes years to respond to emails so I call first thing the next day. Around 10 since at 9 they might be late or whatever. Sometimes I call the wrong number so I ask if I can be directed to the right number. See what they say. As for the test hopefully you\u2019ll be able to take it but if not, your professor has to work with you since you can\u2019t be in school. Hopefully they\u2019re a good nice professor and it\u2019ll be easy, but if they\u2019re really an ass about it you call the chair of that department, hopefully the school secretary can direct you there, explain to them your situation, admit that yes you were a little late but you are taking the required actions to get it sorted out, the chair is usually very reasonable so I doubt they\u2019d give you hard time, and you can get your test rescheduled. But again hopefully your professor is just a nice person and you don\u2019t have to put yourself through that hell as I\u2019ve been through something kind of similar lmao. You\u2019re not gonna take the 0 don\u2019t worry, universities are very helpful when covid interferes with your grades. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
