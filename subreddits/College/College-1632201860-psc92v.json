I used to be a really good student in high school but im college that went out the window", "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a second year student in University. Back in high school I didn't have the most effevient methods of studying but I would get everything done and in on time. The prospect of falling asleep in class would've horrified me, the idea of missing a quiz would've appalled me and given me massive anxiety.\n\nMy first year of college i basically had a full on mental breakdown. Not because of academics (I had mostly as and bs), but because of some mental health, social, and personal issues that came to a head. After that breakdown I went through some pretty massive changes in my personality, issues, etc. I became far less insecure, I became confident, I wore new clothes, changed how I looked, walked, and just felt better overall. Sure, there were relapses.  But I did change in a pretty massive way. I also become much more sociable and spent more time with people. I really developed deeper connections that I hadn't really had before.\n\nThis year I have continued to foster those connections. However, I have run into some problems with academics. So my grades have been slipping a lot. I am disorganized, have forgotten about tests and quizzes, sleep through class often, and cannot for the life of me focus. I fail tests on material I know I understand. Just today, I had a mid term over a topic I feel I have a good understanding of and I spent 3 days studying, doing literally every practice these they offered and I still got a 65%. That's not good. I used to never really struggle with grades but I procrastinate to am appalling degree and can't focus on my work at all. Instead I focus on things I like/want to do and can't seem to get myself to focus on schoolwork even when I know it's important. Hell, I want to be a programmer, but I can't get myself to focus on programming assignments for school and instead focus on my own personal projects in CS. Like I can focus on a personal program I write for me, but my brain shuts off when it comes to school.\n\nIdk why this is but I absolutely despise anything school related. I love the people here but I just cannot get organized, I dread schoolwork (even when I know it is important for my goals), etc.\n\nLike I honestly had to fight the urge to do multi variable calculus on brilliant.org instead of doing my physics homework. So I clearly like learning, I like math and science and history, but I literally cannot get it done when I have to do it for school. Any advice? What do I do? I need a certain gpa to maintain my position in a scholarship program and my gpa is falling through the floor. Idk what's going on.

I\u2019m choking myself with studying and cramming, losing sleep and losing my appetite over the anxieties of failing. I wish we could both find a happy medium. \n\nGood luck to you this semester :)", "author": "Curious-Mandy13", "created": 1632355016, "upvotes": 1}}}
