Admittingly, I am an overachiever. I have a close to perfect GPA and have been fortunate enough to have amazing opportunities. All that being said,  I am overworking myself. Taking 6 classes (18 credits), one of which requires service learning, I have work for an international fellowship I received, working 15 hours a week at my paid internship, leader of two clubs, and having a big role in another. I have been tracking hours and between everything, I have worked 83 hours this week. I'm constantly tired and overwhelmed to the point where I wake up with severe anxiety. I have gotten a cold because I'm not taking care of myself, I frequently forget to eat. I call my mom crying at least once a day. I still try and see my friends as much as I can but I tend to be distracted. I love everything that I'm doing and I can't drop anything but I'm so scared I'm going to fail, which is my greatest fear. \n\nAnyone in a similar position?

Most schools 4 or 5 classes is considered full time.  Consider internships during the summer instead of during the school year? Or perhaps just the fellowship during the summer if you need the funds from your internship?  You are in control of your life.
