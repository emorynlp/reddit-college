I looked into it and it seems like something I'd enjoy more but I keep having second thoughts. I've considered doing psychology or kinesiology or even teaching because I can see myself enjoying that too but I can't decide if I'd actually enjoy it or if I see that as an easier alternative. \n\nI just feel so uncertain about everything. My biggest fear if being I'm my junior year of college and releasing I made a mistake. I've always been so certain about what I am in life but for once I don't actually know. I've asked for advice but people always tell me \"do what makes you happy\" but I don't actually know what's going to make me happy. I know it's kinda unrealistic to have a job that will 100% make you happy but I just feel uncertain now.\n\nEverytime I think about it, I always tell myself \"no this what I want to do, I've always wanted to do stuff like this\" but is it? Is it normal to feel like this in college?", "author": "nooter70", "created": 1632622506, "retrieved": 1632800298, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
