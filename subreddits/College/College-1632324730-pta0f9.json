All of my intro courses were capped at 30 people, and everyone has to take them. My upper electives were 12 max, with some being 5-7 students per. This will depend on your major but I think its relatively common among the school in general. Additionally these smaller class sizes always mean 1:1 conversations with your professors. I've learned and gained valuable insight by straight up just being friends and them having to get to know my name/face. Might not be an option at a school with lectures of 100-300 people. \n\nActivities/clubs: Plenty, there is an organization for nearly everything, and if there isn't, feel free to start one. Chances are, there will be others who wanted it too! I've never thought this was a down point imo, and honestly I get overwhelmed at all the options. As for school spooned activities, I would like to think there are a lot, although I'm not sure. Tbh I just throw those emails away as I'm too busy with other stuff. \n\nStudents: Everyone is super friendly and helpful. I personally haven't noticed any outright discrimination (and if there is... you'll get 10 plus email about it and a letter from the dean no joke). Keep in mind I'm a white male. As much as the school wants to push 'diversity and inclusion', the majority of the student body is white, and tends to skew female. Thats just an observation and by no means the reality. \n\nProfessors: What can I say, there are good professors and bad. I only had two professors I really disliked, one in the math department (she has since left) and one in the philosophy department. ***However*** I have loved eevry other professor since then. They have all been extremely kind and helpful to me with questions on homework, class, career advice or life in general. Every university will have bad profs, thats just a fact, and I'm ure you could find a news article on all of them. But in general I'd score a 8.9/10. \n\nParty school or not?: Definitely not. Sure there are frats and sororities, but to keep up with the public image of 'good catholic private school', there aren't massive frat parties, or a frat row or stuff of that nature. If you want those, usual stomping grounds are SDSU, Point Loma Nazarene, or UCSD. \n\nSafety: I as a white male, 6'3, 200 pounds have never felt unsafe in San Diego. I come form Chicago, where I wouldn't drive the sub past 10pm in most spots. That being said, if you're a women, then yeah maybe you'd feel unsafe. I think campus is pretty safe (besides the occasional break into a car overnight), as I've walked across campus blacked out and never had an issue. This is purely my own experience however and I've definitely heard complaints from my residents about walking to the parking garage late at night. \n\nPM me if you have any more questions and I'll answer the best I can.
