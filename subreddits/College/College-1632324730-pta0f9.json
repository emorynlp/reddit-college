      "text": "The colleges you have listed are all fine options, for they are all accredited. While there are ranking differences among the universities, that ranking is not really going to matter. You are majoring in Psychology, a field that is very much oversaturated. As an international student, you are paying nearly double what an out of state student would pay and nearly 4 times as much as an in state student. Consider pursuing your undergraduate degree in your home country and then pursue your graduate studies in the US.",

      "text": "USD Student and RA here:\n\nClasses: Class sizes are extremely small compared to those you'll find at any of the others schools listed here. All of my intro courses were capped at 30 people, and everyone has to take them. My upper electives were 12 max, with some being 5-7 students per. This will depend on your major but I think its relatively common among the school in general. Additionally these smaller class sizes always mean 1:1 conversations with your professors. I've learned and gained valuable insight by straight up just being friends and them having to get to know my name/face. Might not be an option at a school with lectures of 100-300 people. \n\nActivities/clubs: Plenty, there is an organization for nearly everything, and if there isn't, feel free to start one. Chances are, there will be others who wanted it too! I've never thought this was a down point imo, and honestly I get overwhelmed at all the options. As for school spooned activities, I would like to think there are a lot, although I'm not sure. Tbh I just throw those emails away as I'm too busy with other stuff. \n\nStudents: Everyone is super friendly and helpful. I personally haven't noticed any outright discrimination (and if there is... you'll get 10 plus email about it and a letter from the dean no joke). Keep in mind I'm a white male. As much as the school wants to push 'diversity and inclusion', the majority of the student body is white, and tends to skew female. Thats just an observation and by no means the reality. \n\nProfessors: What can I say, there are good professors and bad. I only had two professors I really disliked, one in the math department (she has since left) and one in the philosophy department. ***However*** I have loved eevry other professor since then. They have all been extremely kind and helpful to me with questions on homework, class, career advice or life in general. Every university will have bad profs, thats just a fact, and I'm ure you could find a news article on all of them. But in general I'd score a 8.9/10. \n\nParty school or not?: Definitely not. Sure there are frats and sororities, but to keep up with the public image of 'good catholic private school', there aren't massive frat parties, or a frat row or stuff of that nature. If you want those, usual stomping grounds are SDSU, Point Loma Nazarene, or UCSD. \n\nSafety: I as a white male, 6'3, 200 pounds have never felt unsafe in San Diego. I come form Chicago, where I wouldn't drive the sub past 10pm in most spots. That being said, if you're a women, then yeah maybe you'd feel unsafe. I think campus is pretty safe (besides the occasional break into a car overnight), as I've walked across campus blacked out and never had an issue. This is purely my own experience however and I've definitely heard complaints from my residents about walking to the parking garage late at night. \n\nPM me if you have any more questions and I'll answer the best I can. I'm majoring in business so thats where my primary expertise will be",

              "text": "I saw some other comments mentioned GPA and Scholarship opportunities. Your GPA being a 3.5 (they dont just look at senior year, otherwise I could've gotten into MIT LOL) will be fine to get in, and being an international student I'm sure they'll give you money. Tuition is about 72k a year, but the plus of it being a private school is they give out money like no tomorrow If you really need it ie low income family. My costs were:\n\nFreshman year 29.5k (Parent PLUS Loan) - Rest of scholarship/grants/federal grants\n\nSophomore year 13k (RA scholarship takes \\~16k away in costs between room and board)\n\nJunior 29.5k (Studying abroad for the entire year, part of USD's business dual degree program. Had I stayed in the states it would be 13 again for RA scholarships)\n\nSenior 13k planning (RA scholarships)\n\nIs it expensive? Yes. But its also private and there is a reason for that. \n\nIf you come from a low income, and are a POC, then you could apply for plenty of scholarships that are designed for you. I can't, but you could if you fall under that. \n\nHousing: You're required to live on housing for 2 years, freshman and sophomore unless you live with your parents and can commute. There is NO way to get around this. This will include a meal plan (which freshman year is quite good.) Freshman housing blows, but its not horrible as they just got remodeled. Sophomore housing is more apartment styled living and much more tolerable. You get your won kitchen now! Yay! For the last two years you can chose to continue living on campus, or rent somewhere off. Unless it's Pacific ridge, you'd probably want a car. Being San Diego, everywhere is super fucking expensive. So take that into consideration. \n\nHonestly even though we are in the 'city' its really the suburbs. You'd want a car to get around. With a car is only 10 minutes to the best beaches. Although I think for freshman you can't have a car unless you get a waiver for it. \n\nFood: Not bad. It gets a little repetitive at the main restaurant (SLP) but there are plenty of food options to spend dinning dollars (included within a meal plan). Coffee shops, burger joints, taco truck, Ribs etc. \n\nCampus: We have had the most beautiful campus ranking a couple times and for good reason. They sink money into the landscaping. You want to know where the 72k charge goes? The flowers. No joke. \n\nStudy abroad: The. Fucking. Best. No joke. Study in more than 70 partner schools around the globe, no problem. I myself am getting a second degree (a second piece of paper) from a partner institution in Europe for the same price as staying there. And its only one year (this is limited to business though). But for intersession (between semesters) or even a semester, its all Guchi, just pay what you would at home and go abroad. Everything transfers for one semester. Want to go for two? Then Finances might get a little tricky. Although I will say the international office is fucking horrible to deal with. Seriously it made me so mad I want to take their job. \n\nI'm trying to think of anything else and I can't at the moment",
