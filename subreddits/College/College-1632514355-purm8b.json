I don't know how to get better in this class because i have trouble understanding the lessons the way my teacher teaches them and it seems like the next unit we're going over is going to be just as confusing. I didn't go to tutoring before the first test but i am going to it now and i think it's helping but this entire class has got me stressed because of how little i understand the material. Even when i looked up youtube videos on the subject to try and get a different teaching perspective, i still didn't understand what was going on... it's not like i was bad at math before college but i think it's just calculus that is giving me trouble which is bad since i'm expected to take calc 2 right after this.", "author": "jasu4321", "created": 1632514355, "retrieved": 1632800350, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"hedomit": {"link": "/r/college/comments/purm8b/failed_my_calculus_test/hedomit/", "text": "That\u2019s a good idea.

For others, there are x values for which f(x) does not have a valid definition. For example, x cubed divided by x squared is not defined at x=0 because 0 squared is 0, and division by zero is undefined. But, we can calculate what f(x) approaches as x approaches zero, by \"simplifying\" the function to f(x) = x, and then plugging in x=0.\n\nPut another way, if you have a value c at which you'd like to calculate the limit, and you choose a maximum distance between that value and other values on the number line, you can calculate the maximum distance that any f(x) for any x within your chosen distance from c will have from the limit. So, in the case of f(x) = ((x-3) cubed, divided by (x-3)), I can tell you that the limit, as x approaches any number within 0.01 of 3 is going to be somewhere between 9 and 9.0601, or within a distance of 0.0601 away from the actual limit. \n\nA derivative is basically the answer to the question, \"If I move x by a teeny, tiny amount, what is the ratio of the change in f(x) to the change in x?\" Mathematically, it's the slope of the line between (x,f(x)) and (x+h,f(x+h)) where h is very small - almost zero, but not actually zero (technically, it's infinitesimally small). So the derivative is just the limit, as h approaches zero, of ((f(x + h) - f(x)) divided by h) For example, the derivative of x\\^2 is the limit, as h approaches zero, of (((x+h)\\^2 - x\\^2) divided by h), or ((x\\^2 + 2hx + h\\^2 - x\\^2) divided by h), or ((2hx + h\\^2)/h), which is just 2x + h. Set h=0, and you get 2x. So the derivative of x\\^2 is 2x.", "author": "Comprehensive-Ad3963", "created": 1632549020, "upvotes": 1}, "he62ca7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/purm8b/failed_my_calculus_test/he62ca7/", "text": "I don't know if this recommendation applies to you, but be sure to make an attempt to understand what you are trying to solve for.
