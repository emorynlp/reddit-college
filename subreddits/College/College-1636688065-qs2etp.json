      "text": "Nothing, I\u2019m depressed and I\u2019ve convinced myself I\u2019ll be far happier in Florida or California. It holds some truth. There\u2019s something about the sunshine and palm trees that makes me happy. \n\nI hate NJ because nothing is exciting to do. My hometown and the people in it suck. My perspective is due to my shitty experiences in school growing up.\n\nYet I\u2019m still stuck here because I didn\u2019t feel like ending school with $80k minimum in student debt. I figured going to CC then transferring is smarter. I\u2019m in it to leave NJ permanently ASAP, not just for four years.",
