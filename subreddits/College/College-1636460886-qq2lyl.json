  "text": "Hey y'all\nI'm a first semester computer sciences engineering student. We have a 2 hour class every week called language lab which is a pain in the ass. The professor recently gave us a \"skit\" assignment and assigned groups for the students.\n\nHonestly I couldn't care less about this subject and the assignment. So is it okay for me to completely skip this assignment? I don't care if I don't get graded but skipping might cause problems for my classmates. I don't care about them either but it would be annoying if I got in trouble for skipping.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEdit: No guys skipping this assignment won't harm my group mates.",
