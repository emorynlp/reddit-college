  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking a class where the professor said at the end of the semester they\u2019d grade essays, and it\u2019s the end of the semester. The final is Sunday, and he\u2019s only graded one item out of 8, and he hasn\u2019t graded anything else either even though he only said a certain type of essay would wait. I\u2019m having such bad anxiety over this because I have no clue what my grade is all I know is my quiz average? Like you\u2019d think when something is worth 30% of your students grade you would move a smidge faster(that 30% isn\u2019t counting the other 10 for the essays he said he would grade at the end). He\u2019s honestly just a bad professor, he has a lot of typos, posts drop boxes with incorrect due dates, gives the wrong instructions for assignments and doesn\u2019t notice until called out",

      "text": "He's probably going to 'grade' everything at the last second. Meaning he'll give a cursory glance at stuff and then basically pick a grade for it out of his butt. To give him the benefit of the doubt, he may have things mostly graded already, but just not put into the computer system. Putting stuff in takes time, maybe he just wants to put it all in at once.",

It\u2019s just stressing me out a lot. I\u2019ve never had a prof do this",
