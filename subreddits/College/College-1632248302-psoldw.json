Even if you put in 101% of your effort, the difference is going to be negligible. And a 91 is really close to a 96 if you really think about it.\n\nThat's how I've come to terms with getting these \"low\" grades on exams, but ended up being really happy because it was the best I could do. Clich\u00e9 advice, but you learn to be proud of what others may deem \"not good enough\". As long as you're happy with it and you know you couldn't possibly have done better, than that is a grade well earned.",
