{"sid": "gft0ne", "link": "/r/college/comments/gft0ne/13_minute_finals/", "title:": "13 minute finals", "text": "Hey all. I seriously need feedback on this. For 2 of my classes with the same professor, our finals worth 40% of our grade will be online. 13 minutes, that's it. You don't get to see every single problem in one go - you can only see them as you take the exam (so you do question 1, then question 2, etc). So if you trip up on #1, you can't spend more time thinking. IDK how anyone can even \\*think\\* per question. There's 10 questions. They're multiple choice, true/false but half the questions are paragraphs long based on the midterm of the same format. (Not exaggerating, I saved the exam when I got my instant grade, and the \"10 questions\" were more than 3 pages single-spaced.) Prof. said finals is same thing so I'm going to be presumptuous and say we'll have paragraphs long questions on the 13-minute finals as well.\n\nIs this even rational? When I took the midterm, I was 2 minutes in when my internet was \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up and then I lost 4 minutes to the exam. BAM, I failed the exam because I couldn't even get to question 5. How was I supposed to think through any of the questions when I have 4 minutes to do a bunch of other questions? The midterm average among 80 students was a 30/100. The professor \\*graciously\\* said our midterm can be worth nothing and our finals worth 40%, depending on how well we do. (Originally each was worth 20%.) Well, the finals is the same format, and I'm annoyed. I am more scared about my internet disconnecting than me not knowing the answer. I literally don't even want to start the exam because my internet hasn't been stable for the past 60 days, just like every other American. I can't even sit through a 50-minute Zoom without disconnecting every minute. What's up with this professor? I've raised this issue with her before, she either misinterpreted me or was a d\\*\\*\\* and said, \"I can't just accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else.\" I'm baffled because I'm positive out of her 160 students total (in both classes), there's at least 50 of us going through hell.\n\nPlease let me know what you think - I'm seconds away from raising this to higher ups but I want some rationalization of why a final worth 40% with 10 questions only allows 13 minutes. If we could see all the questions at once, I would say it's a little bit \"better\" b/c we can do what we know and think about the hard ones last. But that's not the case. I don't even know how any of this is feasible when this reddit post absolutely undermines other factors of my life tht are f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up such as having to be home 24/7 with an abusive family. This is ridiculous. Someone enlighten me. Let me know if you're confused on why I am complaining b/c I am thoroughly annoyed with my school and don't know how to write, talk, w/e. This is the 1,000,001th time I've complained in the last 60 days.\n\nedit 5/19: thank you for everyone's comments! Wanted to say that I scored above the curve for both finals, so I should still be getting my A's at the end of all this. No - the 13 minutes never got changed. The finals did become 20% rather than 40% though. President, 2 deans, 4 chairs - nothing was done. I guess all of their brains think 13 minutes is right for a finals during a coronavirus pandemic.

So I quietly approached the professor about extending our time period explaining myself and at least one other (though I believed and told him that there were probably others) were struggling with finishing the amount of work in the allotted time. He listened, took a poll asking how many wanted more time in which at least half the class confirmed what I had told him, and then added another 5 ish minutes to our quiz. Taking it from rushing to finish the quiz to being able to hopefully check answers. \n\nAll of this to say sometimes knowing your not the only one struggling can make a world of difference in having ground to stand on when talking with professors.
