  "title:": "13 minute finals",
  "text": "Hey all. I seriously need feedback on this. For 2 of my classes with the same professor, our finals worth 40% of our grade will be online. 13 minutes, that's it. You don't get to see every single problem in one go - you can only see them as you take the exam (so you do question 1, then question 2, etc). So if you trip up on #1, you can't spend more time thinking. IDK how anyone can even \\*think\\* per question. There's 10 questions. They're multiple choice, true/false but half the questions are paragraphs long based on the midterm of the same format. (Not exaggerating, I saved the exam when I got my instant grade, and the \"10 questions\" were more than 3 pages single-spaced.) Prof. said finals is same thing so I'm going to be presumptuous and say we'll have paragraphs long questions on the 13-minute finals as well.\n\nIs this even rational? When I took the midterm, I was 2 minutes in when my internet was \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up and then I lost 4 minutes to the exam. BAM, I failed the exam because I couldn't even get to question 5. How was I supposed to think through any of the questions when I have 4 minutes to do a bunch of other questions? The midterm average among 80 students was a 30/100. The professor \\*graciously\\* said our midterm can be worth nothing and our finals worth 40%, depending on how well we do. (Originally each was worth 20%.) Well, the finals is the same format, and I'm annoyed. I am more scared about my internet disconnecting than me not knowing the answer. I literally don't even want to start the exam because my internet hasn't been stable for the past 60 days, just like every other American. I can't even sit through a 50-minute Zoom without disconnecting every minute. What's up with this professor? I've raised this issue with her before, she either misinterpreted me or was a d\\*\\*\\* and said, \"I can't just accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else.\" I'm baffled because I'm positive out of her 160 students total (in both classes), there's at least 50 of us going through hell.\n\nPlease let me know what you think - I'm seconds away from raising this to higher ups but I want some rationalization of why a final worth 40% with 10 questions only allows 13 minutes. If we could see all the questions at once, I would say it's a little bit \"better\" b/c we can do what we know and think about the hard ones last. But that's not the case. I don't even know how any of this is feasible when this reddit post absolutely undermines other factors of my life tht are f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up such as having to be home 24/7 with an abusive family. This is ridiculous. Someone enlighten me. Let me know if you're confused on why I am complaining b/c I am thoroughly annoyed with my school and don't know how to write, talk, w/e. This is the 1,000,001th time I've complained in the last 60 days.\n\nedit 5/19: thank you for everyone's comments! Wanted to say that I scored above the curve for both finals, so I should still be getting my A's at the end of all this. No - the 13 minutes never got changed. The finals did become 20% rather than 40% though. President, 2 deans, 4 chairs - nothing was done. I guess all of their brains think 13 minutes is right for a finals during a coronavirus pandemic. Absolutely outrageous but farewell to this pathetic school. I'm graduating, and I don't know this college.",

Apparently lots of them had been complaining since March but in every single email, the adjunct says 13 minutes is not the problem.\n2. I raised my complaint to the president, 2 deans, 4 chairs.\n3. The dept head of the class reached out. He said that the adjunct said we \\*never\\* reached out to her about our concerns - all lies. Us students have email proof, unfinished exams, screenshots. Like who wants to lie about getting a 0 on a midterm? No one wants a 0 - even if we guessed, we'd at least get 1 right. \n4. The finals went from 40% of our grade to 20%.\n5. I didn't bother to complain anymore because the exam was approaching. But I did tell A LOT more people to spread the issue. \n6. I borrowed someone's internet, got insanely fast load times, and scored way above average for both finals. Should be ending with 2 A's.\n7. Classmates struggled with the same struggles (internet, reading speed, etc) and failed\n8. Classmates are going to file formal complaints after official grades are in.\n9.

Sadly this isn't enough so I need to complain more :x \n\nUgh, see, I knew hot spot is an option. So when I first got into lockdown, I called to ask if my plan offered hotspot. It's only if I am on one of the monthly plans that require a credit check. I just got out of $20k delinquent debt (long story, lots of medical problems) so my credit is trash. I don't have the credit to go on a monthly plan w/ hotspot. So I loaned a device from my school with hotspot. That thing is crap - it's worse than me stealing my neighbor's wifi.

There theoretically is a reserved, huge, open space for students to access internet. When I went to my own campus, the security would not let me go anywhere and told me in a condescending way, \"Go pay for internet.\" He didn't care the school president's memo said we're allowed to be there for internet, food pantry. The shit thing is that when I told my prof this, he straight up said I was lying and the dean was looped in the email. Nothing was done. Anyways, if my relationship with this school gets any worse, I will be pulling the CCTV footage because the whole situation was caught on camera. I broke down out of desperation too because I knew my profs. are assholes and I couldn't leave the campus w/o internet. I had homework to do!\n\nI have no hopes colleges will let me use their WiFi but I'll def. check the local libraries. Thanks so much! :-)",

If you have a group chat with any of these classmates ping them and ask if anyone else is concerned about the time constraint your probably not alone. And this is extremely important in maybe getting the prof to listen.\n\nOne of my classes this past semester we had quizzes that simply were too long to write in the original time allotment and it was showing in our grades (class average was consistently around just above passing) and for me it was causing my anxiety to spike even with my meds. After talking with a classmate I realized I wasn\u2019t alone, everyone was struggling. So I quietly approached the professor about extending our time period explaining myself and at least one other (though I believed and told him that there were probably others) were struggling with finishing the amount of work in the allotted time. He listened, took a poll asking how many wanted more time in which at least half the class confirmed what I had told him, and then added another 5 ish minutes to our quiz. Taking it from rushing to finish the quiz to being able to hopefully check answers. \n\nAll of this to say sometimes knowing your not the only one struggling can make a world of difference in having ground to stand on when talking with professors. Not saying it might fix the issue. Not everything always goes that way. Not all profs will listen. It can be a bit of a gamble. But sometimes when your not the only voice they do listen.",

I wonder if my prof just isn't caring about their complaint? It's why I raised this issue on Reddit - something is suspicious. No way it's just me wanting to complain near the end of the semester. I come from a school where 95% of students struggle with some severe form of hardship (it's written all over our school report for student body, demographics, etc). How is it that nothing's been done? \n\nHere's an idea of what student body is like, I am positive someone complained but is being ignored: \n\nI think 95%+ in poverty. We're 95%+ of diversity as in we truly honor all races in our student body. I think we're at least 70%+ first-generation. We're I think 30%+ immigrants. We're also I think 25%+ parents, non-traditional students, etc. We come from such \"different\" backgrounds but we're all connected in being low-income, being a minority, being first-generation. We statistically struggle. Like part of the slogan/PR of my school is the fact we \"push\" our previously \"struggling\" graduates into middle and upper class of society. So it's obvious many are non-natives. That we come from difficult backgrounds. That we struggle with mental and physical health problems. That we are practically almost all economically insecure. I only know this because in my sociology class last semester, the class got our hands on the student body data. We're truly a school of diversity and hardships.\n\nIDK what do you think? :x",

              "text": "Its complicated. I think some of its what you mentioned. And another is the aspect of how students view professors.\n\nAs I realized when it happened in the other class. Just because I wasn't the only one with a concern didn't mean I wasn't the only one willing to raise it. There was about a dozen students in the class. And despite more then half wanting more time, no one did anything until we were half way through the semester and I made the request.\n\nAnd that might be a byproduct of me being an older student whose been around the block a lot thanks to medical issues. I've learned with experience that sometimes the best approach is the direct one at times. (I literally told my prof point blank  Something some of my younger classmates don't feel comfortable with. \n\nThat being said that just because this can help doesn't always mean it work so take it with a grain of salt. I had the head of the comp sci department listed as my prof even though it was a TA doing the teaching last spring. And getting her to change anything to work with me (I suffer from chronic migraines and I was trying to get her to work with a last-minute schedule change due to a migraine triggering before an exam I eventually got her to give but there was a frustrating week with me, disabilities, and them talking with her) was like pulling teeth. And I'm about 90 percent sure she didn't like me based on an email I got in the beginning of the semester (I was out the first week doing other things and boy did she not like getting an email asking what I needed to keep in mind for when I came back) which I would never have sent if I had known she was the department head. Apparently she's normally a nice woman I just had the misfortune of getting on her bad side. \n\nIts hard to say what's going on here without talking to the prof face to face. And unfortunately in this climate that's not an option.",

I wish I was there - I would fight for you with all my might. It's never easy to have a disability, have school policies claim to accommodate and be inclusive of you guys, just to have professors be f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* about all of it. What's the point of the ADA and other civil rights laws? \n\nMy friend, a freshman, had her family pass away before covid-19 happened. The professor was a fucking douchebag about it and wouldn't accommodate her. Since she was emotionally unstable, she didn't tell me. She immediately dropped the course along with others. I found out weeks later. If I found out earlier, I would've fought for her. WTF is up with professors who don't treat death seriously? Sure, lots of people lie, but that doesn't mean you can undermine people truly experiencing a death in that family. That professor got his punishment though as I reported him like mad recently for some stupid unaccommodating thing he did to me. I took it all out because not only is he a dick to someone who lost their family, a discriminatory dick to me, but he's clearly a prejudiced professor and I made it clear to a few of his bosses. \n\nSMH, I hope you and I don't need to go through any more of this. COVID-19 is bad, disability makes it worse. Good luck with everything :(",

Bull****.\n\nAs for the other assessments, after the email I sent to the dean, she gave us another 5 minute extra after the first test was 12 minutes for 15 questions. Then, that would make 17 minutes for 13 questions PLUS an open ended which no one got to.

I'm imagining (well, hoping) your president must be like mine where they're both going to let you complain directly to them b/c my president is scared shitless of what will happen if any of us students get mistreated during this pandemic. \n\nI was at war with another professor a few weeks ago over an exam. I spared no sugar on that fudger. I'm in the humanities/liberal arts division and I got the STEM school (of much more power) involved. I knew the humanities & liberal arts professors are just eating shit for breakfast so I complained to 20+ people in my school. HR, Chief Diversity Officer, Academic Dean (or w/e she's called), president, deans, professors, chairs, other divisions, ombudsman (though that booger is unresponsive), provost, etc. Don't spare these nuggets during this pandemic. We're all impacted in some way. My professor and her whole family got COVID, disappeared for 4 weeks, and thankfully recovered.

Finally, always keep a mindset of \"I can do this\" because you can. The power of will and discipline is a strong strong assistance in life and it can really help turn things around when you've become accustomed to not having it like I was.

Welp, they must think it's not a problem to take a finals in 13 minutes so they did nothing. But I think they did tell the adjunct to change the finals from 40% of our grade to 20%. \n\nRegardless, I also got in touch with another redditor who generously let me borrow their WiFi. The internet was so fast, it's two universes compared to my laptop with my WiFi at home! I scored well above average for both finals and assuming there's a curve, I'm getting 2 A's! Hopefully there will be a curve - I learned that a lot of my classmates were complaining since March! Just the adjunct doesn't want to listen. Surprising that many students scoring 0s, 10s,20s, 30s, 40s doesn't concern the professor. She should also be able to see that a lot of us didn't even get to question 5 thanks to our internet. When I took an almost 4 hour finals yesterday, a lot of people disconnected and lost their test answers. The professor was able to retrieve their progress and see everything they have done, so I'm surprised this adjunct hasn't considered the fact that our low midterm average comes from such a short exam (smh). \n\nThanks again for your advice! So glad I managed to get everyone's advice in this thread, found someone willing to lend my some excellent internet, scored way above the average, learned that my hardships aren't unique to me, actually found some amazing advocates, and I should be graduating in a few days with a GPA finally above a 3.6! (Well... was supposed to be a 3.7 but one professor gave me two inaccurate C's for no reasons without telling me, still gotta do something about that -.-)",

But if that midterm was truly 20% of my grade, the max grade I could get in 1 of the classes is only an 80! That's because I got a bright ol' 0 for disconnecting during the exam. Imagine that happens for finals? I honestly think the prof is just stupidly irrational at this point. What if I disconnect on finals? A 0? She could try again. She could let me take it again. She'll think she \\*must\\* give me 13 minutes to be \"fair.\" BAM I'll disconnect again. This is pathetic. \n\nIn my email, I have an argument about socioeconomic class. My school is at least 50%, if not 95% filled with students in poverty. (I'm checking demographic stats soon.) I personally live in federal housing in a crap neighborhood - everyone should be surprised I have working internet. Like this reddit thread crashed on me when it started getting traction yesterday and then my laptop crashed (lmfao). This whole school knows how shit of a situation I'm in even before coronavirus (it's more than just poverty, crap internet, etc) and the fact they expect me to do a \"fair game\" 13-minute exam with everyone else is ridiculous. I'm sure I'm not the only one out of 160 with shit conditions so this whole situation is just bewildering. \n\nI even loaned a device from my college b/c I know my condition is shit, but their hotspot services are just as bad.",

So yo, professors, do you not know many of us are non-natives? That we come from difficult backgrounds? That we are practically almost all economically insecure? I only know this because in my sociology class last semester, the class got our hands on the student body data. We're truly a school of diversity and hardships, lmao.\n\nMy school got millions in funding for emergency grants during COVID-19, we're also the school where almost 80% of the student body begged for the grant. \n\nI do not understand how all of this can be happening.\n\nAnd thank you for triggering all these thoughts because this is going into my complaint LOL",

Just that it's unbelievable students can complain and never get heard; while here I am spending hours gathering everyone's comments, formulating an argument, checking the wording of my complaint excessively, etc. It's so exhausting x\\_\\_\\_x \n\nBut having a \"petition\" of some sort among my peers would be nice and impactful ;o",

I got well above average for both finals but my peers aren't letting this adjunct and stupid school go. \n\nBTW, so the president, 2 deans, and 4 chairs all did nothing about this but reducing the finals from 40% of our grade to 20.

Goodbye to this school - most people I've talked to are going to file formal complaints after this BS is over. \n\n20% seems like a better compromise but it undermines all of our efforts to do well during this pandemic, trying to get our A's no matter what.

I group everyone as the same out of respect. There's problems with the whole division, and I've repeatedly experienced it but no one dares to speak up.\n\nI went up the food chain and the chair (the most unaccommodating person in the whole school) told me to speak with the professor. The professor and the chair are both lying by saying no one has raised concerns about the exam with the prof even though my classmates have given me proof --> emails reached out to the prof in addition to those unaccommodating responses. What should I do? It's becoming outrageous that all signs seem to point at the fact that this 13-minute exams is even \"acceptable.\"",

I would expect the Chair to be in disbelief, yet still do due diligence and investigate, but it looks like they don\u2019t care, or they\u2019ve got their mind set. Are you receiving federal loans? If so, you can reach out to the dept of education and explain how this school is misusing federal funds to flunk students, and ask for resources on how you can tackle an impossible situation facing debt incurred due to improper teaching strategies. That\u2019s a hell of a long shot though. You may need to reach out to the advising office, president of the school, meaning higher up in the chain, those would be your immediate next steps. If I think of something, I\u2019ll hit you up.\n\nPS : document everything. Have a certified letter sent to the Program chair requesting to formally investigate this issue, signed by all students. Include a copy of your proof from each and every student. They should sign their proof too (as if a legal document). Ensure you ask for a certified mail answer. Do not accept anything that\u2019s not written down, signed and sealed from the person it\u2019s directed to or the school. Keep doing so with every interaction above the program chair too. \n\nTalk to your parents and family, reach out for help to them, and explain. The rest of the students having a problem should do the same thing. If parents get involved, I hope they actually do look into it, and if it\u2019s so - that you\u2019re being set up for failure, they take corrective actions and fix it. \n\nGood luck!",

I gave the prof suggestions on what she could do. She could extend the time, she could have us take the exam on a diff platform, etc. The platform we're on is known to be a problem even before lockdown for almost a decade now - there's no way to ever expect it to just work miraculously especially when we're in lockdown.  \n\nShe then gave me the \"I can't accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else\" answer. Should I raise the issue a different way?",

I honestly don't want to get anyone into trouble so I'll try my best to resolve with the prof herself. Here's what I originally did:\n\nIn my original email this past Monday, I specifically stated it's not feasible to expect anyone to take a 10-question exam with lengthy questions within 13 minutes. I then stated that just internet connection problems interfere with the exam, and that's not even something within our control. I actually attached a video of how my page wouldn't load during the midterm (same format, same time, same platform, after lockdown started) -- I only took a video because I had a feeling, after reading a ton of reddit posts, that my prof. would accuse me of lying. I then suggested solutions she could \\*consider,\\* like giving us more time, finding another platform, etc. She flat-out said she can't accommodate me or else she'll have to accommodate everyone else. IDK if that's a sign that no one else is complaining, that she clearly doesn't see anyone's hardship, etc. \n\nI honestly do not have a clue how else I could ask her.",

I was concerned about my students' internet dropping, so I gave them three hours for their open book final, instead of the hour it would have been in class. That was for a 20 question final where half were essay questions. I cannot imagine, as a student, taking anything but pure memorization multiple choice in 13 minutes. If you have any short answer, that's not enough time. \n\nYou want to email very soon and not wait, because the AD or Dean can talk to the prof quietly about this and suggest she change her test (or time), but after the fact it's going to be harder to get anything done about it (once the grades are in). Even then there are no guarantees as a lot of professors have control over how they teach the material, but usually informal behind-the-scene chats with the dean/ad can push someone to being less ridiculous.",

Whether I graduate is dependent on these 6 credits and me passing shouldn't even be an issue. The other 60% of my grade for both classes is going to end up being a 97-99, so it's just this finals potentially wrecking me for no reason. \n\nI'm confident I'll succeed - professors don't listen to me but when I reach higher up the food chain, they do, thankfully. I'm sending my complaint soon so hopefully all goes well!",
