  "text": "I would like to know the thought process behind setting a due date for 10:30AM. It seems like 95% percent of things are due at 11:59PM; and then I always have that one oddball due date time assignment every couple weeks. Are we doing me a favor with this? or what's the process? Simulating a \"class experience\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've finally annotated my entire calendar, because I forget to read the times for all 4 or 5 things in the color coded square on any given day. Is this just me, anyone else getting burned on this one.",

It is convenient, but if you forget it's a morning assignment it's easy to get the false impression you have 24hrs instead of 12hr.  After, reading over the posts, some professors see it as giving the max. amount of time. I think their intentions are good and I imagine it helps some students. It's just unfortunate that it seems to result in a blind spot for some of us. It would be nice if I could tweak Canvas to automatically load early morning assignments to the previous days line up.",

So there was no point in the assignment being due before class instead of after class. Some other assignments were due at weird times/days, like 9:30 AM on a Wednesday. We didn\u2019t have class on Wednesdays, so I don\u2019t know what the point was of having an assignment due at 9:30 AM on those days.",

      "text": "You have to make your own deadlines. My deadline is always the 11 59 closest to the deadline. So that keeps everything in check and nothing gets crammed on one day. The reality is, its an illusion. They really want it at 11 59 pm the day before, but they set it to 10 30 so that if some students need it, they can stay up late and do it. The key is its there if you need it, not that you have to use it. When you get to college, you need to be able to do this because due dates will be random, like at 3 in the afternoon or other random times. A lot are due at 11 59, but a lot are also do when class starts, so you need to hold yourself accountable. In addition, if they were to make it due at 11 59, you would be losing 10.5 hours because they would not make it due that same day, but the night before. If you can't stick to that schedule, that's on you.",

Even though this entire year the assignments have been due at 12 pm on Fridays, and even though I sent you an email earlier this week saying they were due at 12 pm this Friday. I have re-opened the assignments.\"\n\n\nI recommend talking to your bio professor about that. 12:59 am (basically 1 am) is a very odd time to submit assignments at, and it's also just one hour after the normal due date. Many professors are having trouble adapting to the online format and I imagine if you talk to your bio professor about the odd due date he'll probably be lenient and may allow you to submit your assignments, especially because assignments have been due at 11:59 pm the rest of the year for you.",

      "text": "There's no one ideal time to have assignments due. Though a lot of us professors use 11:59. \n\nI used to use 5:00 p.m. for some classes, as it was the latest I wanted to wait for papers to come in, print them and go home (yes, I still print certain assignments before grading!) but there were enough complaints, so I started making everything due at 11:59 *the day before*.\n\nNo one complains, they are happy with the \"later\" time but they have no clue that assignments are actually now due 17 hours sooner than they need to be.\n\nSo, I guess I'd say, YOU can make your own deadlines for whatever time of day you want, it's just going to be sooner than the final deadline (which you should be avoiding almost-late submissions anyway, to give yourself a buffer).",
