  "title:": "Is it not normal to wave or nod at people you've met?",
  "text": "I'm already someone who's not very confident in their social skills. I suffer from anxiety and ADHD and I've been bullied in the past so I'm already quite insecure in this area.\n\nIs it not normal to wave/nod to someone you've introduced yourself to before previously? I've been getting a mixed bag of responses. Sometimes they will just wave/nod which is fine, but other times I just get this stare as if I'm a stranger with a third eye, without any sort of reciprocation. My hygiene isn't bad and I don't think I wear anything noticeably bad so I don't really get why I get this weird response sometimes.\n\nI might sound overly sensitive but I just genuinely worry that I've somehow rubbed them the wrong way just by waving or nodding. Is this odd?",

I\u2019ve never had a strong memory for faces, but with the masks it\u2019s like my brain doesn\u2019t even try.  It\u2019s a weird psychological thing, but I bet anything this is contributing to OP\u2019s experience.  It\u2019s pretty hard to remember a hundred new half-faces",

Being yourself is always better because you can either have a few real friends or a lot of fake friends, as long as your not creepy. Hope you can find your  confidence, I was diagnosed with social anxiety and went to therapy for 2 years before I really overcame it. It sucks but you should try to work on it. Progress is slow and can take months/years but its worth it.",
