  "title:": "Is DM\u2019ing people a weird way to make friends at this point?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m lonely as hell (I posted about it a few days ago) and I really need more people to talk to because I\u2019m just getting super depressed at this point. I have severe social anxiety tho and I can\u2019t talk to people. I just don\u2019t know how to approach people and start a convo. I have ZERO social skills. Once I\u2019ve spoken to someone for a while, I get better, but the initial conversation is horrifying. \n\nA few weeks ago I messaged a guy I was kinda interested in on Instagram and it turned out well and we\u2019ve hung out a few times (we\u2019re actually getting lunch today). I was considered doing the same with a few people that I was interested in making friends with (some of which are in my classes but I\u2019m too awkward to say anything to them). Would this be weird at this point? We\u2019re 7 weeks into the semester already. I feel like it too late to make friends in general, and I feel like DMing people would be weird at this point. I worry that everyone has already made their friends and I\u2019m late to the party. But I feel like that\u2019s literally the only way I would be able to muster up the the courage to talk to someone. What do I do?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know about everybody else but to make friends lots of ppl DMed each other at my school. Lots of us meet online over Discord, so it\u2019s nothing too weird. Whenever I\u2019m nervous to talk to people in person, I always just think about how I would receive it if they started talking to me, and if they\u2019re any sort of reasonable person, they\u2019ll probably react about the same way you would if they came up to you, happy to meet a nice, new person. Even though DMing might be weird, if that is actually all you can do, I think it\u2019s fine. You want to push yourself out of your comfort Zone, but if you already feel overwhelmed, I think you\u2019re fine.",
