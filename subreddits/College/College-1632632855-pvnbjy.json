Ive made practically 0 new friends, spent so much time doing nothing, got bad grades because I couldn\u2019t get off my phone, and now I\u2019m in my senior year feeling so lonely and hopeless and uncertain about my future. \n\nMy freshman year I made friends left and right but stuck to the ones I knew and got right into a relationship and I completely neglected everyone else. I now have no friends of my own and I have had nothing to do practically every weekend if it weren\u2019t for my gf. \n\nI\u2019ve signed up for a bunch of clubs and sports but I feel like no one is as desperate as me for a friend now and people don\u2019t care to reach out to me as everyone has their groups and their other friends to look forward too. I don\u2019t know what happened either as I didn\u2019t have this issue up until college. I really don\u2019t think that I come off as an anti social person.  \n\nI would love to have something to do and groups and friends to do the things everyone else does in college but I spend most of my time alone and I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong.\n\nMy mind is always racing now. I have less than a year left and I feel like it\u2019s too late to have this experience I\u2019ve wanted.", "author": "golfif", "created": 1632632855, "retrieved": 1632945957, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"hecmmx6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvnbjy/down_so_bad_please_help/hecmmx6/", "text": "It's not too late.

Best way is to leech off them, make their friends your friends. By senior year you\u2019re gonna have a problem sliding your way into other peoples friend groups so just connect. Are you open with your gf and friends? Be straight with then and be like hey guys I\u2019m feeling kinda down, I want to meet some new people, you know anyone you\u2019d think I\u2019d like? Or just ask them to go out to a bar and meet some people there, it\u2019s a lot easier to connect with other groups in with your own group.", "author": "Kenkxb", "created": 1632634888, "upvotes": 3}}}
