  "text": "I have no idea what it is but whenever I\u2019m at college I have so much trouble sleeping. I\u2019ve tried everything that I know to help me sleep ;like running a fan, reading, changing my breathing pattern, etc\u2026) and nothing works. This is the third night in a row now where I\u2019m barely sleeping (I initially wanted to go to bed at 10:30 and it\u2019s 3AM now)and I literally don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s especially weird because I finished all of my hw so I\u2019m not stressed, I rarely have caffeine so I know it\u2019s not that, and whenever I\u2019m at home I never have sleeping problems. I have no idea what to do at this point \ud83d\ude10",

Exercising helps burn off extra energy. Cut excess sugar/alcohol. Also, a glass of water and a tablespoon of apple cidar vinegar can help. In college I never had that problem, I'd sleep soundly on campus in a room full of people.",
