  "title:": "How would you react to this email?",
  "text": "My professor for Philosophy just sent out this e-mail. Five people have come to my room in the last 10 minutes asking about this email. My class is pretty split on thinking its outrageous and the other half thinking its hilarious. How would you react to this? Personally I think its hilarious, but agree that the wording here is insane. \"Act like mature gentlemen\" and \"If you are cold, please bring your binke, ok? In addition, you look like idiots\" have one line in between them. Not very professional in my eyes, but still gave me a laugh so that's something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Currently organizing a binke protest for class tomorrow. Its at 8AM though so its gonna be a longshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost class update: About half the class was wearing hoodies today, He never said a word about the email and lectured as normal. After we got back from class there was an email from the school explaining that there was a faculty member who was let go due to some comments he made to students. We are 90% sure it was him. This was also posted on Instagram and got blown up. A decent amount of people saw this and shared it. I don't know if that had anything to do with but if it did then thanks guys I hated him. I will post another update when we confirm who the staff member who was fired was. The binke protest fell through due to nowhere being open by the time the email was sent and the protest was organized. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkxp45526xs71.jpg?width=1106&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d3f8e678199d90432f9e7315fdab76b49aec2e8",

A normal, comfortable, casual, outfit choice that no one one really thinks twice about. It achieves salience via its interplay with white skin and white skins relationship to society at large.\n\n[Second you have the black people hoodie. A type of clothing that can lead to racial profiling and oppression. It achieves salience via its interplay with black skin and black skin's relationship to society at larg](https://mlk50.com/2018/11/08/why-i-stood-up-against-racial-hoodie-profiling-at-a-memphis-mall/)e.\n\nThen you have the hoodie-as-this-guy-sees-it, a terrible sin on fashion for some reason. It achieves its salience via interplay with the stick up this dudes asshole and the sticks relationship to his massive ego.\n\nSo, you have at least 3 different possible ontologies of the hoodie depending on the circumstances it engages with, or what Deleuze may call its position and movement within its field of immanence. \n\nThis was my Ted talk.",

However, I notice that it isn't in the syllabus, the document that laid out in the beginning of this class how we will operate. You further singled out a gender identity, and barred just that gender identity from the attire; is it safe to assume that women are free to dress for their comfort as they see fit? How about those that do not conform to traditional gender identities? How are they supposed to react.\n\nHowever, levity aside, I feel that I must inform you that you are breaking Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, of which prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Your program accepts federal financial aid, and you may therefore not do that. I have copied the chair of your department, and the Title IX coordinator for <institution> in case you have any questions about the particular discrimination in which you would like to partake. I look forward to being warm in your classroom.",

      "text": "I know you have a tongue-in-cheek response prepared, and I hope it goes well and it all turns out to be a joke. \n\nJust wanted to chime in as a university staff member, I would find it a little concerning if one of my students shared that they received this. I would see if the student feels comfortable forwarding it to the professor's department chair. If not, I would forward an anonymous screenshot like what you've posted on their behalf.\n\nI would probably frame it as being concerned for the professor's well-being, as this isn't usually the kind of message students get from their professors. It's a bit of a red flag that the professor might be experiencing some mental health distress. I'd also be concerned that this professor may have capricious assessment standards for students.\n\nI hope the binkie thing went well. If the professor escalates, please talk to your advisor or the director of undergraduate studies or department chair in the professor's department.",

If you all pass class is cancelled for the rest of the semester. If you don\u2019t all pass whoever receives an A will keep that grade for the semester and be dismissed from class. If you all fail then class will proceed as scheduled but the highest grade u can end up with at the end of the semester is a C (passing grade)\u201d\n\nNow logically everyone would choose B and pass but the whole thing turned out to be an ethics lesson about how much you can trust the people around you and how the results would look if the test was real.

They can get paid other ways such as turning their back to you fill the chalkboard with writings and be a dick about amount of work and tests they give you or they can go somewhere else and have your school lose a experienced faculty.  \n\nJust be mindful and take others into consideration. Don\u2019t force your belief about prof being a dick just because he asked you to be a bit more professional.  Remember soon you will have be suiting up to interview and find a job.

There is only about 15 people in this class. There was one class where he walked out because he wasn't happy with attendance for the day. Only like 6-8 people were there. Other than that I cant say there's any reason behind it. I couldn't care less about the rule but its how unprofessional the email was and how he was asking us to be more mature and in the same paragraph insulting the students for how they dressed. He could have just said no more hoodies. Instead he decided to insult the class. Very unprofessional to me and honestly for the school I'm at, not uncharacteristic. This is not the first staff member who I have seen be outrageously rude to students. This is just the first time I just have any shred of evidence to back that up.",
