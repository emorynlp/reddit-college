  "text": "I like to take my notes digitally (on my convertible windows laptop) directly in the pdf-version of the presentations. However when I open a pdf document through microsoft edge there aren't many options what I could do. For example I want to be able to add blank pages with a grid pattern (or without) in between the pdf pages. Does anyone have software recommendations?\n\nThanks!",
