Which is the right answer?\n\nMy best guess is that it's ok to ask what a job does if they make it vague in the description, but if they tell you exactly what you do in the description it's better to ask \"What the day to day work looks like for x job\" instead?", "author": "mody_bird_s", "created": 1632188181, "retrieved": 1632801346, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdodky1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps8nnf/is_it_appropriate_to_ask_what_a_job_does_during_a/hdodky1/", "text": "I would just make sure you\u2019re asking what specifically people with this job do at this company.
