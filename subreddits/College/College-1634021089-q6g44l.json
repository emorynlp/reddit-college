  "text": "So basically I\u2019ve been in school for a long time. I\u2019m 23 years old now. I went to art school for you, dropped because I realized I would struggle in this professional financially. Went to community colllege for 3 years to figure out/finish GEs while switching major twice. Just transferred to a shitty csu that doesn\u2019t have the major I want so I have to transfer again while thing to bump my gpa significantly because the past 3 semesters have kicked my ass due to deep depression and anxiety during the pandemic. I feel I\u2019ll never make it at this point. I want to study psychology ironically, but it\u2019s taking so long\u2026. The whole reason I wanted to study it was to help people like me, but I can\u2019t even help myself. I just want structure and it seems impossible. I\u2019m hurting real bad.",

      "text": "There's no achieving happiness. It's not some accomplishment that you'll finally hit one day after doing stuff. \n\nHappiness is probably closer to an acceptance of what things are than anything. You can always be happy at any point. \n\nWe get stuck in this \"I'll be happy after I do (insert something here)\". Bitch, that never fucking works. Life is never going to get better and doing something won't ever bring you happiness. \n\nDon't get me wrong. Financial comfort sure makes it easier to be happy but it doesn't make me happy. \n\nBeing happy is stupid silly most the time. You choose it. Mushrooms and trees on campus make me happy. Just find some arbitrary bullshit as your happiness crutch. Maybe it's seeing more than 5 girls belly buttons on the way to class. You just have to make that choice about what makes you happy and just allow it to. There's no trick or anything. \n\nI've dealt with feeling like I can't enjoy anything anymore. I wouldn't even let myself enjoy playing some mindless game for 30 minutes. I couldn't enjoy anything. I couldn't bring myself to get nice things for myself. I have to allow myself to enjoy things. It's hard but it's worth it. Fuck the world, it sucks. At least have a little bit of fun in it. It doesn't have to be serious.",
