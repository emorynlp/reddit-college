  "text": "I'm on my 4th year of architecture school and I wanna just quit it so bad. i feel like I haven't learned anything in these years, I have no interest left and nothing enjoys me anymore. I'm just learning to be a slave of the workload that they put on us, nothing more. I don't know if I will work as an architect in future, I don't see myself capable of but I don't wanna quit bc what will I do after? I don't have much interests in other things and I dont wanna disappoint my family..\n\naside of this, I totally lost my life on it. I don't do anything else and my mind is 90% college stuff I don't have time to do anything else and this is making me feel like shit\n\n\n\n+++thanks to everyone that had the time to answer me, I really appreciate it! I will try to talk to a tutor and to my friends about it and maybe I will realize what I want and what it's best for me",

Having any college degree nowadays opens up a lot of doors by getting you past a lot of useless resume screening and you don\u2019t necessarily have to work in architecture if you don\u2019t want to. Since you already made it this far, just push through and get the diploma. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do after you graduate.\n\nI\u2019m not necessarily trying to advocate to stop giving a shit about your classes, but if college stress is all you think about, just remember, C\u2019s get degrees. Try your best to enjoy these last couple semesters and it\u2019s perfectly fine to take on less stress about school work if it makes you happier.",

How will dropping out impact YOU beyond what everyone else might have to say? Do you have a direction or plan beyond in regards to what you might do if you drop out?

Is there a degree through your architecture school that isn't a professional degree you would need to do a thesis for? Architecture schools are a bit odd, some are 4 years plus a 2-year master's, others are 5 years ending in a bachelor's, but are considered a professional degree so you can take the licensing exam with either one. Is there overlap at your school between interior design, or environmental design? A lot of universities offer a bachelor's of general studies. Depending on your core classes you may be able to finish this year or go online to finish. Then you could work, see what you really want to do, and then go for a master's in a different field, or even at a different school.",

The system is archaic, the pay after a masters is trash, I couldn\u2019t stand the people I was surrounded with. I couldn\u2019t see myself doing this for my life. Leaving that trash was the best.\n\nYou\u2019re kinda in deep. Finishing your degree just to finish it may not be good advice. If you have to get another degree anyway, why mess around for an *additional* year on top of it? Some grad programs and/or careers require a bachelor degree of any type. See if anything like that interests you. If it does, maybe completing the degree just to have a degree as a check in the box is worth it. But if you need a degree in a different major stop right now.\n\nI would suggest taking a year off to work and distance yourself and clear your thought process and vision.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go through with architecture  ultimately it\u2019s going to be expensive and time consuming and you can\u2019t change that. I\u2019d argue living a life you hate will be more \u201ccostly\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on living a dream job of passion. Your career is to pay the bills. Leave your hobbies as hobbies.\n\nI did two years in arch, hated my life, took a year to work, went to community college, destroyed all the calc, linear algebra, stats, physics, chem etc, got an associate transferred back to big boy school with three semesters to do and I\u2019m about to graduate with a public health major, math minor, and on to grad for epidemiology and biostats and I love all of it.\n\nDon\u2019t give into sunk cost (assuming it\u2019s ultimately the correct decision). It WILL be expensive it WILL be time consuming but it may also be WORTH it.",

Even if it might be just a little, it's still more. \nWe didn't go 4 years to college for nothing! There are many ways to change our career paths later on. Maybe you could teach math? Nowadays there are so many options. If we drop out now we would have to go through EVERYTHING again. We would be no different than a high school graduate, just 4 years older. In terms of job options.\nDid you ever look at your list with all the exams and papers you have passed? \nI don't come from a family who can support me if I drop out now. \nSo just see if you can afford it or not. If it makes a good difference. Or if continuing with your degree is the better option overall. \n\nWho knows, maybe you find a similar occupation to an architect which you like?",
