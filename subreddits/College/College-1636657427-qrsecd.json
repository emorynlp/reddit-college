  "title:": "Some wont get it, but its extremely heartbreaking to me when me and my roommates relationship is over and she got my introverted ass to do a bunch of cool stuff.",
  "text": "The biggest mistake I made with having a roommate (freshman) is that I felt there was an obligation to always be in each others presence. Always be each others BFFs. We did absolutely everything together, and we really didn't have much friends outside of that. Now we are in an argument over petty things and we havent hung out in 2.5 weeks and the talking between us has been slim. I thought it would be fine, Im very independent but I got anxiety thinking about it today, like wishing we could go back. She got me to go to parties, got me to talk to people out of my comfort zone, and was reliable to always eat at dining with me. We had plans to go skydiving together too. And now it's done, we agreed to just mind our own stuff, but I miss doing stuff with her. Ive already grown attached to her. Ive found other people to eat at dining, and yesterday I talked for 4 hours with a new friend who shares the same humor as me. But I feel overwhelmed because this \"friend\" confessed feelings for me and I dont feel the same way back and I know for a fact I will not like him back physically. I feel anxious now about having to turn him down, personally wise he's a dream and got it put together but I really dont feel ready for a relationship and tbh I am very immature despite being 18 in terms of relationships. I had strict parents so hanging out with guys was a no. I still find physical affection between me and guys foreign, and I have a hard time really wanting to kiss anyone. Ive went on a lot of dates in college and its just not something im into at this point in my life. Problem is also, that I have to restrict my friends to girls because all my guy friends eventually confess their feelings for me and it makes me uncomfortable (I know childish). \n\nIn short: I feel a bit empty, a bit anxious, and a bit lonely. What do I do now?",

      "text": "um are you me? this feels a little too similar to what i've been experiencing this semester.\n\nmy roommate last year also did everything with me and since she's in a sorority, she got the both of us into parties and let me meet her friends. i genuinely thought we'd be friends for the long haul, i opened up a lot to her and we used to stay up all night talking and doing fun stuff. but this year, everything's changed and after an incident, i can't be in the same room with her without it being awkward and even though this was unspoken, i think both of us agree we won't be friends or have the same relationship ever again. \n\ni didn't realize how much of my social life she was until we stopped being friends. now i spend a majority of my time alone in my room doing homework or doing my own thing while she continues to go out. but making new friends isn't coming easy for me. after having a lot of failed friendships and people i trusted stabbing me in the back (including the roommate), i dont want to put so much effort into something that may end up with me being hurt. \n\ni'm also just over everything concerning my love life too. never had a relationship, i've realized that hookups are not for me, and any interest i see coming in my direction (granted though, this doesn't happen often) i just push away because it irks me. that's not something i want or need right now with all the other messy things going on in my life.\n\ni wish i could offer you some help or advice, but sadly i'm in the same boat. but anyways, what i've realized helps is just learning to be self sufficient. sure i'm still lonely, but that loneliness has significantly decreased after i learned that i'd much rather spend time with myself than most other people. i know a lot of other people say joining clubs or organizations helps them meet compatible friends, but that hasn't been the case for me. maybe i just haven't joined the right ones. but after doing all of my homework, i just watch tv or play with my cat or listen to music and solve puzzles and stuff like that in my room alone. it sounds sad, but genuinely that's the one thing i look forward to everyday. free time by myself. \n\nsorry that was so long. it was more just me ranting but you're not alone! my dms are always open if you ever want to talk or make an online friend.",
