  "text": "I hate having a roommate even though he\u2019s perfectly nice, because I never have any privacy and feel like I have to basically kick him out of the room any time I want to sleep or do anything that requires him not being there. I don\u2019t get how I\u2019m supposed to have privacy when everywhere within a mile of me has people. I feel like I\u2019m trapped surrounded by people, and I socialize and try to make friends sometimes but I don\u2019t enjoy having to constantly be around strangers. This is just not a good lifestyle for me and I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m supposed to do.",

But, the longer you remain passive about this, the more unnecessary resentment your going to build up against someone who probably doesn\u2019t even know this is bothering you because you haven\u2019t communicated that. In any roommate situation, you need to communicate. Refrain from blaming him and just express that you need some time alone and are wondering if there any hours that work for him where he wouldn\u2019t mind leaving so you could get some more private things done (if you don\u2019t want to mention the therapy directly that\u2019s fine but they\u2019ll likely be more understanding if you do). As another comment mentioned try to offer something nice in exchange. I also would recommend trying to befriend them more after this talk so you don\u2019t keep building resentment. But again as long as you avoid the conversation, its on you.\nBest of luck with this, I\u2019m a big privacy person as well so I hope you can resolve this!",
