  "text": "As a sophomore whose first in-person class was this semester, moving out and adapting to the new in person environment is harsh. Ever since school started, my academic self esteem has taken a hard blow. I feel constantly behind my peers both in class and in professional settings. What hurts the most however is how lonely I feel. As a urm, finding a community has been so hard. My randomly assigned roommate is kind of an ass and I have no deep connections with anyone yet. Since my first year was online and I stayed home, I became extremely close with my family and I feel pained whenever I think of them. The loneliness and spiraling has affected my mental health to the point that I\u2019ll start crying at random points of the day. Honestly can\u2019t wait for the semester to end. I plan on moving back home after college and hopefully find work in the area because my mental health can\u2019t take this isolation anymore.\n\nThe truth is though, I don\u2019t want my college experience to be like this. I want to hang out with friends, explore the area, and try new things. Connecting with people who don\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from though and who don\u2019t have the same values as me is really hard. As a first gen student working part time, I can\u2019t eat out everyday or skip out on work due to finances, which causes me to miss out on a lot of outings. A lot of friendships and conversations also just feel very forced and I absolutely hate it. \n\n\nAll in all, college so far has just not been the move. Is it bad for me to wish for these next two and a half years to just end already? I do like learning, but my GPA has suffered, which have affected my self esteem and mental health. I\u2019m feeling very lonely and constantly anxious. I just want to go back home with my parents, but in know I can\u2019t rely on them forever. I genuinely hate the city I\u2019m in however and I hate that I don\u2019t see anyone who looks like me. Nothing I enjoyed makes me happy anymore now that I\u2019m constant anxious. I\u2019ve been to a school counselor, but since those services are all online, they don\u2019t benefit me as much. Tbh I just crave human interaction lol. Is it bad that I want to graduation to come quicker in order for me to move back home permanently after graduation? Or will things gets better?\n\nSincerely, a tired college student :\u2019))",

      "text": "I might suggest killing two birds with one stone. I attended two different universities, and that both of them I made a majority of my close friends through study groups. Sure it might not start out seeming like a friendship, but if you do your homework together two or three times a week you'll eventually get to talking, get to know each other, and you can always Bond over the specific classes that you're in together, especially if you're in the same major.\n\nOut of curiosity, and I mean this sincerely, what is it about being a urm that you find makes it so difficult to find a community? It sounds like you're really trying, so it I doubt you're just limiting yourself to people from your group, but what parts of your past experience make it hard to relate?",

      "text": "Hey I'm a sophomore and it is my first time being in-person too. You say you're a urm, and I've seen clubs and associations at my school directly related to minorities, so my first recommendation would be to attend those groups and just talk to people there. Of course it might feel forced because most conversations in college start off with asking about major, year, etc. but while discussing those you can take it on an interesting route.\n\nI also desire human interaction and sometimes you have to work for it when no one else will. What I mean is in my classes so far this year no one talked to me first, but I've reached out to and have had casual conversations with people sitting near me, and while we're not close at all its at least a starting point. I'm a commuter so I can't comment on your dorm situation, but I feel like that's an even better place to make connections compared to class, where most people just listen to the lecture and dip.\n\nLastly, I would say its not great to want graduation to come quicker to just go move back home. With patience and lots of trials who knows what you can accomplish, and I personally think there are still a lot of opportunities out there. I was very hasteful at the beginning of the semester to make the most friends or connections or something, but I've realized that it can take time and it does need a lot of effort. A lot of effort for me at least because I overthink social situations a lot. It's not necessarily smooth sailing for everyone else either though, and awkward moments are just a part of it. The more people you talk to even with the 'what's your major' opener the better chance of finding that person who you can form a deep friendship with.",
