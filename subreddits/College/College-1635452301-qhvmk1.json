      "text": "The idea of a college is to get you a different outlook on the on the world is true but only partial. Don't feel guilty for wanting to college also to give you skills and a good career and a comfortable life. As for the employability of philosophy degrees, they are as employable as any other major in the sense that there are many jobs out there that required to have a bachelor's degree in anything. Philosophy will probably also give you lots of experience and writing communication critical thinking in a non-numerical sense, etc. So will a philosophy degree get you six figures out of college, no. With philosophy degree guarantee you even 60k out of college, not necessarily. But it will open up opportunities and make you more employable.\n\nBecause a philosophy most likely indicates that you won't be working in your field, I would identify what field you would like to work in that requires a college degree so that you can plan and work towards that while still pursuing a college degree that you're interested in. Also not a bad idea to just go in computer science and make a ton of money.",
