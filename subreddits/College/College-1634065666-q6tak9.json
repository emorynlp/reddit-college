  "text": " Hey, So im an American (18f) living in the Netherlands for university. I lived in Austria before for my moms job. The thing is I want to stay at university. But I think I may be forced to drop out. In the Netherlands if you dont pass the first year they kick you out which means the country also kicks you out due to it being a student visa. I am afraid because I wont have the opportunity to go to uni again at least for many years. Also the financial loss will be great as its all out of pocket. Also my contract forces me to pay for my housing for 12 months even if I got kicked out of the country. I also cant work in Austria (cant speak German). I also dont want to go back to the US. I dont know what I would even do. Im so scared and I feel like my life is over already.",

I know that you don\u2019t want to go to America, and I don\u2019t blame you, but really there are many good community colleges over here I can give you a leg up and will except you as long as you have a pulse. You\u2019re only 18, and I hope this doesn\u2019t sound condescending, but you were great and you have so much amazing possibility ahead of you.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible have you considered looking at other universities in Europe that teach in English depending on your major?",

And if you want to look somewhere else in Europe then I would consider broadening your horizons.\n\nAny reason why you don\u2019t wanna go to the US, because I know Reddit makes it out to be a third world country but as someone from a Third World country trust me do US is literal paradise even though it\u2019s not as great as Europe (lived in Germany) and the university systems is pretty decent actually.",

If it\u2019s something else like immigration, then I understand, or an abusive family member or partner, I understand but just saying the \u201cUS is not safe\u201d is just a massively huge generalization.\n\nAlso the US Uni system literally babies you. It\u2019s the most hand holding university system in the world. Foreigners from third world countries (me, before Germany) love it here because, well, there\u2019s so much flexibility.\n\nAnd community college is very forgiving. Do NOT go to a big city. You can apply to a community college and fill out FAFSA. Colleges are also always hiring custodians and secretaries which make decent money so do that for a year (family member did that, saved up 40k, cheap rent in mid size city)",

Just because they don\u2019t \u201ctalk about trans issues\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re any less horrible. \n\nThere are no magically \u201cgood states\u201d. If you go to a safe mid size city, then you will be fine. Honestly suburbs are fine too. College campuses are fine for trans people, honestly as a trans NB bio female, there literally the most accepting places on earth. \n\nThat\u2019s it. Maybe stay away from the Deep South but that\u2019s just not true. They\u2019re are plenty of gay and trans people that live in the south, and honestly we\u2019re thriving and doing just fine. Homophobic people on college campuses are laughed out of classes, it\u2019s genuinely not a problem over here. \n\nOr you can look somewhere else in Europe and get a job. Up to you. But you need to do your OWN research, and broaden your horizons then. \n\nAlso look at Eastern Europe if you want cheap prices and education l, but know that it\u2019s not always LGBT friendly.",

And even from developed countries like Europe, that shit can be so much more insidious. Just because they don\u2019t talk about transgender issues doesn\u2019t mean that they actually care in fact I found that all they do is sweep it under the rug.\n\nBut we keep thriving as LGBT people because we are strong and our very existence means to be marginalized.

So I wear mine as a badge of honor and I don\u2019t let anybody fuck with my opportunities.
