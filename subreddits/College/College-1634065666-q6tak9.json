  "text": " Hey, So im an American (18f) living in the Netherlands for university. I lived in Austria before for my moms job. The thing is I want to stay at university. But I think I may be forced to drop out. In the Netherlands if you dont pass the first year they kick you out which means the country also kicks you out due to it being a student visa. I am afraid because I wont have the opportunity to go to uni again at least for many years. Also the financial loss will be great as its all out of pocket. Also my contract forces me to pay for my housing for 12 months even if I got kicked out of the country. I also cant work in Austria (cant speak German). I also dont want to go back to the US. I dont know what I would even do. Im so scared and I feel like my life is over already.",
