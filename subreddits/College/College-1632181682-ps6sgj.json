My professor's first language is Spanish, and his accent is really thick. I have auditory processing issues which can make it very difficult for me to understand what he is saying during lectures. I tried recording using a transcription app I found so that I could read what he is saying, but it couldn't understand him either.\n\nI just took our first exam today, and it was rough to say the least. More than half of the questions just generally didn't make sense. A lot of the options for fill in the blank didn't fit grammatically, sentences were just overall very, very difficult to decipher. I'm very worried I'm going to get it back with a terrible grade due to this. I take my exams in a different building so that I can have a distraction reduced environment as well as time and a half on all exams, so I can't ask him directly to clarify what a question means.\n\nI checked and the only other NEURO 101 class is online asynchronous, and I really struggled with asynchronous classes last year, so I'd prefer not to do that. But I also don't want to fail an intro class to my major. I love neuroscience, but this class is making me second guess myself.\n\nIs there anything I can do to make this easier? He doesn't seem to teach much from the book, and his PowerPoint presentations only give so much information. Most is just from what he says in class.", "author": "serpentheo", "created": 1632181682, "retrieved": 1632801001, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"hdqxv74": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps6sgj/difficult_first_exam_due_to_professors_broken/hdqxv74/", "text": "Are you working with an Office of Accessibility?
