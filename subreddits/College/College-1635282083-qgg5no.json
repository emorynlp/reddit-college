  "text": "I\u2019m a biology student from Canada and now that I\u2019m in my final year of university I want to participate in collaborative projects related to my degree. However, I am not exactly sure how to meet people to work on these projects with, especially if no one at my school is interested. I\u2019m looking for a group or place to connect to any other college/university students who are interested in participating in case study or research competitions, forming a team for science contests, or creating extracurricular clubs or organizations related to academics. \n\nI was hoping that this subreddit would have a discord to potentially be able to network with other students interested in similar opportunities but I can\u2019t find one so if anyone knows of one (or another group on another platform) please let me know! Alternatively, if others are interested in figuring out how to create a space for students to network and collaborate on projects, I\u2019m 100% down to help!",
