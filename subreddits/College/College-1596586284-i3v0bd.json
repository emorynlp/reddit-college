Colleges will take your money. Many won't take you without a GED or earning your GED there if it's a community college that does that. Honestly, don't worry about college right now. If you ever want to succeed at it focus on the essential of the foundation you need for that. Find remedial courses for basic math and English. College gets hard fast. Plateauing in education is bad. \n\nCollege is really about skills. Studying is a skill. Writing is a skill. Reading is a skill. Speaking is a skill. Know what questions to ask and how to ask them is a skill. Knowing how to know what you do/don't know is a skill. Knowing how to organize your life and manage time is a skill. Knowing how to prioritize and strategically plan and stick to it is a skill. Being aware and realistic about where you're at is a skill. Smart people fail college because they fail to consistently execute multiple skills effectively. Average people can ace college if they're disciplined and practiced. Knowing how to tell people to fuck off when you're busy is a skill. Knowing how to be independent and undistracted is a skill. Anticipating the future is a skill. \n\nGet your GED. College is about setting goals and making them happen. Set your goal to ace the math on the GED. And the essay.\n\nPatrick JMT on YouTube. Math is a skill. My grandfather was a mathematician. He worked very hard at math. It's not you're inherently  good/not good at it. You either worked towards your ability or didn't. It's that simple. But not easy. College is like this. Smart people can be not good at shit and has to truck through. \n\nFocus on math and focus on basic writing. How to write a sentence. Use commas. Proper grammar. Specific and clear thesis. 3 body paragraphs with topic sentences that support thesis. Supporting details in paragraphs. Conclusion that summarizes and illustrates how the thesis followed from the discussion into something generally worth thinking about. Being able to do this spontaneously through organizing your thoughts and not having problems with grammar and punctuation. \n\nI've had college courses where you literally have a few days to read an entire book. It's your job to be able to know what's important and what is not. And remember it. And then walk into class and answer a previously unknown essay prompt  right then and there. You have to answer the question. Proper spelling, grammar, punctuation. Paper has to be neatly written without shit crossed out. \n\nMy point is don't put the cart before the horse. GED isn't college prep. But it's better than not getting it.

I would also check into your financial aid eligibility to see if you can get help for college; if you don\u2019t qualify for it then you\u2019re definitely gonna need the GED in order to get scholarships (and some states even award scholarships to GED graduates, my state gave me $500), and to get a decent entry level job in order to pay for school. Also, having a GED can prevent you from having to take a lot of remedial courses. I scored high enough on my GED in English and science that I didn\u2019t have to take any remedial courses when I started college. I did have to take a remedial math class though before I was allowed to take any regular math courses. Remedial courses don\u2019t count toward your degree and it\u2019s basically something you have to do to satiate the school; but they still cost money so if you can avoid them by doing well on your GED and placement tests then do it.

They're considerably less expensive than college course tuition, so I highly recommend looking into them if you want to save money. I'm currently considering taking some of them myself as a rising sophomore in college due to the cost-effectiveness. I think there are three main things to consider when deciding whether to take these exams:\n\n1. Different universities have different policies on whether they accept credit from these exams, so make sure that the colleges you want to apply to will accept them beforehand. \n2. You will have to self-study or get a tutor or investigate online resources to help study for these exams. I'm sure there are prep books out there, and it seems like you've had success with self-studying for the GED, so as long as you're okay with self-studying you'll be able to handle the preparatory period before the exams.\n3. If you plan on entering the premed path, most med schools don't accept online credit and/or exam credit for fulfillment of course prerequisites. As such, I'd mostly recommend these exam options for courses outside of your prerequisites -- but only if you're premed. If you're going into a different career path then you should be fine to take online courses in the place of prerequisite courses, especially given how the pandemic is affecting the way colleges teach classes in general. I haven't heard about other fields that are as particular as premed about prerequisites, but if you look through reddit I'm sure you'll find better explanations of the pros and cons of these exams.\n\nI wish you lots of good luck on your GED and beyond! :D", "author": null, "created": 1596596288, "upvotes": 4}, "g0elj1h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/i3v0bd/im_an_18yearold_high_school_and_middle_school/g0elj1h/", "text": "You should 100% get your GED.

If you have any math tutoring resources available to you (including Youtube!), use those and level up your math skills as cheaply as you possibly can. If you end up needing to take remedial courses in college, they most likely won't count toward your degree, and it will take longer to complete your program. Most bachelor's degree programs require at least one quantitative reasoning class of some kind - even the totally non-STEM disciplines like art and language and history and such.\n\nI encourage you to think hard about what you want to go to college for - not like, what do you want to do with your degree, although that is also important.
