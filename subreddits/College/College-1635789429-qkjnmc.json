  "title:": "Why is it so difficult to find a relationship in college?",
  "text": "Ive been looking to get into a serious long-term relationship but it seems like most people just want to hook up. Anyone else feel the same way?\n\nEdit: I understand that most people in college want to focus on careers and all. But I have learned to balance my work, school, and romantic/hookup life. Im actually an investor as my job, which is cool to do at 18. Private equity and stonks. \n\nIt took me a while to learn how to balance things, and I think most students in college should learn how to. Its an amazing life skill. I was in a dark place before I started college. \n\nOne example of this is that I make sure all of my work is done before I have dinner (including clubs and that stuff).",

I also imagine most students are less interested in \u201cpidgeonholing\u201d themselves at such a transitory time in their life. \n\nAfter college, life really starts to change for most people that move into professional life. Routines start to become far more necessary, no more new classes with fresh faces each term, your peer group begins narrowing, and the opportunities to meet new people become more scarce. \n\nIn college, the dating pool is wide, accessible, and there is turnover. For most in the professional world, it not only becomes harder to experiment in the dating scene, but it also becomes far more necessary to seek stability instead. \n\nTL;DR: After college, your dating opportunities will narrow. While there is room for experimentation in the professional world, it becomes more challenging. By committing yourself to long-term relationships in college, you are essentially eschewing the unique social opportunities that largely only dating in college can provide.",

Finish school, land your dream job, see and do cool shit, get your bread up, figure out what you want in life and in a partner, then find someone that is going to help you accomplish great things and be a better you. People waste too much time jumping into long-term relationships time and time again when they are young. You miss out on so many experiences and opportunities. Very few college students are actually competent enough to engage in a serious relationship.",

Listening to my friends piss and moan about this same exact shit is exhausting. You're not gonna find your life partner at 21 years of age, so stop stressing about it.\n\nOn a less aggressive note, the truth is even people who want a long term relationship at this stage aren't mature enough for one. Hunting aggressively for it is just going to get you involved in a bunch of bad relationships, it's gonna get you overinvolved with someone who doesn't care, or it's gonna put you in a self-destructive hoe phase when things don't pan out. Love isn't something you track down like a meal. You don't systematically create it like passive income. There's no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nEventually you're gonna meet someone who lights up your world, who you're gonna care for with every fiber of your being, and they're gonna bring you so much joy. And you're gonna do the same for them. And it's gonna be a lot of hard, exhausting work to keep it that way, but it's work that you want to do for that person. Until then, you just gotta wait until that person shows up. Know it'll happen, and recognize when it does. Patience.",

A decent number would find me attractive as well. Of that pool, a huge swath of them are not very compatible in one way or another, at least not right now. Maybe we don\u2019t share any common interests, maybe they don\u2019t think at all like I do, or share opinions, maybe they are more or less mature than I am, have morals I wouldn\u2019t put up with\u2026the list goes on and on. \n\nSay you have some fear of missing out on said people, or wonder if it could work, or just want some fun. Then *allllll* of those people you\u2019d otherwise write off if you were looking for something serious are suddenly on the table. \n\nMore options, potentially less rejection, lower stakes\u2026I guess it makes sense in some respects. And if you\u2019re hooking up, maybe you\u2019ll find someone, but in the meantime at least you feel less lonely.",
