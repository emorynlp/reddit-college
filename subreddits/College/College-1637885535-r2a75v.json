      "text": "Try starting a hobby that relates to the subject you're studying. For me, I make soap and draw reaction trees to help me better understand organic chemistry. If you're studying engineering, try getting into robotics or structure building from legos or toothpicks. If you're into biology, try indoor gardening with small plants like aloe vera that are easy to handle, or bonsai trees! They may not seem like much, but being \"productive\" over break shouldn't feel like work. If it does, you'll exhaust yourself before the spring semester even starts. If you learn in an enjoyable or relaxing way however, you'll likely start ahead of the curve feeling refreshed and ready to go!",

I did that with one of my lit classes and it saved me so much time to just skim over the books again than it would have to stress read some of them and try to retain while taking other classes.      \n  \n\nTalk to people who have already taken your Spring classes and see if they have the syllabus (or ask the prof if you can get a copy of the current one).",

          "text": "This a way to get As imo. What I did over the summer was look at the syllabus for my courses and figured out what to study. Found YouTube lectures and guides and spent about 4 weeks \u201cloosely\u201d studying them. Once the semester began I had about a \u201c2 month\u201d advantage in two science courses and the material was way easier to grasp. I\u2019m already studying for next semester because I have this semester in the bag with 3 weeks left.\n\nYou really don\u2019t have to study but the key is to be productive. Maybe you want to lose weight or get in shape? It\u2019s a good time to build good habits!",
