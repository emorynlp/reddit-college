I used to do the starbucks drink with nonfat milk, and grab one of these blister packs with hard boiled eggs and fruit and cheese.\n\nAlso how many dining options do you have? Here there are dining halls but also restaurant-style places as well. I found a place that served noodle and rice bowls. I opted for vegetarian items just to maximize the veg and basically ate there every weekday.",

There really isn't an easy solution here, unless your college has a community kitchen where you can meal-prep your & can store them in the fridge for the week.\n\nThe only healthy option for me is the dining hall (they actually make healthy stuff at my college), but it gets old eating there more than a few times per week. I also don't understand why they won't let us have toaster ovens here (we are legally adults). \n\nLet me know if you find a solution as I have the same dilemma. Good luck!",

      "text": "I struggle with the same. \nI\u2019m changing my eating habits. I\u2019m starting to cut out junk food. Chips, sodas, cookies and \u201cdesserts\u201d in general. If I\u2019m hungry, I look for an actual meal, or at least a turkey sandwich, maybe a salad. Basically whatever I can find that isn\u2019t straight up junk food. Will power and portions have a lot to do with eating healthy as well. Resisting buying a chocolate bar is hard. Also, buying a pack of cookies that contains 8 cookies, eat all cookies at once and later buy another pack, is different from buying a pack of cookies that contains 8 cookies, eat 2, later on the day eat another 2, and later in the evening eat another 2, and save the rest for the next day. Of course, a pack of cookies is not a full meal, even less 2 cookies, but if you are only snacking, or buying the cookies as an add-on to your meal, it is better to eat 2 (or whatever one portion is) instead of the whole pack. \n\nI hope you can take something positive and helpful from this :)",

But even then, that is helpful, maybe we stick to good eating a few days at first, but then when we go back at it, we can stick to it for longer. Maybe first a few days, later a couple weeks until it becomes a solid habit/lifestyle. I honestly can say that saying no to desserts is hard, but once we do it once, we can do it twice.",
