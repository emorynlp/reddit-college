I'm a stem major, on a pre-vet track so the work load is quite hefty but I was managing well, I had met someone with the same goals as me and we were going over lectures, studying for quizzes and tests regularly and it was a great help. However, I started to fall behind a bit, and while studying with them I was lost and didn't contribute much to the study session. I also made a mistake in taking a bus to the class and missed a lecture for the first time, putting me even more behind. At this point it seemed like they were trying to avoid me because I wasn't of much help, and then they stopped asking me to study with them and said they preferred to study alone when I asked. I've never had to actively study and always got by with good grades with little to no studying up to this point, so having them as a guidance and motivation to keep up studying was extremely useful. I recently missed another lecture because I overslept and when I messaged them to send me their recording of the lecture but they never responded and started to avoid me, so now I'm on my own, I don't have any other friends and haven't met anyone else from my major. I have a big test coming up soon and everything feels like its moving too fast for me to get a solid grasp of everything. I'm dorming and not close to home, so I'm still trying to get used to everything like managing money, time, getting food, etc... every day starts to feel harder and harder, and I'm getting constant headaches and just not feeling well mentally. Sorry for the long explanation of my situation, I'm not sure if this what the subreddit is supposed to be used for but I would really appreciate any tips or help from anyone who's gone through something similar or has any insight that could help me", "author": "CounterfeitCat", "created": 1632791363, "retrieved": 1632945482, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hekt937": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwv5xt/just_started_college_but_im_already_questioning/hekt937/", "text": "I\u2019m worrying about the same thing.
