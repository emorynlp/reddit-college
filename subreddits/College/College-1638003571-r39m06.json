  "text": "So long story short, I think I'm going to fail one of my classes. I'm a first-semester student taking seven credits, but some mental health issues have caused me to fall behind. I've already caught up in all of them except one, which is very work-intensive. It's too late to drop this class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling that I'll end up on academic probation, but is there anything else I can expect from flunking one class? Thanks in advance.",
