  "title:": "How many classes can I handle over the summer?",
  "text": "For some context, I'm a high school sophomore so I'm not all that experienced when it comes to colleges. I'd really like to take some economics and financial classes at my local community college over the summer, but I'm not totally sure how many I can handle. Just to clarify a bit, I know a lot of people suffer from burnout, but I'm not really one of those, and the classes I plan on taking are in a field I really enjoy. I also don't plan on working *too* much, maybe about 8-16 hours a week. The classes I'll be taking are also beginners classes, so more long the lines of \"Fundamentals of Personal Investing\" and not something like advanced calculus. So, in general, how many credit hours worth would I realistically be able to handle? (I'm pretty sure they're all 10 week classes)",
