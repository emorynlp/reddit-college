  "text": "Edit: cost difference is about $30k  \nBoth are SUNY schools.  It shouldn't be hard to figure out what I'm talking about, but I'm not going to mention the names directly.\n\nI am currently a science major on the premed track.\n\n|Hometown SUNY|Current SUNY|\n|:-|:-|\n|\\- Less research.  But, research is available in house.|\\- Probably 2-3x in house research.  In addition, there are numerous labs within a 30 minute drive that take undergrad students as research assistants (and some of those positions are paid)|\n|$30k maximum cost for 3 years.  Parents are willing to pay the full cost.|$61k maximum cost for 3 years (after subtracting academic scholarships that I already have).  Parents are fine with paying for it all.|\n|10 minute commute.  Living at home|Dorming (which I am neutral on).  4-6 hr drive home, depending on traffic and how fast I feel like driving.|\n|I have a few old high school friends going there, also for premed.  There is a lot less diversity though.  However, I grew up nearby so I know how it is.|I have made a ton of new friends and have also met a lot of other people from my cultural background my age.  There is also a higher percentage of the student body as premeds.  So, it is easy to relate to new people.|\n|Class difficulty is about the same|Class difficult is about the same|\n|Has a few clinical opportunities.  But, it is hard to get shadowing, scribing positions etc. because the university is a similar size to my current univeristy.  But, the local population is smaller and so there are a lot fewer hospitals nearby.|Way more hospitals nearby  mean that the ratio of opportunities to opportunists is much better.  Also, since the area is much more populate, there are also more opportunities to shadow/scribe with specialists.|\n|I grew up in the area and I have good memories here.|I wasn't a fan of this university because of the more densely populated surroundings.  But, I've grown to appreciate it and I see more opportunity to grow here personally and professionally.|\n\nI still want to go to my current university for academic opportunities and because I like the diverse campus more.  But, I am torn on the cost difference.",

Also if you're serious about a resume, just be a big fish at a small school instead of a small fish at a big school. Also, let's say senior year you decide fuck the medschool stuff, don't want to do it. YOU WONT BE $60000 IN DEBT.",

          "text": "I don't have any debt currently and my parents are paying for it all.  For the first year, I am paying $0 out of pocket because my parents' income was 1/4 what it is now when I applied last year.  I just feel weird having them spend so much money on me, especially since I grew up on that 1/4 income.\n\nI will say though, I can definitely make it as a premed in my hometown university as there are many premeds that do get accepted there yearly.  Thanks for sharing your advice!",
