      "text": "For the record, should you chose to call a doctor for anxiety, you'll need to call a psychiatrist (if you're in the States). Those appointments usually go over your symptoms, family history, personal life history, and then you and your doctor work TOGETHER to figure out a best path forward for you. If your doctor dictates to you, find a new doctor. You know yourself better than anyone and you have to advocate for yourself hard with some people.\n\nFor general de-stressing, I play video games. Usually JRPGs because the stories keep my mind engaged. Or I watch anime. Again, stories are what gives my brain the feel-good hit so that's what I gravitate towards.\n\nFor colds, I got nothing. Colds hit me hard. Like, in bed \"dying\" for 3 days hard. I've never found a remedy except sleep.",
