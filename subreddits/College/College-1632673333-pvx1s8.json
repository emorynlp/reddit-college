That being said I don't retain it well after the exam so make sure to take the time to fully learn the material after, if your exams are cumulative or you have a final. Also great because you can use it on your phone whenever like while waiting for a class to start or whatever. Speaking it out loud helps. I suggest making your own set even if one exists because you can customize it to your needs, but also, more importantly, typing out all the flashcards will help you remember. Schedule out your next few days thoroughly. Meals, showers, commutes, everything. I also sometimes find it helpful to rewatch lectures on 2x speed if they're available online when I can't be actively reading something (walking, driving, etc).
