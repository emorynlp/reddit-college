  "text": "Hi guys, \n\nNot sure if this is the proper subreddit for my question.\nI was wondering how different education systems are valued for international job seeking. \nComing from the US or UK employers tend to know about the strength of the applicants, but what about other system. How easy is it to get a job abroad if your coming from other education systems, such as Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, Japan etc.? \nHow do people see these education systems without big names like Oxford or Harvard? \n(Ignore the fact of job experience or any practical experience)",

      "text": "This is not a countrywide thing.  Some universities in the Netherlands, for example, have world renowned engineering programs, and people in engineering people will know that.  The same school may have a mediocre fine arts program and people in the fine arts will know that.\n\nThere are also specific country -country things.  Like the US is a bit snotty about UNAM when some of their programs are actually better than what we have here but this is a US-Mexico thing and doesn\u2019t necessarily translate elsewhere.  Again in those specific programs , it is a small world",
