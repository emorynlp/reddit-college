  "title:": "I just withdrew from University of Phoenix.",
  "text": "I had enrolled about two months ago and was in my third course, working on a bachelor's in computer science. I knew for-profit colleges could be shady and expensive, but my company is partnered with them so I received a discount on top of $5,250 in tuition reimbursement per year. I also knew of the strong stigma against for-profit schools, but figured an (accredited) degree is a degree and if I could show projects to demonstrate my skills then I'd be fine...\n\nAnd then I started reading this sub, and realized exactly how most people in industry and academia view UoP -- either with humor or total disdain. Whether or not those views are justified, they're not something I wanted to contend with once I graduated and started looking for a job. \n\nI have a personal policy that if you go looking for advice and every single piece of information you find says the same thing, you have to at least consider that information. I wanted to stubbornly stick to my guns and believe that if I worked hard I'd end up okay, but having mulled it over enough, I realized it would be smarter to go with my gut and withdraw. \n\nI'm working on making a plan to go to a local community college for the next two years. Half of me feels like a weight is off my shoulders, and the other half is purely disappointed that the plan I had didn't work out. I'm 30 years old and I was so ready to be in university.\n\nIn case anyone else in this sub is going through the same thing -- you're not alone. Having to change your plans hurts a little sometimes, but, both to you and to myself, just keep trying.",

It's frustrating... I went to an event where the VP of Zillow talked at length about how she got into computer science because a friend of hers who was vacating her position at Microsoft asked her to take over (she didn't even apply). She said she had no CS experience at the time. She also said she would never consider hiring anyone who didn't at least have a bachelor's from a big name school. To this day I wonder if she ever realized how much of a hypocrite she sounded like.",

I attend PSU World Campus and all my classes are asynchronous, and so far almost all of my classmates have balanced work and school. We still have group projects, but they really haven't been as bad as they sound like the would be. Our tests are often proctored online which can be a bit weird, but it keeps the programs respected so it makes sense. A set-up like that might work for you.",

That being said, if there is a tuition reimbursement at University of Phoenix, it might be worth looking into a target university and working with your preferred school's counselor to transfer credits from your old school to new one. I looked it up and UOP has a regional accreditation, so that is a potential do especially if you want the tuition reimbursement, which YOU SHOULD.\n\n Washington State also reimburses for the first four years of college education for persons who qualify for FAFSA, so the tuition reimbursement may not be a big thing but that is also dependent in your income and need.",

The problem is the tests are too easy to pass, you sometimes have unlimited attempts, and you go over the material so fast you won't retain it. I understand why most people have their doubts about UoP.\n\nThey are also really, really expensive... about $600 per credit whereas I think my local CC is still sitting at about $100 per credit.
