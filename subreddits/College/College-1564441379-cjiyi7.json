  "title:": "I go to college in 19 days and my roommate has blocked my number and cut off all communication",
  "text": "Has anyone ever had this happen? Anything similar? What do I even do about this? I didn\u2019t really like him to begin with, which is entirely based on some text conversations and his lack of communication, so I\u2019m fully aware that I don\u2019t have the right to be full-blown angry at him since I\u2019ve never even talked on the phone with him, but I have to say I never expected to be ghosted by someone I\u2019ve never even met and am now supposed to live with for 9 months.\n\nEDIT: Checked my school\u2019s website and it turns out he moved out and didn\u2019t tell me. Wow.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve fallen victim to one of the classic blunders! He just messaged me back on IG and my texts from the last several days delivered, indicated he did not in fact block me! He said he\u2019s been in the hospital the past few days (explains why the texts didn\u2019t deliver), but he\u2019s still no longer showing up on the housing portal; according to that I\u2019m still solo.\n\nEDIT 3: He said he\u2019s not attending my school this semester so he won\u2019t be my roommate.\n\nEDIT 4: I have been assigned a new roommate as of 8/1. It\u2019s been an interesting saga, thanks for the sympathizing and the upvotes.",

Some roommates *don't want to talk* very much, they want a quiet space to live and work and to me it sounds like you've made it very clear you will be bothersome.\n\nI recommend backing off whoever your roommate turns out to be, stop messaging them unless it's *absolutely necessary* or even wanted..",

I know this because the stories I could tell of roommates from vastly different backgrounds becoming the greatest of friends... like Chris the Quaker from Greenwich CT who rowed crew and was selected to be roommates with Jake from the Bronx who grew pot plants in his closet.... Uhmmmm. Never mind.\n\nAnd, if it doesn't work out, well, that's why there's a room exchange period...\n\nWork hard. Study hard. Play hard.
