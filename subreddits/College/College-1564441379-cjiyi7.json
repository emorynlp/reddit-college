Anything similar? What do I even do about this? I didn\u2019t really like him to begin with, which is entirely based on some text conversations and his lack of communication, so I\u2019m fully aware that I don\u2019t have the right to be full-blown angry at him since I\u2019ve never even talked on the phone with him, but I have to say I never expected to be ghosted by someone I\u2019ve never even met and am now supposed to live with for 9 months.\n\nEDIT: Checked my school\u2019s website and it turns out he moved out and didn\u2019t tell me. Wow.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve fallen victim to one of the classic blunders! He just messaged me back on IG and my texts from the last several days delivered, indicated he did not in fact block me! He said he\u2019s been in the hospital the past few days (explains why the texts didn\u2019t deliver), but he\u2019s still no longer showing up on the housing portal; according to that I\u2019m still solo.\n\nEDIT 3: He said he\u2019s not attending my school this semester so he won\u2019t be my roommate.\n\nEDIT 4: I have been assigned a new roommate as of 8/1.
