  "title:": "How do professors curve and what is the possibility of this?",
  "text": "So for organic chem II, the test average was a 31%, 53 students took the exam. The highest grade was an 82.5%, one of the lower grades but not the lowest was a 14%. Did students do poorly in general below that average number? What\u2019s the process for curves and can it be curved in general? The avg was the lowest he\u2019s seen. Averages online were higher due to cheating. In a previous semester for an exam for this class another very brutal professor, maybe worse, had an avg of 43% during the online format and added 10 points in the exam grades. This is obviously lower and different. \n\nThe professor stated this \u201cI don\u2019t want to promise you all a curve because if I do you won\u2019t want to study\u201d. Which is understandable but how do you guys feel about this? \n\nI mean no one can say but the professor himself but what\u2019s your thoughts or opinions?",

When you have most students getting below a 50%, that\u2019s failure on the professor\u2019s part imo.",

That\u2019s what everyone was telling me I mean with all the cheating that went on last semester the previous guy who taught this class didn\u2019t need that curve too much. Because if I did my calculations right I would\u2019ve had a C at least, I got a C- so he didn\u2019t use the curve basically because if the high test averages. Which was like a 63-66, minus one which a 43 was received and this guy added 10 points to everyone\u2019s grades. This professor I have rn is a bit more kinder in therms of knowing how students do and what they\u2019re trying to achieve, but yeah that curve is a big thing rn. A 31 is low and he recognized it was the lowest he\u2019s seen",
