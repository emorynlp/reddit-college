  "text": "Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. I recently started my freshman quarter and I\u2019m really not enjoying my time at my current 4-year university. I know it\u2019s still early so I\u2019m still trying to meet new people, attend clubs, etc. But I have a sinking feeling that my current university is not for me. So my question is is there an option of just transferring at the end of the year, after I attended one year/quarter of college, to another university but just to join the freshman class and not the sophomore class in order to get another fresh start?",

      "text": "Straight up that\u2019s impossible because you status (example freshman,sophomore,junior etc..) is mostly based on credits. So if you have 24 credits or more  already you\u2019re automatically a sophomore but if you have less than that than you\u2019re a freshman",

              "text": "Unfortunately college is not like that, your credits is going to be on your official transcript and that\u2019s how they go about things. \nBut there\u2019s another trick if you\u2019re looking to transfer some of your credits from the college you\u2019re in may not transfer to the other college because they have different syllabus so yeah there\u2019s a way and that\u2019s the only way",
