  "text": "In 2019 before the pandemic, I wanted to pursue dentistry. I no longer want this, and I have entertained doing PA School but not sure I want this either. All my classmates are determined to go to med school which I definitely don't want. Optometry is a good maybe, but again, not enthusiastic.\n\nI am feeling lost. I graduate in December with a BA in Biology (should end with GPA 3.8 or higher, certainly above 3.7 if I don't do as well in my current classes). I am in NYC. What are some really cool and interesting graduate programs I could take that would lead to a solid career? Something in the sciences, maybe an offshoot from biology or something that wouldn't require too many additional prerequisites. Any ideas? I want to make decent money doing something interesting and stable/reliable with room for growth. I know personality plays a big role in things, so if it helps I'm not a big people person and I'm an INTP. I can be good with people when I choose to be but normally I like to be independent.",
