  "text": "Has anyone had experience burning out so hard they end up sick? I got a covid test today and am waiting for a response. I honestly don't know whether I am more afraid of a positive or negative result. If positive, then I can say goodbye to my efforts this semester. If negative, it's probably becauae i burned myself out (again). \n\nI honestly don't even know what to do anymore. There is so much pressure from my parents and society to do a lot to the point where I burn out essentially every semester. Any advice?",

Do your work the next day. Dont check your email. Dont check canvas. Breathe. Maybe call Student Counseling Services, they should be wonderful to help, this affects so many students.",

          "text": "This is important. I'm going to go a step further and suggest that this MUST be incorporated into your week. \n\nI think since a lot of young adults live on campus, there's this idea that they should always be on. You absolutely need to treat weekends as weekends. \n\nI've come back at 32 and it's so much different than my 20's. For one, I have discipline to get my work done during the week before 5 pm. I only work past 5 pm a few times a semester and never ever past 9. My week very much looks like my work week did before I came back to college. \n\nAt the same time, I don't study on weekends either. I've never had to. I generally wake up and get started on studies at 8 AM on the days I don't have classes. The two days off a week I use to catch up and get ahead on my studies. \n\nI've experienced a very LOW amount of stress this semester. I've realized that I can curb the stress a ton by simply getting things done before hand. There's nothing better than knowing you've got 4 days before anything is due since you got ahead. \n\nThe full days off of not checking anything need to be a normal thing. Your body needs them. That means you've got to work diligently during the week when you should be working so you can enjoy and relax on the weekends. \n\nI feel like this is why so many young people experience so much mental stress once they go to college. They don't know how to separate studies from life. Learning that will greatly improve your quality of life while in college. It takes some practice but it's completely achievable and totally worth the effort.",

If you have access to mental healthcare through your schools health services, take advantage of that! If not, as much rest and self-care as you can.",
