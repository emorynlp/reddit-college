  "text": "I\u2019m not totally sure if this is the right place to be posting this but here goes anyways. It\u2019s my freshman year as a music major and I am the most depressed I have ever been in my entire life. I\u2019m not a bad student, I generally do pretty well academically. In high school I got straight A\u2019s and was very driven, but these past few months I\u2019ve had little motivation to do literally anything. I\u2019ve made zero friends on campus and I feel very isolated from those around me. Everything with regards to my classes feels so overwhelming and I\u2019m thinking of changing my major. Is this normal? I\u2019ve been watching my classmates have a great time learning and growing and developing friendships but I just feel totally stagnant. Throughout my life college was always built up to me as \u201cthe best years of your life\u201d but I am having the worst time. Anyone experiencing something similar? Or know what to do about it?",

      "text": "Yes. I was in the same exact situation actually with the music major, making no friends, not feeling the major because I struggled grade-wise, feeling isolated etc. I'm in senior year now stuck in the major bc I just want to graduate in time.\n\nMy only advice is if you really do feel like it's not for you listen to your gut and change it. I know being a musician is your identity but if you really don't see it being a thing for you, and you don't like it please don't hesitate to explore other options. Don't settle. You still have time to figure out what you enjoy and what will make you feel comfortable and confident.",
