  "text": "Has anyone ever rushed into their masters ? \nIm in my final year of engineering (undergrad) and I didn't get a job , and I personally did not want to get a job through college placement. I want to do my master's but I'm not 100% sure if I do. Like yea, I want to learn more about my field (aerospace engineering) because I half assed nearly 4 semesters due to covid. But at the same time I'm not sure I'm as passionate about the field as other people in my class. Do u know anyone who regrets doing their masters ? Is it wise to do masters if I have no clue what I want to do with my life , or should I have just gotten a job that I knew I'd hate ? \nI'm from india , planning to study abroad",

      "text": "It is so hard to get a job with just a bachelors. I found that many positions want certifications and licensures rather than degrees. I am honestly struggling. The plan was to save up for medical school but instead i am getting ready to pay back undergrad without a job yet. \nI recommend continuing school if you can. For now, just take some time to plan out where you want to be in 5 years. Time goes by fast, bills will start rolling in for undergrad sooner or later. You will have better luck becoming financially stable if you look for a job while still in school or by remaining in school and getting a masters.",
