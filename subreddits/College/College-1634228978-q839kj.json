  "text": "So ive just hit college. In high school women were childish and temporary. Im lowkey looking to settle down with one person. I have met a girl that i have been hanging out with for about a month now, we hang out pretty frequently and can have genuine conversation and doesnt get dry. We have been on a \u201cdate\u201d and we just chill sometimes. The vibes are always good when we\u2019re together and we text everyday.\n\nI like this girl but it seems she has a mature,  independent mindset. I think its obvious shes into me but i still overthink this fact. She doesnt text back fast but she is genuinely not on her phone. I compliment her but she doesnt seem to be as flirty. We joke around and life and talk about real shit and we hug each other goodbye. We also cuddle when we chill but its not as frequent that we get to. Usually we hang out around campus or smoke. She also juggles class and work.\n\nAm i reading this right? Is she into me? Is it okay to know that things are moving at this pace? I feel we are kind of at a point where we are just enjoying each others company and feeling things out.",
