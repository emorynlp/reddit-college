  "text": "So I want to major in illustration, I want to go to college, I like learning. Currently I live in the US and art colleges cost a ton of money here and I heard that they could possibly look into Canada colleges and I just don't know where to start. \n\nI don't want to look at the top 10 greatest art colleges because I feel like those are always the most expensive, I just need ideas on how or where to look for art colleges in Canada and how I can find out the tuition.",

      "text": "That depends. Where in Canada do you want to study? Education is handled at the provincial level here, so every province has different rules, structure and pricing for schools. Also, do you want to go to a college or university? Those are different things here as well with different application processes depending on what school you want to go to. \n\nI can only really give u info for my province (Ontario). Here are the links for uni/college research \n\nhttps://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/\nhttps://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/programs\n\nFair warning you'll be coming here as an international student so you'll be paying like 3x what I pay.",
