I highly reccomend watching this video about sleep and good study habits, it recently helped me put a few things in perspective: https://youtu.be/c0fp7kB2vuU\n\nI have some horrible ADHD, and have experienced many major depressive episodes in my life. My mental health can easily fall into the gutter if I allow it to. Circumstances exasperate these kinds of mental health issues, as do habitual thoughts. However, at least in my experience, probably 50% is physiological. Eat healthy foods. Get enough sleep and establish good sleep hygiene. See a mental health professional to see if medication would be a good option for you. Exercise and get some sunlight. You will be much more productive and happy.\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you stay up for two days straight. You are probably in this situation in the first place due to poor time management (been there, it happens, and sometimes you really can't help it). Your body will have to adjust, and you will lose even more time, and you will probably have to do it again pretty soon. It's not sustainable.\n\nGet some sleep, accept the loss, and just do the best you can. Email your professors about possible extensions, and explain your situation to them ahead of time. They might give you extra credit options, extra time, or even just a bit more patience and understanding.\n\nAlso I hate to be an armchair therapist, but look up ADHD symptoms and see if they apply to you at all (disorganization, forgetfulness, poor time-management, \"laziness\").
