      "text": "Unlike the people saying no, I\u2019ll add a bit more input. Yes, you can get a great paying job with just an associates, but it\u2019s not quite that simple. The only industries that give good results with just an associates are: IT/CS/pretty much anything tech related, healthcare, and the trades.\n\nAn associate of arts or business degree is literally useless. Usually these fields have to supplement the AAS/AS with certifications. They also won\u2019t pay huge amounts, but it will definitely be a worthy number(35-50k starting usually)",

If you're *really* lucky, you might be able to get an upper-middle class job, but that's extremely unlikely. Most associates degrees leave you in the lower-middle class pay scale, at best, though.",
