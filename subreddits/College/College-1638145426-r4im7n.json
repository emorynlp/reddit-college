  "text": "I literally apply to at least 20 jobs a week and I constantly get denial letters, even from jobs that only require a high school degree and I\u2019m not understanding why. I need to get out of my moms house Bevause we argue daily and I can\u2019t take it anymore. I just can\u2019t believe I can\u2019t even get a minimum wage job\n\nIs anyone in the same boat? I\u2019m starting to lose hope and it\u2019s sending me down a spiraling path. It\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s a few of my friends and my uncles kids have said that their friends have had the same dilemma. \n\nAny advice on what to do?",

If they do, they will typically offer a free service where they help you with your resume to make you more marketable. Also, I recommend using LinkedIn to connect with people I'm the field you plan on working in. I have a few friends that have majored in English and Art and they both found decent jobs out of college by following those steps. Good luck mate!",

Just a stretch but that may be the case?",
