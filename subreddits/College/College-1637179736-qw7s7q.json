  "title:": "Computer Parts Refunded as Education Expense on Taxes? (American)",
  "text": "A thought crossed my mind today and as I am an engineering student I often use 3D modeling and analysis software for homework and labs, and the IRS seems to define reimbursable education expenses as that which is necessary to your education like tuition, fees, but also books and equipment. Since this is obviously different per country: Americans, do you think I could get PC upgrades refunded when I file my taxes this upcoming year?",
