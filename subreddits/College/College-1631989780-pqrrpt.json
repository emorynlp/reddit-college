I'm a junior who did my first 2 years online. I am lucky to go to school in state and I'm only 45 minutes away from home. I've been coming home on the weekends and on Wednesdays because it works with my schedule. I've been having intense anxiety (I'm officially diagnosed and on meds) about going to college for the past year, and everything came to a head when I moved into my dorm (it's apartment style). \n\nI'm lucky enough to have my own room and share a suite with two other sweet roommates. We have our own kitchen and I share a bathroom and don't have to use the communal bathrooms in some of the other crappy dorms. I am trying to get my bearings, set up a routine, and manage everything but it's really hard. When I moved in, I was such an anxious mess that I didn't stay at school for a whole week. \n\nNow that classes have started, my therapist recommended I spend one or two nights at home during the week to aid the transition and slowly build up. This week, I'm gonna build up to three nights spent at school but I'm so scared and anxious about how I'll cope. Last time I cried so hard and had such a bad panic attack that my parents started crying because they didn't know how to help me. It's just that when I get going into an anxious spiral, I cannot stop no matter how I try or what tools I use. \n\nI'm really at a loss of what to do and I go back to school on Tuesday morning (I have no classes on Mondays), and the anxiety is really eating me up inside.", "author": "Bellarker100", "created": 1631989780, "retrieved": 1632801533, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdj5w2w": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqrrpt/what_can_i_do_about_anxiety_going_between_school/hdj5w2w/", "text": "I feel like we are in the same boat! I am a sophomore on campus for the first time, and I found the transition affected my mental health in ways I had never been challenged before. I go home every weekend and on Wednesdays as well. \n\nI think that you should do what is right for you. If staying home more often eases your anxiety, there is nothing wrong with that. Do what makes you happy, and what allows you to better focus on your studies.", "author": "SilentSwordfish392", "created": 1632097476, "upvotes": 1}}}
