I have ADHD so I have the hardest time sitting in one place and studying, and when I actually do I don\u2019t pick up information well. I also get super distracted really easily and it doesn\u2019t help that the apartment I live in is next to an elementary school so all o hear is kids screaming. I know I could go to the library to study but honestly I don\u2019t know campus at all, most of my classes are online so I don\u2019t have to go to campus and this is my first semester here (my old university is 1/4 the size of this one) and I find the campus to be really intimidating especially since I don\u2019t know anyone on campus. Does anyone have any tips or tricks that they use to help? Oh and my major is microbiology", "author": "Reasonable-Run-5536", "created": 1632904909, "retrieved": 1632945356, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
