  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\n I am a freshman at college in class of 2025. I just started this semester. \n\nEver since the semester began, I've been getting low test grades (multiple 60s in chem) and I just completely bombed a math midterm worth 8% of my final grade today. My class had a review but nearly none of the problems on the review was even closely related to what was on the midterm. \n\nI am a STEM person and in high school I took AP and honors classes and passed fine with As on exams. I don't know why the change in college is so difficult. When my professors change grades, they leave no comments so I don't even know what I got wrong. They offer office hours once a week and I don't think that sufficient. We have hybrid classes and I can't email them because they either will ignore me or not address the issue I am asking (has happened already). I turned in an assignment 23 minutes late and the same professor wouldn't accept it, although I emailed them beforehand saying there was a tech issue and even attached pictures. I am very worried for my grade because I wanted to maintain a 3.7+ but I just can't seem to improve. Looking at my situation now, I don't know if I can maintain the desired GPA. I want to attend grad school. It seems I'm also having trouble with time management skills. May someone please give me suggestions or advice such as using planners or whatnot because I'm really freaking out and feeling overwhelmed.",
