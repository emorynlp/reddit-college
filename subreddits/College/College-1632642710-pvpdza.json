The food they serve us is lesser than prison food. The gym is the size of my garage. We have basically no sports teams. The students are all anti social. \n\nHonestly, coming here has helped me change my mindset and realizing I need to step up and get out of here\u2026",

It's just that UCLA supposedly has the best food.\n\nAlso, my friend from UCM has said that people are anything but anti-social \\~ they heavily socialize in lieu of studying.\n\nBut, you can probably transfer out of your school if you really want to. It's not even that hard, from what I hear.",
