Is this a normal thing that happens at other colleges?", "text": "So first of all, I should probably say that people aren't complaining ALL THE TIME. People for the most part seem to be okay with how things are, and aren't actively trying to leave the place. But regardless, I do hear complaints about my college from a lot of people, from several different social groups.     \n\nI was kinda bummed by how many people were complaining, because I really liked my college when I first went there. The campus is pretty, the cafeteria and the food appealed to me, I liked the buildings, people were nice, and they had the programs I needed.     \n\nBut being here for a couple years now, I can start to see where people are going at with their complaints. The school, while pretty, is a bit small, and does not have a town where people can go to and hang out, so it does feel a bit claustrophobic at times. There are some notable professors who are notoriously strict, boring, or just flat out bad at teaching (most professors are good or even just okay, but its still noticeable). Many dorms are a bit old, and it shows. And the people in charge can make some pretty stupid decisions, which was shown to the T during quarantine.       \n\nI go to a mid-sized school in NJ, so I'm not sure if its just the area in general or what. I know the colleges in my area, besides maybe the Ivy league schools, are nothing spectacular compared to the south or even places like California.         \n\nBut what about you guys? Is it common for people to complain about things pertaining to the college frequently? Is it normal for people to like the college at first but then eventually start to see the not-so-good parts? If there is little to no complaining at your college, please say it so I know whether its widespread or not?", "author": "XxItsNowOrNever99xX", "created": 1611604911, "retrieved": 1632947648, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 901, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gkux4xc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/l4w4l7/there_is_a_concerning_amount_of_people_at_my/gkux4xc/", "text": "No matter how good college one gets, they are gonna complain anyway.

There are some people at my college who complain about every small detail to the level that I question why they went here or if they would be happy at any college. I complain some, but I still love my school.
