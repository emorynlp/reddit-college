My family is okay with me moving out of the house but what are the benefits with moving out during college with housemates? \n\nIs it worth the $700+ rent, while most of us college students are working paycheck to paycheck?", "author": "raknrakn", "created": 1586795049, "retrieved": 1632802613, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 780, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fo1sy5b": {"link": "/r/college/comments/g0m7v6/what_are_the_benefits_on_moving_out_of_your/fo1sy5b/", "text": "My family is not from Middle East, but it is an immigrant family with, uh, \"traditional\" values by American standards. We are typically expected to stay with parents until marriage, unless we have to move due to studying. If unmarried, upon graduation we typically move back in with parents. I have two degrees, and during the first I moved out while during the 2nd I lived with parents, so I can speak to both sides.\n\nOut of the house: main pro is not having your parents around 24/7, and I don't mean in the party-time way. I learned a lot about myself, my values, and independent life by living with roommates. I have no siblings, so this was my first time truly socializing with peers on everyday stuff. I learned how to cook for myself, how to budget, some basics of frugality, self-discipline in studying, and a lot about communication and negotiation. I messed up a lot, but my mom wasn't there to berate me. I caught bronchitis in the first year, and learned how go to the doctor, follow prescriptions, routines, and take care of myself while sick. All-in-all, I went in a 16 year old teen and came out an independent adult with 3.9 GPA. Not bad for being left alone with 1 phone call a week. \n\nmain con: constant money shortage and a hell on earth if you are introverted and you just want people to shut up, just for a little bit... \n\nIn-house: main pro is living/food comfort. If your family takes care of you and honors your study time, you couldn't ask for a better arrangement in terms of living expenses. Having a hot meal ready at the end of the day, a bathroom you don't have to share, no loud roommates, steady internet access, and a back-up ride if the bus doesn't pick you up really does wonders for academic achievement. I was a fairly good student in my first grad round; I was at the top of the crop in my second round due to having boatloads of time to spend on it: 4.0 GPA in second grad school completed in 2 years with a 50% job assignment in the second year. Time is a commodity that you don't realize you lack until it suddenly drops into your lap. I saved up some money from working part-time, and moved out at 26 with a reasonable emergency fund and ZERO college debt, which is a rare. \n\nmain con: no privacy, zero. My mother decided \"to make up\" for lost teen years and doubled down on my \"discipline\" in my early twenties for disrespectful acts, such as cutting the onions in the wrong way or not dropping my homework to wash the dishes for the 5th time in 2 hours. I wrote a draft for my final project while my mother sat on my table (yes, on top of it) and screamed at me on the top of her lungs because she had a bad day.

I ended up living with her until August of the following year, so about 8 months. There\u2019s pros and cons to having your own apartment while attending school\n\n1. Responsibility and learning how to budget when you are in college is vital. Especially after college when the average US rent cost is $1200 per month, not including utilities, WiFi or furnishings. \n\n2. Networking and friendships are easier to maintain, you have your social distance (no pun intended) with your college classmates and your family, but also have a place of gathering. \n\n3. You WILL NOT save money living off campus in my opinion. I could\u2019ve lived in a dorm for FREE with my scholarship, and took out 12K in loans for off campus housing and living expenses. Now I\u2019m paying $125 monthly for the next 10 years for those 3.5 years of luxury. \n\n4. If you feel like your family is altering your growth I say go for it. You may have money you owe in student loan debt, however you can also learn responsibility and independence. Many college students fall on their ass in first time apartments and fall apart which is normal. YOU SHOULD EXPECT FAILURE. Especially going into the workforce after college.

I would rather pay 700$ for rent and do everything myself, then live with my parents. \n\nThis is my reason, first of all, i don\u00b4t like being treated like a handicapped child. When you have arab parents, they will treat you as a handicapped child (speaking from experience) and make you one, as long as you live with them, you won\u00b4t progress mentally as you would living alone. my second reason, you get disciplined. You learn how to do stuff, the way you want to do it! This is honesty the most rewarding and satisfying part of living alone. You can plan your life exactly the way you want it to be. And the third reason is you think like a grown up, your mindset will change. I myself would say, get an apartment for your self, don't share with anyone, not even friends. That's the best way to live alone i would say, with your own bedroom, own kitchen and bathroom. \n\nSo i have lived alone for some time, by my self, and with a friend. all and all i would say having your own place is the best.

I\u2019ll tell you why I did, and why I\u2019m starting to regret it. \n\nDorm life:\n- The friends I made at the beginning of the year ended up making their own little friend groups, got boyfriends, etc. and I had maybe one friend to socialize with. \n- I was in a tough program, and my lack of friends meant I was studying all the time, which helped me academically but absolutely ruined my mental health. \n- I ended up being diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my therapist believed it was partially from my lack of socialization. \n- I\u2019m an introvert so moving into a strange place for a year to a university of 40,000+ was not my thing. \n\nPros of living at home:\n- I don\u2019t have to pay the $760 rent I was looking at for a 4x4 apartment\n- I have my dog and cat with me\n- I get home cooked meals\n- I get to save my money a lot more. \n- I don\u2019t have as much pressure on me (I lived in the Honors dorm and every day felt like an academic competition) \n- I have more freedom to be myself\n- I have my own bathroom!\n\nCons of living at home: \n- Parents can be overbearing\n- I didn\u2019t have to work at university because I had a scholarship; had to transfer schools so now I work anywhere from 15-25 hours a week, which has been a struggle for me to juggle academics with \n- I feel less independent and have felt myself getting lazier because I don\u2019t have to do everything myself. \n\nOverall I think it depends on you.

Here\u2019s why:\n\nAcademically: My mother tends to nurture a lot and my dad is a very \u201cgo go go\u201d person. Because of this, doing school work at my home is hard with my mom always checking on me and asking what I\u2019m doing or what I need or If I\u2019m okay. Along with that my dad is always asking for help doing stuff, home projects, things like that. Moving out allowed me to set my own routines and my own schedule and get into a groove to do things at a set time that I choose to make sure they get done! At home you\u2019re just at the mercy of your parents or maybe siblings!\n\nSocially: My parents were always super welcome as far people coming over and me coming and going! With that being said, I was always uncomfortable coming home late or people staying over late because I worried about waking my parents up accidentally or them worrying about when I was coming home, so moving out alleviated some of those concerns!\n\nHope this helps!", "author": "HomelessSecretary", "created": 1586796367, "upvotes": 682}, "fnaeoiv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/g0m7v6/what_are_the_benefits_on_moving_out_of_your/fnaeoiv/", "text": "you can bring a girl home", "author": "49_1", "created": 1586796183, "upvotes": 254}, "fnaehuf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/g0m7v6/what_are_the_benefits_on_moving_out_of_your/fnaehuf/", "text": "Depends on you and your mindset, my friend. Personally I moved out of the house because, although I love my parents, I can\u2019t really stand being at home and living on their terms. I crave financial and social independence. My mother is predisposed to narcissism, so living with her throughout high school where I was already miserable and stressing about my grades 24/7 was... not good for my mental health. After I moved out of the house I started to feel more like an autonomous individual with healthy boundaries whose perceptions of himself weren\u2019t dictated by his environment, as a direct result of not being among my family constantly or in the (in my opinion) toxic environment of my hometown. \n\nHowever, if none of these things sound applicable to you and you like living with your family and the support they provide you, then why move out and burden yourself with the rent, since that is a pretty hefty undertaking for any college student as you said. For me, $700 of rent is a damn good deal for my independence. But perhaps you could better spend that money elsewhere?
