My professors have always been super understanding when I shoot them an email about my situation. You don\u2019t have to be super specific with details if you don\u2019t want to; just let them know that you\u2019re struggling and might need some extra help (short extensions, for example). If you feel comfortable, a great option is also dropping by their office hours. Your profs are there to help you - they don\u2019t want you to fail. I\u2019m also registered with my uni\u2019s Student Disability Services which provides guaranteed accommodations that your professors must abide by, so check and see if your school has that as well!
