  "text": "So I am a junior in high school and recently got emailed by the school. I saw that they had programs for game design and a nice campus and got excited. But the reviews are TERRIBLE. Like that school ruined a part of their lives terribly type of reviews. They talk about racism, unprofessionalism, favoritism, scamming, and all kinds of awful stuff. Is there anybody who went to the school, is currently attending or knows anything about the school?Is the school really that bad? Thank you",

      "text": "for profit colleges are sketchy as hell. weak or no accreditation so it won't be taken seriously professionally, credits often won't be recognized by other schools if you want or need to transfer, etcetera. looking at full sail it seems like the accreditation they have doesn't necessarily carry weight in creative fields.\n\ngame design programs in particular are a red flag, it's not really an academically recognized discipline and more often than not those degrees won't translate into a viable career. from what i've heard over the years it actually looks bad on your resume because its associated with schools like Full Sail. a better degree would be something like software dev or if you are good with math computer science. (people who can work with low-level engine and graphics stuff like Vulkan=$$$$)\n\ngame dev is also a notoriously nasty field to work in and there's a lot of turnover, after a few years lots of people jump ship to other software industries. would you want a degree that boxes you into game development?\n\nthere's a lot of money to be made in just barely ticking the checkboxes to get FAFSA eligible & convincing young people and families to take loans from the government to go to your school. they buy email lists from like college board or other services that people looking for a uni would use and send out marketing communications to try and sell it on you.  i learned quickly to be skeptical of any uni or program that  reaches out to me for marketing.  whenever i do the research stuff like what you mention comes up.\n\nEDIT: It also seems like Full Sail is a very networking heavy school? They seem to have a serious alumni network, & going to a school like that I can say that can be 100% what you make of it. if you get the chance to talk to some professors and make a positive impression it's amazing the sort of connections you can make. that sort of university can have a really interesting culture IF you can plug into it.\n\nknowing the right people is a big boost professionally. if you go in person and are good at making connections and surrounding yourself with the \"right\" people (i.e ppl who dont just do their homework and call it a day) s then you could land the connection that makes everything I just said irrelevant. it's kinda a gamble though i think, there's schools that have both the security of accreditation and stuff & the good networking opportunities. definitely not a one size fits all university.",
