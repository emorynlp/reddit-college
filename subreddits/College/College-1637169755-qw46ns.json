  "text": "I am a 35-minute drive away from my college. I  have been enrolled my last two semesters in online classes. Part of me misses being in-person and having interactions be in-person with my professors and classmates. On the other side, I am/ have gotten very used to having my classes be online. Which do I pick? Online or In-Person classes? I know that there are pros and cons to both options. Anyone out there in a similar predicament?",

              "text": "real talk man, at the end of the day you gotta focus on your edu, and your career. Friends come later, you aren't doing college for your friends. I feel like so many young people these days are dependent off their friends for everything you know wheter that be eating outside, attending classes by yourself etc.\n\nYou just gotta act like an adult and do your things by yourself you know. Cause your getting a degree for yourself not your friends you gotta look at it long term right. You are doing this for yourself your friends ain't gonna do sh\\*t right. \n\nLemme tell you something, in my opinion there are wayy more pros to doing online school compared to in person. Convenience, flexibility and you get to WFH. Take advantage of it. Why go to a in person one like your gonna have to spend time on commute, etc. Waste of money and all that.",

Taking one class would be good to kinda of strike a balance and get reacquainted with in person classes and have more interactions that are in-person. \nI am torn though,still\u2026As an essential worker with 3-part time jobs my time management skills are better with a more consistent schedule - and online classes seem to meet that flexibility and time management checkbox for me. I like your idea though.\nThank you!",
