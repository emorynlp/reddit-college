  "text": "I'm currently a freshman at FIU, a decent school but I know I can do much better so I want to transfer to either UF or UCF. UCF is a great school, but UF is much better. The problem is that UF has much more prerequisites for mechanical engineering and it'll take me two years to actually transfer there while I can transfer to UCF next semester. I'm not enjoying my experience at FIU at all and I want to leave as soon as possible, but I don't know if going to UCF will make such a huge difference on job opportunities in the future compared to the opportunities I'll get at UF. It's all so stressful because I don't know if everyone telling me to just go where my heart wants to go is actually good advice",

      "text": "UCF vs UF really won\u2019t make a difference. It\u2019s about what you want to do. You can drop to CC and transfer to UF to get out of FIU, save money, and still go to your dream school. Or you can go to UCF right away if you don\u2019t want to go to cc. You may also hold UF in a higher personal regard so just choose the school *you* want to go to and then take whatever route gets you there.",
