I live on my own and work full time, I know I can go to school part time but on that note, I still see myself getting overwhelmed. I have about a year to prepare, but my mental health is at it's lowest. I would love any and all advice anyone has to offer. Its been a dream of mine to go to college, but I feel as though I'm psych-ing myself out. I don't know what to expect, what college is like, the schedules, workloads, etc. My high school was a very low income, inner city school so they didn't talk about college really at all and graduation wasn't even the norm. A majority of students flunked.

I started college, dropped out and I'm back after 7 years. \n\nIn that 7 years I've developed a really strong work ethic that is TERRIBLY evident during group projects. My peers are young kids who are too busy on facebook to get shit done. \n\nIf you're always on time to work, work hard and do well at work, you'll be fine in college. There's some differences but as long as you're diligent to study, you'll be fine.", "author": "Awkward_Mail_2786", "created": 1632507078, "upvotes": 2}}}
