  "text": "Seems like my roommate almost never leaves the dorm room except to get food or use the bathroom. He used to go to class but now does them online in our room. I\u2019m out for most of the day (even on weekends) but sometimes would just prefer to chill/decompress by myself. He\u2019s chill and a fine roommate, but I\u2019ve found myself intentionally leaving the room just because he\u2019s always in there. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any clubs but I invite him to hang with me and my friends so he can do something. \n\nI know he\u2019s entitled to be there whenever he wants but any thoughts?",

If you want to be alone, find a study room or something to go. Freshman year, both my roommate and I were introverted, so we both stayed in a lot. When I got exhausted of her, I would go to a study room or the honors building and just vibe by myself. She went home most weekends, so I got a much needed break then, but I'm an introvert, so I go tired of her even when she was there. Now I'm fortunate to have a single and can be as weird as I want in here, and nobody can bother me.",

My roommate is a lot like this too. I know that privacy is a lot harder to achieve with a roommate but it's not unrealistic to expect a few hours to yourself every week or so. I'm similar in that I'm out for most of the day so my roommate gets the room to himself a lot of the time but I think that has made him accustomed to basically living in a single the size of a double. He sometimes gives me weird looks or says passive aggressive things to me if I want to be a shut-in some days.\n\nI think for me, it just feels unfair that I feel like I am giving him so much privacy, but he gives me nothing in return. Even though it's just the nature of our lifestyles and not me actively giving him privacy out of the goodness of my heart, it still makes me a little frustrated.\n\nThat being said, I think this is a good opportunity, though, to explore campus and find a more secluded spot for you to decompress. If I am in a thoughtful mood, I walk through a nearby forest and sit on a log. If I want to take a nap, I move my mattress to an empty room in my building and chill for a bit.\n\nThese are some things that have helped me gain a better sense of privacy and it has helped me a lot with feeling less resentful towards my roommate. Not sure if it'll work for you, but best of luck!",

Is he a freshman? He could be having trouble adjusting, so he might be keeping himself away because he doesn\u2019t know where to really branch out. Also, you guys are complete strangers so it\u2019s a little awkward! He might get anxiety about hanging around your friends. I\u2019d say take it slow and have a 1 on 1 hang out session away from the dorm, then slowly invite friends so that he can make mutuals. Slowly build a friendship by inviting and encouraging activities 1v1, I think he just needs a friend right row.\n\nDon\u2019t sit him down and tell him you don\u2019t like him being in the dorm all the time, it\u2019s awkward and not right. Because if you confront him about this, it will just make things negatively uncomfortable, and he might start to think you don\u2019t like his presence in general.",

We're all at work/class at the same time and home at the same time. I'm the last to leave and usually the first to get back (not by much) so for them, it can feel like I was just there for 10 hours when in reality I had 3 classes, a club meeting, and a soccer game. If you're gone most of the day it's hard to assume that he wasn't too. But again, even if he wasn't, he doesn't have to.\n\nIt can get annoying having someone always in your bubble but that's what having roommates is like. If you want space you have to make it, or be willing to ask for it (but accepting that they have a right to say no). 24 hr study labs are mostly vacant and good anytime. Libraries are huge and have so many untouched areas, especially on quiet floors. I've found spaces where I don't see people ever. You could reserve a study room if you want an entire room for yourself. All this to say, if you want space to decompress, you can find it or make it.\n\n**But really, just ask for it.** You're lucky to have, as you described, a chill roommate. Start with asking just for a little time, say an hour or two so he doesn't feel like you're kicking him out. Offer the same to him, even if you think he's in there all day.",

He doesn't need to join clubs and make 100 friends, but just going on a walk, going out to get pizza or wander Target etc. will be good for him.

      "text": "my roommate currently is the exact same way. obviously first the behavior you described is possibly a sign of depression, so check in on them and offer to help them get access to school mental health resources if needed. \n\nbut apart from that, what my roommate and i agreed on was we each get one night a week, from 7-10 pm, that one of us has to stay out of the dorm so the other person gets a decent chunk of truly private time. we also agreed that although our days are \u201cset,\u201d depending on the week things can be adjusted for whatever reason. \n\nso far there haven\u2019t been issues, and normally whoever is out will just go to the library to work (i have club meetings on her day so it works out most of the time naturally for me). yes we both pay and both have a right to the room, but having these equally set hours gives us time to release emotions, decompress without needing headphones or no volume, and even have a time window we know to look forward to for a late nap. plus my roommate has even said having to leave the dorm has helped her get more acclimated to campus and finding social events that may be going on so she gets more of a fun college experience.\n\nedit: our dining halls serve till 8 so although 3 hours sounds like a lot between usually eating at the end of service and walking its down to having to spend only about two hours truly out of the dorm",
