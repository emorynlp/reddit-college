  "text": "Seems like my roommate almost never leaves the dorm room except to get food or use the bathroom. He used to go to class but now does them online in our room. I\u2019m out for most of the day (even on weekends) but sometimes would just prefer to chill/decompress by myself. He\u2019s chill and a fine roommate, but I\u2019ve found myself intentionally leaving the room just because he\u2019s always in there. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any clubs but I invite him to hang with me and my friends so he can do something. \n\nI know he\u2019s entitled to be there whenever he wants but any thoughts?",

If you want to be alone, find a study room or something to go. Freshman year, both my roommate and I were introverted, so we both stayed in a lot. When I got exhausted of her, I would go to a study room or the honors building and just vibe by myself. She went home most weekends, so I got a much needed break then, but I'm an introvert, so I go tired of her even when she was there. Now I'm fortunate to have a single and can be as weird as I want in here, and nobody can bother me.",

My roommate is a lot like this too. I know that privacy is a lot harder to achieve with a roommate but it's not unrealistic to expect a few hours to yourself every week or so. I'm similar in that I'm out for most of the day so my roommate gets the room to himself a lot of the time but I think that has made him accustomed to basically living in a single the size of a double. He sometimes gives me weird looks or says passive aggressive things to me if I want to be a shut-in some days.\n\nI think for me, it just feels unfair that I feel like I am giving him so much privacy, but he gives me nothing in return. Even though it's just the nature of our lifestyles and not me actively giving him privacy out of the goodness of my heart, it still makes me a little frustrated.\n\nThat being said, I think this is a good opportunity, though, to explore campus and find a more secluded spot for you to decompress. If I am in a thoughtful mood, I walk through a nearby forest and sit on a log. If I want to take a nap, I move my mattress to an empty room in my building and chill for a bit.\n\nThese are some things that have helped me gain a better sense of privacy and it has helped me a lot with feeling less resentful towards my roommate. Not sure if it'll work for you, but best of luck!",

Is he a freshman? He could be having trouble adjusting, so he might be keeping himself away because he doesn\u2019t know where to really branch out. Also, you guys are complete strangers so it\u2019s a little awkward! He might get anxiety about hanging around your friends. I\u2019d say take it slow and have a 1 on 1 hang out session away from the dorm, then slowly invite friends so that he can make mutuals. Slowly build a friendship by inviting and encouraging activities 1v1, I think he just needs a friend right row.\n\nDon\u2019t sit him down and tell him you don\u2019t like him being in the dorm all the time, it\u2019s awkward and not right. Because if you confront him about this, it will just make things negatively uncomfortable, and he might start to think you don\u2019t like his presence in general.",

We're all at work/class at the same time and home at the same time. I'm the last to leave and usually the first to get back (not by much) so for them, it can feel like I was just there for 10 hours when in reality I had 3 classes, a club meeting, and a soccer game. If you're gone most of the day it's hard to assume that he wasn't too. But again, even if he wasn't, he doesn't have to.\n\nIt can get annoying having someone always in your bubble but that's what having roommates is like. If you want space you have to make it, or be willing to ask for it (but accepting that they have a right to say no). 24 hr study labs are mostly vacant and good anytime. Libraries are huge and have so many untouched areas, especially on quiet floors. I've found spaces where I don't see people ever. You could reserve a study room if you want an entire room for yourself. All this to say, if you want space to decompress, you can find it or make it.\n\n**But really, just ask for it.** You're lucky to have, as you described, a chill roommate. Start with asking just for a little time, say an hour or two so he doesn't feel like you're kicking him out. Offer the same to him, even if you think he's in there all day.",

Not a lot of people have mentioned it, but he might be struggling with mental health. He doesn't need to join clubs and make 100 friends, but just going on a walk, going out to get pizza or wander Target etc. will be good for him. He'll probably start to self-regulate and go out *more* once he rips off the band-aid and realizes it's not so bad.",

      "text": "Nobody in the comments understands introversion\u2026 introverts NEED alone time, it\u2019s not just something you can get over and go without. Op\u2019s roommate has tons of alone time all day long, it would only be fair for op to get at least a little bit of alone time as well. \n\nYes, they are both entitled to be in the room, but they are also entitled to alone time sometimes. It\u2019s basic decency when sharing a space with someone. Op is nice enough to give the roommate alone time during the day and the roommate should do the same. It\u2019s not fair for op to always be the one having to leave the room if they are both introverts. \n\nI had a roommate who never left the room freshman year and it was awful as an introvert. She didn\u2019t have any mental health issues at all, she just had no interest in any clubs or social activities and didn\u2019t make many friends or have many events or activities to go to. My social battery was really drained all the time that year and my mental health suffered. When moving into a shared dorm room, obviously you don\u2019t expect to be alone for a large amount of time but you also don\u2019t expect to NEVER ever have ANY time alone. You expect your roommate to have a healthy amount of outside activities they do or people they see. And when they don\u2019t it\u2019s tough because it is really really hard to get no alone time at all. \n\nOp, you\u2019re entitled to ask for a little bit of alone time here. And at other times, what I always ended up doing was taking really long walks or finding spaces on campus I could be alone. A lot of the student club meeting spaces are empty during the day, and a lot of classroom buildings on my campus were empty at night but still open. After a while I found all the best spots where I could go and be alone for long periods of time.",

Finding a place to hide on campus is not the same as being in your own space with your own stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to have the conversation with your roommate and explain that it\u2019s important for you to have a little alone time in your own space, too. The roommate can obviously relate and if he/she is a decent person who isn\u2019t completely self-centered (I\u2019m willing to bet your roomie is nice and decent) it\u2019s likely they will be more than willing to work with you. Remember that your roommate ALSO entered into this situation with a basic understanding of the nature of sharing a space. Some give and take. As long as you approach it with honesty and kindness and with the intention of finding a win-win plan you have absolutely nothing to feel bad about. This is how grown ups handle shit, so start practicing now.",

I get out the room to study at the library, have 2 in person classes, go to the gym in the mornings,  have a job and try to hang with friends. So I\u2019m gone for a lot of the day.  Meanwhile  my room mate never leaves our room.   It\u2019s basically his room in my opinion.  He has no in person classes so he never leaves the room.   I leave for the gym come home and there he is.   I leave for a few hours come home and there he is.  Still in bed or on his pc.  \n\n\n\nI guess I just miss having my own room and getting adjusted to living with someone has been a little rough. It also sucks because the way our room layout is I can\u2019t even relax in bed while he\u2019s on his pc because our face will be directly facing each other.    It definitely sucks.

      "text": "not much you can do about it unfortunately, definitely fucking annoying though. I moved into a shared apartment with a woman who said she worked full time, did tons of activities, was out most of the time, and that was true for about the first two weeks until her seasonal job ended. after that she was on the couch all day every day playing Elder Scrollls in the shared space shouting into her headset, complaining to me how her employment insurance claim hadn't come through at the end of my 45-60 hour work week. she would only leave the house at the same times I was out, wanted to be on my exact schedule and use the bathroom at the same time I was getting ready for work or showering at the end of the day CONSTANTLY, always seemed to want to cook when I was in the kitchen despite having the house to herself 8-12 hours a day and full access to the facilities whenever she wanted. like we're grown ups, we need private time. if I was being the couch potato I'd be mortified and make efforts to simply GO SOMEWHERE.  \n\n\nI'd say your person is either just really unaware, or quite happy with your busy social schedule. maybe try to bring it up casually in conversation that alone time is important, especially in a shared room situation.",

      "text": "I disagree with some of the commenters that \"he's just as entitled to it as you are\". \n\nDid you fill out a roommate agreement at the beginning of the semester that might have addressed this topic? Can you talk to your RA about this for some more ~professional~ input? \n\nYes, it is his space, but if you want alone time and feel like you can never get any, he is impeding on your ability to enjoy the room that you are also paying for. There is nothing wrong with wanting personal space a few times a week. He gets the room all to himself half the time, it sounds like. Most people get that alone time throughout the week because their roommate does leave for class, studying, or clubs, but clearly that isn't the case in your situation. So this means you have to communicate your personal needs. You won't be being unreasonable to ask if he can try to find other spaces to study or attend virtual lectures a few times a week. He could even just hang in the common space of your apartment sometimes if he doesn't wanna leave the building. \n\nSeriously, talk to your RA if things go poorly if/when you communicate with him about wanting some time to yourself in the room. \n\nGood luck!",
