Because of this I was stuck between three choices: my local community college, depaul and Chicago state. Although I wanted to attend the community college my mother wouldn\u2019t allow it because it would interfere with a scholarship program she forced me to join my junior year. Convinced I would receive more money if I went to the school that covered less financially she chose my college for me, against my advice and wishes. She chose the state college because she expected I would receive a cash scholarship of 5k if not more, however it ended up being 1k split in half per semester. I was able to get a scholarship that covered tuition and fees(but not room and board) on my own. However, I honestly hate the school. Since I\u2019m commuter on a really small campus it\u2019s been extremely hard to make new friends. My professors are relatively ok for the most part but one thing I\u2019ve noticed both amongst my peers and professors is just how nosy and snobby everyone is. Everyone is competing against in each other in a game no one knows we\u2019re playing, they\u2019ll do anything for an ego boost no matter how trivial it is.\n\nIn addition to this my mother is being the doting, micromanaging mother I tried getting away from in the first place. She\u2019ll check on my work like I\u2019m in elementary school, not because she wants to help but instead to criticize me despite me having an A so far in all my classes. She even grounded me my first week of class, bye bye social interactions. My freshman college experience feels ruined and while I\u2019m doing well academically, mentally and socially I feel stunted. Any advice on how I can survive this year?", "author": "hdjbdjdjnsns", "created": 1632242191, "retrieved": 1632800986, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdrqpx3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psmh34/how_do_i_survive_a_year_at_a_college_i_hate/hdrqpx3/", "text": "You are having some college problems, and a huge amount of parent problems.
