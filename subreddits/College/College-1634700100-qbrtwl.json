  "text": "When I was in HS, I thought college was this haven where people would have groups of friends, and I'd find my flock.\n\nI've been in a college town for 2 whole years, this is my final year. I've joined one club, got a 'bad vibe' from it, and stopped attending after one semester. Then I practically lost an entire year and a half to COVID. Now I'm just begging for this shit to end.\n\nI've tried reaching out to people, to my counselor, to help me somewhat, and it just won't work with my schedules.\n\nAnd what irritates me is that most people don't understand what it's like to be an ND person attending college, just having the advice \"tAlK tO sOmEbODy\" by going to a party and going up to some random person, as if that's going to help anything. \n\nI'm really just fed up.",

Let\u2019s say theres an esports club at your college. join and talk to everyone and grab their discord. then play some games with the ones you fucked with the most.\n\nif esports isnt your thing, try a volunteer club, a sports club, whatever. doesn\u2019t even need to be something you do. maybe youve had a mild interest/ thought ab weightlifting in the past. join the weightlifting club and join them when they lift.\n\nthe way to make friends is to see them consistently and make efforts to hangout. talking to strangers and making friends out of thin air is, in my experience, a waste of effort and time. its just not as efficient. which is why im so grateful clubs exist, since it gives everyone at the function a common interest or goal. attend all club meetings and such. dont give up! you got this. you will make friends.",

Or to make the assumption they have something like ADHD based on traits they personally observe and not a diagnosis. The obvious downside to this is getting advice that may not be correct or suitable.\n\nI had assumed you had a diagnosis because the majority of people would if they said what you said. This is just what that other person was probably thinking.",

It's one thing if there's medicine for it that clearly fixes some sort of problem. \n\nThere's a very clear and abundant 'trend' with playing the victim with these things. Ya know like \"I don't go to class because my depression\" or \"My ADHD keeps me from paying attention and I'm failing\". The biggest take away here is that those two statements put the responsibility on someone else because the person saying it is a victim to those things. \n\nIs being Neurodivergent the exact thing that is stopping you from meeting people? \n\nMy point being, that I'm pretty confident that I could walk up to you and make friends with you. I don't even know you. I know I could be your friend. I can be friends with anybody. I wouldn't even know you were neurodivergent.\n\nMy mom went through 2 brain surgeries, struggles to form words at all yet STILL manages to be friendly to people. It's incredible. It's interesting to see these things that people will rely on as why they can't do something. My mom cannot form sentences. She cannot pull words for what she wants to say (Broca area brain damage). Yet, I shit you not, she says hello to everybody. She's friendly. I'm 100% confident that my mother, who would take 3-5 minutes to say that she wants lemon in her water, would be absolutely fine on her own in a city she'd never been too. She's got a HUGE disability. My mother cannot communicate like the rest of us. It doesn't affect her at all. \n\nThis is the part that nobody ever likes to hear. Those diagnosis can become a crutch. It's easy to blame poor performance or bad grades on ADHD, PTSD, depression and anxiety.  It's easy to blame those for why you can't do something. My mom could have given up on ever being friendly again because not being able to talk means that you can't be friendly. It's not the case. ADHD doesn't make you miss class. You make you miss class. Brain cancer didn't make my mom unfriendly simply because she didn't allow it.\n\nYou can make friends. I promise. It's not easy and takes skills that you may not have. That doesn't mean you can't do it. \n\nMy trick to making friends on campus is for one, I'm 14 years older than most of them and I simply have no reason to give a shit about anything. If the conversation goes awkward, I laugh. If it doesn't go anywhere, that's cool. I talk about a slew of weird shit and people join in. \n\nI don't know. These things are tough. It's not going to be a transition that takes a day. Even though you're neurodivergent, you're still a normal human being. Normal human beings can be neurodivergent, just like you.",
