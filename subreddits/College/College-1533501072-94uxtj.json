Maybe I have more drive and more will but I'm not smarter than most people, I just fought like hell to get an education because it was my out and I took it, I didn't give up when shits got rough, I threw myself into work and clenched my teeth, and I have absolutely no regrets.", "author": "Matrozi", "created": 1533587791, "upvotes": 3}, "e3p58q7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/94uxtj/just_do_it/e3p58q7/", "text": "A lot easier when it's not yourself stopping you.", "author": "pursuitmoon", "created": 1533559519, "upvotes": 5}, "e3otn5d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/94uxtj/just_do_it/e3otn5d/", "text": "Not everyone can be a lucky gifted Chad like you, you're just setting people up for disappointment", "author": "Frostav", "created": 1533538216, "upvotes": -11}, "e3or9qz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/94uxtj/just_do_it/e3or9qz/", "text": "You are fucking awesome!", "author": null, "created": 1533534202, "upvotes": 2}, "e3opf0g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/94uxtj/just_do_it/e3opf0g/", "text": "I got full financial aid to cover the expenses.
