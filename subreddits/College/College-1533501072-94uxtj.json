  "text": "When I was starting my freshman year, I came directly from a homeless shelter. My advisor at the shelter told me college was a pipe dream and to get realistic because I wasn't college material. My first semester I had a 3.8 GPA. I graduated with department and national honors. My point is don't even let naysayers tell you you can't do anything. Prove them all wrong.",

      "text": "My mother is an alcoholic and my family is poor, everyone dies of liver failure on my mom side and on my dad side everyone is crazy, no one makes it to college, on both side because everyone starts to fuck up their life before entering their 20's. \n\nMy dad got sent to a mental hospital for major depression when I was 15 and did back and forth between home and the hospital for almost 2 years.\n\nOn my first year of college my mom attempted suicide.\n\nAnd yet, I made it.\n\nI graduated high school with high honors, went to college and miserably failed my first year but got back up and went back to it, I worked the summers to pay for school, worked the year as a private teacher for kids in order to get a bit of money.\n\nAnd then 3 years later, I graduated with high honors from a bachelor degree in biology special in neuroscience and got accepted in ALL my master degrees application, all of them, and I will move accross the country in september.\n\nI proved every fucking statistics wrong and I fucking kicked asses and I will do it all over again. Maybe I have more drive and more will but I'm not smarter than most people, I just fought like hell to get an education because it was my out and I took it, I didn't give up when shits got rough, I threw myself into work and clenched my teeth, and I have absolutely no regrets.",

While unfortunate, it's not terribly surprising that a shelter advisor would say something like that considering for many college is a significant time/financial burden even with a decent footing let alone in/on the border of/just recently out of homelessness. \n\nAll the more impressive to OP. If I have learned one thing in life, pushing beyond what everybody thinks you are capable of and/or pushing forward out of spite makes one of the greatest motivators out there. ",
