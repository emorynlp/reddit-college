      "text": "Textbooks are not mean to be read like a regular book. Usually, but not always, the first two sentences of each paragraph tells you the information you need. If you don't understand the first two sentences, then read the next sentence. If you still don't understand what it, then read the whole paragraph. I  read the first two sentence, then skim the rest of the paragraph to find the relevant information and highlight them. Then I would go back and read the highlight text.",
