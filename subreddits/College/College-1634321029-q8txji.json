  "text": "I have the worst inattentive ADHD known to man. Because I am not hyperactive I got diagnosed kinda late, and can't afford medication. I'm a freshman in college and my ADD has been affecting more than before. In high school, I had my parents and school guide me through completing school work and studying for tests and now I am at a complete loss. I am UNABLE to study in my dorm because I get distracted very easily as I have access to my switch, guitar, etc. At library I feel overstimulated... the lights are too bright, I feel like everyone is staring at me and the chairs are uncomfortable etc. I  really have need help in finding ways to stay concentrated on school work. Else I end up writing essays on my intrests",

      "text": "Hey, I kept fighting this battle for over 4 year sometime i win sometime i don't. Anyway, i would suggest some things that worked form me over the period i experimented. First, libraries are worst place in the world ( everyone is making a noise and anyone but me seem to not be even slightly bothered by this) therefore i stopped going to the library and started the hunt for empty classes. This i was able to have an empty class on my own where i can adjust the settings as i prefer. However make sure that the class doesn't have a weird sound ( like just get in and listen, is the air conditioner blowing to hard or is there any weird sound) if not u got the spot. I also used to put a paper on the door with spot reserved for study or something like this. Next, coffee. May sound completely weird but i hope u know ADHD is a deficit of neurostimulation and u brain is constantly trying to stimulate if by looking around for new shit. Therefore coffee bring u that in a form of warm/cold tasty drink. Next, assign a place for specific tasks. Don't eat at u desk because i have noticed i get carried out. However when i have designated spots my brain fills like it has that switch ( u know when u spend to much time u have the urge to get up and change something) so that may help but u mention u are not very hyperactive so u may not have that problem.  Also, since our brains is constantly searching for change give it what It needs and by that i mean change in between the assignments. It may sound stupid but you are basically fighting yourself and for that i also tried to catch myself on doing the wrong thing and by that i mean watching YouTube or basically procrastinating. It almost looks like a game to be honest but once i catch myself i ask why am I doing and i push myself to get out of that thing. My biggest advice would be try to experiment this is not one size fits all and something different may work for u. I have tried a lot of things and ended up with a couple that work for me. Good luck! P.S by experimenting i mean plan an \"experiment\" on yourself and stick to that routine for about two-three weeks. To get any results u need a bit of time so if u are gonna change you routine every two days u may end up feeling like nothing works.",
