  "text": "I desperately want to go to college. My parents make a ton of money (around 100k each)  so I don\u2019t qualify for any sort of FAFSA assistance (they gave me $300 last semester.) I can\u2019t get private loans because my credit sucks. I want so badly to be a doctor, I have for years, but even the classes at community college are around 2k each. I only make 1800/mo and my parents are not willing to help me. It feels completely unattainable, I could work 80 hours a week and still not be able to afford the tuition. I can\u2019t even get an associates degree. I feel like I have literally no hope for my future. Is there anything I can do? Or do I just need to make peace with it?",

This is not done  by telling your financial aid advisor your parents won't pay... unfortunately it is difficult to be young (under24) and financially independent",

Nobody said you have to graduate when you\u2019re 22. \n\n2) Become financially independent from your parents. The easiest way to do this is to file your own taxes as an independent adult or get married. \n\n3) Obtain private scholarships. This depends a lot on demographic, field, grades, connections, etc. \n\n4) Try and get a university scholarship for a talent. This requires you to be a star athlete, musician, etc. but if you are talented in those fields it is doable. \n\n5) Attend an out-of-state school with cheaper tuition. For example, this is why a lot of Californians attend the University of Utah. \n\n6) Move to a cheaper school state, work until you get residency, and then take the in-state rate. This works well if you are willing to relocate and take a gap year. \n\n7) Look into getting a higher paid job or side hustle. For example, a lot of students who are good at selling pay for their tuition from summer sales of solar, pest control, etc. \n\n8) Work for a company with tuition reimbursement. Hard to find sometimes, but this can be pretty sweet.",

      "text": "That cost sounds super high. I\u2019d look at every college in the state of Colorado and find one with the cheapest tuition. There\u2019s got to be one that\u2019s cheaper than what your quote is. Once you\u2019ve found the cheapest college, apply for every single scholarship you qualify for, whether school, state, or private. And of course, work and save as much as humanly possible. It might take you longer than you\u2019d like because you might not be able to afford to be a full time student, but don\u2019t despair. There should be cheaper options out there. Also look into taking CLEPs for some gen Ed courses, they\u2019re a lot cheaper than paying for a full course and they\u2019re graded by pass fail. Only problem is not all colleges accept them.",

      "text": "Join the military. That's honestly what I did (not because my parents wouldn't contribute, but it works the same). I had an amazing time, became completely self-sufficient, learned valuable and employable skills that I can use to support myself while I'm in school now that I'm no longer in, my tuition is paid for, and they actually pay me to go. I have also always dreamed of being a doctor and, even older than you by quite a bit, am still going for it in a much better financial position. Plus, you will have a ton of life experiences to bring to the admissions boards that are looked at so favorably now.",

I\u2019m in my early twenties and probably have some grey hairs but I will graduate with less than $10k in debt. It\u2019s hard, but not impossible.",
