  "text": "I have been wanting to go back to school for years. However every time I have to take in-person classes I freak out and don't want to go. I'm fine with online classes but classes like lab and clinicals obviously have to be taken in person. It's through a community college not university so they are the sizes of a typical high school class. I'm just worried that I'm going to get bullied or something. I absolutely hated high school and still hate and traumatized by those \"people.\" I hate to admit it but I hope karma bites their asses and they are living miserable lives.",

      "text": "College is really different from high school in the sense that you won't typically know your classmates, and there will be different people in each course, so you won't be interacting with the same cohort over and over again. \n\nYou can make friends with people in your classes, but you don't have to engage socially if you don't want to. You'll interact with some classmates if there's a group work or lab work to be completed with a partner, but most people treat group mates like coworkers, and aren't going to ask about your personal life or interests. Bullying generally isn't a thing to worry about.",
