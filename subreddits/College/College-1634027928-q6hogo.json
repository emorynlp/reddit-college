  "text": "This is referring to a physics exam.\n \nI got about 5% total of my grade taken off for questions that I got correct, but used a different method than what I guess was the most efficient way of solving the problem. \n \nI wasn't really worried about how I got the answer during the test (1hr time limit), so I just used the first method that came to mind. Sure, upon further inspection, I could've cut down on work needed to find the answer, but my methods and solutions were correct regardless. Is this a valid reason to take points off of an exam?",

Also possible that the method you used is not always accurate and you got lucky on the answer, but didn't demonstrate that you could choose the more consistently accurate solution process.",
