I wish so badly that I tried harder academically in highschool, or at least applied to the schools I wanted to go to (didn't because grades were really bad). I know I can have a good experience at my current college but I still hate it so much. It wasn't even top 5 on the list of colleges I wanted to go to. I only went here because I had no other choice. I emailed the colleges I wanted to go to, to see if it's possible for me to drop out and reapply as a freshman for next year. Anyone else dealing with/ has dealt with this type of regret that can give some advice?", "author": "lemontino", "created": 1632021680, "retrieved": 1632801493, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hdibh89": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr0cgl/regret_highschool_and_college_admissions/hdibh89/", "text": "To add to the previous comment, it would be useful to improve your academic skills while you study at your current college until you can transfer to the college you want to attend. \n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)\n\nI also have a College Freshman Starter Kit.

It\u2019s probably gonna be something that you\u2019ll regret later in life tho if you don\u2019t transfer to the school you want.
