  "text": "hi reddit \u2014 i hope this is the right place to go!\n\ni really want to adopt a cat. i struggle with an anxiety disorder, had cats growing up, and so i think it would help me a lot. my landlord has given me the go-ahead, i have a lease for two years, my roommates are ok with it. i\u2019ve got a vet picked out, i\u2019m thinking of adopting an adult cat.\n\nmy parents? not so ok with it. i go to school really far away from home, so if i\u2019m in a pickle it might be really hard. i dont ever want to give up a cat, but if i have to i know not to abandon it. \n\ni\u2019m afraid my parents are right and it\u2019ll be too much of a financial burden (i have a part time job but it\u2019s minimum wage lmao)\u2026 plus, i don\u2019t know how ill be spending my summer and i\u2019m worried about leaving my cat behind! my friend promised he could cat sit if i don\u2019t have any other options, but i\u2019m simply worried it\u2019ll be cruel to my cat.\n\ndo you have any advice about adopting a cat in college? is this too irresponsible? it would make me so happy but i never want to put a cat in a bad situation just because of my desires.",

      "text": "My advice is to wait a little longer. Try to budget out money for the cat. If you can\u2019t set aside money for the cat now, how will you realistically set aside money for the cat when you actually have it? Also, consider whether you\u2019re interested in study abroad and whether you vacation or travel often. It would be stressful for the cat and the caretaker to take care of a cat that isn\u2019t theirs for months at a time while you travel.\n\nSo if you successfully are able to set aside money for your cat\u2019s food and hygiene, then you can use those savings for their *future* vet bills. And you\u2019ll have more time to figure out what\u2019s happening for your summer too",

These cats maybe a little more hostile, given the new environment, but the cats need a safe place to recover from their surgeries all the same. Occasionally you will also get a litter of kittens that also need caring for, so you end up getting these kittens ready for adoption.",
