Also some companies require you to apply directly on their website.\n\nKeep in mind, anytime you upload a resume it IS going through an applicant tracking system.\n\nYou need to customize ever resume for every job post, focusing on the skills/keywords mentioned in the job post you are responding to.\n\nSincerely, \n\nA resume writer",

It is also used to sort candidates into good fit/bad fit categories and disqualify candidates who lack experience,  education, or skills required for the job. Which is why you HAVE to use relevant keywords.",

I am not claiming that recruiters in all industries feel this way.\n\nHeres the thing thats annoying for you to hear: for every piece of advice you hear, you will likely hear that advice contradicted by someone else.\n\nIf it were me, I would use indeed/linkedin for searching for positions, then find the companies' websites and find their job application portal and submit there.\n\nIf there isnt an application portal then Id go back to the job-searching site.",

I say this because on LinkedIn, the application is linked to your profile that has your connections, your photo, and a full background if you fill it out completely. You can take skill tests on LinkedIn and people can leave reviews about your skills. And you can have back and forth conversations with recruiters/HR people where Indeed it's less personal.",
