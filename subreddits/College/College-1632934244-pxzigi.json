Pretty picky, don\u2019t eat from the dining hall, and cook my own food. I was having a similar problem but found some solutions.\n\nSince I\u2019m doing most of my cooking, I reserve it for the weekend. I don\u2019t try to attempt to cook during the week too much because I either have no time or am super busy. You must find time be it the weekend or weekday! \n\nI meal prep **everything**. This is not just for meals, but also ingredients. All the vegetables and fruits in my fridge have been precut by me because I know I will need them at some point. \n\nMake a list of really easy meals and categorize them by how much time they take to make. \n\nMy classes have a no eating policy as well. I started packing snacks in my bag that are easy to eat in between classes and that I can also walk with. Fruits, bread with Nutella, cheese, roasted veggies, granola bars, etc. it will hold you over.\n\nHope that helps!", "author": "queen-cheeks", "created": 1632941989, "upvotes": 1}, "her8jd8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxzigi/have_almost_no_time_to_eat_in_college/her8jd8/", "text": "Your campus may have a nutritionist who can help you come up with a plan.
