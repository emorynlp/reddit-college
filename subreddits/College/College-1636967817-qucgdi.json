  "text": "When looking into the requirements of a master\u2019s degree, work experience is one of the common factors universities look into.\n\nMy questions are the following: \n\n1.) Is 2-3 years of work experience mentioned on most university websites the recommended amount of experience or is it better to work for at least 5 years?\n\n2.) I\u2019m researching universities abroad (Canada and New Zealand) since I want better opportunities and wages. Does the work experience they mention have to be in their country or can I work in my country and still have it accept it.\n\n3.) I\u2019m in my last year of my bachelor\u2019s double degree (Financial Economics and Financial Management) and I want your key insights if getting MBA or Msc in Finance is more essential.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this type of question, I don\u2019t use reddit much :)",
