I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case at your school, but I know some schools do that. \n\nTwo: lots of people are struggling. This situation is tough. The schools know this. If you want to wait a semester, wait a semester (or a year) before going. Spend that time working and saving. \n\nThree: College is not like high school. It\u2019s taught differently, structured differently, and there are different expectations. It\u2019s also mentally different - high school is a \u201cgiven\u201d for many people. College is not, and if you are on scholarship, you\u2019re gonna be more motivated to work harder. \n\nGive yourself a hug. It\u2019s gonna be okay.",

I\u2019d say get a planner - you\u2019ll know soon enough if it doesn\u2019t help you. What I often do is take my syllabi at the beginning of the semester and write out each class on each date I have it, in order (this is on a weekly planner, not monthly). Each class gets its own color. Then I use the syllabi and write in all due dates/important dates for classes (homework due dates, exams, quizzes, papers, projects). Sometimes I also include the lecture topic, if it seems useful (if the prof gives you an outline of this). \n\n\nLike so: \n\nMonday 8/31\nGerman: hw #3 due, accusative case \nLinguistics: nothing due\nPhilosophy: quiz #2 (topic of quiz) \n\n\nTuesday 9/1: \nChemistry: nothing due \nOrchestra: movement 1 of Tchaikovsky 6 \n\nWednesday 9/2\nGerman: nothing due \nLinguistics: reading about Germanic languages due \nPhilosophy: nothing due \n\nThursday 9/3: \nChemistry: Quiz #1, Chapters 1-4\nOrchestra: movement 2 of Tchaikovsky 6\nChem Lab: Titration Lab\n            Acid-Base Lab Due \n\nFriday 9/4: \n\nGerman: hw #4 due, dative case\nLinguistics: reading about Romance languages due \nPhilosophy: reading about medical ethics due \n\nSaturday 9/5: \n\nSunday 9/6: \nChemistry HW #4 due 11:59pm \n\nAnd so on. \n\nThen, after class, I\u2019ll add anything new I found out (like if an assignment was added or we get a formula sheet for an exam). \n\nI also usually write out my schedule for the whole semester on the week before the semester starts with room numbers and buildings and that kind of info. \n\n(P.S.: this advice might or might not work for you based on your major and stuff. Also, this is a completely made-up schedule, so don\u2019t freak out if it looks like a ton of stuff.) \n\nAlso, remember that everyone around you is probably as confused and feeling as unprepared as you are, so it\u2019s okay, and you don\u2019t have to struggle alone. \n\nAnother thought: when COVID happened, I switched to printing out an 8.5 by 11 monthly calendar with all this information and hung it on my wall near my desk, because that\u2019s where I\u2019d be found everything anyway.",

Take it from me: That is not the end and it doesn't even close many doors. My school put me on probation and required that I meet with an academic advisor weekly (who I adore and still meet with just because I can) and get my grades up. I never came in danger of losing my scholarship, even though it was merit-based, and any time I applied to anything I explained that my GPA was low because of a bad first semester. I never had it held against me, so long as I took the time to explain and prove that I'd improved. Nowadays, I tell everyone to meet with academic advising (or whatever it's called at your school). It's open to anybody, and they love people who show up preemptively. If you're really worried, maybe set up a regular meeting with an advisor or make a plan to go to regular office hours.\n\nAlso, I just want to say, this was during a regular year. Next year the schools will be especially understanding to the new students who struggle with all the changes. Best of luck to you, and don't forget there are people at your college who are waiting to be asked to help, from professors to advisors to RAs.",

Don't get me wrong, I think it's ridiculous that colleges are charging full tuition for classes that are probably going to go online later this year but I doubt they'll lower tuition for the next semester even if it's entirely online. Just something to think about, the decision to defer a semester is not an easy decision to make and there's no shame in whatever you choose to do.",

Being on campus gives you access to their resources (libraries, studios and other facilities, actually speaking with teachers), and a college education simply isn\u2019t the same without them. Online learning is often too sub-par to truly get anything out of it. If education is your number one priority, I think it\u2019s valid to consider deferment right now.\n\nI\u2019m deferring and I think it\u2019s my best option. If you take advantage of your time, there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with skipping a semester or two.",

My parents wanted me to go to school closer to home, my parents wanted me to let them pay for everything and stay under their control, but if you want it bad enough, you will work hard to make your own way. I love my family and I'm so grateful for their help, but Independence and being self-sufficient is important to me.",

You or your mom can take all the money from the account. Sometimes this happens to people right before a divorce, like one person will drain the account and run away. That\u2019s the risk with joint accounts. You should be careful about that. \n\nI would recommend opening a new checking account as well, for the money you\u2019ll make with your job. If you can\u2019t go to a physical bank, then do an online bank like Ally or Capital One. You can have your employers direct deposit into your account, or if they give you a physical pay check, you can still deposit those in online accounts. You just can\u2019t deposit cash, which is inconvenient, but I know with capital one you get interest on your saving and checking account both and there\u2019s no fees. So it has its pros and cons.",
