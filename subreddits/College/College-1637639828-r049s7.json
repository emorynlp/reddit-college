  "text": "Honestly, I wasn't the smartest student in high-school nor the one who slacked off majorly. My GPA is quite horrendous, 2.8. So I am looking advice to enlist college this January, I would prefer online but I wouldn't mind. I am looking forward to be an accountant then pursue cpa, which if am not correct, accounting takes 4 years then cpa about 1-2. Where should I go from now on? Would a 2.8 GPA even worth giving a shot at? Or community College then get my associate and hopefully   import it to a university and get my bachelor's. What should I do? Any tips would be appreciated. \nLocation: NYC",

You can graduate from state schools for relatively cheap nowadays, a lot of state schools offer free or low income tuition to low income students, UConn, University of Texas, University of Minnesota, University of California are some that come to mind. Not to mention that there are a lot of scholarship opportunities that are not academic based.\n\nState schools > Private schools",

Seriously, these sources of aid are as selective as the ivy leagues themselves. Relatively cheap is rich... literally. My 4 year education has almost doubled my household's annual income; and I'm not even 6 figures deep unlike others.\n\nAnyways, State school, Private school, they're both the same shit. One just gets a bad rep because its associated with degree mills like Harvard, or Brown. Anyways, Ive got like 15 minutes before the mods delete this, so until then I guess.",

I'm sure plenty of people take advantage of these schoolerships, but it really fits a niche population. Like, what family making less than 50k doesnt have their child working for an extra source of income? That child having a job and then required to be full time a university and then required to maintain \"satisfactory academic progress\" is legitmentally what I ranted about 2 comments ago.\n\nSystems bullshit, if you have money you get the opportunity to pursue a career that will in turn make similar amounts of money.",
