  "text": "Final is just around the corner, i took 5 subjects this semester. Im decently prepare for all subjects except one. This subject requires A LOT of memorization and i really have no idea how can i get an A for this subject. Really wanted the A so i can maintain to be eligible for the full scholarship award.\n\nBasically the final exam for this subject contains 100 MCQ with 5 short essay questions, not too bad huh? Yea but the problem lies within the study materials. The textbook is 750 pages thick, 15 Chapters, with average 10 sub-topic within each chapter. That makes a total 150 topics i need to study and MEMORIZE. And each of the 5 short essay questions are choose from those 150 topics!!!!\n\nNow I have 2 choices, focus on several topics and pray to god im lucky OR memorize all the topics. I know memorization is not the key because you need to understand them which i do. But its just so hard to remember the \"point\" while you are staring at the question paper.\n\nOpen book exam would be great for this but make sure to prohibit students from copypasting. What do you guys think?",
