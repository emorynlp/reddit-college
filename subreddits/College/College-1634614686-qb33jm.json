  "text": "I am a veteran utilizing the GI Bill. For the past semesters I attended classes assuming my tuition was paid for... turns out my school was posting loans to my creditor, all the while issuing out \"refunds\"...\n\nMan... I assumed those refunds were accounting for tuition and thought, DAMN! free money... turns out... the school was posting loans to my creditor... I legitimately had to plinko may way through 4 damn representatives to get this resolved.... the past semesters... I just have to eat them... this semester has been resolved....\n\nWhat the fuck kind of school is this?!?!? WHY call it a damn refund??!?! I now have loans.... I struggled my way through the military for no reason...\n\nIts a good thing there is a hold on student loans.... I was about to pay interest.... The fuck?!?\n\nBe careful out there veterans.",
