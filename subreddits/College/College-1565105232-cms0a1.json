I was a med student at Cambridge when I came across this [Dunlosky 2013 review paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173288) about **effective study techniques** \\+ **active recall**, and honestly, it completely changed the way I study.\n\n(TL;DR: actively recalling facts with closed book spider diagrams/practice tests/self-explanation >>>> re-reading, highlighting, summarizing).\n\nI legit used to spend *hours* re-reading content and making open-book mindmaps (which worked in high school when the workload was much less). My efficiency hugely increased when I started actively trying to make connections, making closed book spider diagrams, etc etc. and it helped me be much more work-life balanced tbh.\n\nYou need to make use of **evidence-based study** techniques. The Dunlosky paper ranks 10 commonly used learning strategies from the least to the most effective ones according to cognitive sciences (i've listed the top 5 below).\n\n* To get the most out of your studying you need to use the most effective techniques when you're studying or making your resources/use education tools that are built using these principles.\n* Platforms I found useful included [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) basically, like Quizlet but interleaves practice using spaced repetition (super handy for learning long lists of drugs for pharma).\n* For **high school**, a platform like [Seneca](https://app.senecalearning.com/courses/add?type=Free&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=usa&utm_content=reddit-dunlosky) might be useful as it uses spacing/interleaving in its algorithms to retest you on topics you have struggled with previously.\n\nDunlosky's five most effective strategies (in increasing order) are:\n\n**5) Self-explanation**\n\n* Connect new content to stuff you already know. (e.g. how does what you learn about enzymes in biology relate to reaction rates in chemistry?)\n* Relating novel content to prior knowledge creates new connections and facilitates the development of schemes.\n\n**4) Elaborative interrogation**\n\n* This strategy involves asking and answering 'why' and 'how' questions. (e.g. why are enzymes similar to chemical catalysts? How do they both increase the rates of reactions?)\n* This requires thinking about a subject in more depth and detail, which strengthens connections in the brain.\n\n**3) Interleaved practice**\n\n* Interleaved practice means mixing up the order of questions across different topics. This is particularly effective for Maths and Sciences.\n* Usually, students learn strategy A, solve a series of problems that demand strategy A, then do the same with strategy B.\n* Interleaving would be to learn strategies A and B, and solve problems that can demand one or the other.\n* This way, pupils need to find out the right strategy from the problem itself, leading to a deeper understanding and better preparation for exams.\n* Basically, let's say you're going over triangles. in math. Rather than studying Pythagoras' theorem and then doing Pythagoras' theorem questions and then studying trigonometry and then doing trig questions, you should study both Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry and then do a mixture of triangle questions based on both.\n\n**2) Distributed practice**\n\n* Distributed practice is basically like the opposite of cramming.\n* Research consistently shows that studying small chunks of content spread out over time is more effective than studying long blocks of the same topic only once. (tbh i still cram a bit for exams, but starting earlier>>later).\n* Try and make a study schedule as early as poss in the year and stick to it. Regularly review content.\n* Also working in small chunks is generally more effective than studying for hours at a time (a good technique is the Pomodoro technique, where you work for like 50 mins, rest for 10 mins, then repeat!).\n\n**1) Practice testing**\n\n* The most effective strategy according to Dunlosky is practice testing. It consists of studying and reviewing by answering questions and actively bringing information back to mind. We love active recall!!\n* When this is done, information is reconsolidated, new connections are created, and memory and understanding are strengthened.\n* Basically start doing practice questions as early as possible. Like if you cover photosynthesis in AP bio, go on the college board's website and find all the free-response questions you can on photosynthesis do them and mark them yourself.\n\nI hope this helps!! :-) If you can set up these study habits now, honestly the rest of your education (and working life) will be so much easier and efficient. I will say using active recall techniques etc feels scarier at first (at least it did for me) as I was worried I was forgetting something/felt dumb when I couldn't remember something etc - but once you get into the swing of things, knowledge picks up quicker and sticks around for longer.

By studying alone you will ATLEAST understand what you DON'T know. Then, you can ask your friends. They will probably know some things you don't, and vice-versa;\n* Idk how it works in the US, but in the EU, the final grade is usually decided by calculating the mean between the grades of 2 exams within a subject (say you have a 10 and a 9, final grade would be 9.5). So try to get better grades in the first exams, when the semester is fairly fresh, because things are gonna pile up towars the end of the semester;\n* Understand the meaning of MVP (Minimum Valuable Product), this works both for group projects and studying for exams. If there's not enough time left, focus on what's more important;\n* Do NOT skip classes like crazy. Sure you're gonna do it, if you're tired, or if you have to catch up on other subject. But teachers often tend to tell students (besides teaching what they're supposed to) what might appear in the exam;\n* There's time for everything. I know people that graduated from the \"hardest\" universities and had a decent social life, played sports and had good grades.

Even if you understand the material, make it a point to visit your professors during office hours at least a few times leading up to a test. Don\u2019t wait until the day before the test to bombard them with material that was covered weeks ago. If you don\u2019t understand something, try to go by their office soon.

Just don't forget.\n\n* Know how to actually take notes; in order for you to understand the course content better. Question the lecture materials; try to explain what is being said by both the lecture materials and the lecture itself in a way you can understand it.\n\n* 1st week of college semester; every subject, note down the dates of your assessment due dates & *times*... (the latter a lot of people I see forget, what might be a 11:59pm submission close time in reality is a 10:00pm submission before the upload crush, which might fail due to large amounts of students submitting at the same time).\n\n* For assessment research... my approach has been to do 2/3rds first (and compile a list of sources; maybe with a little abstract to explain what each source is about / saying) and then start writing, and then finish it with the last 3rd of research to consolidate your argument. YMMV.\n\n* **read the assessment criteria**. Again, and again, and again. You don't want to end up failing because you missed a small but important point on a 3,500 word essay or report. \n\n* Don't stress yourself. If your stuck on a topic or concept, ask for help.
