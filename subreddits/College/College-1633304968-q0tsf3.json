  "text": "I don\u2019t feel like the college I\u2019m going to gives me enough opportunities to grow as a person. The school is great and I\u2019m doing amazing in my classes but, I don\u2019t feel as if I can grow here, plus I am a state away from my actual home where all my friends are, and I tried countless times to get involved and tried to at least explore the area I\u2019m in the best I can but it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything here for me. My main concern is my parents, as they\u2019re so specific on everything so, does there have to be a specific reason to transfer?",
