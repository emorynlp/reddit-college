  "text": "Hey y\u2019all I\u2019m looking to transfer from my current university and also change my major to something that is more business related. I live in the Chicagoland area and want to go to a different university that offers online courses mainly because I can\u2019t make a commitment to show up to classes because of my current living situation with my family. I was wondering if anyone can give me suggestions of any universities or online universities that offer their courses that are online and don\u2019t require you to use online proctoring services or lockdown browsers. The reason for this is because I\u2019ve had a few shaky situations in the past where I got called out for acting suspicious as I was being watched from a webcam and also struggling for not having the appropriate software. I\u2019m almost done with my degree but need almost a years worth of credits to finish up. If anyone has any ideas or experiences they can share it would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "One thing to look at is how many credits are required from that college specifically to graduate. In my experience, I\u2019ve found most institutions require you to take a minimum of two years worth of credits before you can graduate, even if you have 120 credit hours of required courses.",
