      "text": "I do active recall with fill in the blanks that I print out. I personally think this is better than flash cards with straight definitions. If you do flash cards do them with fill ins. (E.g A contraction in which the muscle changes length:________. These could be __________ if the muscle shortens, or _________ if the muscle lengthens.) This is way better than just writing the words isotonic, concentric, and eccentric with their definition behind the card on a quizlet.",

What I'll do is write down each bullet point on each slide and organize them by sections of the chapter. I do this before every section of the chapter. Then, I'll add any extra information from the textbook that may be important to know. It helps me get a grasp of equations and any other information I may not fully understand. Much better than skimming through it.\n\nI will have to see how to do this with non-textbook readings in other classes, but I think I could make it work.",
