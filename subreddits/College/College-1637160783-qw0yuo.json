  "text": "So I\u2019m retaking this class after I dropped it early on last semester. I had too many other classes so it seemed better to just wait until this year when I had less stuff on my plate. I had also planned on taking it at another school over the summer as the professors here suggested(they know this class is ridiculously difficult), but they didn\u2019t offer it for some reason. So now I\u2019m just taking it at my school. \n\nWell anyhow, I did really horrible on the first 2 tests- 1 lab, 1 lecture. Failed both despite studying my ass off. I took my third and did much better-82%. I think the amount of material he requires us to know is just insane, but the third test was much better imo. I just took another one and I don\u2019t think I did well enough to at least end up with a C in the class. I have one more lab test and then the final. This professor isn\u2019t the type to go out of his way to help people, so I\u2019m contacting my advisor to see what my options are. Like I\u2019m assuming they aren\u2019t going to fail me out of school for this one class??? I\u2019m supposed to graduate December 11th. Im just so disappointed in myself cause I thought I could pull through. I\u2019ve literally done my best, but apparently that\u2019s not good enough.",
