  "text": "Okay, so I am in my first year of university and my problem is about a team assignment we are doing.\n\nSo we have a group report to do blah blah blah, it was alright in the beginning, everyone somewhat contributed but that was really just putting ideas together. The assignment is due today and although I have messaged everyone in the group, nobody has made any effort to help out in writing the introduction and conclusion (both 350-500 words). I decided to just write the intro and asked the group if they could write 1-2 sentences summing up their part of the report and we could compile it together. They have not done this. Two of the girls in the group have completely ghosted and havent responded to any messages. I understand that in undersity you will be put in groups like this but here is my issue:\n\n\\- We have a team feedback task BUT it is all on one page. We all have individual colours so when we score our team members on how they did they can see who rated them. Like I said, I'm in my first year. I will be spending 2 more years with these people and don't want any bad blood but I feel it is necessary to let someone know that they haven't actually contributed?\n\nWhat do I do?",
