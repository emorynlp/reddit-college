  "text": "So it just occurred to me after a month of basically giving someone answers, that it's academic dishonesty. How should I go about cutting this stuff off? Luckily the class is virtual so I don't have to see the dude in person. Should I just suddenly cut him off of my Snapchat (how we have been communicating)? Should I tell him about this all? Anything is appreciated.",
