You have to meet specific criteria to file your FAFSA independently. Be 23 or older, be married, active duty military, be a ward of the state, both parents being deceased since you were 13. There are instances when students can't provide parents tax info so schools might provide something called a dependency override.",

I just know my circumstances. and that when filling out the FAFSA online it wouldn't allow me to file as an independent student. My EFC wouldn't have been too high as I had planned out my return to college and the amount I was making solo was not high enough to cover independent living costs plus tuition (I was making just around $32k gross pay as a single person). I remember arguing with FAFSA on the phone that I shouldn't have to provide my mothers tax information because I knew she made a decent amount of money and I hadn't lived under her care or dependency for 10 years at that point in time... and I tried asking the university for help and well... that went no where as well lol.  It could be any number of things that were done wrong, even on my part! I was a first generation college goer and at the age I was entering I didn't have the support needed to understand or navigate it...and I navigated a lot on my own but there were gaps that current me now realizes were there in the process and my knowledge and understanding :)   So my situation may have been an oddball exception or a situation that shouldn't have happened and I just didn't know how to say what needed to be said correctly. At the end of the day I just gave up trying to argue - paid the first semester myself, then earned an academic scholarship and didn't worry about it afterwards (although the remainder of the time I was there I had to file similarly when I did my FAFSA yearly which is why this stands out to me as a memory...an annoying one :( )",

If it's any consolation, I was completely clueless of the process too. Not anymore though!\n\nCongrats on the scholarship! I got one, too. The financial aid office told me I wasn't eligible even though I knew I was, wouldn't even give me the application form. I found it online, printed it myself, turned it in, and got to say \"I TOLD YOU SO!\" when it was approved. But then it jacked up my financial aid so that I owed the college money somehow?! I had to go in and have it straightened out, and they tried to shrug me off like it was my fault. Finally they called in some supervisor guy who fixed it and congratulated me rather sincerely.\n\nDealing with college financial aid is a huge pain in the ass.",

You can only be considered independent in the eyes of FAFSA if one of the following is true:\n\n* 24 or older\n* Married\n* Working on a graduate degree\n* Have children or other dependents\n* Served in the military\n* Lived in foster care or is an orphan\n* Is an Emancipated minor or had non-parent guardians\n* \"Unaccompanied youth at risk of being homeless\" as determined by your high school, director of homeless youth center, or director of emergency shelter\n\nI think even if you pay your own taxes and not a dependent according to the IRS, you can still be considered a dependent according to FAFSA.\n\nAgain, IRS separated parents is different than FAFSA parent status:\n\nFrom fastweb:\n\nA student's parents do not need to have a legal separation or divorce decree to be considered separated on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). An informal separation can count as a separation for federal student aid purposes. In an informal separation, one parent has left the household indefinitely. Living on separate floors of the same house is not sufficient. The parents cannot cohabit in an informal separation. Temporary absences for work, education or military service also do not count. IRS rules are different, so it is possible for a couple with an informal separation to file federal income tax returns as married and the FAFSA as separated. (Parents who are divorced or who have a legal separation cannot file federal income tax returns as married. However, if the divorce or legal separation occurred after the end of the tax year but before filing the FAFSA, it is possible for there to be a joint return in the prior tax year.) \n\nIf the parents are separated, only the parent with whom the student lived the most during the 12 months ending on the FAFSA application date is responsible for completing the FAFSA. The other parent's income and assets are not reported on the FAFSA. The other parent is also not counted in household size.",

If your parents make over a certain amount you just don't qualify for grants (like the pell grant) which is money you don't have to pay back. What will happen is after you fill out the fafsa online you will usually get an email showing you what kind of aid you get. If your dad makes too much it will say you are not eligible for the Pell Grant but you will have the option to take out loans. I think the standard is $10,000 or something like that. Subsidized loans don't accrue interest while in school and unsubsidized loans accrue interest while in school. You will get aid though. Whether you want to take out loans is up to you, but don't hold yourself back just because of that if you are choosing a good major.",

      "text": "A degree from an online college is still a degree. \n\nI'm currently at Penn State, and I took a year off of classes because they were through Zoom. And I moved to Penn State World Campus. Which is completely asynchronous. This meaning, I can log on whenever I wanted to and read through the lesson and do the work. I could do a whole week's worth of class work in a day if I wanted to. This, to me, was much better than going through Zoom again. If I stayed on Penn State World until I graduated, the degree wouldn't say Penn State World, it would just be a normal degree.\n\nTaking classes through the World campus or an asynchronous campus was hell of a lot cheaper than in-person or Zoom classes. But if your employer is offering to pay for some or all of your tuition, take advantage of it. Or look into getting financial aid.",

The classes are designed so literally everyone passes, the professors are terrible, and if you look into the reviews you see the truth. There were people who got associates degree\u2019s through the programs and applied to 4 years and literally *none* of their credits transferred, people who got their bachelors and masters couldn\u2019t find jobs, and people who just had 0 idea what they were doing once they graduated because the education was so poor.\n\nIf it\u2019s a school like ASU, Penn State, U of Florida, then yeah those are more legitimate because they\u2019re from respected universities.",

      "text": "I'm looking at the colleges they are willing to pay for. Among those colleges are University of Arizona, Purdue, University of Denver, and Southern New Hampshire University. (Possibly University of Florida?) All of these are accredited programs that will allow you to get a college education for free. And University of Arizona, University of Florida, and Purdue are really good schools! If you already work at Walmart I see no reason you shouldn't pursue this option. There may even be an option for you to do a few years online and see if you can get aid or afford to transfer in to an on ground program.\n\nFor some background, I'm a lurking grad school administrator, not an undergrad, for an on ground university. We commonly see students enrolling into our programs who have attended undergrad fully online. At this point truly the only thing you'd be missing out on is that \"on-campus experience\" which is just another manifestation of classism. \n\nIs there a limit on which degree programs they will pay for? I suspect there is but when trying to look it up it's vague to people who aren't employees. \n\nAs others have said, it doesn't hurt to apply for the FAFSA, so you can know all of your options. Personally, I've taken every kind of class you can imagine- Bougie on-ground classes at fancy colleges, on-ground community college, online community college, online private college, and I'm about to cross online public college off the list this spring. Some classes will be easier, some will be harder no matter where you go. Get your degree with the least debt possible in the way that will make things work for you the best.",

      "text": "Since I saw a lot of comments about the ins and outs of FAFSA money, I'm just posting this for whoever might find it useful so sorry if it isn't helpful to you, OP.\n\nA zero EFC (Estimated Family Contribution) is how you get the max Pell of about six grand. After that, your Pell grant goes down as income goes up. You get the automatic zero EFC if:\n\nDependent students: parents' annual income is less than or equal to $27,000\n\nIndependent students: you and your spouse's income is less than or equal to $26,000 AND you have dependents other than your spouse (aka kids)\n\nYour family has to be very, very poor for you to get the max Pell grant. Either you have to be a dependent student with very poor parents or an independent student with children. The Pell grant is made to help the poorest people escape poverty.\n\nEveryone qualifies for the same amount of Stafford loans, though. Stafford loans are pretty much how they expect most people to pay for their degrees. If you don't want debt, you need to go to community college and then transfer to a four-year with state grants and private scholarships lined up to cover it. A job with tuition assistance/reimbursement helps.\n\nCommunity colleges in my area are partially funded by lottery money, which covers half of tuition for students who don't qualify for other state grants and aid, like academic scholarships earned in high school. Ask if there's any state-funded grants to help you.\n\nIf you live in the state where you graduated high school, you may qualify for a state scholarship based on your academic performance in high school. There are also a ton of scholarships that you can find online for literally every subject, and most just require an essay and/or resume. Appy for a few dozen that are a good fit for you and see what you can get.\n\nETA - If you can relocate, about twenty states offer free community college. Most states require you to change your license over and wait 6-12 months to establish in-state residency for college purposes. Tennessee does not make you wait (unless they've changed things in the last few years). You are a resident as soon as you have a TN license, and you are eligible for free tuition at two-year colleges.",

      "text": "do not do what the comments suggesting community college say you should do. once you make this decision, you are throwing away your chances at the majority of scholarship funding that your school will provide. in most cases, the most scholarship money you will get excluding fafsa is about $7,000 annually. if you are not banking on scholarships then go for it, otherwise you would be schooled at how much your school will pay you. \n\ni had a higher gpa (graduated magma cum laude) and my parents are also in that bracket where they make too much for a lot of fafsa money but they could not pay for college, especially because my mom doesn\u2019t work due to disability. fafsa estimated my family could contribute about $19k/year which isn\u2019t even close to what they can do. \n\nwhen you apply to schools use the common app and look at in state schools. tuition is reduced for most in state schools and when you fill out forms on the common app, it will ask if you want to be considered for need based scholarships and merit based scholarships. i felt average, had a few b\u2019s and c\u2019s but mainly a\u2019s, and i\u2019m currently going to a private university that most people pay $60-70k a year to attend. the school gave me $45k in scholarships and private loans. if i did not dorm here, i would be going for free. additionally, things like state standardized testing (in massachusetts it\u2019s \u201cMCAS\u201d) will give you small scholarships of about $1,000/year if you do well throughout high school. lastly, reach out to banks for co-signers and loans that are relatively low in interest and try to fill in as many scholarships as you can. \n\none more thing\u2014 if you are extremely smart and have a lot of extra curriculars and think you have a shot for ivy league schools, many of them offer comprehensive financial aid (especially harvard and yale) so if this is something you think you could do then definitely put work into the application. \n\ngood luck! please don\u2019t screw yourself over by limiting how much money you can receive in scholarships.",
