  "text": "It\u2019s a lab practical and I had a law test yesterday night that I spent a lot of time studying for but my mind blanked out the minute I sat down. Now I have a lab practical in an hour and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna blank out too. We only have 3 minutes at each station. Then tomorrow, I have a biochem exam. These are all midterms. \n\nHas anyone ever failed a massive midterm and made a comeback or should I just take the L? \n\nFml. I\u2019m exhausted.",

      "text": "Well, I took the L when I took my sophomore year midterms. \n\nIt was so bad that I switched majors and despite having good grades until the end I failed to get a 3.5 GPA. My advice to you would be to ask yourself if this is something you will be able to recover from. I knew that I could not so I moved on. If you fail this midterm then it will be time for you to make very hard decisions. If you pass then you'll have more option but should also rethink if you're on the right track.",
