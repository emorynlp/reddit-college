In fact, my biological anthropology class had to give a 20 minute disclaimer on the separation between science and religion. Shit\u2019s crazy, dog.",

In my first year biology class, I knew some people that dropped the class because it conflicted with their religious views. It\u2019s really weird that people straight up deny fossil evidence. I think you\u2019re right, it is a vocal minority. I just have to deal with it more often than someone living in say New York has to.",
