  "text": "Hello, I am very close to being half way done with my AA. (Yay) \n\nHowever, for some time I have wanted to Double-Major. Preferably in Biology/Film (with the goal of eventually getting in med school after BA) \n\nI was more or less wondering am I put my mind? Is it realistic/unrealistic? Also, anyone who has happened to double major any advice? What to expect, etc? \n\nThank you. x",

If you are committed to medical school that is generally pretty consuming during College and many students fine that splitting their attention to another major may make it time prohibitive to do all needed classwork in addition to the outside activies that make a student a good cantidate for medical school.\n\nNot trying to talk you out of it in any way, its just someting to consider.  - edit for dumb spelling issues",

It seems as though they all wanna know what are your aspirations outside of helping people/studying medicine. For me that \u201cextra\u201d aspiration has always been Film. However, I completely appreciate your advice! If I am unable to double major can always add Film as a minor potentially? But again thank you..",

              "text": "Hey no worries. Again, if you can or not depends on the school you are attending. Some the minor in things like film and arts are open, in others they may be capped or closed. Are you already had the institution that you plan to be graduating in, or are you transfering? \n\nAnother thing to consider, if film is your passion, why medicine? How do they go together? Do you have thoughts as to if you can meld them in some ways? For example I had a student who loved film, biology and diving. Their end goal was to essentially help biology researchers figure out how to use film in research. Had another student who loved medicine and art. Their final goal was to do medical textbook illustrations.",

To me becoming a Doctor is a astonishing accomplishment that I could only hope to achieve. I wanna push myself to the edge & achieve something great. (To me that is medicine) Also a lot of members in my family have worked in the medical field. (My brother/mother still do) So medicine has always been a prominent part of my life & as I decided to go to college realized it\u2019s what I wanna achieve above all else. I wanna help people get better. \n\nFilm for me was just another outlet that I wanted to pursue to help people. (Obviously in a diff sense) \n\nVery passionate about both & would be immensely satisfied achieving either or for sure. However, medicine is undoubtedly the more aspiring goal for me.",

So I decided not to, but I was going to double major in art (graphic design) and biology. My major choices are different so it could be because of that, but I had taken classes towards both majors when completing my Associates degree so it was kind of disappointing. I decided not to double major but definitely talk to the advisors for both majors because that helped me make my final decision in the end. Good luck!",

That way you only take classes that really interest you instead of having to meet all of the requirements that a second major would bring. You'll still learn useful information and you wouldn't use the words on the piece of paper anyway. Just my opinion.",
