  "text": "Hello, I am very close to being half way done with my AA. (Yay) \n\nHowever, for some time I have wanted to Double-Major. Preferably in Biology/Film (with the goal of eventually getting in med school after BA) \n\nI was more or less wondering am I put my mind? Is it realistic/unrealistic? Also, anyone who has happened to double major any advice? What to expect, etc? \n\nThank you. x",
