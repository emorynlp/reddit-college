  "text": "Last night I was taking my Spanish final with respondus lockdown browser + webcam. I have a hp chrome book that uses Linnux. Respondus has worked on the chrome book multiple times in the past. Mid exam it says there\u2019s no connection. I went downstairs and the wifi is working great for everyone else in the house. I came back to my computer and still nothing. I googled what to do, and it said to power all the way off then turn back on. I did so, and the test came back on perfectly. But it wasn\u2019t recording my monitor or my face. I figured something must\u2019ve gone wrong, but I had already lost 20 minutes of a timed test and I wasn\u2019t going to stop and try to get it to record. I got to the end of the test and it wouldn\u2019t let me submit the test. I tried like ten times and it just didn\u2019t do anything. I exited out, then double checked on my college website and it said I had submitted the test already. I emailed my prof and she never responded ( of course \ud83d\ude44 ). Can anyone help me figure out if it submitted by answers when I powered off my computer or if it maybe did submit the test when I exited out of the website? I really want to know if I\u2019m going to fail my final or not lol",
