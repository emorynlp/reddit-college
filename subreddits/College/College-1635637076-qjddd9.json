  "text": "My mom has had a medical emergency and I have a lot of work that\u2019s due this up coming week and I honestly have no idea if/when I\u2019ll have time to do it. How do I go about emailing my profs? Do I just let them know so they are aware I may not be able to hand things in on time? Do I send them each their own email or just add them all in the same one? One project is already overdue but I haven\u2019t had to a chance to email yet until now. Should I email that prof separately from the rest???",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation a while back. I wrote up a template email and sent it to each professor individually. For example;\n\n\"Hello prof X, \n\nTemplate email\n\n-Thank you, (your/OP name)\"\n\nRemember, we, professors included, are all human.  \nAs long as you're respectful and (this worked for me) offer/ask about how to make up for missed work they will be accommodating (as far as I've experienced)",

      "text": "you make a plan and request what you need. send individually, plan individually.\n\n\"hello professor X,\n\nmy mom had medical emergency and she is in hospital/whatever. Can I get  X day extension on Y assignment(s) to be due on \"month/day\"?\n\nThank you,\n\nname\"\n\nDo not ask to be excused from doing an assignment entirely, and remember that they must approve of extensions; you do not automatically get everything handed to you (like in high school where the teacher/principal just tells you that you get an extension without you having to ask). Also don't make your email super long, because if you needed an extension, then you wouldn't have time to write rambling emails that waste your and their time.",
