      "text": "I've never met someone who said that. Someone who fails the same intro class for their major multiple times has probably picked the wrong one, so keep in mind there are different levels of \"struggling.\" I struggle with classes, too, sometimes, but I can usually pull a high grade in the end, so that's obviously a different \"type\" of struggling.\n\nMany people quit tough majors because they think that if they struggle they aren't \"cut out\" for it. I have no idea where this mentality comes from, but I don't think it's a good attitude to have.",
