      "text": "Im a physics major and as of now i have a 3.79. I typically work 12 hours a day on homework and studying and typically dont have days off. I dont have much of a social life outside of my girlfriend or friends in my class. I genuinely enjoy what i am doing and do not envy missing out on the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. Id rather have a job i enjoy later and enjoy what I do every day rather than have fun now. \nI am a bit out of the norm admittedly, there are balances you can make but ultimately everything is a sacrifice. I tend to have much, much more free time in the beginning of the semester.",

Your question is super general and hard to answer but I would love to provide more specific advice. I am still able to live that college life thank you to some great study skills and time management habits. HMU if you have more specific questions :)",
