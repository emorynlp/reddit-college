  "text": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen a kid like this before at the college level. Just straight up not prepared but always around? Met him a few years back, he was in 4 of my classes. He was always surprised when an exam hit, he sat next to me one day and asked if there was an exam on account of everyone having a Scantron in front of them. I told him yes, there\u2019s an exam. He literally got up and left. Didn\u2019t take the exam. Next exam rolls around, he seems to know what\u2019s going on because he brings a Scantron. Only a Scantron though. No pencil, not even his backpack or anything. I luckily give him one. \n\nHe started complaining to me a few weeks later that he was failing and the professor was out to get him. I saw him around off and on through the years. I hope he got it together. ",

While I was at mug night, I ran into some classmates from my 8am the next morning. They said \"Hey! You ready for the test tomorrow??\"\n\n\"...What test?\"\n\n\"Our midterm!\"\n\nI was already obliterated and fully intended on skipping the next day. I was in a fuck-it attitude so I stayed out to bar close anyway. Drunk-me is really irresponsible. Anyway, by some miracle I naturally  woke up right before class started and remembered the entire conversation, hauled ass to class and started the test late. I'm lucky the prof allowed me to.\n\nThe class was super easy so I passed the test, albeit with a lower grade because I didn't study. But it was also an important one so I would have been boned if I missed the test altogether.",

I was always allowed to retake it and always got As (often mechanically reduced to Bs, because the profs knew I was full of shit but they didn't want to argue about it).  \n\nCollege is entirely what you make of it.

Then she started referencing what they had covered in lab leading up to the test. Lab? I hadn\u2019t signed up for any lab. And that\u2019s how I dropped my first class in my college career because I had no idea there was a one credit lab course that was affiliated with this class. Why not roll that in and make it mandatory? Ended up running into others in this class that did the same thing. A couple didn\u2019t know about the lab also while others did and dropped the class too. So much for \u201crocks for jocks.\u201d This course absolutely schooled me. \n\nI will note that my parents did not go to college and I was always someone that never asked for help from anyone.

Afaik he didn't make it to the exam.\n\nSecond story, same uni.\nWe had this mathematics analysis course with a very.... not mean, but very demanding professor. He was this old grumpy man that a lot of people disliked but i actually liked him because he had a very funny sense of humour and he just looked tired all the time. Like, I feel you, professor.\nEither way, one day we were writing our final exam from his course. It was the day that everyone feared and loathed because we knew how difficult the exam would be. So everyone shows up late and is super stressed out throughout the exam. Then suddenly in the middle of it (about an hour in) the door opens and the same guy from the previous story arrives.\nHe is visibly confused but asks if he can write the exam. As you can guess, professor got pretty angry. Told him to leave right now and not bother him with stupid questions. \nPoor dude got made fun of for being late to the scariest professor's exam for the rest of the year. Which he also failed.",

I think to myself: \"no big deal, so I miss a few questions, not the end of the world.\" Nope. The entire fucking exam is based off of that single reading assignment. All fill in the blank. I didn't know a single goddamn answer. I sat there in silence, feeling my soul just...drain away. An hour later, I turn in a blank paper with my name on it. I never returned to the class. Dropped it a week later. It still haunts me.",

      "text": "I have a couple stupid stories about exams and college.\n\nFor starters: I have always been a great test taker. In my highschool AP courses I developed this shitty habit of binge studying the night before a test and passing off of that, and it worked out well because I test well. However, this shitty habit persisted into college.\n\nFor my freshman year it worked alright. Classes were mostly review, and I did enough homework to pass with good grades. Sophomore year I took O-chem. This is where things started to go wrong.\n\nMy O-chem professor introduced a new grading option. Your grade on the final exam, which reflects what you've learned in the class, would be your final grade in the class, if it was higher than your current grade. It was extremely generous, and me, being the little shit I was, immediately stopped going to class.\n\n In the 36 hours preceding the final, I studied 30 hours straight and then slept for 6 hours before heading out to take the test. It was my first time going to the class in at least 2 months.\n\nI passed with a C by 1%. I did not learn my lesson.\n\nLater, I would take BioChem. This Professor allowed the exact same thing. It must've been a chemistry thing. Anyways, I did not attend a single class after the second day, until the final. I also passed, but barely.\n\nSome of my co-workers, who are still in classes, have mentioned that the Biochem professor has since amended the policy, adding in a new stipulation that for the final to replace your overall grade, you must meet certain attendance requirements.\n\nFinally, TWICE I missed a final due to having gotten the date wrong. Both times I noticed immediately AFTER the exam, as friends texted me asking how I'd done. For the first time, I was allowed to take the exam at a different time, but my professor straight up thought I was an idiot.\n\nThe second time, my professor started out angry. They thought that because I had a high enough grade to pass without taking the final, I had blown it off. After I explained my circumstances, she understood and said that while I could not take the final, I had options to raise my grade.\n\nDon't be me. Be a better student. I didn't get good grades with my method, but hey, I graduated. If I had gotten it together sooner I could've aced my classes though. Bad habits weren't punished very harshly so I didn't stop taking advantage and scooting by on the bare minimum.",

Turns out I missed an email rescheduling one of the tests and I just flat out missed an exam.\n\nI also had a Hebrew class that was 4 times a week, and I would skip at least 2 of those days, sometimes more. I remember on test days we got 8 pages of ancient Hebrew to parse and translate, and I would just stare at the page in frustration because I literally had no clue what it was saying.

I tried reading on each of the pages but I remember I felt way too tired to read or to even give a bit of attention to it. I didn't even write my name on it. I just got up, handed it back to my teacher and left. I don't remember what was going on at that moment but there's a good friend who saw me pull all of this and it's always laughing at how badass I looked. \n\nBtw, I never failed a class but barely passed high school.

Saturday rolls around\u2014I go to my car to find the assignment topic. OH SHIT! I can't find it!!! After searching my car top to bottom, I give up. I was averaging an A until that point so I figured even if I get a 0 on that paper I could still pass the class. \n\nThat Monday comes around and I go to class with no term paper, ready to accept my fate. The hallway was packed with people, faces you hadn't seen in weeks. Except, everyone was reading their textbooks. Weird. \n\nI sit down next to my friend in the class and make a joke about everyone showing up like it was a test day or something. He looks at me with a weird look and pulls out a scantron. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life. A wave of anxiety washed over me from head to toe as I scanned the room like a Mom looking for her lost kid at a themepark. My brain started hyperfocusing to all the scantrons I had been oblivious to. \n\nI tell my friend how fucked I am. He reassures me that the term paper would be worth a test grade and make up the difference even if I fail the test. I look my friend straight in the eyes and tell him I didn't do the term paper. His face goes somber and he just says, \"RUN\"! \n\nAt that moment I didn't think I just did exactly that. I ran straight to the professor at the front of the class as he was getting ready to pass out the tests. I couldn't form words. I just had my phone in my hand and start pointing to it with my other hand while trying to think of what to say. \"I got a call\", \"I don't know what to do\", \"I\", \"ugh\", and I point to the papers and say \"test\". The professor put his hand on my shoulder and says, \"Don't worry about this test we can figure something out go take care of whatever just happened.\"\n\nThe professor ended up allowing me to count my final as 200 points instead of 100. Finished that class with a D+ which to my surprise was the lowest possible passing grade for the semester! Ran into that professor 5 years later during my last finals week. Told him I was one of his students from 5 years ago, he remembered. He smiled and congratulated me on making it this far in college hahaha he will forever be one of my favorite professors to date! \n\nThe mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!",

I had just had a practical exam for my A&P course an hour before, and I showed up to my cognitive psychology class and saw everyone cramming before class started. I had zero idea there was even an exam because I'd been so focused on my A&P practical. I got a 55% on it and cried for two days after the exam. \n\nMy professor pulled me aside to chat about it and I explained it to him. He was kind and told me if I did well on my next paper he'd forgive the bad test since I'd been doing well in everything else in the course. I killed it on my paper and got a B+ in the class. It would've been a C- without his kindness. I ended up not pursuing a career in nursing because my heart wasn't in it, and even minored in psychology after that.",

There was a lot going on for me at that time so long story short: I was on anti-depressants, my days were foggy and short. I never went to that class. It wasn't hard, there was no need to go to the lecture, except the professor had random exams that weren't scheduled to promote regular attendance. Somehow, on the mornings I actually got my ass up for that godforsaken 8:30, was a day that there was a 'surprise' exam. I didn't miss one of them. I have no idea how that worked out.

Sent the professor an email stating I was in a car accident complete with pictures of a previous car accident I was in. They replied stating I would need a doctors note or police report as verification. So I did the only sensible thing and wrote a fake doctors note. I went to the local hospital and printed out their stationary, typed up some generic stuff and signed it Ashley Leroy RN CCU. Went off without a hitch. Thanks patient privacy laws.",

      "text": "I know I'm late, but I was that kid one time when I was in college.  I was taking an elective and it was considered one of those \"easy\" classes to help boost your GPA.  My roommate was in the class also.  The class was a Housing and Consumer Economics (we called it HACE) class, which is basically a \"how to do normal adult things correctly.\"  Didn't learn much, but on a side note, I did learn that when you use your credit/debit card at a gas pump, the machine \"keeps\" your card information, so you must press the \"Cancel\" button after the transaction in order for the information to be deleted.  A little LFP to go along with this story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I went to class every day ( I think it was a Tuesday/Thursday class, 75 minute classes) up until the first test, took the first test, and it was SO easy, got a 98/100, got the A.  Attendance wasn't mandatory, and all of the information was provided online by the professor that I would need to pass the tests.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, after the first test, I just stopped going to class.  I had 3 classes on Tuesday and Thursday that semester, and this particular class was my third class of the day, so I had two classes before I had to go to the HACE class.  Anyway, weeks go by, and I had about an hour between my first and second class that semester, so I would hit up the library to study in between these first two classes.  Well, on this particular day, I leave my first class, go to the library, and think to myself, \"I should check to see what's been going on in the HACE class to stay somewhat up-to-date.  I'll check the syllabus real quick.\"  *Opens syllabus, looks at the dates I miss, up until the current date, and go into shock as I see that we had our second test TODAY, the day I was looking at this damn syllabus!!!*\n\nI was in shock, I was pissed at myself, and then I realized my situation fully and wen into full prep mode for this unexpected test.  \n\nAlso, remember, my roommate was in this class also, and he did the same thing I did as well by skipping all classes after the first test.  He didn't have any other classes on Tuesday and Thursday during this semester, so I knew he was at home.  I call him and tell him, \"dude, we have a test today in HACE!  You need to get the fuck up and meet me at the library!!!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe, for a good reason as we always fucked with each other because that's what good friends do to each other, didn't believe me.  So, you'd think he'd check the syllabus as I did and see for himself.  Oh no, he does something much more idiotic.  See, we had a platform setup through the university that would allow all the students in the classes that you were in to communicate online and send messages, get updates from the professors, etc.  SO, he decides to go on the group chat (and this was a 200 person class, so lots of eyes on this particular chat log) and sends a message to everyone, \"Hey, is there a test today?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, he got answers like, \"Um, yeah....\" and \"duh\" and then I responded on it, because it's what friends do, and said, \"Actually, I think it got rescheduled to next week.\"  He knew who I was, so was thinking that I was really fucking with him, but then A LOT of people started commenting on my comment in a serious manner, saying, \"wait, so is the test not today?  I'm confused...\" and \"NO, it is not rescheduled, the test is today!\"  The teaching assistant even commented and said, \"just so everyone know's, the test is still scheduled for today.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, finally, my roommate believed me, and met me at the library, 45 minutes before the test.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile he only had 45 minutes, I had a solid 3 hours to study (I skipped my second class that day, for obvious reasons).  I went through all the info provided on the online forum, all of the powerpoint slides, all of the notes shared by students, and I even wen to some website (can't remember the name of it, it's been 6 years) that would sell you notes for classes that students provided for, I think it was, $20.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo during the 45 minutes with my roommate, I tried my best to play professor and teach him everything I just crammed, which in turn helped me understand the material better for myself, so it was a win-win.  Anyway, we go into the test, and we take the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis story has gone on for way too long, so I'll sum it up now.  We get the results of the test the next week, and I turn to my roommate and ask, \"so how'd you do?\"  He was like, \"dude, I passed!  76!  I got a C, but given the circumstances, I'll take it!  How did you do?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this moment, I felt like I beat Goliath, or like I created Facebook, because I ended up getting a 96 on the test, one of the highest scores in the class.  I told him what I got, and my roommate didn't believe me, so I showed him and he just started golf clapping.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, didn't go to class still after that day, BUT I checked that damn syllabus every week so I knew when to show up for the tests.  Got an A in the class.  Stay in school, kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

No, the teacher gives him the same grade as the lowest grade recorded by the person who actually took the exam\u2014he passed. I love Mike...but that story pisses me off.

      "text": "I've participated in something of the opposite. We all show up for the exam, first of the quarter. Standard for my school at least is if you finish your exam you get to leave early. Professors generally plan that their exams will take up the whole period, or at least won't force the students to learn shit after taking an exam.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, this teacher had absolutely no respect from us, and she really didn't deserve any. She should not have been teaching the class, because she didn't know the material at all. She strictly read out of the book and used the provided slides from the publisher, and couldn't even answer easily googlable questions or look into them further. This is in a program that typically has fantastic instructors who know the subject backwards and forwards, so her lack of knowledge was really apparent.\n\n  \n\n\nAs we're getting close to finishing, she decides to tell us that we have to stay. She's planned a video and lecture for after the exam. As she's saying this, the first guy done is bringing down his Scantron. He sets it on the table, looks at her, and walks out with his bag. We all follow suit as we finish our tests, and her 200 student lecture hall was probably less than half full by the end of it.\n\n  \n\n\nShe's no longer allowed to teach here.\n\n  \n\n\nTldr; we were all prepared for the test. Not prepared for lecture after, and left.",

So after the individual presentations I form a group with all the other students who got As in them bc I heard so many horror stories about terrible group mates, but then our prof also assigns us one kid who was frequently absent and happened to be absent the day of the group formations. \n\nSo we prepare for the presentation and everything is going well, then day of this guy just doesn\u2019t show up. Luckily he was only doing the conclusion so I was able to bs his part and get through it. Saw him later and he said he thought it was on a different day. Nice guy but a bit of a space cadet.",

I guess one of the students who never show up to class heard through the grapevine and emailed me an hour before the test. They said they were sick and asked if they could take the test at a later date. I promptly denied their request.\n\n\nNow, before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out on a few things:\n\n\n1. I normally take these types of situations into consideration. After all, I am a student, as well. However, the student emailed me that afternoon one hour before the test. I felt it was a bit too close to the test to justify that to myself.\n\n\n2. When I say that this student doesn't show up, I mean it. They turned in the first homework and took the first test. That's it. There had been numerous homework assignments and numerous tests by this point, and this student turned in almost none of it.\n\n\n3. Finally, I let their final test grade replace their lowest test grade anyway, just for this type of reason... Not that it would help this student, anyway.",

My job doesn't necessarily REQUIRE a degree, and my last elective was a geology class (I was essentially a liberal arts major). I wasn't failing by any means, but with graduation months away and no academic scholarship on the line anymore, I certainly wasn't giving my A game.\n\nSo one day, after a busy week, I show up to Geology class and see everyone reading their study guides, only to realize to my horror it was exam day.\n\nI certainly panicked, but I swallowed my pride, took the exam and somehow managed to squeak out a C-, the lowest grade of my college career.\n\nStill managed to get a B in the class though.\n\nThat was also the same semester I was accused of plagiarizing myself... but that is another story ;)",

He dropped out of the engineering school (you have to maintain a certain GPA) but stayed at the university and kept paying for classes like machine shop that didn't actually count toward any degrees.

The exam was 1/3rd of the whole course. I proceed to leave class, drop out from all classes, search for jobs 4 hours away in Dallas, moved to Dallas, and been here since. I don't regret anything. I was passing a different class for anatomy and physiology but I was stressing me out, which also didn't help. Made the decision in a split second. It wasn't something I had been considering for a while. My brain takes the reins sometimes.\n\nEdit: this was my 6th year in college and I failed 3 classes, all history/state related shit classes.",

I think I got a .79 that semester whereas during my freshman year I was on the Dean's list and in the honors college.  I failed a soccer elective too, which I love. I think the only reason I ever made it out is because the next semester I felt so guilty since my parents were helping to pay, that I put a ton of effort into going to most classes. By the next semester, the classes got to a high enough level that the professors would actually email their students when someone missed. Pure guilt got me a college degree and likely saved my life. I have a really good life and job now",

Learn the main actions of classes of drugs (like beta blockers end with -olol, metoprolol, labetalol, they work similarly, have similar side effects) I studied the classes more thoroughly, then tried to cram in quirks of each med. It was a crap shoot which detail would end up on the exam. I missed an A by 0.3 of a point. Bah",

Not only that, she has a policy where she drops your lowest exam and adds extra points to each exam if you pass her quizzes and point out any mistakes in the exam (if there are any which is rare) on the discussion board. Which IMO shows that she\u2019s very fair and lenient with grading.\n\nYeah I get it, some profs are total jerks, but ratemyproffessor has become a place where students rant because of their own incompetence.",

I talked to my Prof after class and he said that because I was one of the only ones that participated all year, and because he could tell I had made an honest mistake, he'd give me an extra day to \"light the midnight oil\" and get it done\n\nGot my first official college A",

I had an athletic schedule, so I busted it out in a weekend. 100% in the class, so I feel good. Fast forward to finals week, we received the email telling us our test date. I scan the email, May 2nd - sounds good. The day comes around and I log on to take my exam. It's locked. Turns out the exam was actually on May 1st, I misread. I call the professor, he tells me it is my own fault (which, I agree... but c'mon... 100% before this). It was 10% of my grade. Only B I received in my college career. Cost me valedictorian not only in my specific school, but overall in the university. \n\nSo, you could say I was a bit bitter. Haha\n\nDifference between an on-campus Psych class and a tenured online Math professor. ",
