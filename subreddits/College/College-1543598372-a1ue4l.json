In my highschool AP courses I developed this shitty habit of binge studying the night before a test and passing off of that, and it worked out well because I test well. However, this shitty habit persisted into college.\n\nFor my freshman year it worked alright. Classes were mostly review, and I did enough homework to pass with good grades. Sophomore year I took O-chem. This is where things started to go wrong.\n\nMy O-chem professor introduced a new grading option. Your grade on the final exam, which reflects what you've learned in the class, would be your final grade in the class, if it was higher than your current grade. It was extremely generous, and me, being the little shit I was, immediately stopped going to class.\n\n In the 36 hours preceding the final, I studied 30 hours straight and then slept for 6 hours before heading out to take the test. It was my first time going to the class in at least 2 months.\n\nI passed with a C by 1%. I did not learn my lesson.\n\nLater, I would take BioChem. This Professor allowed the exact same thing. It must've been a chemistry thing. Anyways, I did not attend a single class after the second day, until the final. I also passed, but barely.\n\nSome of my co-workers, who are still in classes, have mentioned that the Biochem professor has since amended the policy, adding in a new stipulation that for the final to replace your overall grade, you must meet certain attendance requirements.\n\nFinally, TWICE I missed a final due to having gotten the date wrong. Both times I noticed immediately AFTER the exam, as friends texted me asking how I'd done. For the first time, I was allowed to take the exam at a different time, but my professor straight up thought I was an idiot.\n\nThe second time, my professor started out angry. They thought that because I had a high enough grade to pass without taking the final, I had blown it off. After I explained my circumstances, she understood and said that while I could not take the final, I had options to raise my grade.\n\nDon't be me. Be a better student. I didn't get good grades with my method, but hey, I graduated. If I had gotten it together sooner I could've aced my classes though.

Freshman, the class was Bio 101. I remember it was the halfway point in the semester because we had a term paper due that Monday. Saturday rolls around\u2014I go to my car to find the assignment topic. OH SHIT! I can't find it!!! After searching my car top to bottom, I give up. I was averaging an A until that point so I figured even if I get a 0 on that paper I could still pass the class. \n\nThat Monday comes around and I go to class with no term paper, ready to accept my fate. The hallway was packed with people, faces you hadn't seen in weeks. Except, everyone was reading their textbooks. Weird. \n\nI sit down next to my friend in the class and make a joke about everyone showing up like it was a test day or something. He looks at me with a weird look and pulls out a scantron. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life. A wave of anxiety washed over me from head to toe as I scanned the room like a Mom looking for her lost kid at a themepark. My brain started hyperfocusing to all the scantrons I had been oblivious to. \n\nI tell my friend how fucked I am. He reassures me that the term paper would be worth a test grade and make up the difference even if I fail the test. I look my friend straight in the eyes and tell him I didn't do the term paper. His face goes somber and he just says, \"RUN\"! \n\nAt that moment I didn't think I just did exactly that. I ran straight to the professor at the front of the class as he was getting ready to pass out the tests. I couldn't form words. I just had my phone in my hand and start pointing to it with my other hand while trying to think of what to say. \"I got a call\", \"I don't know what to do\", \"I\", \"ugh\", and I point to the papers and say \"test\". The professor put his hand on my shoulder and says, \"Don't worry about this test we can figure something out go take care of whatever just happened.\"\n\nThe professor ended up allowing me to count my final as 200 points instead of 100. Finished that class with a D+ which to my surprise was the lowest possible passing grade for the semester! Ran into that professor 5 years later during my last finals week. Told him I was one of his students from 5 years ago, he remembered. He smiled and congratulated me on making it this far in college hahaha he will forever be one of my favorite professors to date! \n\nThe mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!", "author": "ontusko", "created": 1543636830, "upvotes": 6}, "eau10m7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a1ue4l/ever_have_a_kid_in_class_show_up_and_realize_its/eau10m7/", "text": "I did this once in my entire 5 years in undergrad.

I was taking an elective and it was considered one of those \"easy\" classes to help boost your GPA.  My roommate was in the class also.  The class was a Housing and Consumer Economics (we called it HACE) class, which is basically a \"how to do normal adult things correctly.\"  Didn't learn much, but on a side note, I did learn that when you use your credit/debit card at a gas pump, the machine \"keeps\" your card information, so you must press the \"Cancel\" button after the transaction in order for the information to be deleted.  A little LFP to go along with this story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I went to class every day ( I think it was a Tuesday/Thursday class, 75 minute classes) up until the first test, took the first test, and it was SO easy, got a 98/100, got the A.  Attendance wasn't mandatory, and all of the information was provided online by the professor that I would need to pass the tests.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, after the first test, I just stopped going to class.  I had 3 classes on Tuesday and Thursday that semester, and this particular class was my third class of the day, so I had two classes before I had to go to the HACE class.  Anyway, weeks go by, and I had about an hour between my first and second class that semester, so I would hit up the library to study in between these first two classes.  Well, on this particular day, I leave my first class, go to the library, and think to myself, \"I should check to see what's been going on in the HACE class to stay somewhat up-to-date.  I'll check the syllabus real quick.\"  *Opens syllabus, looks at the dates I miss, up until the current date, and go into shock as I see that we had our second test TODAY, the day I was looking at this damn syllabus!!!*\n\nI was in shock, I was pissed at myself, and then I realized my situation fully and wen into full prep mode for this unexpected test.  \n\nAlso, remember, my roommate was in this class also, and he did the same thing I did as well by skipping all classes after the first test.  He didn't have any other classes on Tuesday and Thursday during this semester, so I knew he was at home.  I call him and tell him, \"dude, we have a test today in HACE!  You need to get the fuck up and meet me at the library!!!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe, for a good reason as we always fucked with each other because that's what good friends do to each other, didn't believe me.  So, you'd think he'd check the syllabus as I did and see for himself.  Oh no, he does something much more idiotic.  See, we had a platform setup through the university that would allow all the students in the classes that you were in to communicate online and send messages, get updates from the professors, etc.  SO, he decides to go on the group chat (and this was a 200 person class, so lots of eyes on this particular chat log) and sends a message to everyone, \"Hey, is there a test today?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, he got answers like, \"Um, yeah....\" and \"duh\" and then I responded on it, because it's what friends do, and said, \"Actually, I think it got rescheduled to next week.\"  He knew who I was, so was thinking that I was really fucking with him, but then A LOT of people started commenting on my comment in a serious manner, saying, \"wait, so is the test not today?  I'm confused...\" and \"NO, it is not rescheduled, the test is today!\"  The teaching assistant even commented and said, \"just so everyone know's, the test is still scheduled for today.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, finally, my roommate believed me, and met me at the library, 45 minutes before the test.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile he only had 45 minutes, I had a solid 3 hours to study (I skipped my second class that day, for obvious reasons).  I went through all the info provided on the online forum, all of the powerpoint slides, all of the notes shared by students, and I even wen to some website (can't remember the name of it, it's been 6 years) that would sell you notes for classes that students provided for, I think it was, $20.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo during the 45 minutes with my roommate, I tried my best to play professor and teach him everything I just crammed, which in turn helped me understand the material better for myself, so it was a win-win.  Anyway, we go into the test, and we take the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis story has gone on for way too long, so I'll sum it up now.  We get the results of the test the next week, and I turn to my roommate and ask, \"so how'd you do?\"  He was like, \"dude, I passed!  76!  I got a C, but given the circumstances, I'll take it!  How did you do?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this moment, I felt like I beat Goliath, or like I created Facebook, because I ended up getting a 96 on the test, one of the highest scores in the class.  I told him what I got, and my roommate didn't believe me, so I showed him and he just started golf clapping.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, didn't go to class still after that day, BUT I checked that damn syllabus every week so I knew when to show up for the tests.

She strictly read out of the book and used the provided slides from the publisher, and couldn't even answer easily googlable questions or look into them further. This is in a program that typically has fantastic instructors who know the subject backwards and forwards, so her lack of knowledge was really apparent.\n\n  \n\n\nAs we're getting close to finishing, she decides to tell us that we have to stay. She's planned a video and lecture for after the exam. As she's saying this, the first guy done is bringing down his Scantron. He sets it on the table, looks at her, and walks out with his bag. We all follow suit as we finish our tests, and her 200 student lecture hall was probably less than half full by the end of it.\n\n  \n\n\nShe's no longer allowed to teach here.\n\n  \n\n\nTldr; we were all prepared for the test.
