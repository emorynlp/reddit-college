  "text": "I am failing calculus 2 as we speak. I can\u2019t drop the class because of my scholarship so I have to finish the course. I might fail. I got a 7 out of 40 in my first midterm (17%) and my grade currently sits at 43.7%. I studied my ass off for the past 4 weeks to understand the topics for the 2nd midterm. I was walking to my class today to take the test and I realized I have never been so nervous about a test in my life. My heart was racing and I knew once I walked out of that room after the test I would know if I failed the class or not.\n\nTruth is I don\u2019t know if I passed or if I failed. Getting such a low score changes your perception of your own capabilities as a student. Even if you know how to do, let\u2019s say, volumes with integrals, you feel like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and it sucks. It discourages you. I\u2019ve never felt something like this and the stress that comes with it along with the mental health issues derived from it are overwhelming. Is crazy how a low grade can make you feel like you\u2019re not capable of anything.\n\nTL/TR\n\nYou know what they say about \u201cdon\u2019t let your grades define you\u201d. I understand what they mean. Currently failing calc 2 and I answered everything in my 2nd midterm today yet I dont know if I passed even though I studied a lot.",
