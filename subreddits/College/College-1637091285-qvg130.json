  "text": "So I could use some input. I\u2019m in somewhat of a sticky situation. So to sum up there\u2019s a girl whom I have feelings for in the same major and couple classes as me. But also happens to be in the same club as me. It\u2019s a club for networking and career help. I\u2019m an officer of that club. Well we\u2019re talking and I kind of want to ask her out but I\u2019m hesitant bc of the following:\nPros:\n\u2022easy to talk to\n\u2022stuff in common\n\u2022could help each other \n\nCons: \n\u2022 I enjoy the club and I don\u2019t wanna have it be awkward and bad if things go south and don\u2019t work out \n\n\u2022 if things don\u2019t work out I don\u2019t want my reputation ruined \n\nIs this shitting where I eat? What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts?",

      "text": "Don\u2019t live with regret. Just recently got dumped hard by a girl I work with after going on just a few dates. Never regretted asking her out though. I don\u2019t have to see her every day anymore, but it still sucks when I do. Depends on whether the risk of heartbreak/awkwardness is worth it or not to you.",

      "text": "as a girl i say go for it! yeah it\u2019s annoying to get rejected but im sure the thought of being with her makes you really excited. if she rejects you for some reason, it takes two to make a situation awkward, so just treat her like normal. it might be weird at first but things will return to normal.",
