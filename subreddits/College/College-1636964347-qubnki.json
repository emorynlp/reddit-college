  "text": "I've been going through so much shit with my grandpa having terminal cancer and I just forgot about this presentation I had to make - it wasn't super important. I remembered before the lecture so I emailed her like 10 hours before, she didn't reply. When the lecture started, she got really mad and said I'm a slack (though I told her I'm having family issues). She said she can't know if I actually have problems and that everyone has problems anyway - not to mention she also didn't hold her lecture last week due to some personal issues. Wtf? Is she the only one allowed to have personal issues that interfere with her work?\n\nSorry, she made me feel like shit. I've been trying to do my best with everything happening and then a person like this comes and says I'm a fucking slack. I didn't tell her anything because I don't think it's worth picking up a fight with someone who's grading me.",
