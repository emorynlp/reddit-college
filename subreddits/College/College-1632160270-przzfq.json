  "text": "Now that I'm a senior, I don't really have classes with my friends in my major since everyone is taking different electives or taking classes in their double major or minor. With COVID it was hard to connect with classmates virtually and even now it's kind of the same since I've wanted to keep my in-person social circle small to reduce COVID risks.\n\nBut goodness. The quality of my education has just sucked without having actual friends to work and study with. It feels totally different than my first and second year. I really am not doing well with this sort of dynamic. What can I do to fix it? How do I manage my time better, engage with the material better, etc. without the embedded support system that was there when I had friends in my classes? Most of my classes have no group work or labs, so I can't really get close to people that way, either, whereas in my freshman and sophomore year that was a way I got to know people in my courses well.
