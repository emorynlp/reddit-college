  "text": "I came down with something nasty last week, and I\u2019m at a point where all I can do is sit in bed, barely have the energy to cook food the last few days. I\u2019m starting to get behind on assignments and everything just feels so overwhelming right now. Can barely focus on Calc II, I\u2019ve had two day colds before but going on a week is becoming extremely detrimental. Has anyone experienced this situation? How did you deal?",

Contact your campus health services and get your illness documented.\n3. Get a COVID test.\n4. Get medical care. Drink lots of water. Eat healthy; get pre-prepared food if you don't have energy to cook. Get documents from medical care for professors or appeals (if it comes to that.)",

Today, after I woke up in the middle of the night crying in pain, I finally tested positive for strep. Definitely go to your student health center and keep drinking a bunch of fluids.",
