      "text": "I didn't during the last two years and my grades were much better.\n\nDuring class I would mainly pay attention to the professor's conversation as opposed to only thinking about writing their words on paper. I found that when I was taking notes, I was just copying words I heard and not actually digesting what the professor was teaching.\n\nFor tests I would use the powerpoints and/or coursework to create flashcards. I relied mainly on the existing paper material they taught with.",

      "text": "write down what the professor is saying as a summary if possible. bullet points or whatever is quickest to get the point across. Your goal is to relate back what the content is and what your professor said (it helps you remember the content really quick if you get in the practice of connecting your ideas)\n\nworry about the powerpoint stuff later. usually they post it online before or after the class so you may already have a copy. Ask your teacher for a copy or to post it. \n\nDon\u2019t be constantly writing if you can help it. This takes power away from absorbing and processing the content.",
