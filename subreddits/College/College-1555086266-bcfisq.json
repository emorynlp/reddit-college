Fine by me. After the class she sent out a class wide email explaining that the whole class she had never seen us being so disrespectful and we made her day worse because of some \u201cTragic/traumatizing news\u201d she received regarding a colleague. She had also individually emailed me asking me about a question I had in class that day. I tell her i\u2019ve understood it now and thanked her for helping. She then emails me back saying that she had already explained why the exponent was negative 20-30 times and me asking that question had completely thrown off the flow of the lecture and told me I need to pay attention more and that it \u201ccan\u2019t/won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Yesterday, We had lab without the professor and apparently she had done this to several other students as well. She has also sent several other class wide emails that just said \u201cthere will be a pop quiz on Friday with no equation sheet. be prepared.\u201d Am I wrong for thinking that this woman has lost it?

Dont be THAT person. Notify the school asap of your uncomfortable position to begin setting up a clear record in case there is questionable problems later.\nFor the record - this is not even close to some of the poor behavior I've witnessed.
