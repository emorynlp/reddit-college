  "text": "Am struggling very hard in my biology and other classes.Used be decent in high school and learnt all this already but in another language.Now I struggle to answer correctly or confidently in these assignments. Can\u2019t focus learning either I had to be in home and go online classes cuz of shitty school and more shitty government. I have always been terrible at focusing at online classes.\nMoreover, I can\u2019t even find any related knowledge let alone answers in lecture as well.\nAt this rate, I don\u2019t know how I am going to continue studying or choose a major\nI need a very high score to choose a major.\nI feel like I dont belong in this subject even though it sucks already , people I know from this programme scores highly or can dump 10 points from finals and get an A+. The competition is high and I am afraid I will lose it.I cant find anyone that is related to me or can share my feelings or situation.My secondary schoolmates are non college students or students that doesnt struggle at all(they played league during exams) or legit 0 fucks given to college or I dont know them well enough.\nI even spent hours worrying about an assignment I have done.",
