  "text": "I admit I'm guilty of leaving my application portal open and refreshing it every once in a while while using my computer. Well I did that a few minutes ago and was greeted with the little floating confetti...but it doesn't say anything about acceptances, application updates, or anything. Everything looks the same except the section that did say \"application status: awaiting decision\" disappeared entirely. So it this just a technical error? I only had my interview three days ago (when they said they just got a new system) and it's rolling admissions so I'm leaning towards that, but still was unexpected to see haha. Has anyone else had this happen to them and did you get accepted?",
