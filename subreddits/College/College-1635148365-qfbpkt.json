  "text": "So in short, I received a 0 on a big assignment because I had \u201csome plagiarism\u201d in it. I did not plagiarize and did everything honestly. The turn it in score is 26 percent. It\u2019s an annotated bibliography so I cited many things. The professor asked me to email him about it. Truth is i don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t really wanna make any excuses and say that the professor judged the assignment wrong because that never works. I also don\u2019t want to accept the plagiarism accusation because I truly did everything honestly. How do I go about this for the best result?",

      "text": "TurnItIn explicitly says which lines are plagiarized from what source. So in your report go from highlighted part to highlighted part saying \u201cTurnItIn flagged X, however it was quoted from source Y in the bibliography\u201d. Also anything cited you can just remove from the essay temporarily and if you reupload with the same word count (just add blocks of \u201cblah\u201d where you removed cited material but keep word count the same) you can prove whatever is written is purely yours. That\u2019s what I would do in your position at least",

Explain how you produced your assignment Ex. \"I went to the library on Saturday and read these books.\" Rather than make accusations, ask for explanations. Overall keep a calm, composted tone and an attitude that you want learn from this experience to do better in class.",
