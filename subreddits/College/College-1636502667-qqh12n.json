  "text": "Hi all! Looking for some advice here. I'm a sophomore Political Science major, and I'm thinking about adding a mass communication minor. I feel like it might be useful in the work force, I'm not sure exactly what I want to do, hopefully something in Congress, but I feel like it could be useful to have some qualification in media. Honestly I'm not sure (hence me coming here) so any and all advice regarding minors in general and mass communication specifically would be most appreciated. Thanks :)",
