There are soooo many things out of our control right now: what *can* you control? What are some things you can change about how you learn? \n\nIf you are used to attending lecture then doing the reading, try flipping it. Finish the reading/watching  videos, etc before the lecture. If you already read first, can you make time to review the information more than once before class? If you do not take notes, start. If you do take notes, try a new approach to note taking (https://www.utc.edu/center-academic-support-advisement/tips-for-academic-success/note-taking.php) \n\nIf your environment is loud, can you make changes to the time of day you study or borrow/purchase noise blocking headphones?

Colleges are pushing for this to be the \"new normal\" so they can keep raking in tuitions and pumping out degrees for a fraction of their usual overhead. All we can do is keep loudly vocalizing our dissatisfaction with the deteriorating quality of education being sold to us at the cost of a house. We have all purchased an outrageously expensive product with certain expectations that aren't being met. \n\nImagine if you bought a luxury car and come to find out you can only drive it 30 miles an hour because the transmission won't go past third gear. You would probably expect them to replace the car or refund your money right? So why do we expect anything less from our universities? Why don't they back up the product they are selling? In my opinion, students are WAY too complacent with their situation right now. We absolutely cannot allow this to become the new normal.", "author": null, "created": 1600355702, "upvotes": 125}, "g5lavbz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/iul3qe/anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_not_actually/g5lavbz/", "text": "Me too.
