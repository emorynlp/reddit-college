  "text": "The (now) professor that is advertising my small graduate program managed to secure a proper tenured position at my school roughly a year ago. Here in Germany, we have a thing called \"Antrittsvorlesungen\" (Inaugural Lectures), where new tenured professors formally introduce themselves to the faculty and students. These usually take place a year after they get appointed.  \n\nThey invited us to their inaugural lecture last week, which took place yesterday. And let me tell you, it was quite an experience. I can recommend going if something like this exists at your college. I don't think I have ever seen so many professors in one place at the same time. Their lecture itself mainly focused on their research, and they seemed to be quite nervous. Similar vibes to student presentations. The best and most interesting part was the reception afterwards though, talking about research, the university, the different institutes and other uni woes and happenings they normally don't talk about. It offered some unique insights into the university and was a decent way to network.  \n\nIt was sadly online, due to covid-19 and the university still dealing with the damages from the recent floods, which lessened the mood somewhat. It also didn't allow the customary toast. Since my fellow students and I had a lecture the next morning, we decided to remedy the situation and brought a crate of cold beer and some non-alcoholic ciders for the 9:00 lecture to properly toast.   \n\nThe professor seemed pleasantly surprised, but objected toasting/drinking before the lecture, so we had to wait till the end of the lecture at 13:00. They even got us some pastries, so we didn't have to drink on empty stomach. It was a nice atmosphere, and they talked a lot about their times as student (grad, phd) and about their research, uni life and so on. Was quite interesting to listen to. \n\nIt was just a great way to build a students-professor relationship and get some more insights into parts of uni that are usually not that transparent as a student. I can recommend visiting inaugural lectures/department colloquiums/trial lectures and other similar events if you're interested in stuff like that. Most profs are usually happy to have students there and you get to talk to them outside of a classroom setting (we don't have office hours here).    \n\n\n**tl;dr visited inaugural lecture, brought beer to next lecture and got free pastries. turns out most professors are human.** \n\n\n*(english isn't my native tongue, so I'm always happy if people point out flaws so I can improve my written english.)*",
