  "text": "I've been to 2 different colleges and have 3 semesters under my belt (47 credits). I'm currently working on starting my 4th semester at yet another college. I am working on finishing up pre-reqs on a Concurrent (Dual-enrollement with a 4th college..\\[I've moved around a lot\\]) Nursing BSN Program and in DegreeWorks, it states that i'm working toward an Associates of Science.\n\nWhen I plug all my required future classes in (spring '23 and summer '23) to the program, it says I am due my Associates in Science. The program/school only accepted 29 Credits of my previous classes to go toward the Program. But every college has different pre-req's... so I have a lot of extra classes now.. According to the Program I'm going to be applying to, I won't be getting my Associates or Bachelors in Nursing until close to the end of the program. I don't want to be awarded the Associates in Science or I won't be able to get FAFSA to pay for the Associates in Nursing, which is the degree I want. How do I fix this?",

      "text": "Moving colleges with credits is always risky. As a lot of the time you have to do those credits again as they become invalidated by another course provider.\n\nYou fix it by staying at one college for your Associates and/or bachelors degrees if you have credits at one college for both degrees. Once you get too deep in unfortunately you are locked in. This limits consumer choice and also guarantees income for the University. They have to put assets in to teach you so they don't want you running away with the credits you used their resources to get to complete the degree at another university.\n\nAs you did not complete your course of study at the previous institution, it does not surprise me about student funding group declining your application. As you keep moving colleges it appears unlikely that you will finish your degree",
