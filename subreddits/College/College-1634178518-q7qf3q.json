I'll have my associates in May, (I plan on going through to my bachelors). \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to mention that I finished my first set of classes for this semester and I currently sit on a 3.68 gpa going into the second term.\n\nAs stressful as it is, especially since all my classes are online and I'm also working a full time as well as a part time job, it's oh so rewarding.",

Youre at risk of burnout or some kind of breakdown with this schedule if youre not naturally an organized person. Im assuming you need to work so going forward you should really only take 10-12 credits. \n\nYou manage by time by *showing up* to everything you need to show up for. When you get home from work, shower and eat and then hit the books until its time for bed. Rinse and repeat everyday. Ill be honest with you its going to be stressful and suck.",

          "text": "The first thing you need to do is to gather everything you have (schedules for classes, work, etc.) and put it all into one place. This will help you stay on track and you can use tools like Trello or Notion or wtvr. As a freshman, your goal should be to manage your time in a way that doesn't feel like a chore. For me, I used To-Do lists and Google Calendar. On your calendar, put down EVERYTHING, and I mean everything. Put all of your work shifts into blocks of time, classes, labs, etc. to help you visualize what time of day you'll have left for studying and whatnot. Since you'll have most of your time after 6, I would look over notes and such in the mornings before you go to work, then look at notes again while on break (if you have a break, that is) and then work on the problems after you clock out. \n\nHonestly, 14 hours is actually a good start for a college freshman and you'll have quite a bit of time to do your work if you manage your time effectively. One piece of advice for you is to not waste any time whatsoever until all your work is done. If possible, start on your assignments almost immediately after they are assigned. Get any reports in as quickly as possible and you'll be amazed to see how caught up you are.\n\nJust do not procrastinate right away. Once you start following the rabbit hole of procrastination you will pay for it, so keep track of the time you take to relax and work. As you get more experience managing your time like this, you'll become more relaxed with your schedule.\n\nThis helped me get a 4.0 GPA while working two jobs all year while I was in community college and now I'm at a T30 university. I still follow the same process and so far it's working out pretty well.\n\nAs for calculus, practice. Practice again and again! I got A's in all of my calculus classes because of how much I put into practice rather than just going over notes. I recommend this to anybody taking a calc class, and the more you work on problems the better prepared you will be. If you don't already know, Khan Academy has a great set of problems for calculus 1 and 2 (albeit, a lot of it is geared to the high school level, but it's all the same concepts). That being said, good luck on your studies I wish you well!\n\nAlso, so sorry for making this so long, but just one last note on money, don't waste it if it's something you don't need. From my two jobs, I saved up so much money I was able to pay off tuition with little to no loans because of how much I saved up. It can be tough when the paychecks start coming in but find it within yourself to hold back from making unnecessary purchases.",

I never miss an assignment doing this and it isn\u2019t so bad once you get into the rhythm of it. \n\nOne thing that helps is to take as many asynchronous online courses as possible.",
