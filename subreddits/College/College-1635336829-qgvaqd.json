I\u2019m in my final semester of my undergraduate and have already been accepted for my grad school. All I need to do is keep my 3.4 from going below a 2.0 by the end of the semester. However I cared about it and made sure it was good up to this point.",

      "text": "Agree with u/caroline_button_. \n\n\nYour recent post history mentions that you plan to apply to grad school. Admissions for grad school are already tough (and, from what we saw, they got tougher when COVID hit) and while GPA isn't everything, it plays a role. If you go to grad school, as they mentioned, often your funding is contingent on a high GPA. The expectation is that you will get mostly As with the occasional B on a transcript. You mentioned being tired of studying, but you are *constantly* piled with work in grad school, and you're expected to do it well and do it quickly. Because of that, it's in your best interest to learn *now* to combat that burnout without sacrificing your GPA, rather than trying to learn later.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, it's less important, but keeping it decent will be good, and having it higher leaves options like continuing education down the road.",
