                      "text": "This is incorrect, and I do believe it is almost always much cheaper. The exception might be big cities where rent is crazy high. In my specific situation it's $1500/mo for a shared dorm or $300-500 for a room in a house near campus.\n\nAnother exception might be for first year students with high merit scholarships. My college \"requires\" you to live in a dorm first year, and the penalty for not doing so is losing your merit scholarships. In my case this was $750 for the semester, so it was still very much worth it to live off campus ($3750- cheaper, not accounting for meals). You can usually get a waiver for this if you can prove that you cannot afford to live in a dorm.\n\nDorms do include meal plans, which is a bonus. The average cost of food is like $200-300/mo though, so that's still $1200/mo for the dorm if we don't include the meals in the price. \n\nFinancial aid doesn't know your true cost of attendance, it is based on an estimate. This estimate will not change based on your housing, room and board is always estimated the same (in my experience).\n\nFinancial aid (obviously) does not *directly* pay for off campus housing. Instead, the extra amount is applied to your account and then deposited into your bank to use for education related expenses. Housing *absolutely* ***is*** an education-related expense, and it is most definitely covered regardless of where you are. Food and car insurance are also education-related expenses.",

Let's assume that if you're living in a dorm you won't use a car.\n\nFood averages around $200 a month, let's say car insurance is $100/mo and gas is $100/mo. That leaves you with $750/month for rent and utilities (or $950 if you would've had a car in the dorms anyway) In my area you could get a 1br apartment for less than that, but I know that's not the case everywhere. Usually, though, you can find a room in a house for much less than that (as low as $250+util) in my area, and you are only paying 1/x of utilities where x is the number of housemates you have.",

It\u2019s pretty cool having a roommate and suitemates. It\u2019s good to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page in terms of what is allowed at certain times of day, who does what chores, what everyone\u2019s schedules are like, etc. It also really helps to have a line of communication that you\u2019re comfortable using in case you have an issue with something someone else is doing. As long as those things are set, living in a suite and with a roommate is pretty cool. I\u2019m not really going to get into the advantages of having a suite over a normal dorm because I don\u2019t know what your school offers.\n\nI say if you can afford it, go for it. Living in a dorm is pretty alright.",

(And my roommate and my schedules don't match up exactly, so I have some time to myself too) It's very easy to hole yourself up in your room (for better or worse) during the day. Even people whose parents called them every 2 hours have slowly gotten busy/focused on their own life. \n\nMy roommate was an acquaintance from high school, so we get along fine. I got lucky and my dorm-mates are mostly quiet. (Although - my roommate is a light sleeper and says people biking around or talking sometimes keeps her up)\n\nI like the ability to establish new study habits too, since it's a new environment\n\n Advice?:Consider meeting roommate beforehand, establish quiet hours and house rules (Ex:cleaning schedule) -I've heard some people say earplugs and headphones are a nice thing to have. Also make sure you have some place by yourself to study/plan some time to have the room to yourself, since walls can be thin. Although - it's actually not very loud here. (I live on the 2nd floor too) - Most people are considerate.",

I finally feel like my own person and that I am in control of my life, it is so freeing! I have a single which makes it easier, but living with a roomate can have its drawbacks, just make sure you room with someone you can trust and can communicate well.  It\u2019s loud at times being in a dorm, and people can be annoying but depending on your situation it might be worth it. A lot of schools will let you tour dorms or you could try asking a friend for a tour or review I guess. Hope this helps!",

There are nicer new dorms at some schools, but those cost an arm and a leg. \n\nIf you\u2019re going for a dorm, i\u2019d suggest finding a living learning community (that\u2019s what my school called it)- a group of people all grouped into a dorm based on major, or other similarities (transfer students, international students, etc). These groups provide an easy bit of community and often have perks like tutoring and fun community events. \n\nDorm life might seem a little tough at first but it is easy to make friends, and not so bad once you get used to it.",

BUT one thing, please make sure you're in a company of good people. otherwise that'll affect your performance quite conspicuously. my academic performance never got hampered, thanks to my roommates who were really good and compromising. not very troublesome. and yeah, stay out of situations that aren't concerned with you. things get pretty messed up if you try to involve yourself in everything and when you're living with strangers. \ntake care, all the best!",

I live in a single, due to personal health issues, but I still have neighbors in the hall.\n\nSome advice would be to branch out and make friends. Find people in your major who you can study with or go to lunch with. This way, you guys can work with each other and if you miss a day or they miss a day you can share notes.\nAlways make sure to be considerate. Throw your garbage away and don\u2019t leave a shared item gross. Clean up after yourself always!\nMake sure when you leave your dorm to lock your door because dorm theft sadly exists everywhere. Sadly we can\u2019t trust everyone.\nDon\u2019t be the person up screaming all night. Be considerate of quiet hours. Especially during midterms or finals. People need to study.\nLast bit of advice would be to get a mattress pad. College beds aren\u2019t the comfiest \n\nI wish you luck in your future endeavors!",
