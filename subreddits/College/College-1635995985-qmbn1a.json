  "text": "A little background information...\n\nI am currently working towards a bachelors degree in computer science. Because I took many classes in high school for college credit, I have been on track to get the degree in a total of 6 semesters. I am in the middle of my third.  I took one CSCI (computer science) class my first semester that I enjoyed, 1 my second that was really tough but alright, and now in my third semester I am taking 3 csci classes, none of which I am enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I am feeling that I never know what I am doing despite getting great grades. I feel like I am so behind my classmates and that I'm the only one that does not write code etc for fun. in fact, I chose not to post this at r/csmajors because the whole subreddit is about getting competetive internship at big name companies that I don't have a chance with. I believe that I would graduate lacking knowledge, not to mention I rarely enjoy the coursework anymore.\n\nHowever, I am nearly halfway done with the major, and have spent thousands on the classes, so I feel like it is too late to switch. Anyone else been in a similar situation? Have any advice?",

      "text": "Hey I was in a similar situation during my second year. I\u2019m a cs major too, and I enjoyed the first year but I found second year quite tough and not really what I expected it to be. I was considering switching to a stats major, but I decided to tuff it out and at least finish the lower division requirements (which are all the first and second year classes). I am now just starting my fourth year, and have actually re-spiked my interest in cs after taking some third year classes. At my uni, they offer much for freedom on what you can take during third and fourth year, so taking classes that I thought I would be interested in really helped. \nAlso u mentioned you feel like you aren\u2019t learning anything despite getting good grades. First of all, congrats, it\u2019s not easy to get good grades in cs courses (At my uni the class averages are usually a B-). What you have is common in the cs industry, it\u2019s called imposter syndrome, look it up! I very much think that I am like that too, but it\u2019s okay! We all do. \n\nAnyways, my advice would be to stick with it for a bit longer, and if you really feel like you dislike it then a switch is probably best. But a cs degree is valuable, and maybe you could try and land an internship after your second year(?). \n\nGood luck, hope this helped!",

      "text": "Can you switch to a similar major like Information Management Systems? Is there something else you'd rather do entirely?\n\nDon't worry about the leetcode grind to get into Google if that isn't actually what you want to do with your life. Sometimes its better to use even a little programming skills as a super-power in another field.  You can go really far that way!",
