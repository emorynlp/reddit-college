  "text": "I got overwhelmed in the last few weeks with work and coursework that I forgot I had a midterm due. I had it written down and reminders and i somehow managed to forget. I have never done this before so i'm very disappointed in myself. \n\nTips on how to make sure i never make this dumb mistake again? The midterm is 10% of my grade so i think i can still pass with a decent grade, but i am so ashamed to have to face the professor and possibly explain myself. i don't like to have to give excuses because this is not excusable. \n\nAlso has this happened to anyone else?",

And don't beat yourself up so much, the problem isn't *you* so much as the exhaustion you face from being overwhelmed by an unreasonable amount of work/responsibility/stuff you gotta deal with. I think the most important thing in this instance is to take a breather, since you clearly are overworked atm. You can do this!",
