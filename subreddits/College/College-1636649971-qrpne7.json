  "text": "They both have good ratings, just the new professor as a slightly better rating. 4.2 for my current professor (3.2 difficulty) and 5 star rating for the new one (1.9 difficulty).",

      "text": "If you already know how your current professor is and don't have a problem with them I would just go with them again instead of rolling on the unknown. If it's a new professor they won't have as big of a sample size for reviews or they might've just been thrown into a Freshman introduction class to begin with where its easy so people give out perfect ratings before going into teaching a more challenging class.",

      "text": "Besides your grade, what do you think of your current class? Getting a good grade doesn\u2019t always equal it being a good fit. I\u2019ve had courses where I\u2019ve done well in but didn\u2019t particularly enjoy.\n\nWhat do you think about the teaching style? Is the balance between lectures and discussion satisfactory for you? Do you feel like you are actually absorbing information and making deep connections or just enough to do well on assignments? What about the type of assignments? Do you feel like you are getting good feedback? Are the reference points relevant? Do you want to get a feel for the other professor before taking advance courses with them if this is your major department?\n\nAlso (honestly what will be the deciding factor) whose class fits into your schedule the best? Will taking the course with the other professors allow you to fit something else that you want or need to take? Would you prefer a morning or afternoon section?",
