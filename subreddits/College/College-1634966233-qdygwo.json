  "text": "Recently, my university had opened back from remote learning. I had just started the organic chemistry series and I am now currently in the last class for it. However, I just had my first midterm exam, expecting the average to be super low considering that everyone is making the same transition.   Then, I've just gotten my score back to realize that Ive received the lowest grade of the class. It's been hard to study and retain the information I have just learned because, for all of the previous material, I heavily relied on my notes. Now, I feel like I'm too far into the course to relearn what I haven't memorized in the previous two courses. What should I do?",
