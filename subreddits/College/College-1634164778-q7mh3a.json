  "text": "Any college alumnis have any experiences or advice that might help? Just graduated from college with a pure math degree and I really have no idea what to do next. My original goal was to get a masters in math and teach at a community college but I struggled with my proof based math classes so much that I have no ambition to do this anymore. I've always wanted a college degree from a good university but I don't feel like I learned any applicable skills and I feel like I've wasted my time. Part of me regrets going to college altogether. Now that I'm done with school, I feel like there are a million different paths before me. Right now I'm thinking of joining the navy or get a job but unsure. ",
