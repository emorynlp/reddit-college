If you\u2019ve seen the dorm rooms or a dorm tour video, you can kind of pick and choose from this list depending on what\u2019s most important:\n\n- Area rug: covers up gross carpet or cold, hard linoleum and makes the room cozier\n- Lights: a lamp or some string lights make a room so much cozier than the dorm\u2019s fluorescent lights. A desk lamp will also be important!\n- Extra seating: storage ottoman, beanbag chair, anything to make a room more inviting for a few people to hang out in\n- Posters, pictures, anything to cover up a plain white cinderblock wall\n- Full length mirror (some dorms come with mirrors so make sure you need one before you buy it)\n\nHonestly I recommend buying the essentials (shower caddy, laundry bag, etc.) with your brother and then letting him and his roommate take a trip to Target or IKEA to get things like rugs, seating, and lights. It\u2019s a great way for him to get to know his roommate and they can both agree on how the room should look. Maybe give him a gift card to help him out.

I would double-check that it's allowed, but if it is, definitely get a humidifier. \n\nI also ended up getting a Brita filtered water container for my water in the mini-fridge when my building shut down all the water fountains for Covid reasons, it wouldn't hurt to have and it's especially nice to have your own water on hand in the middle of the night or when he's too lazy to trek out to the public drinking fountains.\n\nEDIT: Also, didn't see this, maybe get him multiples of his favorite shampoo/conditioners, and toothpaste for when he runs out. It's so nice to already have an extra of those items so you don't have to make a shopping trip for them. Plan on getting him a couple of extra toothbrushes as well, I ended up getting sick about halfway through the year and used my original toothbrush while sick. If he gets sick, which in a dorm is bound to happen, it's nice to have a fresh and unused toothbrush or toothbrush head to use so he isn't constantly using the one he was using while sick. All of these would be good in packs of 2, so 2 new shampoos, one to use at the start and one to use after that runs out, 2 new conditioners, and an extra toothpaste and toothbrush for when he runs out of the original toothpaste and for when he gets sick he can then just switch toothbrushes with no hassle.", "author": "cat4hurricane", "created": 1629072848, "upvotes": 1}, "h93g9oo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p4utg6/dorm_essentials_help_from_an_older_sister_filling/h93g9oo/", "text": "putting up posters about getting drunk or with half baked girls is a huge No now days. this puts everyone who walks in on douche alert. posters can be whatever he wants as long as they don't force people's mind into unwanted places.", "author": "solvent_causis04", "created": 1629072627, "upvotes": 3}, "h93fw8c": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p4utg6/dorm_essentials_help_from_an_older_sister_filling/h93fw8c/", "text": "Charging materials for personal devices.

A bed skirt to hid whatever he wants to shove under the bed (i used curtains with ties cause I couldn\u2019t find bed skirts long enough). A fan, especially if there\u2019s no AC. A sound machine for sleeping. A lamp, or some other source of light, an LED strip, or a little book light clip\u2026 bc often the only light in a dorm is awful fluorescent lights, and also if he has a roommate and wants to stay up studying in his dorm, those lights suck.. Maybe also some curtains, depending on what the school provides.

A DUSTPAN AND BROOM SET OMFG. maybe a mini vac instead, if the dorm is carpeted. One of those little plastic drawer sets (with like 3-4 drawers) that they sell at office supply stores is INCREDIBLE for keeping papers organized. Binders. Notebooks. A planner(!!!) Maybe even one of those white board planners you can put on the wall. Also, a little white board to put on the outside of the dorm door can be great for friends to leave messages n such.\n\n\nIf he wants to be studying in bed, a back pillow with those arm things, and a lap desk is great..
