It made my Ultra training class so much better this summer.\n\nOn the doing lectures front - I use Screencast-o-matic and usually have my face in the corner while I am showing them around in Blackboard or other items on the internet they need for the project I am having them do.  In BB Ultra you have to use Youtube for the video holder.  We have mandate to have closed captioning on our videos.  - So after you upload to youtube- come back about an hour later - depending on the length of your video - and you can edit the AUTOMATIC captions - instead of typing the whole thing out. \n\nDo not be afraid to leave in the \"ums\". I say \"so\" a LOT.  And re-record to make it more clear.  I have a degree in Television and have edited all my life and Screencast-o-matic has some very useful editing choices. Don't be afraid to click around.  I put on a new front and back of a video from spring lock down work to this summers hybrid class.\n\nWe are not allowed to use Zoom at our college - remember those porn bombers \\*yup they hit us.

Went from an A student to pity Cs because of online classes and have previously dropped online classes because they just did not work.  (So it's not just the pandemic that was a problem.)\n\nSome problems that I've run across either myself or have had friends encounter:\n\n* If you're doing synchronous classes, please for the love of all that is holy, don't penalize students for not attending.  My internet went down during classes and my professor told me to just use my phone without considering that I don't have unlimited data.  I had friends who had to try to do their classes in cars from restaurant parking lots in the middle of stay-at-home orders, it obviously didn't go well.  People are having to get jobs or may have gotten sent home to the four corners of the globe and have time zone issues, but there may not have been another alternative to synchronous classes.  \n* Put up any PowerPoint lectures ahead of time so that people who want to can print them out/put them up on a tablet/etc and scribble along with them as you go.  \n* Captions are fabulous for accessibility, plus if there's a transcript of them available, it helps students who have to miss classes or can't have audio on because of their living situation.\n* If you're assigning group projects, please don't force students to sit in a breakout room on Teams/Zoom/etc to work on them during class time.  Being forced to sit there hearing group members making noise and their background noise on TOP of our own background noises is absolute hell with attention deficit issues and turns into a prolonged period of getting nothing done except getting frustrated for the required period of time when we could normally take our bits and go at our own pace separately and be fine.  (This happened to me, it turned into getting nothing done and wanting to scream because I was required to be there twice a week for almost 2 hours each time.)  If students want to use that dedicated block, great, but don't make it mandatory.\n* For the love of god, don't use those awful proctoring websites.  They're such privacy violations and they can be sources of shame for students in less than optimal conditions or be outright problems that might force students to take zeros.  Some of the services require having a desk and a chair and being able to show the area around it on camera.  Some people don't have access to any kind of area in their home that fits the bill because of living situations and may have to do their work on beds/couches/floors.  Some also can't get quiet environments where nobody will walk in and start talking to them or they'll get interrupted.  Students may be embarrassed if they have to show a proctor their surroundings.  There's also that awful feeling of being watched the whole time.\n* If you can, please be on camera somehow.  Some students need to be able to read lips and/or see facial expressions to be able to understand and retain information and that's something that may have prompted the decision to take in-person classes even when online was an option before.\n* Be extremely clear on expectations, learning objectives, timelines, etc.  Some students aren't comfortable trying to stop you in the middle of an online class and ask questions like they might raise their hands in a classroom.\n* Don't require cameras to be on.  It's fine to encourage it so that you're not talking to a bunch of blank screens, but requiring it can lead to frustration and/or embarrassment and it's a privacy issue.

You can still make the tests difficult, but don\u2019t invade people\u2019s spaces, privacy, and slow down their computers. \n\n- The professor responds to emails within 24hrs and is clearly and throughly answering my questions. Especially when it comes to answering assignments.\n\n- Not an online only thing, but a class schedule detailing everything that\u2019s due/expected is nice for planners.\n\n- If you use a hw system, use a common one like Cengage that has a cheaper package for students instead of something like Connect that\u2019s $165 per class. Similarly, please make all assignments open at the start of the class instead of segmented by week.

It totally feels like a massive invasion of privacy in our homes and on our devices. Furthermore, it messes with our computer settings and configuration. I've dropped online classes specifically because the syllabus said ProctorU would be used. It's a no-go. Better option is to make the exams slightly stricter on time, or better yet, ask questions that aren't directly copied from the notes or slides but make the exam open-note. Make the questions more about understanding the material rather than memorizing specific details to the extent that you can. That's generally a good practice for in-person classes too, but it inhibits student's abilities to look up the answers as easily for online classes. Some of my professors have just made their exams slightly(not much) more difficult and open-book, and the score distribution remained about the same as it was for standard in-class closed note exams. If you absolutely must use some sort of software to keep students from using the internet, use Lockdown Browser if your school pays for it.

Knowing that is invaluable.\n\nIt will be invaluable to many people - for if they hate classes and would usually not choose them, chances are, they are not in their usual uni environment. They are probably very stressed from their circumstances, and may not have the support system that they usually have around them of people who actually understand their goals and want to help them succeed.\n\nOne thing: I actually disagree with a couple of people below in the discussion boards. Requiring a discussion board of something relevant to both a student and the class material is a fantastic way - for me at least - to feel connected to the class. My two favorite prompts thus far have come from two different classes:\n1. A Western European Politics class: research and give your opinion on either the effects of Brexit on the EU, of Basque devolution, or the effects of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, *En Marche!*, in France. I loved this because I actually have been doing daily research and have been very involved in one of the three, and it was such a joy to be able to speak about it in a context where it was appreciated. 450 word limit.\n\n2. The effects of culture in your personal growth essay from an artistic standpoint (for the class of Art in Globalistion). To do it well, honestly, and with a sense of professionalism and analysis was actually quite challenging - even to accelerated graduate students.  \n\nIt is kind of you to care so much about reaching out to your students - show them that, and you will reach the ones that are open to being helped now.

I\u2019ve learned a lot from the research I\u2019ve had to do for these. What I do mind is x number of responses to peers and word count for those responses. One of my last professors didn\u2019t require responses, but if we wrote good replies to peers those qualified us for extra credit points. That was a much better way of handling it since these discussions often are in lieu of the discussions that would occur during an in-seat program. \n\nSecond, do not assign busy work or assignments that require codes. In fact, the codes should be an absolute no-no when students pay money for the course. Likewise, avoid $800 textbooks or the requirement for the newest edition if there are several editions. \n\nThird, do not require group projects in an online  setting. Every single group project I have been a part of have been disastrous because of nonparticipating students. The project as a whole always suffers because the remaining students are required to assign and wait for nonparticipating students to contribute before completing those sections last minute. While I understand the reasoning behind group projects, they simply don\u2019t work in an online setting (especially in accelerated programs). \n\nLast, explain assignment requirements in detail (either in the syllabus or the assignment page) \nand be prompt with your responses regarding assignment questions (I always had a few for major papers that were not covered in the syllabus).

Viewing them ahead at least let\u2019s me plan my time accordingly.\n\n2. If you do discussion boards please have it remain professional and discuss topics from the textbook. If you want to know how students are doing put that in a seperate discussion board that is not graded. \n\n3. If possible record the meat of a lecture that can be followed by PowerPoint or YouTube. I take notes with my composition book and loathed live sessions because it was difficult to keep up (sound lagging, video distortion, asking to repeat). I preferred pausing the lecture as needed to write the notes down and our professor always highlighted pieces we needed to read or concepts we needed to have a good understanding of. \n\n4. Exams. If your course offers any math please get rid of the timer or extend the timer. We had to do advanced math in one class and **show our work** by typing it out. It was such a struggle to insert an equation and type out my explanation for 50 questions in 1 hour and 15 minutes. It\u2019s just not possible.

That being said, I avoid signing up for online classes with professors that do the following don\u2019ts:\n\nDON\u2019T require students to get their participate grade based off of them attending the zooms or online class. You can\u2019t really measure participation that way, which is why it\u2019s an online class. Students shouldn\u2019t be punished for completing their work on time, in their own time, by managing themselves. That being said, instead you can have assignments due weekly or at the end of the week, or some kind of deadline known ahead of time.\n\nDON\u2019T force your students to attend zoom classes as a requirement. It\u2019s similar to the first one, but different in that professors tell you you *must* attend the classes. Once again I feel like online classes give students an opportunity to manage their own time and do the work they\u2019re required to do in their own time, and that that\u2019s okay. Sometimes by forcing students to attend zoom classes they get more irritated with the workload and start slacking. I know I do lol. \n\nDON\u2019T assume the worst of your students just because it\u2019s an online class. I have a friend who because of covid-19 have a professor who accuses everyone in the class of cheating. As a result, she gave extra work such as essays or make assignments and tests so much harder and stressful than things already are. I feel like one of the best ways you can get your students to respect you, enjoy your class, and enjoy the material is to trust them. Students react different to classes based a lot on the way a professor handles things. I see that in my own classes too when it comes to the behaviors and attitudes that students have. \n\nDON\u2019T not check your emails or be irresponsive. It\u2019s an online class, things happen, and communication is key to making it work. That being said, having deadlines known ahead of him is important.

I first found Michelle Pacansky-Brock's work because [she has a free Kindle book](https://www.amazon.com/Humanize-Your-Online-Class-VoiceThread-ebook/dp/B00DTAKMTC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=michelle+pacansky+brock+voicethread&qid=1594386173&sr=8-1) on how to set up and use VoiceThread effectively.  The app is a game-changer. Every semester, my online students tell me how much they \\*enjoy\\* the discussions (!!!!). Last semester, when my face-to-face classes had to convert to online, they said similar things---especially that it was VT that kept them connected to the class.\n\nI also recommend using screencasting software, especially [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) (free with Google apps). I use my voice to speak my feedback to all my students, face-to-face or online. My online students tell me it's valuable and makes them \"know that I care.\" I've done some research and have a few publications supporting the use of screencast feedback, and it's easy to find in academic journals. Also, screencasting works in any discipline and at any level! I've done many, many workshops teaching professors how to use it, and you can simply use the tutorials with Screencastify (linked above) and be up and running in minutes. \n\nI hope what I've shared here can give you a few practical applications to try. I'm not affiliated with any of the products, etc., that I mention. Without question, I know my students benefit from everything I've promoted here. My reviews and personal anecdotes support that, as well as the many \"thank yous\" that I've received from colleagues over the years.", "author": "docktor_Vee", "created": 1594386585, "upvotes": 3}, "fxizf9e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hokanq/if_you_hate_online_classes_what_at_least_can_make/fxizf9e/", "text": "Like many other people have said, the busy work is extremely frustrating. It's frustrating that one of my professors added online modules through our textbook that add 8 hours of work per week once we went online. In person, the course only consisted of lectures and exams. So I definitely did not understand the reason to add more work when we weren't doing it in the first place. Don't add things just because we are online. The assignments/expectations of the in person course should be transformed into an online version.\n\nIf your class normally involves discussion, I personally would prefer discussion over zoom during class than typing discussion posts. But either are acceptable as long as the requirements of discussion posts are within reason. If the most someone would say in class is a paragraph or 2 worth of information, there is no reason to mandate 6 paragraphs for a discussion post.\n\nGroup work is already dreadful when classes are in person. Please don't assign group projects online.

Things that did NOT work so well, were, as a lot of people mentioned before, dicussion boards and non-live classes without proper interaction with the professor or the other students. Actual group work, like presentations or research projects are not very feasible as well, since it is awful to study with people online over a longer period of time. Weekly assignments are fine and might keep students engaged, as long as they are not too demanding, since this might end up in lack of quality. Additionally you should try to keep in touch with the students as much as possible. Maybe it might still be possible to have individual appointments via phone or at least answer your e-mails frequently.

Links to the recorded sessions, links to the homework, links to the quizzes, etc. Organized by week, updated regularly.

He does it only when discussion is needed. Instead, he makes his own lecture videos, posts them online, and keeps the online session to 15-30 min for updates, clarification, questions, etc. The lecture videos are full of notes and visual aids, emphasizing the important points, and move fast enough to be not boring - he makes them with the expectation that we will pause and rewind and watch the video more than once. Bonus that he uses youtube so we can watch the videos on 2x speed on the second or third rewatch. The software our school uses for online sessions doesn't have a setting that allows you to change the video speed.\n\nHad a professor last semester lecture fully online, monotone, didn't know how to use his software well, etc. It was very hard to focus in his class.
