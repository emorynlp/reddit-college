I feel so much shamed because i didnt do well this semester mental health just take a whole toll of me. So much craziness happenned, that i just gave up. I told her and explained her my situation. I\u2019m moving to another state but still willing to stay in school since were all online. She emailed me back with so much positive words and encouragement. And the last paragraph saying how she can help me in anyway of signing up to my classes. Gosh i was so scared to send my email last night and receiving a judgemental email back but i didnt get that, she gave me words that i needed. I think we all need proffessors like this. \n\nHope you are all well and staying strong x", "author": "omogal123", "created": 1608051980, "retrieved": 1632946833, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1939, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"ggme4py": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/ggme4py/", "text": "Happy for you and can only feel the joy and relief it caused for you!  \n\n\nWent through bad side of same thing. Was studying in France back in late 10s'. Was going through a lot of hardcore drama (like tv show level bad), it took way too much mental toll on me. Missed classes, turned in papers long overdue the deadline etc. I tried to talk to maybe 3 professors and dean at school. I was ridiculed and bullied and eventually they cancelled my degree because a very subjective grade (not depending on how you perform on subject, but rather how a school worker (not professor) grades you). He made a mistake also, my grade was short of 0.25 (out of 20), he said he'd correct it but then changed his mind :)", "author": "soulvandal9", "created": 1608583356, "upvotes": 1}, "gg0s08v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gg0s08v/", "text": "In our class chat group (which is where all the assignments are sent by the teachers)  a student wrote that she'll commit suicide to which our teacher replied that, \"Don't post unnecessary information in the group\".", "author": "3methylbutane", "created": 1608117094, "upvotes": 1}, "gfzt69n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gfzt69n/", "text": "One of my professors insulted us every class for 2-3 weeks after each exam(3) and if no one reads the paragraph for her, she insults us again.", "author": "TheOGGizmo", "created": 1608088589, "upvotes": 1}, "gfzsm1k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gfzsm1k/", "text": "We all have that one good prof that makes college worthwhile \ud83d\ude00", "author": null, "created": 1608088265, "upvotes": 1}, "gfzpq9w": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gfzpq9w/", "text": "Had me in the first half not gonna lie", "author": "Theman5560", "created": 1608086643, "upvotes": 4}, "gfzk0vd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gfzk0vd/", "text": "Most professors are really nice, considerate, and reasonable people. \n\nOther than my differential equations professor.", "author": "munraab13", "created": 1608083452, "upvotes": 4}, "gfz4mz5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kdpmsl/my_prof_made_me_cry/gfz4mz5/", "text": "meanwhile myy professor made me cry too...by telling me if I'm not doing well in his class then I should change major lmao I'm at my last semester of college bro \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIt was a math class for cs, but despite this, the man actually did his best to help me pass his class and helped me a lot!
