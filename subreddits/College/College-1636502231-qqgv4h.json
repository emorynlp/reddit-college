  "title:": "Cried in front a professor for 20 minutes should I buy them tea",
  "text": "I know they've seen it before but I was trying to ask questions through the tears but I didn't even understand what I was asking and I just felt so dumb, but they patiently answered my questions and said it was fine. \n\nI wanted to buy them tea and leave a note thanking them (I don't have the balls to talk to them so I'll leave it on their desk before class). Is that an appropriate thank you?? And what kind of tea should I get? I was going to get a dairy-free chai tea latte because I'm pretty sure everyone likes them\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your responses. I didn't consider no-gift policies so I'll just write them a thank you note",
