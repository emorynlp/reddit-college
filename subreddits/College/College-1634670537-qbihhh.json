  "text": "Alright, so there's this college that I'm thinking about going to but the area is pretty expensive to rent.\n\nA one way flight from Georgia to California costs about $40 and it would cost like $320 a month.\n\nWould it be a idea to fly to class every week or should I just rent?",

You couldn't have very good friends, study groups, dating, jobs etc. in either location. You couldn't qualify for in state tuition ever? Heck, flying that much over a 4-5 year period probably even raises your risk of cancer later in life as radiation builds up (an extreme and slightly comical example, but also a fact)? Depending on your living situation you'll probably have to eat out/pre-packaged food a lot which isn't as cheap as meal prepping? Where are you getting consistent $40 plane tickets GA to CA?\n\nHow much money are you really going to save in the long run, and how much quality of life are you going to sacrifice?",

You\u2019ll spend almost the whole weekend traveling. You\u2019ll also have to factor rides to and from the airport. Taxi? Uber?\n\nAnd where will you live for the week you\u2019re there?",
