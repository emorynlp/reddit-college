  "text": "\nHow would you compare the two? Job opportunities, workload, internships, ect. \n\nI was deciding between the two but I am now leaning towards marketing because I hear psychology degrees to employers go right into the \u201cround bin\u201d. I also like doing things involving creativity and also learning about the way humans just are. Career wise, i just want to make decent money and not hate my life lol",

      "text": "Marketing is the more in-demand degree of the two, but you'll want to pursue internships and do some networking while you're in college in order to have good job prospects as a graduating senior. Keep in mind that a marketing degree should make you qualified for business administration/ business management type jobs as well as roles in marketing and sales.",

      "text": "They both will require you to put in a lot of work. Business & Marketing are great degrees but it\u2019s a highly concentrated field. You need to have an impressive resume bc if you don\u2019t want to take the lowball salary job someone else will. With psychology you need a masters, double bachelor degree or PHD in order to actually work within the field of psychology. If you did end up going to graduate school for psych you will end up making more money, $100-$400/hr.",
