  "title:": "Am I thinking irrationally about my education?",
  "text": "I have been in A Levels since the beginning of september doing Maths Physics and Music Tech and currently doing well in music and somewhat in maths, however I could definitely improve physics. However Im not sure if i even want to continue studying a maths and physics course. I have no interest nor do I have a desired career that involves them so am I wasting my time going to the lessons? I csnnot get myself to study properly for them and I dont even enjoy them on an academic level. I got As for my GCSE in maths and physics so I dont think Im exceptionally dumb, I just think I should cut my losses and continue just the music course, as that is more towards my passion. I dont have student loans so thats not a problem, and the teachers arent bad, i just dont think Im a maths and physics guy really. Any guidelines or advice? (I am also going to consult parents ans tutor).",
