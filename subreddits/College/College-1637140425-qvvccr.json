  "title:": "Will bad grades in 'rubbish' courses hurt my chances of getting into grad school? (First year undergraduate)",
  "text": "Hello, I am a first year undergraduate that wants to eventually go on to do further studies.\n\nMy studies are generally going well in the relevant courses, however at my university we are forced to take a lot of irrelevant courses I consider to be 'rubbish' to give us a broader education, and these courses will be calculated into my GPA. These courses are generally taken in the first and 2nd year.\n\nFor grad school admissions, does it matter if I do badly in these courses? (e.g. getting Cs) if I do well on the relevant ones? I consider these to be sort of a waste of time.\n\nFor more details, the way it works at my university is every student has to take \"common core\" courses about social and cultural topics (For example, \"The history and culture of mathematics\" or \"Sexuality and Gender in Society\"). I am a student that wants to double major in Maths and Computer Science and go on to do further studies in either ai, big data or theoretical computer science, so I don't consider these particularly relevant to me.\n\nAdditionally, engineering students like me need to general engineering courses in first year before then can choose a major to specialize in the 2nd year. As a result, I need to take basic courses from many engineering disciplines such as Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Civil engineering. While some of these are academic (Such as learning about basics of communications theory and electromagnetics in electrical engineering), others are not, like how in Industrial Engineering we are assessed 100% on a project groupwork \"pretend engineering project\" and need to make a business plan to convince the professors we have a good product.\n\nIf I do badly in these courses, would it jeopardize my chances of grad school, since it hurts my GPA? (15-20% of my courses are these sort of 'rubbish courses')",

      "text": "In my experience, your second, third and fourth year courses are the most important for grad school admission, however don\u2019t flunk first year classes simply for that reason. But if you\u2019re burning out or struggling, focus on your cores because it\u2019s less of a big deal if you don\u2019t do as well in your options, and not a big deal overall if you tank your first year (you\u2019ll just be like me and have to work extra hard to pull your gpa back from a lower number in your later years) the only thing I can see it impacting is your overall gpa, and if the course is a prerequisite for another important course. But overall, don\u2019t stress if you\u2019re struggling in first year, I don\u2019t know anyone who peaked in first year lol it almost always gets better and profs/administrators are well aware of this",

          "text": "Thanks for the answer, that definitely helps my understanding of grad school admissions.\n\nId like to clarify that I'm not really struggling with the first year courses, but because I intend to double major the workload in my 2nd to 4th year is going to be huge, so I would rather self study and read ahead to prepare instead of trying to get strong grades of less-relevant first year courses, but I'm not sure how good of an idea this is.",

              "text": "No problem! Definitely leave the post to get other people\u2019s input though. \n\nI think that honestly sounds like a lot, but so does the entire engineering program haha. So if you have a good work ethic and are able to self study in preparation for future courses while slightly slacking in first year courses, I think it\u2019s a great idea to help yourself get ahead so you are able to double major. Like you mentioned though, the only drawback is that those low first year grades may decrease your gpa, and going into intense engineering courses, many people would take those as \u2018easy\u2019 boosters, where you would be using core courses to increase your gpa, which is traditionally more challenging.",

      "text": "It's tricky to say. If they only look at your overall GPA then provided it is \"good enough\" then it may not matter. But if they do look at all your courses then it may matter. Maybe they will interpret your selective efforts by disregarding some modules as a sign that that you can't or won't do work that you don't want to do. And considering that not all of grad school is work you do want to do, they may dismiss your application on that alone.\n\nAs for the more, how should I put it, \"politically charged\" modules like \"sexuality and gender\", then they may hold it firmly against you if they themselves are very much in favour of that topic whereas you manifestly don't care about it. Or maybe the opposite will happen: they don't see it as an important topic and will happily overlook your shared disinterest in it.\n\nHonestly, I'd just play it safe and aim to get the highest grade possible in all of them, even if you do think certain courses are rubbish. Besides, no information is useless information. Even if you disagree with certain information, remember that other people do agree with it, so knowing what they know can help you interact with them (maybe if you want to win an argument, or maybe if you want to make a friend).\n\nBut regarding \"The history and culture of mathematics\", I don't know exactly what this course will involve, but from the name alone it may be more helpful than you think. I myself have a PhD in machine learning (and undergrad in computer science) and the further into my education I got I began to appreciate that to look at the history of computers and maths (and machine learning involves *a lot* of maths) could help my understanding of the contemporary information on the subject. For example, going back to 1943 to learn about the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, the very first artificial neuron, gave me a much deeper understanding of the modern day artificial neuron (the elemental build blocks of neural networks), since it is heavily based on the McCulloch-Pitts one. Looking at the history of a topic and seeing why the topic came to exist and how it evolved can potentially help your understanding of computers and machine learning etc. today.",

          "text": "It is definitely true that I am *very* selective in where I put my efforts, and only commit resources (time) when I think they will help me attain certain goals, and I don't know how this will be interpreted.\n\nI have looked at messages from CS professors expectations for what they expect of students to do research, and an overarching theme is they expect the student to be \"strong at mathematics\", so I want to beef up on mathematics as much as possible, to the expense of these courses.\n\nAbout \"the history and culture of mathematics\" and \"sexuality and gender\", I was using them as an example of what \"common core\" courses we can *choose* (these are not free electives though, and we must take a fixed number of common core modules).\n\nThey are less technical studies since they are designed for students from all disciplines of studies. I don't know which of these I will end up taking because the ones with high grades and low workloads are always overbooked.  It depends on luck what I end up getting, so I just gave examples of choices.\n\nI really appreciate the perspective, especially coming from a PhD in the discipline I am most interested in.",
