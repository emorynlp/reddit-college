  "text": "TL,DR: Skip to last paragraph.\n\n I bombed my first calc exam and let the nerves get to me for the second; I now have an F in calc. My parents were paying for my full ride to college; I chose to keep this from them, take Calc next semester, and either find scholarships or take out a loan for the now needed summer classes. They just found out I lied about it and told me if I don't find a way to pass Calc that im essentially done and they won't pay for any more of my school.\n\n(To be clear, I'm well aware that what I did was fucked up, I'm just not dwelling on the drama because it's not the point of the post.)\n\nI love engineering, and unless I can luck out on something crazy like being a youtuber, I know that it's what I want to do. So, in the very real possibility that I fail calc, I need to take out student loans. I know it's a horrible financial decision to do so, but if I want to do what I'm passionate about then I have to make that decision.\n\nSo, I need to take out loans for college and they need to be full-ride. I'll need to have my room and board + meal plan/money for food paid for along with tuition, and I need to be able to not pay any of it back until after college when I start working. I know the sub isn't meant for financial advice, but I'm just looking to know where to start from you guys that have the experience. Where to start looking for loans, big things to avoid, etc are greatly appreciated.",
