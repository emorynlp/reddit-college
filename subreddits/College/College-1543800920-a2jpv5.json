  "text": "Title says the point.\n\nSemester is ending and you're about to move on and forget your current professors.  Somebody else still needs to take the course you you just finished.  Pass on what you learned.  \n\nUse your school's feedback surveys (most schools push them or even require them). Use RateMyProfessor.  Just share your experience.  Did the professor torture you by treating their 3 credit humanities course like it was a 6 credit monster worth 30 hours per week?  Was you Bio professor awesome and deserves recognition?  \n\n\nThis matters.  When I go to register for classes, I check my professors ratings.  If there are 3 or less ratings, then it's useless to me.  I would rather take a 3.9 professor with 40 reviews than a 5.0 with 1 review.  You should all be checking these and leaving feedback afterwards. If you aren't reading any sort of reviews prior to registering, it's kinda your own fault when you are stuck with the most difficult professor on campus. \n\nThere.  Said my peace.  Do whatever you want.  We're all adults. Most of us at least.  ",

Your course reviews help determine what is good/bad with the class.\n\nLet's say 3 teachers teacher Calc 1. They each have 100 students.  End of semester rolls around and they each have vastly different distributions of grades. That's something the department needs to address.  Student feedback helps here.  If 50 of the 100 complete feedbacks and over half of them say the same thing, then it probably isn't just some salty 20 year old.  \n\nSame goes for online reviews at ratemyprofessor. If 30 people submit reviews, and 20 of the reviews say the professor is always late, then I wouldnt be surprised if the professor is always late.\n\nIt's exactly the same as reading review when you are shopping.\n\n",

And, you can decide for yourself what is and isn't important that others took issue with. \n\n\nI.e. if everyone complains a professor assigns too much reading/doesn't teach, you can assume that it's a big workload but you have a high level of control over your own grade, because they're likely lazy and give you carbon-copy exams of formulaic questions that reading will have prepared you for. \n",

Unless the comments go into a lot of details, they seem to be worthless. \"I don't understand their accent!!!\" with a horrible rating for so many professors who I thought didn't even have an accent at all. And then there's the \"she's disorganized\" comments that seem to be on every female teacher I get. The worst one I saw was a paragraph of \"I was *enamored* with ____ I looked forward to her class and was early every day,\" and \"She's *charming, smart, beautiful* and the class made my heart race, etc \" like yikes, teacher, do the police know about this kid?\n\nMy mom teaches at my uni and for a while she was my ride so I had to sit in her class a lot. She was the only prof I've seen that was always early. Sure enough, two ratemyprofessor comments had something like \"SHE'S ALWAYS LATE!!!\" I have no idea what would make a student so mad think that lying is better than even being honest about what they thought was a problem\n\nThen there's evaluations. I always feel one way or the other of two extremities: either it doesn't mean shit or it will potentially ruin someone's career. Look, I did my fair share of joking around. On an old professor's eval I left a numbered list of suggestions to make the class completely focused on volcanoes as a joke(and yes, it was obviously a joke). Then I met my bf, who's with a phd and now is at that horrible period afterwards where no one's hiring you. I didn't know before I met him that for a lot of places evaluations aren't an optional way to show off. Even if I really dislike a teacher, I will now never use an eval to potentially harm their career. The fact that a person's career could be hurt because of input from someone no one but the teacher knows, all without the teacher's ability to provide their own argument, is bullshit. It's a failure of academia and another reason why it's just becoming a large joke.\n\nSo, teachers, either sell out or get out.",

So if some students believe that giving all a's is more important than being challenged then ratemyprofessor is great\u2014and that's not wrong in a society where degrees are pretty much mandatory for doing anything. But it sucks because that philosophy can't really coexist with one that desires academic integrity in itself. I've had teachers give two evals: one for the department and one just for them(both anonymous). I think that's probably a way to go, despite the fact that it's basically an admission of how useless everyone thinks evals are.\n\nTl;dr ratemyprofessor is fine given what uni is now but it's not reasonable to try and make such a platform meaningful",

There's absolutely no point saying the class is too hard or too easy because I don't know what that means. We need to know precisely what you want improved, and precisely how you want us to do that. And even then, if the class is split 50/50 on the issue then we can't change anything. \n\nIt's easy to believe that your personal opinion of the class is shared by everyone else, but that's rarely the case. In most cases, your classmates believe the exact opposite about the class. \n\nEdit: also, the best professor I ever had in undergrad had one of the lowest ratings on RMP (I think it was 1) and some horrible comments. Yet he has a lot of good awards for teaching, has an office that's decorated with letters from grateful students, is fondly remembered by a lot of people, and was just a plain good professor. But his class was notoriously difficult, and a lot of people would fail because they underestimated how much work they had to do.

Even if you don't care about learning and just want to get your degree with a high GPA and with minimal effort, evals are still misleading.\n\nI know some profs who cannot care less about their students yet have very good evals. Most of them cheat for getting those good reviews.",

If people complain about big exams being important, it worries me more. ",
