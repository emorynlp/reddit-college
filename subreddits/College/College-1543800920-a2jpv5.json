Somebody else still needs to take the course you you just finished.  Pass on what you learned.  \n\nUse your school's feedback surveys (most schools push them or even require them). Use RateMyProfessor.  Just share your experience.  Did the professor torture you by treating their 3 credit humanities course like it was a 6 credit monster worth 30 hours per week?  Was you Bio professor awesome and deserves recognition?  \n\n\nThis matters.  When I go to register for classes, I check my professors ratings.  If there are 3 or less ratings, then it's useless to me.  I would rather take a 3.9 professor with 40 reviews than a 5.0 with 1 review.  You should all be checking these and leaving feedback afterwards. If you aren't reading any sort of reviews prior to registering, it's kinda your own fault when you are stuck with the most difficult professor on campus. \n\nThere.  Said my peace.

Unless the comments go into a lot of details, they seem to be worthless. \"I don't understand their accent!!!\" with a horrible rating for so many professors who I thought didn't even have an accent at all. And then there's the \"she's disorganized\" comments that seem to be on every female teacher I get. The worst one I saw was a paragraph of \"I was *enamored* with ____ I looked forward to her class and was early every day,\" and \"She's *charming, smart, beautiful* and the class made my heart race, etc \" like yikes, teacher, do the police know about this kid?\n\nMy mom teaches at my uni and for a while she was my ride so I had to sit in her class a lot. She was the only prof I've seen that was always early. Sure enough, two ratemyprofessor comments had something like \"SHE'S ALWAYS LATE!!!\" I have no idea what would make a student so mad think that lying is better than even being honest about what they thought was a problem\n\nThen there's evaluations. I always feel one way or the other of two extremities: either it doesn't mean shit or it will potentially ruin someone's career. Look, I did my fair share of joking around. On an old professor's eval I left a numbered list of suggestions to make the class completely focused on volcanoes as a joke(and yes, it was obviously a joke). Then I met my bf, who's with a phd and now is at that horrible period afterwards where no one's hiring you. I didn't know before I met him that for a lot of places evaluations aren't an optional way to show off. Even if I really dislike a teacher, I will now never use an eval to potentially harm their career. The fact that a person's career could be hurt because of input from someone no one but the teacher knows, all without the teacher's ability to provide their own argument, is bullshit.
