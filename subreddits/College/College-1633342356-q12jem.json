  "text": "for context, I'm a low-income college sophomore, with no experience in film, my dad isn't super supportive of art degrees, but he is of photography (??)\n\nanyways, recently, I have been applying for schools bc I am just not happy at my current uni, originally b4 college I wanted to pursue psych and be a psychiatrist but I switched to nutrition to pursue optometry school. I like stem subjects but I'm not that good at math nor have I rlly had a passion for it. I've always been more oriented towards art and stuff but didn't pursue it bc I was thinking realistically and was scared that I would be wasting my time especially bc I'm low income. \n\nI really enjoy optometry so far, I've worked in an environment and so far it seems like something I'd love to do. Only thing that makes me annoyed is the idea of physics and calc lol. I've always liked films and always had ideas in my head about directing movies, I usually just make small videos of my friends and i take pictures i enjoy but other than that I never ventured far into it bc i didn't see a reason to. Lately i've been studying films and finding myself taking apart every scene in movies etc and getting back into photography. this has been going on for the past few months, and it has made me wonder if I should pursue it. \n\nI've been looking into film schools, since I'm already trying to transfer out. ofc I'm gonna try and make some films myself with the help of my friends and stuff to see if its something I can handle. I know film isn't easy and its prob expensive but i was wondering if there were others who have had a similar experience and what you guys did or if anyone has advice. \n\nit would be cool to have some opinions from film students too :)",
